interesting article this week in the federalist federalist dot com the federalist dot com if you want to look up the article the article says the research proves the number one social justice imperative is\nMarriage\nI don't have time to go through the whole article but this is just really intriguing research says just Seventy years ago social mobility and protection from poverty\nWere largely a factor of employment those who had fulltime work of any kind were sold them poor fifty years ago education marked the Gulf separating the haves and the have nots\nFor the last Twenty years or more though marital status has increasingly become the central factor in whether our neighbors and their children rise above remain or descend into poverty the research is astounding\nIn Nineteen sixty the poorly and moderately educated we're only ten percent less likely to be married then the college educated with both numbers quite high eighty four Ninety four percent respectively that parity largely held until the late Nineteen seventies\nOr either the sexual revolution by the way\nProfessor Bill Galston president of Clinton's a President Clinton's domestic policy adviser and now he's senior fellow at Brookings explain that in the early Nineteen nineties that an American need only to do three things to avoid living in poverty graduate from high school\nCleveland, Ohio I tore [noise]\nHi Dave how are you doing better than I deserve what's up in your world [noise]\nWell I'm I'm preparing for separation\nAnd I'm I'm not quite sure what to do with my dad a specific lane my student loan debt\nOkay a separation from your husband John Harris\nYeah sorry about yes my husband\nOkay and I'm\nSo you're preparing for separation how long have you been married\nOh about twenty two years\nOh my goodness it must be I have\nIt it just that we are a chip not on the same page anymore um and ah what other things but ah with money as well and it's just\nUm it's just a thing I just I just don't want to go on with\nMhm have you been seeing emerge comes from\nA that something he's not willing to do\nHave you gone no okay please do that for you\nEven if he won't go oh okay I think it will give you good I'm emotional information twenty two years is a long time and you need to have somebody walk with you who's not in the fog if you go through this\nAnd or give you some in maybe maybe give you some information to give him a little bit of a wake up call as well but back to your original question\nI have a friend of mine that teachers divorce recovery recovery after a divorce and um I remember many years ago hearing her say divorced turns a marriage into a business transaction\nAnd so it it comes it's a real quickly the emotions are carved often shut over to one side and the actual technical legal financial details are on the other side\nAnd it becomes a very transactional kind of thing at that point does that make sense\nYes it does and so a here here's a couple of things to look at your student loans or your student loans they're going to go with you unless you know you may or may not get alimony child support or somebody else but your student loans are going to go with you um and you're gonna have to pay them so what is your personal income\nUh uh it without saying\nOkay right and so what you start doing is if this was a a direction that you you know after ...\nOh it it took out okay\nAll right and so what you start doing is if this is a a direction that you you know after seeing a counselor and doing everything you can to save a twenty two year investment uh and with all the help you can get a you start preparing for living on your own for fifty thousand bucks a year\nAnd you'd you'd look at your student loans how much their mom and dad have you got\nA better Kim I'm Sorry it out and oh my lord okay\nWell how would let them know that this was going on hardship to furrow until you\nGet past ah what else whatever else is going on here okay now do you own a home\nYeah what's it worth a try it out what's out on it a hydrated February ...\nOkay so no equity there to amount to anything right is your car paid for yeah as his car by for no okay is your name on that loan yeah good okay are there any credit cards that have both of your names on them\nAnd there is the one that I shoot him I'm Sorry\nOh you refuse to let him yet oh better than that close that account today\nJust completely closed the credit card\nIf he has the number he can use it if he's one of the users on the car [laughter] here yet and if things go sideways emotionally inside your house I have run into situations in Thirty years of doing this where somebody takes in Mexico drip and puts it on the guard\nAnd you don't want to pay for five thousand dollar cruise for somebody else you know and it'll end up on this card so close the account today just completely shut it down to zero balance\nYeah good close okay do does your checking account have both names on it yeah okay so your money separated by march is there any other debt or dead instrument that's open that as both of your names on it\nYeah yeah okay I don't accept your mortgage probably as both are names on okay so here's what happens you can't afford to keep the south you can't stay there\nYeah um so the house that needs to either be refinanced to get your name off of the mortgage or sold\nYou cannot stay on the mortgage and give him the house that would be dumb\nAnd people often do that in a divorce they often do that\nBut just you know the negotiation is the cars in his name he keeps his car your cars and your name you keep your car your checking account or already separated there's no other debt you get your student loan debt I'm it does he have any big savings or investments or to you and for one case\n[noise] I'm not big now how much am I Am I Am a ten thousand mhm four one K. and I'm not sure what he has um but I'm thinking about five or six thousand not much at all okay as far as what it says income\n[noise] ah it's around Ninety thousand okay\nIn most states your attorney would have to advise you but in most states you would be do some alimony after twenty two years\nAnd that will going with your fifty thousand is how you will reset your life and stay out of debt and start working your way through these student loans that are outrageous and we're going to take some time to work through\n'em but you're going to be working extra job you're going to be doing everything else taking any any money you can squeeze out of your budget and you are not going to Mexico you got a mess on your hand shit\nOkay no I'm not\nSo um unless it's to escape no just kidding [laughter] ah but the ... so you know you're going to be on beans and rice rice and beans are going to get the cheapest department you can get you going to stay debt free and address these student loans as soon as you can get stabilize\n... after the separation which will lead to a divorce unless it leads to you all getting back together\nOkay but you pro care for separation the same way financially you would prepare for a divorce and that puts you in a position of strength\nTo negotiate in the divorce financially I'm ... and that's something that you'll have to do and your attorney and you get representation and you'd be ready to pay them pile up money for deposits and for paying them don't pay extra on the student loans until you get the other side of this and I just put 'em on ... and pay nothing right now\nBut let's get the other side has but but my hope is is that you guys you can see a counselor who can give you some words to say some tools to get by by wakeup call maybe the two of you sit down with a coach or counselor and walk you through turning the corner on all of this before you get so far around the corner we can't get you back\nAnd may be you can save this thing I that would be best for everybody involved I'm\nAssuming the issues that you have that are causing you such concerns are addressed and I'm sure that I'm sounded like a pretty long list but I'm just an address some ... see a counselor for your sake call your pastor say who cannot sit down with a can walk me through\nUm\nThe right questions to ask myself the right questions to ask him um because he may think you're kidding oh he may think you're bluffing and when you actually move out it may it may wake him up and he may be willing to work on that list at that point I don't know\nBut those kinds of things are best guided by a really good marriage counselor that's really experienced in wise and\nA godly council a will help you in that situation and I sure hope you guys can turn that around that would be my hope for you\nIt'd be better for all of you ah financially as well as everything else so good question thank you for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five you jump and we'll talk about your life and your money\nInteresting data that just came out on the article I read on the air about marriage and um [noise]\nThe men who are married and make more on average about Fifteen Percent on the men who aren't married women make

everywhere I mean there's not a big thing it's not like at your wedding ring or something it was a an anniversary gift that you all couldn't afford\nOne way and he I mean sweet but dumb or who you know right yeah I think\nSo but I think the thing is here yeah I'm probably taking it back but more importantly I Want to take his brain and screw it back and a little bit better you know in the two year old is are we really doing this or not because otherwise you're you're never going to get there\nBecause apparently he's not on the same page or on that's big thing I mean Ninety percent of this question is around that ten percent on one of the keeps the ring or not\nSane and so this ring is not gonna make or break you get out of debt plan\nOne way or the other but this behavior will\nAnd this lack of being on the same page will so\nYou know what let's just talk us through and and make sure we're on the same page and then you guys decide together what to do with the ringing I don't know I I\nIt just represents dumb and so I'm not ever going to really be able to enjoy is\nIf I'm you are because it's just in violation of where are you thought your whole family was heading and it's

doing if you think we are we ended up going out to get out of debt I'm from New York teaching\nA my father died about five years ago on a motorcycle act and and um there were a bunch of life insurance policies that went through our personal financial adviser has been advising my mother ever spent Ben I'm and the question that I have and he put her in any new lady about um\nFive years ago whenever my dad died a three hundred thousand dollars in the annuity um and then the other end up on Peter concocted and they've been growing a little bit here and there um but the question is the annuity recently we've got the five year mark and advising to pull the money I started ...\nWhich I think is a good idea however the question is is that\nShe should have should have had that money back at ... at the beginning of the time you know it's been a pretty putting in ... she brings home about thirty five hundred dollars a month and retirement and Social Security but she doesn't need the drawing the unity at all you know and he knew that the beginning of the time\nYou know well yeah you're right I that makes me question other things that are going on that I don't know what they are from you\nI'm but I I Am I and I am I personally would\nHave put all of it and the good investments at the time um you know it is the home paid off\nAlmost paid off one hundred percent car the paid off she has the wrote that the euro\nGood good okay and how much is in investments total this three hundred plus\nI'm yeah we're looking at probably about four hundred and twenty four hundred and fifty thousand a total with all the embarrassment to the house another fifty to sixty yeah onto the honor their\nHow old is she ah she thinks she just turned sixty okay All right cool\nAnd she didn't great out because you know like on an old ... year old ... on our way out\nI think right out good I'm feeling better fifty seven to hear you say that so um [laughter] uh I'm not on my way out today either a anyway good or at least the mob to my knowledge anyway so yeah I I'm probably going to question all of that I mean it's um\nIt's not it's not like you put her in a whole life policy which would be like a deal breaker or something silly like that I mean it just the annuity is is you know got a lot more fees to it a lot more commission to it and if it was a variable annuity and the money was in good mutual funds are probably performed okay\nAre there okay um but it's not my favorite thing to do but it's not to the point that I like question his entire competency I just really want to know if it wasn't right for her ... if it's not right for her now why wasn't right for her then that's a good question in your mind Mr advisor\nAnd um I think you've got the right to ask that question and talk it through with them and if you can't get a comfort level or if he goes up on you and starts having an attitude and that's when you know it's time to move to anyway\nSo you do that with any financial people or people that are advising you on technical matters\nWhen they start getting like ... like you have to owe them an explanation instead of us versus them move on\nInsurance lady gets
