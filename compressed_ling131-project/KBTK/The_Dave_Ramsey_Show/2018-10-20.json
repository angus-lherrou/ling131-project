proprietorship you're probably not even gonna make any money you make a little bit it'll be fine pay some taxes on it and if you want to fund a Roth IRA for her or something the point here in this situation is when you have a kid running a business to the point is not the business\nThe point is what the kid is learning\nThey're learning work they're learning interface with customers and how to treat people or they're learning that they have to deliver on time they have to deliver quality they're learning how to put prices on something or they're learning that it's a good thing to make a profit the capitalism is not evil ... these are the lessons are what is important\n\nTo understand the accurate or if she make some money that's just a bonus\nRight but what yeah what are you what you've identified as you've identified the way this kid is wired\nAnd a lot of us that are entrepreneurial are are a lot or at least a little bit ADD [laughter] right right I mean how much you know pass anything the shiny I run towards it you know say I'm sure you know but I ... if you start maybe if it starts in like a hundred\nAre getting ready to have a kid go off to college just because you shop [noise]\nAnd understand\nWhat college costs because\nIt is one of the most bizarre things to learn the\nDistance between the less expensive schools and the most expensive she goes I mean we're talking eight thousand eighty thousand a year\nSpread I mean it's it's even cheaper probably than that but it's amazing and people just assume all of college is the same cost it's just not and it's the number one mistake people make when they don't have a lot of money and the kid is going off to school it draws people in the student loan debt 'cause they simply go to school they can afford\n\nAnd as you know we have a student loan crisis with a half a trillion dollars\nIn student loan debt we have an entire department within our company called Ramsey education that puts a curriculum and the high schools and colleges across America we're now in forty percent of the high schools teaching high schoolers this common sense stuff\nOf staying out of debt and being on a budget and learning to save money and all of that kind of thing\nAnd what happens from time to time is the schools can't afford the basic resources and so someone will come along side and the community of business or an entity of some\nKind and we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations in personal finance curriculum from the Ramsey organization and so we've got about four million students go through one of the coolest things that's happened lately is the University of Wyoming\nHas decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it in paying for it\nDang dang touchdown baby that's how that happens\nThe college university says we're going to take care of these high schoolers\nIn our state and make sure they learn about money and of course University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the Wyoming area to go to college so this all works out really really good not Tyler Moore is with me on the line and\nKyle is from the University of Wyoming he's the associate vice provost of enrollment Kyle why or to go man thank you for doing that\nWell it's a pleasure to visit with you and thanks for that we are certainly Saturday here in the state of Wyoming to be able to partner with a Ramsey education and provide some practical applicable\nThings for students to be able to apply that college search and and and be a real fatty consumer higher education\nYeah because you guys do have low tuition I mean you're you're you're you're the best deal round I wasn't getting right\nYes there we are we have the lowest resident tuition any public institution that grant doctoral degrees anywhere in the United states\nOf all fifty states of all the ... so like your cheaper than my University of Tennessee or your cheaper than the University of dot dot dot that's correct\nWow very cool very cool and I got to tell you when I heard what your whole promotion was behind this I immediately wanted to steal it and bring it\nAnd use it somewhere in like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you where am I doing a few minutes but I Will get them to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this\nLee wanted to steal it and bring it and use it somewhere in like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you where am I doing a few minutes but I Will get them to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nSo that our our our campaign is called the world needs more cowboys we're we're not talking about guys and cowboy hats that ride off into the sunset but we're talking about a state with a long heritage and a university mascot and a cowboy that can be\nAnyone from any gender any background but we're talking about that in her spare we're talking about curiosity and independence boldness\nAt pursuit adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and books for opportunities to make differences in the world we are talking about trailblazers and people exemplify the spirit of the underdog you know\nIt's not a cowboy isn't what you are but it's who you are\nYeah well and you guys are the cowboys I mean so it's a play on words obviously a miniature mascot right that looked at your football team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my university\nOf Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right and so as good I play on words but you you guys got though that you got to the table first with this way to go man I Love it\nIt's a great motto or does it says so much in unjust are so few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and you got sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is it going to have\nAs of coming up soon the the high school curriculum because the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool Kyle thank you man\nWe're happy to be happy to be a partner we uh we are we are state that is very practical where states is very much um applicable in terms of being smart with our money and we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out our opportunities to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment in your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation and the state of Wyoming through the ranks the education product\nWell it's one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're\nYou know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this ... going in there we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that I'm In the winter is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they ought to go to college\nTo sometimes people do silly things like wander across the state line\nI've talked to a lot of ... around the country I'm my own chancellor and vice chancellor of the ... of Tennessee and it's a constant thing the ... the state is trying to woo their own residents to their own university and it's become a thing you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nYes sir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even out of state but you have to be\nSmart and you have to do your due diligence in that process of searching for higher education in addition to being the lowest cost per resident tuition Doctorow ranting institution\nWe are near the very lowest for non residents to come to Wyoming so we have a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming but from coast to coast north and south we can be a solution that provide students and incredible opportunity for education\nAnd we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are helping\nA student be successful not just students success and\nPart of that is not racking up a lot of debt at the end of their degree completion I meant so how many students on your campus\nWe have we have a little over a twelve thousand so twelve thousand a little over four hundred students here that are called himself cowboys\nYou know that's a good size school that's not too big and not too small that's a that's a that's just right those are Goldilocks or they'll just right very\nCool very cool ... it's an honor to talk to you again rather thank you for coming on with us\nThank you very much a best wishes to you and your team there in uh in Tennessee and we appreciate the opportunity to say the world needs more cowboys\nI Love it I Love the motto and I think the world doesn't even more cowboys in so many ways [laughter] good stuff I got a little picture John Wayne going in my head I can't help but it's just the way it is but\nA bottom line is lesser mascot and so now that's a that's very cool stuff I Love it and what a neat thing that the College of the University of the state is buying it for every single high school\nNow if you're a business or a university and you'd like to do something like that maybe you don't have to maybe don't have the money to buy the whole state or something every high school in the states\nSome states have more high schools and others can you imagine you know but uh um\nYou know maybe you just want to do it to the hospital used to go to um I went over smoked at them in the building where I used to go to high school the other day and snow middle school so I had all the forty really bright and\nShiny little eighth graders looking at me that's the hardest speaking you'll ever have I'll just tell you\nUm but

I were to return Elise car\nTo the dealership or at this point do just keep the vehicle or none of the above\nWe take her car back that you own money on or signed a lease on that's effectively a voluntary repossession and that that would be dumb because they're going to sell the car after they've repossessed it and are there and on a repossession watch and then they're going to sue you for the difference\nIf you don't pay them the difference of media\nAnd you don't have the different schools you're broke I don't know that would be a dumb idea we're not going to do that um what we are going to do is find out two pieces of information one is called the car fleece company that you are paying the ... to ...\nAnd find out what the early buyout on the car is\nNow the early buyout is different than the total of your lease payments pleasure residual value at the end it should be less because you're these leases are very new and there should be it's kind of like an early pay off I'm Alone it doesn't include all the interest from\nThe time that you know from keeping alone the whole time\nSo the early buyout as your hourly pay off now now that well that's what strikes by the car off and get the title in your hand then you compare that to\nKB dot com Kelley Blue book dot com private sales what the car is actually worse\nAnd I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout is twenty thousand and then you look it up in the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would leave you four thousand dollars in the whole probably not far off of what you're going to find\n... four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car for sixteen you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer\nAnd so um you have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to cover the whole the journey and the amount that you are upside down in the way you would do that is obviously alone and so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank\nAnd you get a loan lined up for the amount that you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car\nFor as much as you can possibly get for which is more than they will show at four in the report lot so he's bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the difference is greater than you do more damage to your life and lose more control of your life by doing a repossession and so\nYou cover the difference cover the amount that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather you'll be four thousand dollars in debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are\nSo um they ribs utility to borrow money no diver and she's telling you to move

release a outta Marilyn\nMarilyn police district heights Maryland\nTo Maryland police officers were shot\nWhile serving a drug related search warrant\nHalf the wrong apartment\nShort version of this is the police to get a tip from an informant where we have heard this time and time again Scott stuff that'll make you stay up at night worrying somebody gives them the wrong address or they go to the wrong address whatever and the police are kicking in the door they're bashing and they are\nThe guy inside is not the one they're looking for he just a good guy he's a good guy oh yeah and he has a gun and so what does he do he shoots the people who were breaking into his door natural logical since civil legal\nIssues to police officers\nNormally what has happened in the past is a police officer in the shooting him a killing them they end up killing the good guy who was trying to defend himself\nDoesn't wish me any good will\nThey're there to do me harm that it's the only safe assumption because anybody who kicks in my door is there to do me harm\nAnd you know there are at some point I made sure there are things you can do that really simple it will cost you exactly zero dollars that can keep somebody from opening your door\nUm which I got from the white guy [laughter] uh I mean physically keeps the door from being opened I'm going to survive I got to get us and saw where they want to share that are not\nAh but I'm so glad that you had that conversation with them and then it's one of those do you have to say well look officer if if you're at home and somebody kicks in your door what are you going to be doing\nWell that's where the mayor came in uh the mayor did see it on my perspective on that he totally agree to said you know what I understand your perspective he said I Would have done the same thing\nYou know and the other thing is I I Know\nThere's a bit of a line set up we train we've got the guns and we've got the body armor and all that and when you turn and say well look you need to understand I train and I have a semi automatic rifle\nAnd I don't know what you guys are or wearing and I certainly would never wish harm to any long portion portion officer at all okay but I understand there probably what you're carrying a sport I'm Kerry\nWhere you guys have is what I hear so we we we just need to get on the same page on this I'm not trying to hurt anybody that's the point is the conversation Denison to point you're making them is let's figure something out here so nobody gets hurt\nBecause that's the goal is we don't want anybody to get hurt the stewardesses\nAnd luckily we did a time when we did exactly that uh we sat down for a two hour talking we aren't it out there are some things that\nLike for example now their database now has accurate cell phone numbers for myself and my wife on the event that anything like that happens they can say hey we better call before we decide to break in to that particular ad retrograde\nIdea and you know the other thing is innocent another subject for another day is the whole concept of swatting\nWhich has become a real issue where somebody can spoof it call nine one one and looks like it's coming from your house and say hey I'll just give up my wife I'm going to kill anybody who comes in I'm holding these kids hostage and all of a sudden the swat teams comes in and they find out that\nYou're sitting there watching TV or watching reruns of all of the family or something when they break in the door I mean ... a real deal then is thank you so much I Want to go down the line three McGill is with a set of Carson City Nevada and the girls got a different perspective on this one I think it's going to help us out\nHello sir welcoming to gun talk\nLittle kid so I just want to say uh if we look at this from a protectors point of view gained the law enforcement here for people or if they have a registered gun and they have a reason to approach the middle ... it's such a manner\nThat's appropriate for what ever it is that they can do to get the job done any clear by now if you're registered and logic\nAppropriate for what ever it is that they can do to get the job done any clear by now if you're not register and logically it makes sense\nNow if you're going to be hostile or not because there's a tropical search going every residents ... there has been you know why I got that when the first place\nWell what what if they have their own house\nOr if they had the wrong house ... communication is a symbol between what moment something much filed by which the person who authorized\nWhile I understand all that but my point is that something happened to the ticket in the door now\nRight\nIn and then the whole idea of a registered grounded no such thing as registered guns get over that you know nobody there is no requirement to register a gun in this country\nPerfect so I agree with you that now that got hit by wishing All right well\nLet me run down the anti on one ... Indian uh Texas a procedure called ... ... S C I gather you are an attorney\n[noise] yes I Am\nGo ahead I'm no I I appreciate the topic in my my point is I think in terms of\nPolicies that police you know my my considered it to minimize the defense in which they feel the need to to ... tend to like this is what they need to make sure that they've done to deal with it or they go in and they need to carefully consider whether\nA stakeout might be more appropriate people at some point will need to leave their house to get milk get gas or go to work\nAnd another scenario when the individual outside it's much safer scenario that it would be to break into how they can identify the individual that way\nIn many cases you know just simply serving a warrant or you know at a traffic ticket if you're here obviously there there's a level of importance there needs to be an imminent threat\nThat verifiable or the police should consider one of the group in three ways and if you're pointing out that direction where the criminals are starting to say hey here's a good way to get people to just lay down their gun right there there needs to be uniform\nAnd consistent action to deter that kind of behavior and only when the police you know I think it needs to be a nationwide effort if this\nIs a sham that you're talking about the criminal they're catching on to it is becoming very common [noise]\nYeah and it's in and look if you want to really get a police officer angry you get somebody whose personality police officer man that takes them off about as much as anything I Know with good reason\nBut it now it's become what they've done is they've put everybody in danger they put the homeowners in danger they put the police in danger with this whole impersonation deal and you know all you got to do and he's just ... when you get a chance to get out of your car through a little search you'll find different a number of these cases with whom the other thing is happening is home invasions [noise]\nA lot of times now I've gone from one person just six people doing home invasions and it's one of the reasons that I ended up thanks for your call one of the reasons I said\nPeople need to rethink their home defense God's there's also of course we're talking about you know how'd you know what's going on out there well you know what\nCan we go back to where a great sponsored the blink cameras\nYou could turn on your camera out there looking at your phone's if somebody's pan on the door he'd go oh yeah that's a bunch of police officers out there that's the real deal there's like six cop cars out there okay or no that doesn't look right or not you may not have time to do all that because this stuff\nTypically happens fast it happens in the middle of the night they want to do it while you're asleep as much as they can\nUh catching REM sleep they're going to be in the house before anything happens and whether it's a good guys were the\nBad guys [noise]\nIf your doors or how many times have you heard me talk about you know you do not open the door to find out who's on the other side of if you don't know who's on the other side don't open the door the corollary to that is how secure our your doors\nMinister Holocaust the worst and there's not much of a walk on the air or not much of a system\nHow hard how hard is it to get in oh one other thing if you start doing as I Do every day I Do uh basically it's like a clip service but you do with the Google Alerts system\nAnd find new stores that say home invasion and you start reading a dozen of these a day you get a sense after a year to what's going on\nWhat's really interesting to me is how often\nHome invasions are in the middle of the day because we always think it's going to be like two o'clock in the morning well no not always attacked not even most of the you'll find that a lot of these break ins horror the middle of the day\nAnd SARS where people say well you know I Want my doors at night really [laughter] how about just walk your doors whenever you're there what does lock your doors time it buys you time\nIf you if you are an additional ten or Fifteen seconds\nYou could get to your gun you could get you know\nTo safety you could get to a safe place you could go somewhere in lock the door\nYou could hunker your people together time\nThat's all a gun saying does for you by the time even if I could get into a gun safe and they have enough time for that does is it says well this is gonna be thirty second thirty minutes or an hour or two hours\nOr you can break in the hour we'll go somewhere else\nSo you think about what her on the level where we're going to be do we do what he's got a new Supreme Court justice and the question is what's that going to be for us for gun rights or a number of cases\nThat you're either

California\nThe state has to approve the specific model of the gun has to be a submitted by the manufacturer and then put on the list of not unsafe\nGot which I Love that way right not unsafe so in other words you can see all these guys you can buy these guys and then several years ago they said yes and one of the things these guys are all going to have to have this micro stamping at which point the manufacturers said yeah except that it doesn't exist we can't yet micro stamp\nSo when a gun falls off the list and anytime you manufacture changes something in a God it falls off the list and it's required to be re submitted except now you can't we submitted anything because nothing has micro stamping how do I do\nThat's ... that's exactly right I mean in a way to make it very practical California generation or clock illegal to sell in California\nWow okay so in the list to get smaller and smaller because if a manufacturer says well we're going to change the safety\nOn again we're going to change some things on it we're going to upgrade we're gonna make it better except that now that new change to gun cannot be submitted\nAnd they're not making the other one any more so that
