will be here the phone numbers AAA eight to five five two to five were opening up a couple of lines for that right now\nHeather is in the lobby of Ramsey solutions from Spokane, Washington where the question\nI ever Hi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up man I just finished baby steps three and now I'm working on baby steps three ... saving for a house got your emergency fund good for ... yeah and I wanted to know how long is too long in baby step three being before I actually live on two babysat for\nWas not a magic answer the concept or the or the critical thinking skills for the answer is simply this\nIf you stay there so long that you don't save for retirement you screwed up your retirement right yeah or if you don't stay there long enough then you don't have a good solid down payment and you'll end up with other problems on the mortgage so it's the it's the pull between those two things\nAnd most people that means you know three years four years something like that [noise] um but if you're if you're fifty nine that might not be that long or you're not fifty nine now how old are you\nI'm twenty eight on friday\nOkay cool and so I mean if you stayed out for four years and never started any retirement until thirty two\nBut you had a really juicy down payment on a house and got ... ... you don't have a plan to pay it off in a few years because of that\nYou're not you're you're still going to retire multi millionaire you know if you do that it it but if you stayed out for Twenty years ... been called that baby steps ... yeah it's kind of how you think through it from a critical thinking skills standpoint so how long were you thinking of\nLike just started in June and I'm hoping to have it done in two years\nOkay and so Thirty years old you're your game own on retirement taking on a Fifteen year mortgage by forty five the mortgage is paid for if not sooner and are you will have saved thirty five years at Fifteen Percent of your income which unless you just don't\nAnd uh you will of saved thirty five years at Fifteen Percent of your income which unless you just don't work\nIs going to make you a millionaire multi millionaire you say I'm doing this so you're in a safe zone there but that's how you make the decision more importantly than they Ramsey says never go more than three years that's not how it works it's just you're pulling those two things are pulling at each other or because you're not saving for retirement the longer you go that's all it is I think for some of them I think stay\nOpen phones at triple eight eight to five five to two science Julian is in New York City how Julian how are you know\nI ... it can you hear me okay I can how can I help\nThank you very much for taking my call so I'm In a a bit of a unique position I'm I'm twenty four next year I'm going to medical school and uh I was I'm very very lucky and very appreciative uh I'm not going to have any pets after graduating medical school and residency residency included\nI I decided to specialize 'em and are\nYou going to solve or what\nUh uh yeah I'm not entirely certain that's what I Want to do yet I Know I'm I'm asking how you did that\nOh oh um yeah so so if they get from my father and my grandparents um\nWow I'm very very very appreciative of how\nGood you should be that's amazing wonderful so\nUm yeah so when when I was Twenty one uh I was given a essentially control is funny because it's under my name I'm but I'm Sorry I Apologize I'm so I'm\nA yeah I was I was given control this money and uh I've been given a very good financial advice my father who's helping me manage it but\nUm because it's under my name and he he's essentially asking the rain stopped me or I Would like it a second opinion as to what to do with this money I can give it a little bit of money for a living expenses um and I said that about five thousand dollars from\nSome small side jobs at hospitals but I Want to know how to capitalize on this and I have to set myself up as best as I can for after medical school\nWell the the thing I Would be most concerned about is that the money is available and enough to get you through medical school\nUm it it definitely is um about one third of it is invested very securely and two thirds of it I have in savings ah minutes two thirds we were discussing putting into at AT T bill on three months when duo basis until I needed to take them out that the pay my tuition and then I Would just reinvent the rest\nUm well I probably would not do that and the only reason is is that the bills basically or bonds\nAnd a bond interest rates were yields or go to the bond values rarely go down as interest rates go up and we are in an increasing in the interest rate environment so if you put a hundred thousand dollars in the bills that could turn into Ninety pretty quick\nAs interest rates increase so that's not a very safe investment in the environment that we're in right now um but if you wanted to have some portion of the money invested I probably would go to something like gross income type funds but I'm okay if there's enough there to do simple division and it doesn't have to really earn anything\nIf you want to keep it all very very safe that would be okay with me because the most important thing is for you to be able to graduate with zero debt\nAnd if you screw around with his money in some way and it loses value and you're not able to do that then the whole you know is like\nA ... we were concentrating on the wrong thing And Julian is the right thing to concentrate on Julian ... debt free graduation is the most important part of this math equation not what this money is paying\nA it'd be nice to be a little bit sophisticated about it but if you get caught up in some kind of a sophisticated process and you end up losing money trying to trying to just get a little bit more on this lump sum a you've defeated your own purpose Detroit yourself in the foot so to speak so um\nThat's the process you're looking at I'm going to keep it pretty safe or if you want to go toward something that's fine but I wouldn't use bonds for anything right now as possible play Kimberly is in Pensacola Hi Kimberley how are you\nSaying even though I'm great thank you so much for taking my call\nSure I\nI just wanted to thank you for all you do they think temporary Wal Mart has it's been seven years and it's not and I had paid off that I'm following your plans to go for that and\nSay it's I'm not for an hour at all concerned about our parents' killer hunting you could give us some advice on how they got them\nI'm not parents live in North Carolina and within a flooded area of heart problem area and um every time they're ... um they they experience so far they get on their on their property at home as well as my dad is\nAnd we were just minor and what you can find things that what um they have like that they do have um savings and my mom has a ticket for one\nToo often does this property flood\nWell in Ninety nine now and it pointed and yeah but it got like forty answered and the house and I think about ten feet and shop\nAnd then two years ago um it got him like that shop I think about three years so\nAnd at all my life about six okay from getting in the house again and ... there's only been two major but um they're in their sixties and it it's very emotional for them at any town ...\nThroughout this town we actually packed that or I didn't I was able to help them with adequate but they have all their belongings and let them put them away and you know because they were afraid that it\nActually one of the mouse or is living there has become more painful than not living there but those are the fear of rising water even even the fear is not founded we once in Twenty years\nIs not that bad but bottom line is is lately has developed a phobia for them and they're not have been living there sort of a son living there and why wouldn't they move\nI don't care I mean the actual threat of blood sadistic Lee with what you've given me I wouldn't be that concerned about but if they're absolutely panicking every time the weather person comes on says it's raining it's just not going to live there\nYou know it's more of an emotional decision but that's an okay decisions wrong with that is not going to live in a more moving\n\n\nHeard me talk about ideas for years and how it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I run across some numbers that even surprised me and shows the real nightmare that people go through when they become a victim of the sixteen million victims of identity theft last year yes sixteen million\nA life skills book to someone just because we're successful in one area uh and so if you got a twenty six year old music star yeah um well they're good at music but what happens is we see them being very successful there\nEven me I'm fifty eight I Know better I've worked for the NFL players for Twenty years off and on\nAnd um I Know this was a ... a world class one half of one percent athlete\nUm but they are twenty two shifts there and the rest of their life skills are not developed at the level that they're football skills are developed they are the size of a key uh yeah but that doesn't mean that their life skills have developed at the same level and you know so\nIt it's it's kind of weird I told somebody during one of these rookie camps as like you're looking at this guy the size of a key but when you look in his eyes you see a Thirteen year old yes um because he still is football skills are are the best on the planet here\nI'm In his physical acumen his physical a cue the things you can do with this body in mid error or it's just circus like it's amazing what those guys can do\nIt but what happens is when you watch that skill level especially if you're just watching on TV\nYou think of that guy as you know a forty year old who she ... a mature developed a ... as you know strong marriage has all these other things and these guys are college kids or not they were in college last week yeah you know there's twenty minutes ago and I'm\nEven a player that's been in the leagues for years yeah they're still young and they're still I'm twenty five years old ...\nAnd so it's uh it's interesting in the same thing happens with music people when they get a success level earlier anything where your spotlight and you get a success level and your skill is world class in that thing does not mean you have everything else together yeah yeah and that's true with a\nYou know teenagers in general is one of the things we do this entrepreneur tool box\nIs they can start to develop some of those skills you know running a business yeah\nYeah they and that's absolutely right you know you say this all the time when in America knows he knows you for saying this but the NFL stands for not for a long and these football players young football players know that like hey I Need to develop something now because in probably in three years I Would not be in this league mhm um and the most\nMoney these kids will make will be within their first three to five years of the league if they make it past and\nAnd so I I I told them like ... you have to get focused but when we look at these twenty two year oh this is why I'm so passionate about that Fifteen you wrote about that Thirteen year old getting you know the peanuts in order to about ... get into graduate survival guide a book and also taken our financial foundations curriculum is out of a classroom\nBecause all of that teaches what the old they're professionals do not know mhm if they can get it at Thirteen like these middle school kids day four out here now taking our middle school curriculum\nYou know they are um a head of the game like they were teaching me some stuff earlier today I'm like wow like winning the world and so just to see these young kids are getting it\nTaken our curriculum learning learning how to budget learning how what is the difference between a credit card in a debit card and these kids like man I'm not financing anything like that just gets me excited\nYeah his dolled in in a life skill yes life skills stuff and you need life skills whether you're Seventeen or fifty seven yeah you know and this this money thing\nYou know the basic stuff of being out of there being on a budget having your emergency fund the stuff we talk about her every day on the air it really does work for teenagers and the interesting thing is they're not um\nYou know that they're not like rusted into place right you know they're they're pretty they're pretty uh uh\nElastic in their spirits in that they can receive\nYeah this stuff sometimes more than some of us are a little older and we get a little stiffer on our spirit and we don't receive is quite as well they're like okay let's go let's do that right right and they're not like old docked in and go now to argue with you about ... ... it's a it's easier to get through most of the time you don't have a big argument why did it have to have a credit card you have to drive alone you don't\nHave to have a

talking about is a smart conference me when Hogan I was reading an article they're saying that this younger generation team to millennials are not entrepreneur and I'm like man that's that's a bunch of bologna here more entrepreneurial than any ... he wrote that stupid [laughter]\nAnd so I get excited because I'm seeing this younger generation they are making stupid mistakes because no one never taught them once they learn\nThey tend to not make that same mistake in the areas of finances but they have to be taught at first\nSo that's what I Love about what we're doing is we're giving them life skills to business skills through the teen entrepreneur tool box kid we're helping them understand how to deal with their finances and how to make the right decisions earlier on with our middle school curriculum with the graduate survival guide\nAnd when I see these young people come up to me saying man I cannot do and in thank you so much for teaching me earlier on because we make learning

that kinda jeopardize my feeding and I had to withdraw my application I'd be kicked out of the program\nSo I have a lot of how long are you and I don't how long were you in pharmacy school\nA four by four years\nYou were in for four years four years yeah I Want you to do like ... how much did you like graduating\nUm I only had three questions last and completing the on campus um course work and then I had to want to hear a vocation to that I feel one year you graduate and you have to take your boards and become a far with it\nYou know and what level of family emergency would keep you from going across the finish line\n[laughter] well I'm like I have a parent that has gone on controlled high blood pressure and diabetes and high they suffered a stroke\nOr you know very close to a stroke at is that kind of um [noise] how can take on a full serious care and um you know in terms of helping them and that kind of like you don't mess with the fact that I had to study for my my my um studies\nPractices in Jacksonville, Florida Hi Travis welcome to that I rented them hey Dave how're you doing things taking my call\nShrimp ... hoping you could a shuttle a defeat for my wife and I are old\nBuddies with here um we have about Seventy\nFive thousand dollar they collect it we\nUm we own our home outright uh we have a vehicle that is being tasting at Seventy five thousand probably make a decent money and we have in Iran are about to get in to the question on on what what's\nDecent money or she makes about one twenty and I make about eighty okay\nSo the question that I that aren't Albert that we have is um her mother and father passed away last year and uh she was not an inheritance on that in ... she has a certain amount of distribution every year for tax purposes my idea for the inheritance money I'm is who\nPlayed one lump sum\nPay off all of our debt and then to repay ourselves back off of that to an IRA I'm so that we don't have to worry about including sleep paying the uh interest game if you will or a worry about it is that the um you know she is going to be good for our retirement\nUm my record good at it this year forty I'm thirty eight we still have a good amount of time to be putting into our um different farming town so I guess my my question is should we go ahead and take the distribution of our debt so that when a longer paying the\nUm you know the interest rate or should we go and pay the debt down and we are\nA ... and it will be there for you when you went out here\nWell we've been using for almost Thirty years a decision making paradigm a decision making structure that is based on the idea of what is the fastest way\nWealth what is the shortest distance but wells\nAnd I'm In the process what in other words what gives us the greatest returns and what give what gives us the least risk what what has a level of wisdom to it um and it's not just one sided it's not all investing mind that it's not all that in mind that it's not anything it's just a process of financial planning process\nThat process has now been proven obviously doing it for twenty five years and many many people have become millionaires and multi millionaires gradually not get rich quick using the process\nUm then the question becomes do you guys were you agree to use that process and if you're ... so that the way I Would answer the question obviously me being me is I'm going to tell you use that process\nReviews that process and if you're just so that the way I Would answer the question obviously me being me is I'm gonna tell you use that process and that will answer your question what to do with the money\nBut um but you've got a first decide do you want to do that or not I mean that's that's that's the core disagreement here what the process is based on the process was called the baby steps and what it's based on is a couple of things number one you're most powerful wealth building to\nUse your income\nAnd freeing up your income and not having that not only lowers risk not only increases the peace and the quality the relationship in the household but it also increases mathematically freeze up all of your income just to make money with instead of giving it to banks\nAnd uh and the second part of the things driving the process is is that personal finance is eighty percent behavior it's only twenty percent have knowledge stuff we're talking about it's not really rocket science here\nThere's not a lot to the math it's it's about fourth or fifth grade math is really all it is\nSo having said that we say baby step one side of a thousand dollars you guys are obviously done that too is to be dead free everything but your house you've not done that\nThree is to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses I didn't hear that you've done that and then four she had that for start putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement so how much is your emergency fund\nCurrently we have about twenty five or so in our servings come\nIf the inheritance was not on the table what we would teach you to do that down to twenty four through the uh or take twenty four of the twenty five and throw it at the vet and then clean up this debt very very quickly it is absurd for you to have shown that five dollars in debt with a two hundred thousand dollar household income it was getting ready to\n... all your life or a couple of months ago and I'm a went on a on a knife in a nice way on the majority of\nOkay it's absurd that you make two hundred thousand dollars a year and you know under five dollars and that\n... ... ... you know\nYou got to make enough money to have done this the right way you chose not to do with the right way so it's up to you guys but if you're going to do what we teach you know you would use this inheritance immediately to become debt free so that\nYou take all those payments that you don't have any more and you use those to build wealth with you have paid for home\nCorrect we we heard it when\nI'm working on it and how much is in the inheritance in cash\nI I'm not quite a hundred of going about another somewhere north of ... Seventy five\nHundred and Seventy five thousand dollars correct okay and why she taking distributions instead of just taking it\nUm ... what her financial grant or told her that she had it in a disturbing to um [noise] um is it cover her tax uh over the fear here at heart over at the most part because the way to quit the money out of town\nYeah it's a bunch of crap um the uh\nOkay because anytime you start making decisions based on taxes instead of based on economics you make bad decisions so I don't know what this money's invested in but I Want to get control of this money and get it invested\n... what would I Do I catch the whole thing out pay some taxes and I'm In a different financial advisor and uh I Would pay off all the debt\nAnd I would invest the rest of it\nOr in something that I can see control and know what it is in good mutual funds or in some paid for real estate or something like that I honestly don't think that's what\nYou all are going to do but that's what I Would do um because\nI think there's a lot of cooks in this kitchen\nThere's a lot of opinions flying around here and you guys have got to get inside this and to as a couple decide what you're going to do and how you're going to handle money and then you start telling financial advisors what to do and show them telling you what today and uh it's a different different situation so I think she inherited the financial advisor to\nI don't think he picked him and um and that's really a bad medicine\nAs well Ninety percent of the time are you guys need to pick 'em or you need to re picking and hiring again and this time he worked for you but I think he's still works for grandpa even grandpa was dead and uh that's the way this stuff works usually bad bad medicine\nTravis what I Would do just catch the whole thing out pay off all my debts and invest the money was what's left that's what I Would do and I would take your wonderful two hundred thousand or income and become multi millionaires with it and that's what we've shown people how to do for almost three decades now\nHold on I'll send you guys are a couple a copy of the book the total money make over it'll walk you

deal\n'cause she comes from Laurie in Iowa I was interested in opening a five twenty nine plan for my daughter she has autism so I may open in a bubble account instead would depending on the severity of her offices and\nMy biggest concern is that I don't know what happens to the money to five twenty nine plan if she doesn't go to college can you tell me what happens to money not used for education\nOr it will be if you don't transfer it to a sibling um it'll be heavily taxed and ... it'll be taxed and heavily penalize so um\nYou know the five twenty nine is not a good plan a for a child that you're not sure what's going to happen as far as their education is going to be and on and we've got a special needs situation like this I Would use the able to count 'em and or I Would just use mutual fund\nJust blurted mutual fund and let it grow and then you can just take care of the child with that money or to your marketing it for them for their future\nOr they may do a trade school they may do or they may be able to do a full for your academic run 'em they may do a lot of things I don't know how the severity of this I don't know exactly what you're facing\nBut are you simply going to save money\nIt's as simple invest money in your name and you're controlling it and then you can decide to help your child however you want to the only advantage of the table or the five twenty nine is just the tax advantage\nStill just don't investment in a good mutual fund\nQuestion is is at our as it grows is going to be taxed\nThat's the only thing so it's a it's an advantage if you have a real high probability of them doing our education but again where you've got a\nSpecial needs situation most of the time I'm going to say just save it in a regular count saving the mutual fund if you want to use the cable that's fine that's what it's designed for do all kinds of stuff with that but it's a good plan but\nI probably would just keep it where I can get my hands on it and I'm I'm not a big deal either way the the thing the reason we push your five twenty nine just does two things uh ... in a traditional ... situation\nIt teaches you to brainwash your kid to go to college which is not a bad thing at all and the other thing is it allows that money to grow tax free and so it's a ... that's a wonderful benefits but is that ... is that the only possible way you can care for your child no\nInterest in a more traditional situation it's the best way the most um\nYou know the least taxes on the thing which is generally what we want to do 'em or let it grow but in this situation I I'm not the tax benefit is not worth the pension you in the corner and actually hitting you harder later I'm making you wish you just pay the taxes\nAnd and that's the way to work
