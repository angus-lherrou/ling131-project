get fat I fade unlike or pick up her paycheck um can read about in a really big time that I Want to say to that I Am fortunate to have parents kind enough to let me say within like free\nThat's for sure okay what do you make um monthly about eleven hundred\nAnd is that and that's after graduating say okay what is your degree\nIt's actually a couple of colleges but um I actually got a job with

car so I say about ... to about a year\nOkay well at eleven hundred a month we're talking about a little over Thirteen thousand dollars a year that's you're not going to you're going to make it on that in Raleigh out on your own okay you're not making enough to do that so we've got to get your income up that's why I was asking and so um yeah we need a double your income\nYou know pretty quick here as fast as you\nHave and when you can double your income and then I Would go get a you know an inexpensive apartment maybe a roommate or whatever and just get started on your own and the main thing there is make sure you have no dad do you have any debt at all\nI'm going to have about a tough primary uh down our twelve thousand dollars in debt I'm which my parents um our country that too um that they're taking care of that so\nHe can establish more credit what do you mean they're taking care of that so they they come to a lady and they offered him I pay a whole Malone off their finger\nOr that you know we don't need you to establish any more credit you don't need any that you you don't make enough money to breathe hardly okay so you are one hundred percent that free\nAnd then you build an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses are like five thousand dollars a set aside\nFor emergencies then you would start saving towards your home and by then you are also in your first apartment and you just start saving as fast as you can and you won't put down as much as you can possibly put down how old are you what you said you're twenty four\nOkay okay good\nWell you got a good plan so hopefully in the next twelve to Eighteen months you can see that income spike up as you start using your cosmetology degree\nAnd um because you know when you're a Thirteen thousand when you get your twenty six thousand quick as we can that's doubling that storm a lot of money but at least get you out there and get you moving in and get your career to start to build\nSo hey thanks for the call we appreciate you listening Ian is whether it's a prince Edward Hi Ian how are you\nEither thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nMy wife and I got my boys are kids and we just moved into our dream on all three years ago or ten twelve acres to walk through with the kids turn around but the last few months which is your plan where they just have to\nAnd torture thinking um when we got thirty five thousand undead besides the house and we're just not sure if we want and we need to sell the house just to be the free or which is called through the next and Fifteen Years and I'm just making out than\nTen to Fifteen Years remain payroll house and everything\nYeah like ... where you know we have Twenty years left in the mortgage\nMhm so what's your how come\nRight yeah and um then what is your house payment\nIs around twelve hundred among\nOkay house payments not out of line here that's fine now but you gotta lotta carrying you got a lot of kids and you're not used to living on a limited budget and you're going to start that\nWere egg yeah\nBecause you've got thirty thirty five hours to clean up I mean you really need to clean that up it's probably going to take a year and a half two years but something like that you know longer than two years you need to have this debt cleaned up right what is the thirty five thousand and debt what kind of that\nA ... or the lock my parents and part of it is my credits twenty five on a credit and kind of ground alone from our parents\nOkay Mm So just a line of credit what'd you bond with a line of credit\nOh it's just been life has just been here about a piano a few years ago [noise] or just miscellaneous wearing\n... and that's over right yeah\nDoing that anymore right\nNo no no we were like are just sick and tired we just want to be free\nYeah we love the place would my I don't think I don't think you need to sell the house houses knocking on your twelve hundred bucks out of a fifty eight hundred dollar take home pay is not at all on\nYour oh you're okay on our house but you do have to get your written budget get on every dollar you're written budget and get that going as quick as you can every dollar dot com and I'm starting to you know using the app on your phone\nAnd you guys need to squeeze every dollar so that you clear there's thirty five 'cause if you can clear the thirty five you're going to have pretty good room in this budget even with five kids\nAnd you can clear and it's just going to take a year and a half two years of ... a year and a half two years or Seventeen five a year out of Seventy thousand take home that's doable\nYou can do that as a lay down and you can do that a thirty five thousand out Seventy thousand with five kids means one year I don't think you're going to do that so somewhere between the one in the two and that's on landing on Eighteen months Richard is with us Richards in Salt Lake City Hi Richard how are you\nI have a great got how can I help [noise] so I Would call and bring about emerging until we have a fully funded an emergency\nI knew it out of the three to six months [noise] good\nHow about the camp out in there [laughter] I'm at my job the upper H up they account match up to Fifteen hundred dollars a year great um should\nShould I fully fund the account and should account that\nCourt than your emergency Fonda\nHolly funded to get that match that's wonderful and the ... of course can only be used for one kind of an emergency and that's medical bills will lots of other kinds of emergencies pop up and so um do you do you do both of you work in this house for as a single income\nNo single and I'm okay and what's your household income of around and what do you do er nurse\nYou're a nurse okay very very stable career\nMeaning that if you were to lose a job you can get another one in twenty minutes\nNursing is just a fabulous career field so in terms of ah accessibility even add hours anytime you want to add hours you can back it off you can change direction all kinds of stuff you just really ever landed in a sweet spot there so very very good on that given that you've got that type of a career that should not\nSo specialized that it might take you six months to find a job if you lost it or something like your six minutes um then given that that's the situation I went back and do you fully fund you're at it you find that I just say between the three to six months of expenses range I Would back down to the three months\nOkay and so that's kind of like partially leaning on the ... say as part of your emergency fund but it's certainly not we're not really counting it because I mean you can have lots of emergencies that have nothing to do with medical on your life\nWhen you can get you again you could lose a job you could um have the death of a relative and you had to pay for the funeral or wanted to pay for the funeral you can have all kinds of different things happen transmission blow out of the car and all kinds of things that\nCan happen that aren't medical and you can't use the ... medical [noise]\nSo I don't generally counted in the emergency fund but I'm looking at your career stability and the fact he got a big fat I just say with a big fat match on it which is just wonderful both of them then that makes me very comfortable being almost three months side of the three to six months [noise] range for your emergency [noise]\nOne question I get asked all the time is do I need life insurance listened the whole point of life insurance is to replace your income for someone who counts on you so if you have a spouse or you have\nKids yes you need term life insurance is\nWe were absolutely we were in in in in your geysers ministry hands down\nWell we're glad we're part of it gives you guys are heroes man what a great story you're absolutely right well what do you tell people to key to getting out of debt is\nI'd say there's a few things obviously one hundred percent if you're not a team with your spouse there's no way you're going to get out of that I don't see how it was enough troubles in trials in life that if you guys I'm working together at Thursday's when I was struggling that she wasn't and vice versa\nUm and then obviously the plan that you guys set forth um and then you have to be real with yourself and I think not not live the entitled lifestyle that you're going to borrow other people's money to lose I mean\nYou know we talked about this and if you make thirty thousand dollars in this country are more blessing probably Ninety nine percent of people in the world and I think you just kind of have to square your shoulders and say hey this is what I Want and it wasn't fun you know she was she was working three literally three job she had three different jobs really I got credentialed at another university and I would go in because I have a lot of time off with my job and I\nI didn't want to I didn't want to drive three hours and stay the night on my days off in ... at a university and and work extra but\nYou know seeing them in the rearview mirror made me want to do with that much more and just get it done and it's you know what I mean what did you make it that gang for my average income is probably you know without working extra is probably one Seventy five um ACT UP how much on that extra\nProbably another ten or Fifteen just in a short period of time and then and then I started getting more opportunities at my at my institution um and you know I got the only lease it I think you would approve of\nThis is Dave Ramsey lease um when I sold my truck I was going on Craig's list and I was going to buy a beat her for a thousand bucks and my dad's got more cars and he knows what to do with and I said hey I'll give you a
