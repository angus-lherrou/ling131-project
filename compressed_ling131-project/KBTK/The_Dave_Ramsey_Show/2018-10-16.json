I'm In um [noise] we are a very quickly\nMuch better situation not that we were in a really rough spot but it feels a lot better being where we are now I'm In um [noise] we are a very quickly approaching the end of baby step three in January will be\nSix months plus and so my ah my focus now is four or five and six and reading your book and going through the class is actually more than once and um when I'm really faced with is our house we moved in and two thousand six\nAnd a we pay two fifty to a according to the low and you know casual conversation we're not we're not at the two fifty two so after you know twelve plus years were not back to our original ... you know purchase price [noise] um\nThat's weird yeah it no you know Phoenix got hit really hard by the housing bubble and\nWe ... really hard I'm Sorry I didn't\nKnow how to people even across the street or are you know have doubled the price of the house they bought a couple of years after we did we bought on the right side on the downside of the top but we're still not back there even a you know I guess maybe it's our neighborhood worse than others but um so we're not there yet\nAs we approach four or five and six steps for five and six I'm\nYou know I have two teenage sons were going to be faced with college here soon I'm very excited to get back into our retirement planning which we put on hold back at the beginning and so now I'm just trying to figure out if we just forget the houses and not put anything\nWell I better in order of priority for five six but done simultaneously so the way that might sound would be you start with Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement that's baby steps period\nUnless you're in an emergency situation you you do that now I'm ... and then you move on to kids college you've got college looking down you're looking down the barrel gun on college\nAnd so that's probably going to take everything above and beyond your Fifteen Percent going into retirement and your rights houses probably on hold for a little while when you got two teenagers and no college funds you got some catching up today right\nOf Ramsey solutions some sunny from San Diego California drop by and ah [noise] ...\nHi Mr Ramsey plus fall it's such a great honor to speak to you um\nAnd my question is I've just immigrated to the United states and I've lived a frugal life I'm like save my money them careful with it but since I've arrived in the United states um I've had a ... some of my acquaintances telling me\nI'm that you'll frugal living will make your social loud cost ya if you're buying a sense of wars and expensive cars and all of the state of symbol mhm I'm you will be treated as a social out of a sudden I'm came to understand what would be your take on that\n[laughter] I Love it\nOr did your emigrated from a United Kingdom United Kingdom okay and where did you grow up um I was born in India I immigrated to the u._k. when I was Seventeen okay and you're how old are twenty nine okay and how long does your living and you cannot eleven years were you a social outcasts there I'm no okay\nWell uh where did you live in the u._k. a city called ... off right pretty good size city it is it's it's a nice with a a very legitimate shitty and you weren't a social activist there for being frugal no but um I was like oh what do you live in the United states um I live in San Diego\n[laughter]\nYou might be a social outcasts there now are getting okay there are people and certainly in San Diego that have common sense as well\nSo um I don't know what crowd you're running with was there but um it's different than the one you ran with an India or the one you ran with an ... for sure uh because they have been been bitten by the bug of consumerism but plenty of Americans um\nIn in a city or will not consider your social outcasts for having good common sense values now a that's assuming you're you know you if your clothes are not necessarily expensive but they are at least clean mhm and your watch um I'm I'm I'm worth\nWell over ten million dollars is building worth twenty million that you're standing in is paid for and that's my watch pretty on assuming\nI'm like it costs about a hundred and fifty bucks I'm problem is I don't care what you think and if you think I feel like I'm cool because I have a watch I don't really think you're cool so um you know that's the thing you got to decide who you want to influence you\nUm and where you want to end up so what brought you to the United states why did you come here\nWas um a childhood dream that I hunt mhm um I read somewhere that um\nBecause it's going to guarantee freedoms to all people to Supreme Court ruled that no one can be false to a resigned to pledge of allegiance mhm and then to get hold of me I was about twelve years old mhm and I tried to apply that in my school they didn't get a get a naive I was ... I'm In the American constitution doesn't apply in India\nAnd I actually got\nAt my school in India or get a naive I was ... I'm In the American constitution doesn't apply in India and uh and I got 'em if Egypt followed me out to get in trouble yeah I did I think that the principal and the fact that the principal one day when I make it to the United states you wouldn't be able to do that to me anymore\nSo freedom that is correct freedom okay and now people are trying to take your freedom from you with ah forcing you to conform to something using a social pressure but not all okay and so I Would treat it exactly the same way as hard as you have fought\nThrough you know twenty nine years of your life to get to be standing here um I wouldn't surrender my freedom at a threat to stuff\nAre all in the name of someone being impressed generally speaking a here's a good rule of thumb people who are impressed by\nThings that you have or aware or not impressive people when you get inside of their hearts and inside of their minds they're what we call shallow and so um the\nVery people you might attract by having some bling by having some jewelry or some watches or the proper\nClothing are the people that you really don't want influencing your future and your character in your life you've paid a huge price to get to be here and enjoy the freedom and so you're a man of character\nAnd um the uh ... and the show the people that are telling you that are probably not people I Would want\n'em to be influencing me I might want to influence them and try to help them but if I were in your shoes I Would say that doesn't need to be your inner circle that are teaching you how to live mentor and you ... you and so forth um and so\nYou know check out a folks that have a little more depth of character in our judging you based on what you drive now again it needs to be if you're driving a car um that's a while you're trying to achieve a financial go or something what needs to be clean\nAnd maintained you don't take good care of it but um it doesn't it doesn't need to be dirty and doesn't need to be missing the same thing with your clothing or your hair or whatever else you take care of the things that you have been and manage them but most wealthy people or do not by\nA expensive things to impress other people\nAre a few do but most don't that's how they became wealthy now they do by some expensive things that I buy some expensive things but there for me\nAnd for my family and for my wife and that kind of thing and they're not for what someone thinks I'm I'm I've got a really nice home but I buy it for somebody else are we live there you know and what you think about are good or bad doesn't really matter to me and so\nI I don't know is that helpful is that helpful part of this year is that what you're looking answer I think I needed to hear that that'll come what are you doing for a living I'm looking I date in IT okay what do you do a developer you're a developing okay All right well you probably need to come to national work rush\n[laughter] Saudi as an honor to meet you sir if you've got quite a story brother quite a story Weldon\nThanks for stopping by open phones AAA eight to five five two to five ... this was the Dave Ramsey show D is with us in Atlanta Hi Dee how are you\n[noise] Hi I'm well thank you for asking sure what's up [noise]\nUm I wanted to ask if I should have my tax come here and she reported off information on our Seventeen Pakistan and India without being being charged that ten thousand dollars\nYou're being charge ten thousand dollars in penalties yeah mhm not taxes\nI Want to pay their taxes in penalty yeah okay so it's a show like a percentage on the information mhm well that\nFalse information sheet allied intentionally and you get groove that\nYeah why would I Do\nI get to get back my money I don't know but I think that she claimed that we have a business that we don't own she claimed that we're paying for cars that we don't own she plane claims that we're paying 'em some mileage for their business again that we don't own\nThat's weird I mean does your husband have something to do with this\nWhen he doesn't have hit that we should see what you\nKnow I mean they just randomly out of thin air she'd dreamed up a business that you don't have cars you don't have an mileage that you don't have\nRight now we have a church but you know check it don't get caught so there was no nothing in them the documentation I mentioned anything about that churches have our\nUh our number of aid that I don't want to go under ...\nAre you are you doing a work outside the five oh one C. three as of venture lists that you're being paid uh outside of the church no you're not you don't do speaking engagements and get paid for that on the side\nNo everything's through the church or a hundred percent\nYes and you know for the church we don't make any money or they could only have we both work independently frail another company\nI say you have your by vocational pastors okay yeah okay um well I\nI think if there are I I don't know you need to see an attorney is the answer the question 'cause I don't know whether you have grounds to sue someone or not this is a very bizarre thing as someone would do this just out of the blue eye is not a mirror mistake I mean it's a complete fabrication\nAnd so um I mean this was ... it sounds like fraudulent activity on your behalf now you sign the tax returns though didn't you\nKnow everything digital\nYou know but you had to see the tax returns\nYou you you didn't land allow someone to send in tax returns are due to the sea surely I you may have trouble I don't know you need to see an attorney and ask them\nA hot and my guess is the most you could hopefully get back will be the penalties the taxes you on radio and you still owe the penalties are due to them not being paid on time due to this um and I think that's the most you might get back I don't know that some of the money [noise]\n\nYou know that if you combine that data breaches that have occurred in the past twelve months almost every American has had their personal info compromised or act over fifty percent of our listeners and viewers tell us that they or someone in their family has been a victim\nUm we had my mini van was paid off um had over two hundred thousand miles um wasn't worth a lot\nSo I didn't see that being helpful but we had a unique opportunity with the car because we happened to own one of the Volkswagen diesel was handle yeah you know\nYeah and they were offering us you know we could do that by Dr pet and we were planning to keep it but I looked at the options and started looking at if we get to buy back and got the cash settlement\nGot rid of the payment and the position that would put a fan of it actually had us at that point to where we would pay off in thirty six months\nMhm and about two or three o'clock in the morning I called my brother back him\nWhat I'd been doing and he said he would buy us F P U um for Christmas and allow us to you know to the program at home we kind of live in the middle of nowhere and then I told him that I Would text pets but not today to talk to him and I was a little nervous because of the car with kind of pets and I didn't think he\nGot the mini van that's driving the tractor\n[laughter]\nHe's like I'm not driving the minivan but yeah but he I texted him and surprisingly he was like most and I told him about my spreadsheet that I made this nice color coded spreadsheet and I sent it to him and surprisingly he came back with let's do this\n... um and I I think\nThat you are you are ready to you are sick of this\nOh absolutely yeah yeah yeah and then you come home and you guys go to financial university where\nWe didn't end up going to let we did it um through the program at home\nHome study I go to\nOur church is an hour and a half away is run right\nNow now now days you could just watch it all on line but it was different then yeah very good\nYou God is so\nKey to getting into that you made already one thousand and they seem much more folks from Arkansas for\nAdults like in that they paid off the phone ten thousand and then we also got about an eight thousand dollar cash settlement on top of that\nOkay so you got twenty five of the eighty one was that one month yes All right and then what what is the key to getting out of debt and you did it in Eighteen months\n[noise] um I Would have to say for for me it was communication close communication to where both of us know exactly what's going on with everything all the time rather than\nIn the past where I had largely let her kind of control everything\nMhm which she she duty as good a job as I could possibly expect\nExactly what she was by herself but she was by herself I didn't have a full understanding of what was going on right\nHow was being done exactly where we were I knew small numbers I did not have the\nBig picture and you know guys being miserable creatures disparate she gave me the big picture and the color coded clarity\n[laughter] so it's definitely a you\nLost some of the control one but not in law but you gain um someone else's shoulders to carry the load right\nYes yeah it became amazing actually what happened with pat with this was beyond flabbergasted me because\nHe got so on board that what that and God honestly you had a huge impact in this because he was told there'd be no more extensions and that was back like just a few months before we started at man I'm about to\nBe about a year into it he gets a call he he was home during one of his trips and he gets a call from work saying they just got back three weeks before but they went needed him to come back a month early and he\nGets off the phone and he's like or do I do and I'm like I don't know do you want to go back and he's like what what would you do with our debt and so I we were out of town and I don't even know how I got my spreadsheet their numbers if I just knew um but I sat down and he was sitting at my brother's house actually calculating and I'm like you know what if you do this we can be out of debt in June\nUm instead of you know another year and a half and it was like\nWow he jumps on board and he he actually told them that have extended for the the line you know\nIf they would give them an extra two weeks on the end as well that would guarantee us to get it all paid off in that time\nCongratulations you guys were so you think you've got a copy of course opens returns for books for you that is the next chapter in your story to be millionaires and outrageously generous as you go along\nAnd going it directly and I say one other thing that you got him secular view was um one of the big kids for me was um setting an example for our kids are teenagers and I thought they made a huge difference that
