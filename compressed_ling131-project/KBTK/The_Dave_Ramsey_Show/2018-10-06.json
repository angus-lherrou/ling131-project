Ramsey show\nOkay thank you so much for taking my call sure was hot [laughter] absolutely my parents\nMy question is is my dad is Seventy five years\nSee what kind of the airplane next not for fifty to six fifty a week um [noise] a couple of years ago he got sick I found out that he had a paid he's behind on a lot of itself or somehow they got a fifty thousand dollar loan from the bank\nAnd he doesn't have them attention he gets that teen hundred and some security and I'm I'm just wondering what what what can I Do\nAt this stage for him um I did provide hands I took over other bills and I did provide him with about five hundred dollars a week on like a debit card that for him to buy\nFood and what are you doing with the rest of the ... I'm Sorry what are you doing with the rest of the money\nOh I'm paying all and I'm paying all his spare the sale half about um ten K. left on the equity loan ... two thousand on a credit card mhm\nEight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house and how much are you able to put on\nThe debts I'm putting everything was a turning out to do everything on on that much money does that amount to what is it\nA month [noise] mhm\nI think it amounts to about a thousand a month\nAnd that's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two did I get that right\nIf you will have on the car eight and a half and chew on a credit card\nOkay and you know if you divide that about four thousand a month I think you're done and the year\nOkay and your first goal would be to get him debt free you're done with a dead in a year right wrinkles to get him to free 'cause he's Seventy five years old and they still work in the steel plant to understand that right yes that was going to come a moment and it will come suddenly that he just can't do that\nAnd I'm afraid I yeah my prayer is at least that he gets through this year\nMhm and that way you know free and if he's a hundred percent debt free house and everything you can probably make it on a Social Security if you had to write okay not yeah not ideal not what we want but we probably get there and uh\nThen the next step is if we get past that that'd be wonderful let's get debt free then let's build an emergency fund a three to six months of expenses but we get past that then let's start building some nest egg for retirement but the fastest way to build a nest egg for retirement is to clear that dead and to have that emergency fund in place\nAnd he is still the baby steps in other words\nOkay that sounds good well I'm asking is why a bank loan and [noise] um someone at his age and the K animal you know four and a and to be paid off and twenty forty three knowing that\nHe went and lived that long\nWell two reasons one is they're stupid and the second reason is is they're counting on the house I've got to lean against the house right now that\nIn some of the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on it upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral as part of it\nOn and so that's part of the equation the other part of the question is you know asking a bank or if you should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry I mean they'll they'll loan anybody to breathe that are not raising money you know what I'm saying the lending\nHas gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's nothing you know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nAnd ...\nAnd so the industry is just stupid is what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes we will go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and it was like no they would've offered a dog that credit card\nSo I mean and dead people get credit card offers so it you know it doesn't mean anything doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and it doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offer you could be a dead dog and get a credit card off or it can happen so I mean you could be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and just you got to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job congratulations Tim is with us in Dayton, Ohio I Tim how're you\nDoing I'm five days I got to require retirement plus you know ...\nI'm fifty two here about a year ... and um\nI have a bench and then I'll have a four week I also know that a good way mhm I quickly here at sixty two would be better to file for Social Security and weight while before it starts with a a cake for we have for the whole time of the ...\nYou can run the mouse out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four O. one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your Social Security check will grow if you delay it\nAnd that's the way you're comparing it see other words if you wait from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it\nWill you know what is the rate of return on that you know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more than a mutual fund generally speaking um and then the other question comes up you know even if I don't need it should I take it\nUm and uh I I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it um by not taking out their four O. one K. or by some other things than than usually comes out better to\nTake it earlier uh but but you know there's a lot of different parts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation oh that would definitely have [laughter]\n[laughter] yeah so you got you got to kind of gas and you got to say you know average death age of a male and the U.S is Seventy six averaged ... death I drove a female in the U.S is Seventy eight\nBut once you've lived to be sixty is higher than that because that those numbers included infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got a real shot at Ninety\nAccording to the stat tables right now and so um that that's what you've got to walk through and think through in the process so good question man thank you for joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Todd is in New Hampshire Hi Todd how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nWell um I I when I spoke to the lady she said I could ask your question and I just got the starter pack off of your website for myself for my for my daughter who's thirty one I'm fifty two and\nUm I've been a dream or I guess to re free spirited she would say from listening to your show addictive Lee now for the last two weeks [laughter]\nI Know who you were before that it's All right but um my wife and I sat down and we've never been able to agree on money um she's the shaver um the spender and just I don't you know I don't know what the money situation is where I go and spend it [laughter]\nAnd um

my retirement and I've worked for a company for Fifteen Years and I've got\nAbout ... eldest daughter pack where's the total money make over a book in there\nYes it is I started to read that I have read it\nWas totally make over has every detail about the seven baby steps as the seven baby steps on steroids\nAnd so it's going to walk you through first thing you do you just have a thousand dollars you get on a written plan you and your wife or an agreement and we're gonna we're in agreement that we're going to work this plan together okay and once you do that then you're first gold you squeeze out of your budget as you say with ... dollars if you've already got money saved\nThan we would save only a thousand dollars of it stop all investing\nTemporarily temporarily temporarily and then you move on to baby step two which is your debt snowball and that's where you pay off everything except for home busting your debts\nSmaller slug you attack those were caused by getting rid of those that famous now you've got the ability to invest\nAnd then you start at the time it was crazy stuff\nThey make sure you and your wife or whatever that gather\nPlus face it this is a hectic time of year but here's the deal it's not an excuse to lose track of your spending especially when we made it so incredibly easy for you with our free budgeting tool called every dollar\nSeeing how that

I Would do a Lucas is on Twitter Dave do you agree with the pay yourself\nPrincipal well Lucas um in general terms yes uh but if you want to get more specific ah no [laughter]\nThe specific no part would be that I'm an evangelical Christian so I tie the idea of a tenth of my income off the top before I start anything to my local church\nSo I don't pay myself first I'm but putting yourself ahead of your bills as a general philosophy and saying I'm going to save money I'm going to make savings a priority I'm gonna make investing a priority this is what people do to build\nWealth and so yes I Would famous evangelist Martin Luther said I'm no it\nWasn't it was John Wesley ... what am I thinking was famous for Angela forgot that part right Wesley said if you'll give ten percent and saved ten percent and live on eighty percent you'll always be okay and you know there's not a bad formula\nBut that's also putting God first few seconds and then living on eighty\nAnd figure figure out there to live on your income after you're giving in you're investing\nAnd you'll always that money that part is accurate and then we you know we have we evolve that a little bit of the baby steps work when you're on baby step one you don't do anything do you save a thousand dollars and baby step to you're not saving any money and baby step too including stopping all your investments temporarily\nBecause you're completely doing it that snowball and you're focusing on the debt why so we can say more later so that's the technical parts of the answer but in general you gotta put your giving and you're saving at the top of your list at the top of your life priorities because you're gonna have a better life if you always give and save\nAnd live on less\nThe baby step Wesley formula whatever's going

middle school which was seven eight nine the school I went to and man\nIf I could just get out of six gringo over there in middle school you know they've got I got P. E. they've got football they got cheerleaders\nHave it on one that fall thanks for taking my call sure what's up so I didn't hear that go I resigned our children for Florida prepaid college\nPlanned and my husband and I were both making more money at that time and since then our income has gone down and we added another child\nAnd we've gotten into some credit card debt and we have a car loan now um we can take the money out and we have invested over the past three years without penalty\nShould we pay that or should we got half our debts and leave that money and continue contributing to their prepaid plan\nHow much is in there [noise] um about eighty six hundred eighty six hundred dollars and how much do you own your car we have a ten thousand and what do you own your credit cards uh five thousand okay and um are you guys on a budget in reducing debt already\nWe just started at ... and that's and I realized we did that and he's got out of order with having the pan ... pan and then I don't know what to do at this point\nGotcha okay I'm In your household income as well\n[noise] [noise] ah my husband makes twenty five and I have a small business that brings in about twelve thousand a year\nOkay so about sixty thousand give or take All right um no I Would not casual would stop adding to it\nUm and um you do need to get on a budget and follow through with what you're learning and financial position where the and just work your baby steps if you stop adding to it you'll be fine\nThe other thing I probably wouldn't do a norm urgency\nA no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out of there and roll it into a five twenty nine plan in good mutual funds and here's why\nYou're much better off to save for college and a five twenty nine or an ESL and mutual funds and you are with prepaid college plants here is the reason anytime you're prepay something your rate of return is what it increases in price\nAnd so if I could prepay a an item I pay a thousand dollars and increases in price\nTo twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be a nice rate of return right so how much of the increase in price 'cause that's the only return when you ... pay anything they're not giving you an increased rate they're not giving your growth rate you simply are saving the increases in tuition\nBy paying it ahead of time that's all you're doing now\nTuition for the last Seventy years as average about seven point two percent\nInflation right\nSo that means you're making about ... to ... percent on your money when you do prepaid college in a good growth stocks mutual fund you ought to be ten to fourteen percent average annual return over that same period of time\nSo are you make more by putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college the other problem with prepaid college is\nA ... and it's a blanket statement but and it would vary from state to state many many many of the state's\nBusiness government are very poorly run and they screw up some of the prepaid college plans in the process I mean they're just horrible administrators\nNow some states are well run my state happens to be well run\nSo in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be concerned today under the current administration with a with the stability of the ... still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other reason I was talking about I Want a better rate of return on my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition\nSo all of that to say a row you already six hundred bucks into a five twenty nine and a good mutual fund\nAt some point right now I just stopped adding get yourself on a budget cranky lifestyle down stop going out to eat canceled the trip that you had planned to call to vacation because you're broken you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card debt\nSo you're right on track you're doing the right kind of things and that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes Matthew's with us in Fort Worth Texas have Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent uh want to thank you first off for a\nA ... I was going through recipe you for the last seven years we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good for him would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through here while so but\nTo my question because this was a wonderful thing that's fixing the happened or we were in my family my parents have received an inheritance a mineral rights in West Texas ... a large portion\nAnd uh haven't struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and had a few oils but not not a time mhm uh speculators are wanting to sell a by our rights for a large sum of money [laughter]\nOr over a million dollars mhm and we're deciding whether or not we should sell mhm and cash out or hopefully you know we're being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom and we want them out you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed properly mhm\n[noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole\nAnd there's only a boom if after it's not a dry hole there is an actual uh oil prices that sustain a drilling a and and that's the only reason west Texas is struggling run our oil prices are so far down\nThat there's no boom okay I mean when gas for five dollars a gallon or the boom by you know what I mean but er and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on you know what OPEC does on turning on or off the faucet on the supply demand that's the issue\nAll of that to say I'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all they get just about everything I Know just in a [noise] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and you might answer the question differently than I Would\nBecause you might know more or your family might know more ah oh let me ask you this you have to sell all of them you have to show although it was an all or none\nNo it's not an all or none or whether you're it's it's simply a they're looking at a three million for all the and or or you know obviously one point five perhaps\nOkay so you're just added on how one\nYeah and my biggest concern is a risk yeah and we are not oil people\nYeah I think I don't think I'm asking him as as women I'm ... so you're only talking about selling half\nWere deciding on how much yourself\nOkay All right if I were in your shoes I don't know much about the oil business as if someone asked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table that said three million dollars on it would I go by oil rights with it my answer would quickly be no\nMainly because I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about that\nOkay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would rather buy something else with it that I that I Know a little bit more about like real estate and it's a little bit more predictable in less risk personally okay\nBut that's the way you ask yourself the question if I had three million dollars part of the mill kitchen table would I go go by our rights in West Texas with it if the answer is no then it's time to sell\nFor the same reason I say you know that you wouldn't die ... and ...\nAnd that's that's what I agree with his getting the family to understand that you know what we're afraid the stock market crash\nYeah well it might but I Am I going to say I started getting less rock markets less risk than drilling holes\nYeah we're a hundred percent sure that you don't ... I mean walking around since tells you that you don't have to be all persons to know that now uh so what I Would do a ... the family has to do these are family owned and so you can't just sell like yours off\n... uh no this is I'm I'm helping or my mother and father make it to say\nOh I see so it's a just shut down they can make the decision for the whole thing or not yes All right then if I were in their shoes I Would at least to sell Seventy five percent of it\nOkay I probably would sell at all but on the off chance that they are just dying to be a little bit and they all business and they're scared to death so phone low you know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and uh you know so\nThat that you know if it struck out right after I sold it I regret it the rest of my life you know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty five percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and then let's buy some real estate or by some mutual funds or something that's a whole lot less risk with that I'm definitely not\nSome advisers that have families entire portfolio three million dollar network be caught up in the ...

want to shoot you want to shoot the dog so what you're going to want to do is shove the muzzle into the side or the gut or the leg or the head or whatever you can find a of a dog and pulled the

contact shot with a semi automatic there is an excellent chance of two things one\nIs that you can take the gun out of battery which means you're going to show forward to the slide comes back a little bit and it won't go bang that's when you grab the sound weird if you've never done it before\nYou can with a semi automatic nine forty five it doesn't matter put your thumb on the back of sly push forward pull the trigger it's not going to tell you it's all it's not even gonna hurt it's weird but it does\nAnd then you're going to have to rock the slide because you have just induced a malfunction so you're going to go contact shot push forward or keep the slide for pulled the trigger bank now reach over in Iraq was getting ready to do it again if you have to\nHelp ... unbelievable I never I never\nThought of doing that with the semi ah I well I I was in no way you can practice out of their\nUh yeah there is actually I didn't get to a range that has a greedy people don't means you can see all the gun right into one\nAnd you'll find that if you push to go forward it will come out of battery the slide would go back like ... and it will disengage will not leave a fire series you can either wrap your if your right hand and wrap your left hand over the top of the slide push forward with that and shove it into this dummy\nA and pulled the trigger now besides not going to come back so you now have a malfunction ... rip the slide back just do a malfunction grill\nA or and this is like I say it sounds weird but it works the first time you do you think this is this is

find anybody test to find that Kavanaugh's menace fall down beat him up drunk the last twenty five or Thirty years do you or even beyond that\n\nNext they said he he may have committed perjury if he lied about the people on that count wonder Andrea he lied about what those terms mean if he is committed perjury he is\nGone we need the FBI to look into that we need the FBI look into whether or not he beat people up on jails campus\nAnd we need to we need to really track down this judicial temperament of his why you see the way he acted on our committee hearing on friday he was yelling and

you can go\nAnd it is called\nThe DC circuit court of appeals where Kavanaugh has been serving for years and all you have to do is go there and\nStudy his work and then to the courts prior to that

else like me concerned I mean the FBI leadership many of them are gone but a lot of snow there has done the if level best to square with Donald Trump\nWorking with the intelligence agencies we had

they're the same\nGuy that exonerated Hillary Clinton without even an interview with the same guy that said they've found new questionable emails on the laptop of Carlos danger and in a matter of three days reviewed a hundred thousand of them to find there was nothing there so they can do whatever they're going to do in a day or two if they want to\nBut then what happens if the FBI looks into

evidence\nFor Christine Blasey Ford if they produce no evidence for any other allegation if they cannot produce anything that says Kevin all did it whatever it is other words if this
