Shay is with us in Reno Hi Jay welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave thanks for taking my call today sure what's up\nI'm On the health insurance question for you and I'm hoping you could give me some insight on it we adopted our two children about three years ago\nAnd they came from the foster care system so we don't get a lot of services but one thing we do get is health insurance until they're Eighteen and it's provided through our state Medicaid system\nAnd every year my husband and I kind of go back and forth on whether or not to keep it or to put them on his plan through his employer and we're getting close to that um [noise] time of year to make that decision\nOkay um what would his him or your plans cover the Medicaid is not covering\nWell they've both been healthy thankfully I guess are um you know the thing we always come back to as unknowns of any kind of\nHealth issues that they may have er um any services because even though the Medicaid coverage is crummy you know in a lot of ways a lot of doctors don't take it and it's a basically welfare insurance [laughter] um it has covered their needs up to this point because those kids are healthy and they've had you know minimal minimal\nIncidental freight if they had some kind of a major event that he'll have Medicaid would not do a good job of covering and that his insurance might\nActually it's more the opposite I'm not worried about the major stuff because like we've had to go to the ER for you know my you know a scrape and a bump and they pick up the tab for everything it's more the ongoing care there is um you know it's very hard to find providers who take it there's a bit of a steak than we feel\nA little strange having that kind of coverage given our own financial position you know that our kids are on a\nUm there is a bit of a stigma that oh I don't feel having it so it's just it's just kind of a dilemma we face every year and\nI knew you were you know in November we can make a play or I heard you uh uh you know free food stamps because you are adopted a foster child you know that would feel the same way as what you're saying um\nMm Mm\n\nYou're joining us from er but we're so glad you're with us this is the day Ramsey shop Jackie's with us in Columbia South Carolina Jackie how are you\nDo find the thank you for taking my call sure what's up I Want to know\nIf I coincide a

just got a job about twenty dollars an hour for making about twenty five hours a week\nHe's working twenty hours a week\nYeah [noise] okay what's he doing with the rest of his time really he he he doesn't want to have a job that\nWill cause liquids job because he's been trying to get into this job forever because\nWhat I Would have conflict with his job he's only working twenty hours a week\nRight there on call 'em for\nThis job\nTwenty hours a week or the whole\nWeek twenty hours a week ... ... ...\n... ... just go there and they have a football game and the goal it's Florida again\nNow why would you be on call for football there is no emergency football\n[laughter] he's been trying to get into the TV here and\nI got the part where he's working twenty hours a week and his mother is calling me 'cause she came by his dad gum twenty thousand dollar bill I'd like for him to work another forty hours a week on top of the twenties playing football so she can pay is freaking bills so you're not calling me how would that sound that would sound awesome\nI I Try to tell him that well I I did I Wonder how they can I Do not have to go in the in the late ... thirty ... every\nTime you don't work much\nI have to pay like out in the in the late ... thirty days later he don't work much\nYeah\nThere's a great place to go when you're broke to work so uh what I Would tell him to do is get into financial piece university and get his young budding gear and START I and I do I I mean if I'm you I'm going to be all up on this kid because he's twenty eight years old and he's a slacker\nAnd his momma is calling me you single after his mom's a single lady out here when you're fifty what\nFifty years old and you're having to pay this kid's bills yeah I'm mad at him right now I don't want you to be two and a good loving mama's kind of way I'm not trying to disown him I just want to knock knock on his little head okay\nWell you know and then you you better plan on paying it if that ... doesn't get moving okay right so that you know ball and knock it out and then you just chalk it up to that and but dude I'm telling you ah we're going to have some discussions is he married\nHe let it go okay I'll bet she works forty hours yeah yeah there you go [noise]\nAlright open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Katherine is with us from Portland Maine Hi Katherine how are you\nA thank you I don't care about my budget activity every dollar touch it among baby step to crank protect my expenses for them on a\nProject what I'm going to be paying for that and then sometimes something happens like last month when my car broke down I had to had a tone in repaired and it costs almost five hundred dollar\nDoesn't how often that we really don't have ... do you have your your baby steps one with a thousand dollars right I Do now that would be an emergency that you would use that for\nOkay but that's what I was confused about because the way I handled it was I simply added a new line item to my cat for that item and then reduce the amount that I pay toward get for that month so I get it wrong that will\nBe okay you cash flow did you just ... ... if you can cash flow it that month that's fine I didn't have to come out of the emergency funds so you are paying more than five hundred dollars extra on debt each month\nGood and so you reduced it by five hundred for one month 'cause you got kicked in the kneecap with this thing but usually you're not going to have that month in a month out now there's some things if a if there's a recurring unexpected event it no longer is unexpected\nFor anti you know you don't have anything budgeted for car repairs well that would not work because most cars are going to need some repairing over a period of six months you know they're going to have\nAnything budgeted for car repairs\nYeah I probably would put something in there for that because the ... your budget needs to reflect the real world and the real world is you're going to spend something on that car in a given six month period of time it might be tires it might be maintenance or might be oil change it might be a five hundred dollar toe you know\nBut you're going to spend something on a car in unless you're driving really nice brand new cars you're going to spend something on the car during that time so your budget should reflect reality in that regard\nSo probably gonna have a little bit of a sudden it to be a lot fifty or a hundred bucks or something and let that build up as a sinking fund they call it in the every dollar software or in them on below but I don't care where you build it up but somewhere you build it up and you uh have the money in cash then\nFor your car repair as it comes up and that's an example of something that is recovering so it's no longer unexpected emergencies should be unexpected things\nThings that are are often enough that we can expect them aren't emergencies anymore but you did good yeah you did fine just to cash flow through that emergency you slow down your debt snowball for that month and then you pick back up next month hopefully won't have another one of those and you can really\nBuild it up and go from there so good question and you're doing good keep after Tom is with us in San Francisco Hi Tom welcome to the day Ramsey show\nDo appreciate you're doing a great thing I've been an avid fan for three days now\nCan you monitor lady to we need to gather a long time you and I [laughter]\n[laughter] so question for you so my wife and I we have about three hundred okay and and student debt another hundred and Fifteen and automobile and you know line of credit that type of thing so it's about four Fifteen totally do\nAnd we make a pretty good income shoot at about one twenty annually I met one eighty three hundred come on my question for you is I was a move back to school you can get my master's programs only twenty five okay to feel like that would be a very real our ally on edge\nBut over the last three days are starting to think maybe maybe I shouldn't just want to get your take on that\n... masters in what\n[noise] oh it would be in ... ...\nAnd it would increase your income by more than twenty five K.\n[noise] it would probably be hard to say I'm there would be a winning case and you raise because of the category of jump into mhm\nOkay so you would get back into it would make it back in touch over a year then from that point so that's really nice return I think you can put that in the budget and the reason you can put it in the budget as you make so stinking much money\nNow you live in a very expensive area granted it's crazy expensive but I didn't want to live in a really rough ... yeah but you guys are really you're really ...\nAnd ...\nAnd so I mean how quick can we pay off four hundred well we can pay off four hundred and two years if we do it in two hundred a year that you'd be living on a hundred I'm not sure you can do that after taxes in your area so you probably got a three year and get out of debt plan\nBut you know vacations you don't need to see the inside of a restaurant and don't you dare tell me about buying anything else you bought enough for a while you need that you need to live like people that make a hundred people that make three hundred and get this debt ceiling\nAnd in the process of doing that can you believe\nTwenty grand a week I ran into the budget sure\nSure delays you buy\nThis is a\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make\nCarefully select what it is you want to study and that it makes your eyes light up when you talk about it you kind of smile down inside when you talk about doing this\nThing whatever the thing is okay you know once you've selected that then you decide how to study it if it's a four year degree if it's a two year vote tech degree\nOr am I going to go to a community college for two years and then go and those credits all transfer and then go to a regular school I mean for your school for two years to finish up or that kind of a thing\nCommunity college is a lot less expensive and you can get your basics out of the way for the first two years for a four year degree if you want to\nStart the second thing once you've determined what you want to do and how you're going to do it\nThen the second thing you do is college cost is the number one cause of student loan debt\nAnd what I mean is that you can buy a Bentley or you can buy a huge pickup truck both our transportation but one is several hundred thousand dollars and one is just a few hundred dollars\nBut both of you know the mall\nAnd and so if you if you don't have any money and you're saving up you can't afford a Bentley you can't afford to go to a super expensive college and there's nothing wrong with that by the way I didn't go to a super expensive college so you go to an end state school\nThere in Florida you go to University of Florida Gainesville or you go to University of central Florida right there in Orlando a wonderful yeah one of ... wonderful both of them in state tuition not that expensive and uh that's thing one your college selection\nAs at the least expensive college that will help you get the degree that you need to get is what you need to aim at\nWith rare exceptions and you're not going out of state and you're not going super expensive private the second thing is then you start looking for scholarships and you make a scholarship hunting your full time job\nOr an after school job that kind of a thing and you start applying for and filling out the scholarship forms and riding the essays and\nYou'd probably ask for a thousand scholarships and you'll probably get turned down for nine hundred and fifty of them but if you get fifty one thousand dollar scholarship she just went to school free did\nThat'd be pretty cool not a bad part time job the third thing is planning on working\nA lot while you are in school don't borrow money so that you don't have to work work\nAnd get good jobs jobs that pay a lot dog walking cutting grass jobs people don't want to do what they pay a lot to do I'm not talking about minimum wage crap and if you're going to live on campus go ahead and be an R. A. B. a residential advisor or written that's one where they call it what is in RA how it is it\nIs a resident about okay so there you know the the babysitter in the dorm okay and you get free dorm for doing that and sometimes free tuition for doing that and sometimes free tuition free dorm and pay for doing that she'll be NRA if you're going to live on campus\nOr work in the cafeteria get free food do you live on campus if you can get a job working for the university the tuition might be completely free\nAnd that might be different to something to look at it so that's the kind of stuff you look at but figure out where you're going what the steps are to get their figure out the cheapest way to get their figure out scholarships to somebody pays you to get there and then plan on working your butt\nOff and those things will get you through school completely debt free in this day and time and it can be done Alex is with us in Baltimore hey Alex welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nAnd Mr Ramsey how are you a thank you for everything that you do thank you a check on that can be a call and I you know that one I Am debt free I'm On baby step three I got five months saved up two months ago are at my fix my but here's my question and I work full time in a retail establishment\nAnd I have a small\nA job that I find myself on the fire\nOn at that point in the retail establishment where I think it's time for me to stay out of here and we'll start my\nFocused towards my my own personal business mhm one of those should I you can't shut you went by really use my emergency fund to help me through that I was growing pains of being full time with my saw a side job\nNo it's not an emergency um\nYou're creating an emergency by leaving the job too soon I don't blame you from one to leave and we wanted to do your own thing I Want you to do that too but once you get out and get your side business making more money you're going to work anymore and you may have to just take fewer hours at the a retail thing and back your hours down that may mean you moved to a different retail job I don't know but\nToday you're not making enough money on the side job or you wouldn't have asked that question\nWell that's true much money you make it on the side but a ...\nNearly I'm probably a call now about twice\nWhat was your best month over a thousand four thousand one was a ah probably about seven months\nAgo and you do that again\nI doubt I Wish you know you gotta gotta get there now what are you making on the retail gig\nA free a month you know so yeah I mean you need to have you need to have a steady three thousand\nBut do you make it on the retail gig\nA three month you know so yeah you need to have you need to have a steady three thousand a month and I think you can get their real close much June I'm an dial in the side gig\nAnd get it we're steady so that you're not taking such a big risk then you wouldn't have when you can live on the three among all three of them do that just your budget to do that and then make your job you're there man [noise]\nYou guys hear me say all the time that if you live like no one else later you can live and give like no one else I'm so excited to introduce our brand new book every day millionaires how ordinary people built extraordinary wealth and how you can to\nWritten by number one national best selling author Kris Hogan his book is based on the largest study ever done what ten\nThousand millionaires and the results will shock you you will learn the real truth about what it takes to become a millionaire\nIt doesn't matter where you came from it matters where you're going today you can pre order everyday millionaires for only twenty dollars and get over fifty dollars and free bonus items the bonus items include the everyday millionaires audio book any book\nVideo lesson for me called it's okay to be wealthy and video a lesson from ... called how to retire inspired pre order everyday millionaires Dave Ramsey dot com or call us at AAA twenty two piece\n\nThat fifty two percent of Americans have less than ten thousand dollars saved for retirement [noise] if you're in that majority retirement may sound like a hopeless situation but it doesn't have to be my name is ...\nAnd I want to help you harbor pass your dream retirement [noise] we have to start thinking that retirement begins at some magical age like sixty five or Seventy retirement begins when you have enough money to enjoy the lifestyle you dream about\nIt's going to take more than a dream do\nYou have to get serious about making a plan I created an assessment tools and helps you know what you need to do to reach your dream return get your free assessment at ... dot com [noise] what are your goal is to live comfortably traveled the world or have enough\nMoney to help grandkids with college and to be able to get like crazy you can reach the number you mean it just takes a point ...

else going on for me\nAnd I'm twenty six I've got two kids I'd like to stay home um but I Know I Want to work and I want to help out and I and I feel like I locked myself and I have no idea where to even start to find my interests are my strength yeah\nWell I understand that you feel that way but that is an absolute wiser you have to acknowledge the fact that that's just a lack of confidence there's some self doubt it's creeping because you've been at home for a while\nAnd here's another reality reality is that right now to Katie in America we have more jobs that are available than there are people who are unemployed it is a fantastic job market even for stay at home moms meaning you want to stay home but work from the home\n[noise] local back America\nYou're joining the conversation here on the day Ramsey show on June Coleman joined in Studio by Christie right near Ramsey personalities worry there'll be this hour with your business or your career that's what we're taking a shower come on come on Tripoli eight to five five two to five that's AAA\nEight to five five two to five and we're going to go to Patricia who's on the line in Tampa, Florida how can we all\nI Do think that they might call jerk I finally so [laughter]\nYeah ... ... loan eleven has um I'd love to open a yoga studio that function without wellness center ourselves off or\nNot this little God but financial colds and other things to ... or physical mental and emotional health\nBut I think about that wasn't my house buying that he'll play you know where I live up here and it will be the wellness center like concern that is that\nWill there be some sort of liability\nWell go ahead you\nKnow like if someone wants to get hurt a lot I Know that could apply for the and they said go out there if I were to go so they will go after the fitness but if I Lived in the same building with that there but I don't know I'm Wondering if that would be an issue\nYou've got a couple of things going on here put chicken I Want to own a a been a little bit him on each of them first of all I'm probably gonna be state specific so you definitely need to look at the laws in your state in any type of regulations\nI'm you're gonna have liabilities regardless whether it's a stand alone studio or it's where you left your you're going to have liability if somebody gets hurt and you need to know what those are and to protect yourself with insurance um professional insurance products based insurance if you have a product that type of things you want to look into that\nBut I Do just want to challenge you and one thing for ticket I Love your idea I Love the idea of a wellness center I Love the idea that you're helping people but here that are traditionally encourage people to do because you don't currently have yoga studio and you don't have the idea of validated\nI Want to challenge you to start a little bit smaller in a little sooner so I'll give you an example\nWhere is there a wellness center community center yoga studio ... studio somewhere where you could start your business sub ... and they're off hours builds your brand builder demand you have no risk no overhead no upfront costs\nAnd you're able to validate your idea until the business justified you getting your own space be that a duplex that you have about or\nYour own sand on space I'll give an example there are a lot of churches that will operate when they're getting started out of like elementary school the elementary school right next door household they don't have to go on Sundays so they rented out to a church that use it on Sunday and it's just a great deal to win when it's additional revenue\nThe elementary school right next to our house so they don't have to go on Sundays so they rented out to a church that use it on Sunday and it's just a great deal to win when it's additional revenue for the school the church has a place to go without having to afford a whole building seven days a week when they can't justify it\nAnd I've seen a lot of businesses do that so I don't think your ideas about an hour just towns you just start smaller in sooner on a lower risk level lower cost level and validate your idea and bill does relationship village of brand in your demand\nGet that going and then when you're ready to have your own studio it's the next logical step it doesn't feel like a terrifyingly so you definitely look into laws and regulations for liability but also when you think about your space before you make that big commitment\n[noise] Patricia are you a lot of phone are you working full time right now\nRight and that was ... I work fulltime I write it on our on our on our tiny nano civil and back from Ireland to share that way I'm making more money but you know how it goes like this if as well\nYeah I well I ... you can I just wanted to know that fact because this this that piece of information please beautifully knew what you're saying\nShe's going to have to do this on the side anyway she's not in a position to open up anything I don't think you were trying to go round open it um I I just want to see maybe do a little bit of yoga for some people maybe two or three months when I see if you can get a small group to pay you\nBecause it's everything you just said but it allows you to tiptoe into it or the nurse practitioner thing that's going to school to get that will make more money I Love that too can allow her to cash flow have more cash piled on when it's time to to operate so I mean you you nailed it there I I just think ... you know don't rush into the\nWell and the other thing I Want to call out for anyone listening right now that has a service based business and like a yoga studio ... you have a tendency to think that the studio is the business it's not if you are and what you can go anywhere you can go to people's houses you can go to the park outside they're coming and paying for you just don't feel like you have to have a location\nBefore you can start your business because you are the business so you can start tomorrow but you can out of your living room if you want to learn on the street\nAnd by the way you should go ahead\nTotally yeah yeah don't wait for the studio studio is not the business you are the business point people don't care I Know they don't ... enjoy it to come in for you they're not counting for the building\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five triple eight to five five two to five ... Coleman crispy rice sitting in for Dave Ramsey this hour take your calls about your business your business idea or a career career change career question let's go to bill is on the line and Detroit Michigan bill how can we'll\nHead of the cross it out or to get a few good things are calling how can we'll\nHope I can only achieve field for about Twenty years and to the point it really hasn't been I haven't progress as far like clear as I originally\nHoped and wish that was a long story short is I'm back in January wife and I went through a pie view and as we're about to a baby steps Ron based up to right now\nGoing through some of our stuff together perhaps they'll go on a we came and choose some old horror movie a fish from stuff that she had gotten from a bad\nUh when he died um and\nThrough all the things we found you know we had a lot of all eight millimeters old VHS of stuff and it's like okay we have all this stuff um I started to ... and I really found a passion for that that I haven't had in a few for quite a while and I'm thinking okay this sounds like\nSomething I could turn into a great business and love doing going forward\nLooking at this point that\nBill let me interrupt what is the bit to get right to what is the business with the middle of me or what is the business\nI'm converting legacy formats like even though Mader VHS wide pills law that uh could digital content and properly preserve them\nOkay and so what's your question for us then\nUm we bought a question I have is just um how to get started um I definitely want to get started and I just want to make sure I'm stepping through a a properly and ... the um\n... tell you what Bill question\nBill ... he's ready to go she can cause we only have a little bit of time here I Want to be able to get to your your solution\nWe want to make sure we might help you out here's the thing about the great news and it's\nA when you were entering a space where there's already people doing what you want to do it means the ideas prevent so you're not doing something that's never been done before there are actually businesses that have similar type services what you didn't know is yes you're solving a problem and if you're solving a problem it's a viable business idea\nYou just have to find people that have that problem that had the eight millimeters they want to preserve on and you're going to learn how who that person is you're going to go after them and build a business for them to you're going to price for them you're going to create marketing language that speak to them right where they are the best part about this deal as\nYou know the idea is valid because it's been done before what you're going to do is you're going to build your business and you're gonna do it better and you're going to serve your customers and they're gonna want to come to you because you make a unique space for yourself\nIn that market a bill I Know my book is for women but I'm going to send it to you men read it all the time to business principles are the same and it gives you plan to take that idea to market I Hope it helps and we'll get we'll send you finish your wind is really\nGreat plans to follow it and and here's this thing a ... a lot of bills out there you said something that's interesting he finds these old things and you realize way out this\nAnd and you are giving him the steps the book is going to walk into it but I wanted to say when they try it just tested on this and all of the last call here's why some passion should be ...\nItalian things when you turn it into the ...\nYou made a great point other people are doing this he just got to find people that are willing to pay him to do it and keep paying him into others have you need this does me tell you about bill he's got to start really small but start right away stop thinking about it stopped getting away I mean just to learn a lot of searches doing triple eight eight to five\nFive two to five coming up more of your questions about career starting a business [noise] don't go anywhere just as\n\nHeard me talk about ideas for years and how it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I run across some numbers that even surprised me and shows the real nightmare that people go through when they become a victim of the sixteen million victims of identity theft last year yes sixteen million\nI'm going to say one quick thing let you go here's the deal hang on until the hubby gets back to you know what I mean you got to hang on and you can do it here we are in October first years coming right now you have to do it so I think that motivation just hang in there and in Christ is going to we're we'll talk about the plan to get their\nQuick quick question Katie that contract jobs you're doing in addition to the fulltime salary job or do something you're running independently already or do they go through the main company was paying your salary\nSo there are different companies okay I'd like to see a few of them are kind of actually my own projects I work on out here in Minnesota the other one is there a company I used to work four years ago that contract work for\nPerfect I don't have that salary yeah\nThe the reason I'm asking is because when you go out on your own even if it's just getting that first client or two that can be the scariest part to validate can I Do it on my own and can I make the sale and can run this whole thing without having a boss that kind of back me and you're already doing it and that's why I'm so excited in Haiti because you're just going to do more\nOf what you're already doing a little bit and just like Ken that\nYou've got this light at the end the tunnel when you're going to start to increase your family household income in other ways to your husband\nBut in the meantime if you want to spend the next two to three months building up the demand that client the relationship even just taking people to coffee starting together interests of other independent projects you could run on your own that could run through this new architecture firm that you're going to run as an independent person\nYou're building it up and of course it will be crazy for a season because you're getting more and more demand but then\nWhen you decide to leave your fulltime job it the next logical step where the business can support you the income is they are of course that's only going to help and your husband had income so you're all ready I Would say twenty to thirty percent down the path of doing this you're starting from scratch or not like\nI have full time job and I want to do this totally different thing how do I started out\nYou're already doing it you already have clients you're working with I just want you to do more of that and then the next few months as you build that up that will start to ramp up as her husband's income comes in and it looks like first of the year you probably should be able to comfortably leisure Labor Day job\nAnd it comes down to a form of the you gotta work days maybe step stays baby steps on the dream so when you put enough money aside plus decide businesses there and then that's how you get to that number where you can step aside into Christie's point does not have to be a ... jump right that should be a nice move and it just takes a little bit of time and patience lays on her way the light\nAt the end of the tunnels and important point can cause so many people still like how can I have seen this well you're not until January when you've that light of the total you know this is the first season them to put my head down for a season them and have the rewards it's worth it things are\nAll right let's go to ray real quick in Orlando, Florida re how can we say\nHey how
