[noise]\nJason's with us in Detroit Michigan Jason welcome to the day Ramsey show\nDave how're you doing today better than I deserve what's up\nUh we'll just wanted to give you all back story my uh my wife and I just moved from Illinois Michigan a kind of be closer to all her family up here so are you feeling\nOh I just wanted to give you a little back story my uh my wife and I just moved from Illinois to Michigan a kind of be closer to all her family up here so ah you feel a place but I kind of getting used to everything\nBut uh I'm currently unemployed I was just like go up in the past couple of months and I'm looking for a job now I I'm an accountant and my life as a teacher she teaches special education [noise] um so she currently has a job\nUm my question is we are living with her parents [noise] um for the time being until probably maybe next summer so until they can buy on house\nUm we've got about eleven thousand dollars of student debt left between both of us and we've got about that it that much in our bank account right now\nI'm I wasn't sure obviously once they find a job if the best strategy would be to try to knock that get out as soon as possible and then from there started to stay for a house on what my wife kind of wants to do is just put everything we can\nToward a down payment to try to you know uh hopefully not pay for your mind get close to that twenty percent of course I didn't know what your take was in I mean it seems like we should still be able to have some sort of decent downpayment either way I just didn't know how you would feel about that\nOkay I don't recommend that people buy a home when they're broke\nBecause he'll make your broker that's why they call a mortgage brokers\nHome is not a blessing when you're broke its first and when you have debt and do not have an emergency fund you're broke\nBy definition so um my advice to folks has always been and it's not real popular advice and your wife's not gonna like it so you all might not do it\nBut my my strong advice to you is to pay off the debt\nAnd save an emergency phone up three to six months of expenses above that save your down payment and then by and when you buy a home and when you move in the house and there's ten thousand dollar stealing your emergency fund after you move in and you know payments but the house payment that houses a blessing\nThis is a day Ramsey show glad you're with us and\nThe break I was talking with Sharon in Sarasota, Florida\nAnd a sixty eight years or\nTwenty years ago they bought a universal life policy which is a type of cash value policy a portion of your premium folks when you're having universal policy goes to pay the insurance costs\nAnd the insurance is cost goes up every single year because it's based on annual renewable term rage\nAnd so more and more is going to insurance cost us the policy gets older less and less is going to the investment\nTo the point that they they cross the line a few years ago and contacted Sharon and her husband and said oh now the premium that you're paying one hundred percent of it won't cover the insurance costs so now if you want to keep the insurance not only is zero going to investments\nBut now even more has to be paid to keep the insurance active and that's how far we got in the discussion\nIs what I just said all correct Sharon yeah yeah okay and what is going to face amount of this policy eighty thousand eighty thousand dollars and how much money do you all have\nHow much money do we have from\nYou how much you and your for one k.'s and you're now there are always\nWhen we did have a retirement account how much they pay total eighty four thousand ...\nUm\nWe have a concussion dollar right in the fight we our debt free or how to pay for good you know kind of like\nSo you don't have that how much is on our cash value is in this\nHow about you know OK so and you have a pension plans as well ... yeah okay\nAnd so you're living on Social Security and eighty thousand dollars worth of for my husband\nStill works his he um have thirty thousand in income mhm and they very than Twenty one thousand in Russia okay and that at all I I don't know I\nGot you in the face of amount of this policy you said was eighty thousand dollars\nYeah okay we did look into turning Sharon for him but number one it's really a lot like I said but number two he has battled cancer a couple of times yeah non Hodgkin's lymphoma and\nSo basically you know it was like yeah very difficult very difficult but we don't know we we can lower the death benefit\nSo what is the premium how much is that a year\nIf I don't know how much it having a month yeah OK\nSo eight hundred a year and you make thirty six thousand dollars a year\n[noise] um\nWell here's here's the equation here's the way it works in your mind okay what's the purpose of this is to give you an extra eighty thousand dollars\nIf he dies before you do okay and so is that worth a hundred bucks at this stage it's there's no investment value whatsoever so we're not going to the only question is you know you you don't have a huge nest egg uh\nIt's there's no investment value whatsoever so we're not the only question is you know you you don't have a huge nest egg a you you've got a small mistake and the show to double it basically if he were to die would be very helpful\nMhm and so keeping the insurance sounds really good with that in mind\nIf they would only last three or four years anyway and they sent me want to hear me\nOkay and they're going to make you stop anyway they're going to pull the plug that oh yeah okay and at that point you would catch it out and whatever cash value isn't there a ban\nOn [laughter] I have met would like to get it out now\nYou know our way to get it out no way to get out now as close a policy down right which ... which which means that you would you know if he passes away you'd have the four oh one K. money paid for house and be living on Social Security right\nYeah but you probably can make it 'cause I gotta feeling you guys are frugal people oh yeah and so you probably could make it on that but it's not going to be a dream come true um\n[noise] so they have given you notice that at I'm sixty two are are are I'm sure are Seventy three or whatever Seventy years old they're going to shut the policy down regardless\nYeah well I ... well no I guess if we can pay enough that it would be over two hundred a month ago I can write\nOr we we could lower their death benefiting and keep it going I don't know if we could do that because what I wanted to go I went on to cash it out of them are we doing nothing\nYeah there there's not a great answer OK I asked him and hauling a little bit I'm trying to think through it um\nAh my tendency is an eight hundred bucks a year right now to keep it for a while okay I'm Seventy seven dollars a month even if you use the cash value you can have the cash value and begin to pay the premium\n... and ... you know it's going to do it's going to use up some of that eight thousand dollars I'm probably going to do that\nAnd let the eight thousand dollars pay the premiums starting today and I'm probably going to leave it in place a couple of years when it starts being two hundred a month instead of Seventy seven months at that point I'm probably going to join his tribe and say let's cash it out and close it down\nBut I don't think it's going to make sense to keep this long for a long long time we're probably gonna keep a couple more years houses health\nBut then I was his health how uh the first time I went to the fake cancer free for five years and that kind of a cancer free for two years good\nSo I mean they go and get a ... and every every six months I saw the matrix not coming back of a of a\nGood good I'm Glad to hear that ... ... ... ... I'm gonna I'm gonna let the a cash value pay the premiums for the next two years and keep it open if a ... and I'm going to check on his health at that time let's say that he's got another episode with cancer going of that time then you pay the premium no matter what it costs\nAnd you keep it open if he if he's the cancers come back at any stage right to keep you keep the thing open at that point but if he's doing really really good and everything's clean and two years from now you haven't seen a spot nothing's no problems anywhere I'm I'm probably drop and at that point\nOkay that makes sense to\nMe it wouldn't it wouldn't be insured so\nYeah you know but um but but you're also not paying you know three thousand two thousand dollars a year which is what is going to be at that point yeah which is starting to be ridiculous with that kind of money you could throw money into a investments and start having some money\nAnd uh but but at this stage I I I'm I'm hesitant to cancel it it's it's obviously a bad policy so I'll be sitting in a bad thing but it's your only option you're stuck with this now that makes it hard to discuss it hard to think about but I'm\nGoing to hold it two years the cash value pay it at the end of that time if he's healthy or instill cancer free I'm dropping it\nOtherwise I'm going to keep it if there's if he's got a health issue at that time so good question thank you for calling in and I'm Sorry you had this problem\nFolks you hear me yell and scream about cash value life insurance for life life insurance universal library but life is rip off you just\nExperienced it you just experienced the back end\nWhat happens if you buy one of those pieces of crap policy\nAnd you're sixty eight years old this is what happens is because the money they put into that stupid but policy will be three hundred grand right now in mutual funds if they put it into that in a good investment instead of getting ripped off by this insurance company\nAnd if she was sitting there were three hundred grand plus the other four one K. I'd have about four hundred thousand bucks plus\nTheir house is paid for she wouldn't even called me\nBut instead guess who's fat sassy instead of her insurance company\nSo when your whole life agent says I don't really agree with Dave Ramsey because your whole life I just trying to rip you off\nThat's why your whole life agency and that and there's only two kinds of whole life agents ignorant and crooked because if you understand these numbers and that story right there and then you still sell this stuff that makes you crooked\nYou ought to be ashamed of yourself if you don't understand these numbers and you're still selling their stuff that makes you ignorant\nAnd you shouldn't be selling this stuff and by the way folks in case you didn't know you'll get screwed up way more often by an enthusiast enthusiastic ignoramus than you will by a con artist\nSo most of the people out there selling this crap are enthusiastic ignoramus as they're not actual con artists smoke of Charlie show me this region enthusiastic ignoramus\nThat's all uncle Charlie we just nailed him right there\n'cause he's probably not a crook if he'd actually sat down and looked and realize that sharing your if your friend if shares brand sold her that [noise]\nHe's not afraid of my friends like that you don't need enemies [noise]\nYou know good at three hundred grand and mutual funds easy for them what they dumped into this\nProduct\nAlive life insurance the payday lender or the middle class\nAggravates me this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nHey folks let's talk about finding a ride home for your family the amount of new homes built continues to trend upward year after year\nSo you've changed your family tree have injured\nI don't know anything other than they've been born into I'd never having a credit card which is pretty awesome\nIt was very awesome so proud of you guys did you have more cheerleaders or more detractors as you went along\n[laughter] actually talking about that a little bit earlier than that but my parents are very proud and then you know does Geron is on you know some other people oh we got to poke fun a little bay or ... or something and basically now my friends or anything like that it's they don't they don't say anything now\nI guess not yeah you're sitting there with a paid for house or shut up yeah that's pretty cool ... very neat\nWell well done guys very well done what do you think will be the key to getting out of that is\n[noise] being diligent went there and stay on track\nYeah even when you do any screw up I mean I can be the one to be the most is all my idea but when I Want something or I like stuff so [laughter] I always like the most expensive thing\nAnd neither one of the biggest fuss about waiting or you know being patient ... hardest thing\nNo well you did it for seven and a half years you lived like no one else now you can live in New like no one else here and just great shape congrats guys\nWho well we've got a copy of Chris Hogan to retire inspired book for your number one bestseller we want that to be your next chapter in your story and speaking of ... just make sure you're listening to his broadcast because that'll keep you moving in the right direction here and\nHad you off in the millionaire land and be outrageously generous along the way okay\nThat's the only who\nAre I Robert analysis in Hartford, Connecticut two hundred and sixty one thousand dollars paid off that's their house and everything but I was thirty two years old seven and a half years it took them making eighty to two hundred a year counted down let's zero three scream\nBoy those go [noise]\nThen you guys very very\nWell done I Love it\nSarah is with us in Ann Arbor Michigan and Sarah how are you\nI'm great things for taking my call they sure what's up\n[noise] so I had a question about the movement tree that\nFinal parts of the baby steps we currently are added that um [noise] we are we in our emergency fund that fully funded are currently cash rolling two kids in college and um so it's about retirement versus our house pathway currently oh about ... I'm Seventy eight thousand dollars on our home\nGood and what's your household income\nUh just under two hundred thousand a year from them and how much is college on our kids are about forty thousand dollars a year right now for the two of them okay good good how\nAre all doing all of that so my question as they currently have about seven hundred and twenty thousand dollars and our retirement accounts from\nMy husband's company doesn't match that we do Fifteen Percent not a problem mhm my company I'm very blessed with 'em I invest five percent may give me ten mhm [noise] so that's the fifteenth so my question is do I find a different way to invest that other Fifteen Percent or the other ten percent to make mine a Fifteen\nOr do we put that extra it's about three hundred and eighty dollars a month towards our mortgage\nIt's four thousand dollars a year doing much better\nWhen I just saw the sure well I mean you know you're acting like that makes a dent in your mortgage it doesn't\nMake much better day in my retirement account and you know\nSo I I Want you to put at maybe step for Fifteen Percent of your household income you put Fifteen Percent of your household income in retirement it doesn't sound like you're doing that right now\nNo I haven't been 'cause I've only oh I'm I'm In the in our interesting little thing is I put in five and they put it in a timely amazing match you\nKnow wonderful man I Love the match we're not going to lose the match we're going to do ten percent somewhere else like you said in Roth IRAs we can do it during the ... have you got good options if it's raw four one K. particularly I Would do that but I I I Will be putting Fifteen Percent of my income away in return to the point is you're going to pay off his house\nAnyway right ... really the exact same speed\nBecause for a thousand dollars is what's going to get Seventy eight thousand dollars paid off\nWhat's going to get certainly doesn't always paid off when you got to concentrate on that when you get a little bit of a bonus a tiny little inheritance or you just squeeze the money out of your budget but in this three hundred dollar deal here is not\nThat that doesn't move the needle towards getting house paid off the house is going to get paid off 'cause you buys you guys have been concentrating and focusing in probably what's going to happen is when kids would get kids off a role you probably just go vision of the house in that year cause that forty you'll be down to about forty by then the next year you'll just knock it out so\nUm you're fine you're doing really good obviously\nI mean you're doing really really good overall but I'm going to do in person you\nFifteen Percent ... percent of the present it in the time\nThat's your baby step for five your cash flowing sixes and everything else we can find reasonably within the budget\nOne question I get asked all the time is do I need life insurance listen the whole point of life insurance was to replace your income for someone who counts on you so if you have a spouse or you have kids yes you need term life insurance\nIs the only way to protect them until you're out of debt and the build up
