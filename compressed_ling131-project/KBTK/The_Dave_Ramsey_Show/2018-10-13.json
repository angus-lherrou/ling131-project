you're rebuilding your overall life\nAnd uh that's the stuff you're hearing me teach every day that's get on a written plan of budget\nOr avoid that build up an emergency fund and then begin investing long term um and as you're able to get out on your own again a medically and financially you will do that to re establish yourself as a you know a single young twenty eight year old guy that doesn't live at home or no shame in that game right now\nBut a long term you'll want to be out right just like you want to have the dignity of your whole life\nUh so that's a cool thing uh but you know the

hundred dollar bill that there are are from David take family hired for a friend of mine like very little that thousands of dollars that works for getting mhm\nThat I have to pay taxes on that end of the electric funding like true\nThat is true that is not giving us except on a mortgage on your home is a taxable income and they likely will send you a ten Ninety nine for the amount that day for gays oh okay so what's your household income\n[noise] um [noise] it it's very very ... about how about forty five thousand is here\nOkay let's say let's say you're out and ... percent tax bracket as an example okay let's pretend if you were in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness that didn't cost you a thousand dollars and only costs you two hundred dollars\nRight and so it's still a good deal but you're going yeah\nYour I have about two hundred dollars per thousand so that is forgiven that'll hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you\nIf they don't you have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that if they follow through on that but at the end the larger the forgiveness is the more likely they will follow through with a ten Ninety nine\nAnd send you that but as you get that then you will do the taxes so\nYeah I'd I'd get ready for some taxes at tax time that I'm by April ... you know that you may have in in addition to that now if you had a large returning coming because you're over withholding\nWell in that case so you're just going to lower your return because you need to change your withholding

and miners\nHow often should we have these meetings and do we share specific dollar amounts with every one or just share with each individual what will affect them\nUm\nAnnually would be you're meeting and I only share with people who are emotionally mature enough to handle the numbers I don't tell a four year old that you're worth ten million dollars because they will go to kindergarten and tell it\nOkay and they're not emotionally capable of handling that information our children in our case did not know\nOur wealth as a matter of fact when we finally did on vale it and they were in their early twenties\nIt was shocking to them because they were raised like regular people but\nHad a lot of wealth in the background\nAnd um so I didn't want to mess up their childhood by them making assumptions about things I didn't need to make assumptions about but then as we presented to them it was presented as a responsibility\nNot I will do we hit the lottery as for me in my house we sort of more\nMeaning that you don't know anything you're just managing for God\nAnd that takes a little of the ... who all of it\nSo they need to be emotionally immature or sister with them and we do it about once a year [noise] this is the day Ramsey show\nIt's time to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any money on the table one of the biggest expenses as your mortgage payment I recommend the quick Churchill checkup and just five minutes our friends at Churchill mortgage can tell you if\nLike I said it was it was God just

there's\nThere had it had to be pretty bumpy yeah or was it was hard to trust her right\nShe spent her whole life living this way with this chaos with money and in debt and and I did it take you to trust her\nIt probably took a year or so really to to see that hey this is she's she's I'm seeing the action not just the words right\nMore I mean that's a hundred percent but I mean probably within a few weeks you kind of how to raise your eyebrow and go wow she's really doing this when you really had to see that that go a little bit a glimpse of alright alright or is it grew yeah trust grew over

line of credit is an approved alone\nThat you take out only when you would want to\nKnow where you could get pre approved and have a\nLien against your house for a certain amount of money and that's a line of credit home equity line of credit means you're pledged your house for that line of credit\nUm and this is a method of getting a second mortgage on your home basically a show a is it worth having or should I avoid it will die and we tell folks to avoid that\nWe try to take the other way we want you to get rid of your heat lock your home equity line of credit if you have one once you get reverse mortgage if you have one we want you to get out of debt because when you don't have any payment you know what your house money\nThe bar or a slave to the lenders so now we don't recommend home equity lines of credit and bar Paul is on Facebook is there a mileage limit your use as a rule of thumb one buying a used car\nUm\nWhat I'm trying to determine is is the core worn out to the point it's going to give me\nSo the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is the more the miles would affect it\nIn other words a hundred thousand miles dodge neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes\nLike one is used up and the other one is just getting started\nAt that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point\nI don't even know they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay it's not called smart anymore so I just give you that example so no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built that say a higher in nicer vehicle uh they're typically well bill I mean again Honda Lexus or Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac um\nThe larger body Ford products forge building a great product a truck\nA Chevy Truck afford truck with a hundred thousand miles on that one thing you think about that\nAh it's got easily another hundred in it may be another three hundred and it depends on how you took care of it and what you were driving in that kind of thing\nUm but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again though how depends on your budget and how nice of car you want obviously the least miles or the last year's car I bought was a raptor at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought it I drove until I got about sixty or know got got about fifty something on it and um\nSo it was a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day and um\nSo you know you just you're looking at your situation to what is the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\nThe I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more than ... miles would have a negative effect on it\nUm because I'm just I'm just really don't know how to address I'm looking for is dependability and how much life is left and it was so cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how're you\nHey they take them off traumatic what's up\nI'm Seventeen years on the high court emir I've got about three thousand dollars in my family to count out donating shut eye on that idea of what China and\nYou're going to college\nHere I mean the college with a pilot program in St Louis and olive tree\nOkay so you're only going to do two years\nAnd years and then ending on how the program ... maybe ... service that type of a charity and I keep her them at the community college of either and you write out in our first\nYeah you know I Will be true if you get some search someone certifications and stuff and not the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that\nOkay so that's what you want to do you won't be a programmer or you want to be an hour or whatever Mm [laughter] okay uh and the community college is paid for\nAs long as you keep an eye plus yeah um you can invest it and here's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment a mutual fund\nLike on a scale of one to pin a nine point nine finish college and all your education was he wrote that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money\nTo finish your schooling and that's much much you dust and as a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\nField of study that you can you know really make some good money and and the you know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um you know you're the best investment we can make\nMuch better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds a you know maybe I'll talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account to stage\nA with this amount of money in your situation because again my main goal for you is your friend is for you to get your degree in your field of study\nWhether it's a two year whether it's certifications and the ... tech field or or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools in your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to go live your dream without any that\nAnd that three thousand dollar spent on that is more important than than the mutual fund so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route\n[noise] if you need to thanks for calling open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago Hi Mike how are you\nI'm Greg Davis it's an honor to speak with you\nYou too sir what's up in your world\nMy wife and I are currently on baby step forward in time for retirement and we're using the excess our budget to pay off our mortgage early cool and we're both teachers and the state run pension take nine percent of our growth take home pay our dilemma is when we say an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that nine percent that we already contribute\nWe don't have much left over from August coloration\nSo when we say the thicker than we're able to save a lot for a mortgage to tolerate so is it okay to do that or him recommend taking their twenty four\nPercent now they mandatory amount that you're putting in are you ... are you vested in that is that uh uh you're choosing an investment for that or as a pension\nGet the answer no options\nYeah it's it's mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty seven or okay uh and it's nine percent nine percent\nYeah okay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct\nCorrect guy I probably would split the difference because I don't like the pension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run\nThrough its horribly run state and now we're better than all those guys [laughter] uh yeah no thank you so uh but what I count some of it yeah some of it I'm not going to count it as a whole nine what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we got us before then that means we need to put in ten percent\nRight you got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood as I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere it'd be there\nYou know so um that that that's the truth and you know that show a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit or so and just round numbers let's put it in ten percent instead of putting in Fifteen Percent on top\nOr something like that not only celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but it you know it's a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction so I'm\nYou know go do it\nSo that's that's what I Would go back it off a little bit\nAppreciate your joining us this is that I ...

lot of things that were left unsaid and I thought I had a even the playing field because there was very unfair to judge now I can very nicely if they just this habit or it was a very unfair circulation though I\nEven the playing field that once I did that it started just outgrow it was very very unfairly\nThis is exactly what any prosecutor wouldn't do and what fearless Republicans one they have done during the hearings\nHow'd you get home I don't remember well how did you get to the house I don't remember well where was the place that this happened to you I don't remember how many

accepted a piece an excerpt from Adolf Hitler's mind comp read too old to have terms that would be buzz words and knee jerk reaction causes to them and they ended up falling forward left\nHook line

insanity\nAnd so they have prepared a series of hoax essays and papers and presented for peer review journals of higher learning on the academy\nThere obvious hoax estate anybody who knows anything about the origins of the papers that serve as the basis in this case mine calm\nBut this group of women accepted an essay right out of mind comp with just a couple or three words are terms changed to

what I'm seeing out here what do you think what happened to the Democrats in the media if instead of a blue wave if there was a red I mean what do you think actually what happened do you think they
