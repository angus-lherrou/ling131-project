Sean here's got Iraq there was one in two thousand and six year we actually lost the house he beat Tammy Duckworth now us a senator from the state of Illinois he beat her in that election Peter Roskam knows how to win so we have good candidates across the country who I Know how to win and he's talked tough climate\nBut again I think when you look at where the left wants to take this country I think most people with comedy that's going to say I didn't sign up for that I'm going to keep Republican control and the great economic gains that we've seen under the leadership for the president\nDo you think the cabin on hearing the caravan the mobs um coupled with the president's success ... is is there a base out there that we're not hearing from the polls are picking up yet\nI think that's very likely I mean we haven't necessarily seen it we haven't really polled but when you anecdotal you're out walking with folks you sense that you feel that that people are in fact moving a in that direction and and were outraged by what they owe happened to a judge capital\nAnd what are the your house members Freedom Caucus guys how's Dave Brat doing and we're going to actually talk to Scott

other things\nThe Mark Meadows Jim Jordan the whole crew you know went and talked to the president talked or leadership and said you know we can't support this you can't have insurance companies denying people with preexisting conditions that we we got that right in the buildup we finally passed yet they're running this play book all across the country because they don't have anything else that we\nBroke health care well let's all hardly ... tried to fix it\nWell millions of Americans now they lost their doctors their plans and they're paying a lot more that's number one number two you know the big lie is will Republicans didn't support preexisting conditions of course they did that was part of the plan I Know because you're right because I remember that very specific battle\nAnd in the insistence by people like Mark meadows yourself and others to get that in the bill\nThat was passed ultimately in the house\nOn top of that the individual mandate is gone and I mean it all all Obamacare was was one huge redistribution scheme where are you going to have the young and healthy literally buying plans that they don't need or want be enforced by law to have it or penalized if they don't get it financially and then literally\nRedistribute that money to the ... the elderly and disabled in some redistribution scam\nAnd meanwhile they're young to get off a lot better by paying for one doctor's visit a year to make sure they're healthy and\nBuying at their age you know catastrophic insurance which you know is going to be like fifty bucks a month\nAnd in case they got cancer or heart attack or a bad accident so uh it was never a fair to the people in this country they sold us a bill of goods and it never worked out the way they said or what\nBut that's exactly right we tried to repair it a witch and that of course we repealed it voted to repeal and replace it with a much better programs\nAnd then of course it failed in the Senate but that doesn't stop them from only telling half the story which is that somehow we voted to repeal\nObamacare and in doing so uh and the coverage for pre existing conditions like the only way to have coverage for preexisting conditions\nIs Obamacare which is on its face absurd but that's what they're doing everywhere now normally because people know me and the district because I grew up here like you said look you know we we went through hard times here my mom moved here as a single mom\nA running from the abuse of her father and my father and you know\nMe and my brother grew up in a house with an outhouse no running water no electricity you know but we may well I've lived in the American dream Sean and so's everybody else in my family because we live in America and people will be here but they redistricted\nA you know they changed the district and then the other thing they did Sean was pump in all kinds of outside money and they're doing this everywhere but it's coming in from Soros style Bloomberg Michael Moore move on dot org and Nancy Pelosi you know she gave my opponent over a quarter billion dollars\nTo run ads against me and you know folks here just aren't used to that of course they're paying for eyes look all these wise on TV and they're thinking you know what's going on here you know we thought we knew her congressman and of course they do but they're having all these lies pumped pumped into their TVs or every night and uh\nSo and listen to anybody that tells you that negative campaigning doesn't work they're lying that's why we keep saying it but this is the only thing they have\nNot going to talk about how the economy turned around in the last two years they're not going to talk about Thirteen additional ... Americans on food stamps after eight years of Obama eight million more Americans in poverty no president\nIn history ever you know he's the only one that couldn't reach three percent GDP Growth than a year he told us manufacturing jobs and never coming back he accumulated more debt than every other president before him combine they don't want to talk about that part and want to talk about that one million new jobs\nOf four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs are eight million fewer Americans on Americans on food stamps and poverty they don't want to talk about any of that\nWell that's exactly right because they have no message so you're right the whole campaign immediately went negative and I and I'll tell you this to Sean of course now I I've spent a over thirty five years in uniform and proud to do it\nMy opponent of course is my name is Scott Perry his name is George Scott I live in a little town called ... where he lives in a little town called Hillsborough I've got two kids he's got two kids I've got an army career he's got an army career so the ... D triple C pick this guy\nOr just to run against me and of course also he now he is joining the clergy but even though he's joined the clergy that hasn't stopped them from lying about the at the to the hundreds of thousands of dollars up on TV\nAnd you know we have reports from his congregation that he's literally asked for campaign contributions from the pulpit\nAnd he's actually campaign that

these amazing he did something that nobody else did they actually took the time to actually look at Donald Trump's real background railroads his family his father and you know you tell a lot of gripping stories in the book about how\nWell the mean horrible landlords actually weren't so mean after all when people came on hard times they would work with people and help people\nThat's absolutely true story that's actually the Carol won a family in thirty forty your friends and I wanted to relate that story and an all tell us quickly\nOr Fred Trump showing up to collect rent with his twenty six year old son Donald Trump and and they're walking through the uh the garden apartments knocking on doors Carolina family cannot pay the rent a father has lost the job he's a blue collar worker Fred and his sons are looking at them saying okay no problem\nAre very often guy let's wait a month let's see what happens I suspect you'll get a job well and behold a six short days later a he gets a job pays the rent that he was owed a and it's just a wonderful story that their family never\nGoing to be told by the mainstream media but people talk about what does the president that compassion for these people does the president that after the\nThe answer is yes he learnt that at the riding shotgun with his father is he was either building these buildings helping to fill the buildings are collecting rent for collar people that were living shot so so I wanted I get a ton of research on the book\nI wanted to tell the story arc of the Trump family which is a great American success many ways the additive family is also an American success story the arts are different uh and the generational transfers are different uh put their goal part of America the part of the African American\nYou know the the generations that built this country and I don't know if it's Scaramucci Hannity Trump it doesn't matter but the generations of built this country are just amazing people the immigrants that built this country my grandparents all for coming from Ireland\nUh anyway the book is called the Trump the blue collar president Anthony Scaramucci it's up on Hannity dot com Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere Anthony good to see we're going to see on TV this week we look forward to my friend and all the best on your book tour and hope people will run out and get a copy of it because it's worthwhile reading\nYou know when you hear ... also tell you at that point what I Believe it was two thousand and three that oh it's okay if Americans want to join our enemies the polar bottom nearly died\nAt San when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was a deployed on nine eleven or the Taliban harboring al ... who can and killed three thousand Americans\nSince then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops\nTo include you know truthful I was deployed over there I've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nA we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them and are eight ten but often times uh you know the the the firefights happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on a taxi way as the cat the flag draped casket would come through and there is no this is silence there and everyone is saluting giving our final salute to these American heroes\nWho perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates and for her to be able to say that she's OK with an American going to join the Taliban to fight against us I mean that in and of itself should have had her suspend her campaign\nAnd Arizona and should make a different choice to not vote for here since and about this is really personal for those of us who served a shot at by the Taliban and and saw Americans parish over this\nUh you know I I hear the emotion in your voice and understandably so I mean you ... said six deployments that's amazing\nYeah well again it was an absolute honor there's so many Americans who have done that and more are both on the ground and the air and on the the I mean this is this is why we fight to protect our way of life and our freedoms and our liberties are in it you know this and it is you know in addition to this\nA comment saying it's okay for an American to join the Taliban to basically commit trees and she also was protesting right after nine eleven protesting our troops in a pink to to\nA flyers handed out at protests that she led depicting our troops as skeletons and saying stop the U.S terror in the middle east so\nThis isn't just a one off or her uh this is a pattern she advocated a shutdown Luke air force base\nI hosted the president President Trump at Luke air force base on friday to see what an amazing national security treasure it is she's trying to cover up or tracks and with George Soros\nChuck Schumer and the millions of dollars that are flowing in to you know cover their tracks and Turner into something that she's not in the greatest political cover up in Arizona history a lotta people thinks he's moderate a lot of people think she's right of center a and it's just not true and we\nGot this only coming out on a three weeks before the election I mean it's almost on a daily basis it's like you know a a deep dive dumped has been made but I Would think that there's a common knowledge or have to have been common knowledge about her I mean\nI I wouldn't underestimate remember the allegations against the blind shakes attorney that she invited to Arizona State university I mean that's another slap in these two people\nThat absolutely look at you know we are sort of joke that the Democrat Party should have done better in internal opposition research on her before they had her be Chuck Schumer top recruit\nFor them to try to flip the Senate majority we knew about her radical cats uh we've been telling people about it in Arizona every single day uh and that and the last few weeks or right some some videos and and things are coming out every single day but unless you're on conservative radio conservative TV Fox\nOr another on social media you're not finding out about this and so we still have another a number of independents\nAnd Republicans who are not too many yet unfortunately that need to know every time we have to put up an ad to put some of these statements and like you just played it costs us about seven hundred thousand dollars to make sure the message gets out to the voters as they are voting every single day right now\nAnd she's had so much money dumping into her you know and if people do on a supporter of course they can go to mix Sally for Senate dot com 'cause we really do need the help or to make sure Arizona they're aware\nOf Arizona are aware of all of this they will never vote for her if they are aware of your heroes background they absolutely will vote\nFor you um I've only gotten to get to know you in in recent months and I got to tell you I'm more impressed every single time I talk to you and I think it'd be a great senator from the state of Arizona I Hope you're not going to turn into Ben Sasse and run away from me after you get elected but um that's happened more than ...\nYou know what's on your may not remember but back when I was a major in the air force I took out in the Pentagon because they were making our service women wear ... when they were in Saudi Arabia and I put my career on the line and I actually sued the department of defence\nAh fought for eight years and got legislation passed to overturn this and I actually went on the Hannity show during that whole thing ah to talk about how important it was to protect our religious liberties and not say\nIt was a very you know that that was that was a good move I mean I I don't like the idea of American Soldiers are are on foreign soil and were there to protect them and help them which is usually the case ah I don't think that we need to go by their customs were Americans we get to follow her own customs or else you don't want us there then you don't want us there\nExactly that's exactly oh luckily we were there it was with the U.S military policy it was ridiculous I stood up for it I thought for it took me eight years but I finally got legislation passed as a citizen or to overturn\nIt and make sure that our values were ... were set up for it\nWish we both love and why they're new and here I'm a bit more than ... valley if you're not paying attention to this race in Arizona you need to pay attention Christian cinema you know supporting radicals like the Taliban Wal Mart\n... valley if you're not paying attention to this race in Arizona you need to pay attention Christian cinema you know supporting radicals like the Taliban while Martha ... doing her six tour of duty twenty eight years serving our country ah she's got one of those crazy pink hats on you know talking down our troops and accusing them than she accused him of torture as well\nI see where the line with a radical uh anti border patrol a group down at the border trying to help uh you know help with illegal immigration and that group a ... accused the border patrol of torture yes it was a rare again radical extreme group that she was very much involved in a in the inner path\nWhat do you think the president needs to do with the seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border if they make it to the border what's the best plan for the president\nOr this is absolutely ridiculous we have got to stop them from coming in the president needs to use all elements of power that he had Sean we're seeing little mini caravans coming in every single day though because they are taking advantage of our loopholes in the law\nI work very closely that President Trump often called the good that bill that was also the Knicks Sally bill that would provide thirty eight billion dollars for a border wall to secure our border and close the loop holes that the cartels are taking advantage of it has to stop every single day right now there's people\nComing in and ... uh and that's a a sector that is being overrun right now all they do have been down there many months every new yeah they're released\nInto the interior of the United states sixteen thousand five hundred family member units in September the highest ever recorded\nThis is not Czech president John Fong it's a Democrat's fault for obstructing a closing these loopholes and securing the border and the president as frustrated as the eye and ... everything he's got and it took it to to put pressure on Mexico\nAnd then they use them for building the wall and funding and fully funding all yes and you have\nBoarded our belt thirty eight billion dollars including building a wall yes or\nWould you vote to repeal Obamacare the both of John McCain decided to change his mind on\nWell San I did vote to repeal and replace Obamacare on that House bill I'm getting my asking for it right now because it's being misconstrued either Democrats they're trying to uh you know invoke fear in people who have family\nMember wait a minute I Know Arizona didn't how many Arizona's lost their plans lost their doctors and are paying infinitely higher rates because of Obamacare\nYes Obamacare is held in Arizona there's only one choice in fourteen if they have no choice people lost their health care coverage we had people right now a tree that conditions you can't get access to health insurance because of the failures of Obamacare\nSo I work hard to make sure that we were moving away from that and and towards something that gets more choice for people\nMore flexibility at the state level more free market get the federal government you know to not be doing that one size fits all top down penalty taxes and mandate it's failed\nAnd so we you know I voted yes again I've got millions of dollars attacking me right now misconstrue ing that vote I I voted to protect people with preexisting conditions\nOh that's good intentions but their policies are wrong we need more conservative policies to bring the cost down and provide more options for people to get access to insurance\nOr Martha McSally a really a rock star a hero who served their country and an important race for the Republicans as they not only want to maintain control of the U.S Senate but also to build their majority in the Senate\nThat'll make votes for Supreme Court justice is a lot easier on up against a very radical leftist in the name of Chris and send them a thank you so much a Martha McSally for all you've done for your country and and the positions you take

the middle of that going well what about slaughtering\nThe chickens you know can you do that in the back yard and you know what about cleaning up after the chickens and what about of course you can't have roosters usually because they wake everybody up at but I've not heard of any problem with chicken keeping in the city of Flagstaff\nIt's self reliability I mean if you don't want to chicken you can you move to nature way and they can preclude things like that but I was just more and more of a thing where people have said maybe a dog in their backyards\nYou have a chicken then you can eat
