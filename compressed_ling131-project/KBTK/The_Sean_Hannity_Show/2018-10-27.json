they're paying a lot more that's number one number two you know the big lie is will Republicans didn't support preexisting conditions of course they did that was part of the plan I Know because you're right because I remember that very specific battle\nAnd in the insistence by people like Mark meadows yourself and others to get that in the bill\nThat was passed ultimately in the house\nOn top of that the individual mandate has gone I mean it all all Obamacare was was one huge redistribution scheme where are you going to have the young and healthy literally buying plans that they don't need or

glad you are with us it's the Sean Hannity show\nYou are listening to the best of the Sean Hannity show and stay tuned more memorable moments interesting guests and a lot of fun coming up next [noise]\n\nCan you help yeah Hi I'd like to cancel my teeth whitening appointment knee I ask why I found the teeth when you're that works in five minutes that I can do from home can I ask what it is it's called power swaps and waiting to cheat in five minutes doesn't meet my teeth feeling sensitive and it's a lot less expensive than visiting the dentist\nYou know when you hear ... cinemas they also tell you that point what I Believe it was two thousand and three that oh it's okay if Americans want to join our enemies the follow up on a nearly died\nA son when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven uh the Taliban harbored al ... who can and killed three thousand Americans since then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops\nTo include you know truthful I was deployed over there I've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nOr we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them and are eight ten but often times uh you know the the the firefights happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on a taxi way as the cat the flag draped casket would come through and there's ... there's a silence there and everyone is saluting giving our final salute to these American heroes who perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates\nAnd for her to be able to say that she's OK with an American going to join the Taliban to fight against us I mean that in and of itself should have had her suspend her campaign\nArizona and should make a different choice to not vote for years and said this is really personal for those of us who served and was shot at by the Taliban and and saw Americans perished over this\nUh you know I hear the emotion in your voice and understandably so I mean you\nSaid six deployments that's amazing\nYeah well again it was an absolute honor there's so many Americans who have done that and more are both on the ground in the air and I see I mean this is this is you know why we fight to protect our way of life and our freedoms and our liberties a and it you know this and it is you know in addition to this\nA comment saying it's okay for an American to join the Taliban to basically commit trees and she also was protesting right after nine eleven protesting our troops in a pink to to\nA flyers handed out at protests that she led depicting our troops as skeletons and saying stop the U.S terror in the middle east so\nThis isn't just a one off for her uh this is the pattern she advocated is shutdown Luke air force base\nI hosted the president President Trump at Luke air force base on friday to see what an amazing national security treasure it is she's trying to cover up or tracks and with George Soros\nChuck Schumer and the millions of dollars that are flowing in to cover their tracks and Turner into something that she's not in the greatest political cover up in Arizona history a lot of people think she's moderate a lot of people think she's right of center a and it's just not true and we\nGot only coming out on a three weeks before the election I mean it's almost on a daily basis it's like you know a a deep dive dumped has been made but I Would think that this was common knowledge or had to have been common knowledge about her I mean\nI I wouldn't underestimate remember the allegations against the blind shakes attorney that she invited to Arizona State university I mean that's another slap on the news to people\nYeah absolutely look at you know we sort of joke that the Democrat Party should have done better in our internal opposition research on her before they had her Wii Chuck Schumer top recruit\nFor them to try to flip the Senate majority we knew about her radical casts a we've been telling people about it in Arizona every single day uh and that and the last few weeks you're right some some videos and and things are coming out every single day but\nUnless you're on conservative radio conservative TV Fox or another on social media you're not finding out about this and so we still have enough of a number of independents\nAnd Republicans who are not tuning in unfortunately that need to know every time we have to put up and add to put some of these statements and like you just played at cost us about seven hundred thousand dollars\nTo make sure the message gets out to the voters as they are voting every single day right now and she's had so much money dumping into her you know and if people do on a supporter of course they can go to make Sally for Senate dot com 'cause we really do need to have to make sure Arizona's are aware\nOf Arizona are aware of all of this they will never vote for her if they are aware of your heroic background they absolutely will vote for you\nUm I've only gotten to get to know you in in recent months and I got to tell you I'm more impressed every single time I talk to you and I think it would be a great senator from the state of Arizona I Hope you're not going to turn into Ben Sasse and run away from me after you get elected but um that's happened more than ...\nYou know John you may not remember but back when I was a major in the air force I took out in the Pentagon because they were making our service women wear ... when they were in Saudi Arabia and I put my career on the line and I actually sued the department of defence\nAh fought for eight years and got legislation passed to overturn this and I actually went on the Hannity show during that whole thing ah to talk about how important it was to protect our religious liberties and not so it\nWas a very you know that that was that was a good move I mean I I don't like the idea of American Soldiers are are on foreign soil and were there to protect them and help them which is usually the case\nAh I don't think that we need to go by their customs were Americans we get to follow her own customs or else you want us there then you don't want us there\nExactly that's exactly oh luckily we were there it was with the U.S military policy it was ridiculous I stood up for it I thought for it took me eight years but I finally got legislation passed as a citizen\nOr to overturn it and make sure that our values were stood stood up for it yeah\nWell I really do we both love and why the president a new one here I'm a ... Martha ... valley if you're not paying attention to this race in Arizona you need to pay attention of course in cinema you know supporting radicals like the Taliban while Martha McSally\nPaying attention to this race in Arizona you need to pay attention Christian cinema you know supporting radicals like the Taliban while Martha ... doing her six tour of duty twenty eight years serving our country ah she's got one of those crazy pink hats on you know talking down our troops and accusing them didn't you choose them of torture as well\nAs she was aligned with a radical uh anti border patrol a group down at the border trying to help uh you know help with illegal immigration and that group or ... accused the border patrol of torture yes it was a rare again radical extreme group or that she was very much involved in a in a in our past\nWhat do you think the president needs to do with these seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border if they make it to the border what's the best put plans for the president\nOr this is absolutely ridiculous we have got to stop them from coming in and the president needs to use all elements of power that he had shown we're seeing little mini caravans coming in every single day though because they're taking advantage of our loopholes in the law\nI work very closely with President Trump a it's often called the good that bill that was also the Knicks Sally bill that would provide thirty eight billion dollars for a border wall to secure our border and close the loop holes at the cartels are taken\nAdvantage of it has to stop every single day right now there's people coming in in ... uh and that's a a sector that is being overrun right now all they do have been down there many times every ... yeah they're released\nInto the interior of the United states sixteen thousand five hundred family member units in September the highest ever recorded\nThis is not certain president John Fong it's a Democrat's fault for obstructing a closing loopholes and securing the border and the president as frustrated as the eye and you need to use everything he's got and it took it to to put pressure on Mexico\nAnd then usually for building a wall in funding and fully funding all yes and you have\nBoarded our bales thirty eight billion dollars including building a wall Yes sir\nWould you vote to repeal Obamacare the both of John McCain decided to change his mind on\nWell San I did vote to repeal and replace Obamacare on a house bill I'm getting my asking for it right now because it's being misconstrued by the Democrats they're trying to uh you know invoke fear in people who have family\nMight wait a minute I Know Arizona didn't how many Arizona's lost their plans lost their doctors and are paying infinitely higher rates because of Obamacare\nYes Obamacare has failed in Arizona there's only one choice in fourteen counties that had no choice people lost their health care coverage we had people right now is creating conditions you can't get access to health insurance because of the failures of Obamacare\nSo I work hard to make sure that we were moving away from that uh and and towards something that gives more choice people more flexibility at the state level of them are free market\nThe federal government you know to not be doing that one size fits all top down penalty taxes and mandate it's failed and so we you know I voted yes again I've got millions of dollars attacking me right now misconstrue ring that vote I I voted to protect people with preexisting condition\nOh that's good intentions but their policies are wrong we need more conservative policies to bring the cost down and provide more options for people to get access to insurance\nOr Martha McSally a really a rock star a hero who served their country and an important race for the Republicans as they not only want to maintain control of the U.S Senate but also to build their majority in the Senate ... votes for Supreme Court justice is a lot easier\nUp against the very radical leftists in the name of Chris and send them a thank you so much ah Martha McSally for all you've done for your country and and the positions you take and ah you should win this race far and wide when the people of Arizona fully understand the record the background and the radical views of Christ and send them a thank you

know my whole life I consider myself a liberal and my whole adult life I considered myself I was at Democratic Party voter I always voted Democrat\nUm and that was true even in two thousand and sixteen I went and voted for Hillary Clinton and I was one of these people who was devastated by the results of the election for numerous reasons first of all the\nMedia has been telling me for months and months that Donald Trump didn't have more than a three percent chance of winning and they also had been telling me for months and months that he was a racist at a bigot and homophobia and a monster and basically the second coming of Hitler at that his followers or\nNo better and you know they I think that the liberal media did\nFor me as they did for millions of others are very effective job scaring people making people believed the stories in this narrative that they're trying to push so when Trump got elected I was terrified and I was one of these people going on social media\nRanting you know screaming sometimes crying you know saying you know I'll never understand how people could vote for for this monster and on one particular day I had posted about um\nYou know I I'll never be able to understand how people can vote for a man who stood before a cheering crowd and mocked her reporters disability and it was on that day\nIn January of two thousand Seventeen but somebody\nReached out to me after reading my Facebook posts and said listen I'm just asking have you seen this and what she sent me privately was linked to a Youtube video which was entitled debunking the Trump mocked the disabled reporter\nAnd for anybody who hasn't seen this as a compilation of footage I'm much of it is on the campaign trail but some of it even goes back ten years ago of Donald Trump doing that exact same voice in that exact same gesture as he did that day when he was quote unquote mocking the disabled reporter\nBut what's clear when you watch this compilation\nIs that this is a a voice in a bit that Donald Trump does when he's imitating someone who was caught in a lie or doing something shady or grumbling because they've been caught doing something dishonest and I I Know some stupid now shot but it's like it was the first time in my entire life that I really\nRealized that the media was capable of creating a completely false narrative\nAnd then isolating a moment
