Hillary Clinton Russian collusion two people\nAre on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele to compose is a totally fabricated phony document\nBased on suppose Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now a second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Sussman or who is passing along\nComputer storage data as well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection\nConspiracy to use phony opposition research to defeat her political opponent when that failed they doubled down and they continue to spy on an associate of the Trump campaign and to launch a special counsel Bob Mueller\nTo drive Trump from office why haven't Andrew McCabe memos\nEvidence seen this soft

frame Donald Trump good title for a book I guess that's why it's number one\nJohn Solomon I Want you to weigh in on this and I'm sure I missed some details here but I I'm given the best summary I can it sounds complicated but it's not\nIt's really not complicated and Greg does such a good job of cutting through all the laughter and BS in Washington and get right down to the point the FBI and the Justice Department were misused for a political opposition research project to a stop Donald Trump from becoming president and when that failed\nBase was saying I'm investigation that was designed to hand for his early presidency and that's what the overwhelming evidence now chosen and there's another important part\nThat Baker divulge as in the middle of my story but I Want to fight the south because many times I've heard you and I've heard Greg say the media has been complicit in this well a a a fake or gave us an unbelievable anecdote of complex in November right after the election right after ... when the reporter David Corn of Mother Jones\nGives a new version of the ... I see a copy of different from the one the FBI has sort of steel and gives it to Baker and Baker turns it on to the a counter intelligence people why is that important first off it's not a job of a reporter getting evidence the FBI where we're supposed to report facts not become snitches but\nMore importantly the timing of it is so important\nThe FBI just fired Christopher Steele for leaking uh uh the existence of the investigation and all the dirty hat on Trump just before the election he gets fire they fell the price of court or no longer using him and hear it becomes a backdoor a journalist becomes a backdoor to continue to receive information for Christopher Steele\nThis is not how the eyes of process is supposed to work and I think it's another key revelation I mean I I think bakers given several key revelations I Won the challenges the credibility of the same\nOne that shows the media uh uh being complicit in in the effort to unseat Trump and three that's a direct involvement of the Democratic National Committee lawyer and and turning on evidence pressuring the FBI think of what happened in that time from\nChristopher Steele July fifth twenty sixteen walks into the FBI and you're\nYou get turned down they don't act on them right away they ... they're not excited about it a few days later he go to Bruce or the number four official in the Justice Department Bruce or put pressure on the FBI department by reaching out and doing it a month later you've got a the the ... lawyer coming into the FBI again putting pressure\nOn to the system there was an enormous amount of political pressure to get the FBI to find something on Trump before election day and I think when we look back at this we should all be alarmed thick Donald Trump out of this\nAny candidate any American who have been treated this way it really raises civil liberty concerns that really raises abuse of power concerns and we should all be concerned by body of evidence that our firms rector has written in his book\nIt is so scary that when you put it all together and now the pieces seemed to be ... it literally at the end but those the puzzles together usually start on the outside and you get all the square parts on the outside and then you start feeling and the pieces of the puzzle then the next thing you have a tree then you have the grass and you have the sun\nAnd slowly but surely it seems like we now understand a lot more and that is\nThat we had a group of people\nThat literally set up an entire phony Russia investigation\nThe very people that exonerated Hillary long before they investigated her\nThe very people that literally signed off on warrants that are based on information she had provided by committing fraud to Pfizer courts and the very same people that after they lost had an insurance policy and now we know what the insurance policy is\nBy any means necessary we're going to get Donald Trump in the way we're going to do it is a we're

the FBI guidelines\nAnd the justice regulations on winning how you can launch a counterintelligence investigation of an American citizen\nAnd what I discovered is that the FBI violated every single solitary provision of their own guidelines they had no\nCredible evidence of crimes no plausible intelligence to justify a counterintelligence probe importantly they had no probable cause and yet on

FBI was never able to verify and yet they ran with the dial aiding investigation to damage Trump and dad\nThey violated other federal regulations that say you may never use on verified information the

right\nWe we have to take very seriously this concept of the left so the left has been taken over by the radicals\nThinking about the fight but JFK would not be allowed into the Democrat Party today a hardcore anti communist stronger national security you wouldn't be allowed into the DNC what do we have we have the crazies we have the they will cost you of course has is we have the Maxine Waters in control who have made a pact with the devil may have said very simply\nThe ends justify the means we want power and we will use any tool\nWell guess who used out philosophy in the past about philosophy drives to the labor camps that drives to the ... and Dr death camps whether you are right wing extremists whether you're a fascist or whether you're a communist that's the philosophy and we've got to stop that shall we have to stay true to the principles of the republic\nYou talk it in a book about a will to winter and and again the title why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies and here's what we can't have any more and you talk about the will to when you talk about will\nIs if you go back to Vietnam we lost fifty eight thousand brave Americans and we allow that war to become politicized it is and we pulled out you know in Iraq and Afghanistan\nWe pull out waving of dates of our withdrawal and we lost nearly six thousand kids and and so many others comeback without their arms and legs in their in their faces his feet you're fighting for their country we cannot commit American troops ever again\nUnless we're willing to win the war if we're not willing to do what it takes to win the war than we are not get involved ever period unless we have to you have to win these wars or else don't start them they'll be involved in them\nSo so my book is about two things is about all the threats we face of the country so whether it's ISIS Russia or China\nBut the second part is much more important is is the one who hitting on it do we have the will to defeat our enemies because Vietnam is a great example we were the most powerful nation in the world and a bunch of guys with the wooden sticks and rusty rifles defeat us\nHow's that possible because we lost the war at home because we allowed the left to undermine our will to win\nAnd and one of the most important things is the individual real to win\nIn addition to the the ... of the threats I have full vignettes of American heroes I go back to the Bobby was two hundred years ago I talk about a Korean hero adjusted pulled her I talk about a man who spent six and a half years as a naval aviator in the Hanoi Hilton\nBut the last story is very very important for what we are seeing right now and it's Whittaker Chambers\nMost kids have no idea who would occur chamber this\nThis is a man who was cabin old before Kavanaugh was born in Nineteen forty eight the first live televised Senate hearings with the mantle Whittaker Chambers who have been a communist agents of the Soviets who went on record saying\nHey I'm no longer communist but I Need America to know where the communist off in the government including algae his he was a guy who was working for the Soviets what happened to this man who stood up for the truth\nThey accused him of everything\nCheating on his wife ... of the death of being responsible for the death of his brother none of it was true but what did he do\nHe had the will to fight he stood out for the truth justice justice Kavanaugh ... so showing his his his his a scary thing the Democrats have done this before don't be surprised that they get to Capitol they've done it seven eight years ago\nI they have done it every election in my lifetime they play the race card the jet rye or you know they divide America old versus young rich versus poor black versus white

know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is I let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one\nI think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measure I tell you who's not measured at this particular point\nUh you you've got Rod Rosenstein believing that he can hide behind the fact that he's the number two at the O. J. I can tell you got to people on the phone today Jim Jordan Mark Meadows who are not going to let that happen\nOkay Jim Jordan why is this even an issue why isn't you you have the power to subpoena Rod Rosenstein who you are not and bring 'em in and put them under oath\nYeah I mean and this is why that should happen and I hope I hope chairman Goodlatte will do that we've already subpoenaed than McCain memos the kitten was or what the New York times\nCited said there were people in that room with Rod Rosenstein who set by the time was talking about recording the presence of the United states so we have the FBI former chief counsel Jim Baker saying he took that as seriously when he was told about that meeting that\nThinking about recording the commander in chief of this great country and we have the Cape memos that reinforce that we've subpoenaed that became memos and we've asked ... to come in and answer our questions neither one of those things that happen so that that you know Mr Rogers is leading that you played shot he talked about trained he he talked about facts and and the hearing to this power\nArt or rule of law and justice system works well one of the hallmarks of our justice system is transparency showing the document give us the Cape memos and more importantly comments or questions that's what bothers both\nWell why would the committee allow him to pull out of this\nWell I can tell you that your committee has shown weak leadership and I've I've I hate to criticize anybody but we've had two weeks I can tell you this the speaker of the house majority leader of the house\nA Jim Jordan and I with chairman Goodlatte in the room and and two or three other staffers we all agreed that what we would do is move expeditiously to have him come into a transcribe interview and if they did not if rod did not because I suspected that he wouldn't come in\nA than we would subpoena ham and compel him to do that and I can tell you that uh it's it's more excuses on why he should not be transparent and and I for one I'm tired of\nSo we're basically saying Republicans that have the power ... and ...\nLiterally force him to come and testify under oath an answer these really important questions if there was a plot a scheme of planned now you've got three people corroborating Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and now James Baker all saying that he talked about taping the president of the United states\nIn the hopes that it would provide materials that they can invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nHe says no no no I didn't say I was just joking about it I don't see what's so funny about it and said sarcastically I don't I don't even see any sarcasm and that\nAnd they are saying that they all believe he was saying it seriously\nYes that that that is accurate and even if he was joking you ... the guy who was in effect running dusted department should not be joking with support is about recording the commander in chief of the United states that\n... that even if it's a joke that's not something you do it particularly at the time that this was happening remember this is back in May of twenty Seventeen when the whole darn cities in an uproar because on may night the president fires give them call me on may seventeenth ... Bob Mueller the special counsel\nThat there is one of the huge already happened in between there remember at least ... set up to that point they never had any evidence of Trump Russia collusion but there was little menial leaks\nStrategy so that they were creating an atmosphere where people were thinking there was some type of a reason to appoint a special counsel which now gets back to what the insurance policy was the page and struck we're talking about and it seems we've got our answer now\nWhere you're right I think not only were they leaking arid of gyms exactly right you know there's a whole lot that has gone into this you know we're we've got actually a\nMemos that have been subpoenaed testimony that there are a narrative that was put out there by the department of justice and FBI and yet\nThey knew that many of the things that they were putting out in the media\nCould not be substantiated\nI I Would go even further than this you know you you did the lead and I'm not even sure that Rod Rosenstein red defies application many side you know when you start to look and here's some of the testimony it is chilling the amount of documents that\nThey failed to read and I I'm not so sure that Rod Rosenstein even well\nDid they fail to read them do we know they failed to read them or they didn't care I mean there's two different possibilities here\nI'm One of the big problems with all of this is every single item we're discussing here and the Grassley Graham memo pointed it out the Nunes memo pointed out that the bulk of information used to obtain the Pfizer warns\nThat that they were literally committing fraud on the size of court they never substantiated they never verified they never corroborated any of the steel ... of this of course the ... deals\nYou know dot CA and as a result it was used as the bulk of information to attain the warrants and the problem is not even steal agrees that there's any truth in what he wrote\nWell they say that's correct that not even a steel and Simpson believe all the things that were given the Bruce or but here's the other problem\nIs is even Bruce or knew that some of the things that he was writing there were not accurate and and yet somehow they get\nPut in a three oh two and they get used as a justification to actually a further investigation in terms of the president United States it's just sick thing it truly is sick me\nAll right so what's the next step why isn't good latte and Gowdy demanding that that Rod Rosenstein appear tomorrow under oath and answer these questions whether or not he talked about several viciously taping the president of the United states for the purposes\nOf of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment we need an answer to that\nYes we do and the American people need an answer and that's what we'll be pushing a term it gets to do that he would do that so now is the time obviously to get that done and make sure Mr Rosenstein gets in there answered these important questions\nNow that we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting back between may ninth and may seventeenth\nOf twenty Seventeen or he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who's coming forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so look we've
