I'm going to go up on all night unconstitutional guaranteed that right [noise] um but I'm not guaranteed right sending bombs in the mail that's illegal\nI totally agree with you but you're right but but let me tell you what let me tell you what we shouldn't have either\nUm if Sarah Sanders in her family want to sit down and eat dinner she's not working leave her alone\nIs Pam Bondi wants to see a movie leave her alone if secretary Nielsen has them eating a private dinner and groups of people are running no matter the restaurant I don't want that either I don't want a secretary McConnell and his wife some guy banging part or based on his table throwing his food out either\nOr Ted Cruz being run out with his wife at a restaurant I don't think democratic candidates ought to be talking about kicking and instability um I don't think we should be hearing about creating crowds and getting in their face and telling people they don't want anybody anywhere anymore either I'm sure you agree with me right\nAnd creating a hostile environment now one Democrat not one\nHas spoken up as Pam Bondi secretary Nielsen Sarah Sanders Mitch McConnell Ted Cruz and his wife and so many others run out of restaurants by their lunatic minion friends are because as a hostile environment that has been created by the rhetoric\nOf people like Maxine you know Spartacus Booker Hillary you can't be civil with him Eric Holder kicked them and even Brock Obama back as they are is that Mr Burgess out the terror Sean Hannity up\nGetting if that and their face this this is their\nRhetoric now interesting when the shooting happened to the ball field in ... nearly lost his life um and it was a Bernie Sanders supporters of turned out to be I went out of my way to say I don't blame Bernie Sanders because one not that supports him you know decided to become violence\nIs outrageous what they do they do this every time they'd been their silence has been deafening in recent months in days or\nAnyway Sean Spicer ... is with us senior advisors folks have been for American first action and also former White House press secretary and the author of the book the briefing politics the press the president Kris\nKobach is back with us and uh he has tend a piece on them migrant caravan he is the elected secretary of state of Kansas an expert in immigration\nAnd uh by the way he's been very successful\nAnd what he's doing and uh and uh I fully support your your victory there in Kansas was a big win that you're pulled out in the primary and I hope the people of\nKansas are smart enough to put you in that position I Know you'd be a great governor um look I I don't know if we're going to get to the point this caravans growing Mexico seems incapacitated unwilling to do the job of securing their own borders which they usually do a pretty good job of either put people in jail or throw them out immediately\nUm but if they in four weeks or whatever make it to our southern border\nUm and if anybody is to cross that border or if they rush as across that border as in as one\nWe don't have any problem with a choice we will have to arrest them that will be a crisis precipitated by people not respecting our laws I don't want anybody to get hurt if we had a wall up right now Kris Kobach we wouldn't have a problem\nWe wouldn't have a problem and also if we had\nMore states denying welfare benefits to illegal aliens so we give a hundred and thirty four billion dollars a year most of those are states public benefits to illegal aliens you know meanwhile you got governors\nAh like a Governor Brown out in California giving more so if if a federal and state response or the ... states has to stop panning out the goodies\nWhich gives the illegal aliens assurance that if they can get in that it can come in and start getting welfare benefits so while they're looking for a job\nSean Spicer a U.S quite a lot of incendiary rhetoric thrown in your direction we'll get to that in a minute but\nLet's talk about what the options are here I Would think that is the role of the Mexican government that they should be turning these this caravan back they seem unwilling or incapable of doing so uh what should America's response be well\nI think America's response of exactly what the president has talked about which is making sure that we protect our borders our sovereignty and our citizens and that means ensuring that we know who's coming into our country why they're coming in a and that they not coming in with either nefarious reasons\nOr to either harm us for that day you know but there's a friday the bottom line is the number one job of any president of any elected elected official is to protect his people and the president's made very clear and and the one thing I said the the other day that much on I Want to be clear your great with me I Know\nCritical agree as well don't temp Donald Trump don't temp temp\nBecause he's worn Mexican Government is Warren Guatemala he's told them that this is unacceptable they need to do their job stop that from happening um and I I just I I think that if anything people have seen over the last year when he gives you a warning he means that there will be action afterwards if you don't reverse\nCourse let me let me be very clear I I'm just going to assume I really believe\nThat probably Ninety nine percent of the people in this caravan of good people people that don't have a lot of opportunity in their own communities countries they want a better life for themselves and their families I Believe a lot of the eight we give to many many countries is abused and it doesn't get to the people as it should\nUm with that said we have a legal process of doing so but on the other hand let's say it's only a small fraction of the many that are coming\nThat have the various intentions for this country we don't know there's not one person that can vouch for anybody in that care of him\nNobody can vouch for anybody and it would be unfair and the massive risks to the American people\nTo allow people in on vetted no idea what their their point of view of world view happens to be whether or not they have good or bad intentions for the United states and they say that Kris Kobach assuming Ninety nine percent of of the people coming just want a better life\nWell and that's ... that's a very good point\nEngines for the United states and I say that Kris Kobach assuming Ninety nine percent of of the people coming just want a better life\nWell and that's that's a very good point you know it'd be there's abundant evidence of terrorists using\nThe traffic flow of illegal immigration across our southern border to get into the United states\nGoing all the way back to before nine eleven\nUh people from countries where al ... was active now countries where I suspect active have used this this flow this Margaret close to blend in there's no question that that will be the case again\nYou know the other thing Sean that I I wanted to point out is I think the Democrats have lost their grip on reality here there and the third stage of open borders psychosis just follow this for a moment in the nineties\nBut Democrats are were pro enforcement Bill Clinton signed the immigration reform act of ... of Nineteen Ninety six and they agreed with Republicans that we need to deport those here legally then in the two thousands they became crow amnesty and they no longer want it to deport they want to grant amnesty eleven million a year\nNow they're taking the position that we weren't there cheering for illegal aliens before they even get here they want them to come in and be part of the American society it's it's gotten ridiculous ... people before they're even here to become unlawfully present to the United states\nAnd when you play what I played earlier it's amazing how all these politicians leaders of the Democratic party not not that long ago sounded a lot like Donald Trump\nYeah let me let me switch gears to these packages the president said um he spoke out about these despicable acts of terror he said no expense will be spared whoever's responsible for sending these packages that appears in some cases pipe bombs and powder\nThat they will be tracked down and the and the full force of the government will be coming down upon them which is the right thing to say and do 'em both before that Shawn we've seen a lot leading up to this\nAnd what ... what have we seen we've been witnessing ... if I can\nGet one quick like apart and they cause I think you're making an excellent point one laughing it only takes one and that that leads into what we're talking about today you you can have Ninety nine point nine percent B. B. B. doing the right thing but it only takes one to do the wrong thing\nAnd I think that's what we need to remember it to this whole process and we saw that today one person or however many we don't now is now frightening and terrorizing\nThousands and thousands of people [noise]\nUm and and you know I'm not making any connection but while I'm at the point that I'm making it it doesn't mean you can get Ninety nine point nine percent of the people through or safely but if we don't protect to get a hundred percent right people can be threatened her and I that's the thing that we have to make sure that we're clear on\nI Will tell you what when when the quake quake on this will come back on the other side and talk about the president's comments he they will hunt down those people that have been sending these suspicious packages\nAnd powder and potential pipe bombs are two very politicians want to CNN or this is not new I've lived through this myself\nAt uh one of my assistance at the time ... was in\nIsolation what was that the window what eight nine ten hours one day scared to death yeah it was horrible it was horrible because she opened up a letter sent to me with white powder in it that's happened to Don junior in his family we saw the shooting was ... but we've been watching this ratchet up\nLeft wing rhetoric has been insane and we've heard nothing but crickets from the Democrats will get to that I see you know what a big fan of liberty safe I Am day or the number one save manufacturer right here in the u._s._a. and they've sold millions of their seats for good reason and I own liberty safe long before there were advertisers\nBecause it's the best built safe on the planet they lead the industry and technology innovation they offer exclusive features like their military style locking bars and heat expanding fires deals that are second to none and by the way you can get installation as well plus all of their full size safe\nNick over the lifetime warranty and liberty saved truly makes it a beat herbal products and you can count on them to protect the things that matter to you most in other words oh things like uh your important papers your valuables firearms things that you want to make sure nobody has the ability to get a hold up\nIn this month liberty safe is offering some exciting promotions now they are having their Franklin Stein event you can save hundreds on liberties customer favorite Franklin series and I have that and plus you can save our liberties exclusive reaper series save\nSoviet cash jewelry documents important papers firearms you want to protect from the fire or you want to keep your family safe well they have the perfect perfect antidote and that was the best time to become a liberty said Boehner twelve months interest refinancing on approved credit\nAnd you pay much higher taxes in time even doubling our federal taxes wouldn't be enough to pay for an image of radical healthcare scheme here's sentiment how carriage and that would be a nightmare for taxpayers and patients alike they're real kids didn't\nThe most radical healthcare scheme\nJust in sentiments healthcare agenda would be a nightmare for taxpayers and patients alike the real here's been sending my is just too radical for Arizona defend Arizona paper and is responsible for the content of this advertising not authorized by any candidate or candidates committee WWW dot defend Arizona dot org [noise]\n\nFor love or a financial studios you're listening to Ninety seven point was TV DJ to cheat a village northern Arizona is more stimulating\n[noise] this\nIs a Fox News alerts a string of suspicious devices that sends stocks\nHumbling and the ... uh recap on Wall street in a moment first the latest on the package it sent a multiple locations including a CNN office in Manhattan but mainly appearing to target top Democrats boxes Scott was more lives\nWhich by the latest trolleys six packages were confirmed threat three ...

we've got to monitor the media close to here because they're not talking about violence against Democrats are but we do have a number of other states next week I I I'm Wondering if I should say the names of the states I don't know\nI Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop that was yesterday\nI said that this all happens today and I say the same thing we did the uh if you don't call yourself a conservative and go about being violent go your Thirteen Days\nUse whatever passion you have and and vote at the ballot box that's how we do it in this country we don't threaten people we don't intimidate people we don't go after women and children in restaurants or like we've been witnessing\nWe don't listen to the rhetoric of people like Maxine Waters to get in their face creator

the Democratic party or he joins us as well as opposed Paterson who remember he he carried the nuclear football under the Clinton Administration\nWrote the book Darryl electric dereliction of duty a welcome both of you Brandon tell me your story what made you decide you worry I guess pretty left and a Democrat and you started this campaign in this whole thing for you is gone absolutely viral what happened\n[laughter] so I'm a great to be on thank you um so you know my whole life I consider myself a liberal and my whole adult life I consider myself while I was the Democratic party voter I always voted Democrat\nUm and that was true even in two thousand sixteen I went and voted for Hillary Clinton and I was one of these people who was devastated by the results of the election for numerous reasons first of all the\nMedia has been telling me for months and months at\nA Donald Trump didn't have more than a three percent chance of winning and they also have been telling me for months and months that he was a racist at a ticket and homophobia and a monster and basically the second coming of Hitler at that his followers were no better and you know they I think that the liberal media did\nFor me as they get for millions of others are very effective job scaring people making people believe these stories in this narrative that they're trying to push so when Trump got elected I was terrified and I was one of these people going on social media\nRanting you know screaming sometimes crying\nYou know saying you know I'll never understand how people could vote for for this monster and on one particular day I had posted about um you know I I'll never be able to understand how people can vote for a man who stood before a cheering crowd and mocked her reporters disability and it was on that day in January of two thousand Seventeen but somebody\nReached out to me after reading my Facebook posts and said listen\nI'm just asking have you seen this and what she sent me privately was linked to a Youtube video which was entitled debunking that Trump mocked the disabled reporter\nAnd for anybody who hasn't seen this as a compilation of footage I'm much of it is on the campaign trail but some of it even goes back ... years ago of Donald Trump doing that exact same voice in that exact same gesture as he did that day when he was quote unquote mocking the disabled reporter\nBut what's clear when you watch this compilation is that this is a a voice in a bit that Donald Trump does when he's imitating someone who was caught in a lie or doing something shady or grumbling because they've been caught doing something dishonest and I I Know some stupid now ... but it's like it was the first time in my entire life that I really\nRealized that the media was capable of creating a completely false narrative\nAnd then isolating a moment out of contact to push that merits if it had nothing to do is news or the truth brand\nThat let me ask you something now once your eyes are open and once you become aware of their bias and it's like you you you ask yourself ... I've been experienced it myself but it's even worse than it's ever been how did you not see it before do you ever say that to yourself\n... yeah yeah it's absolutely the kind of thing that once you see it you can't see it and what you just said is actually kind of the next part of the story because then I went back to the beginning of the campaign and revisited all of those other moments like\nTrump calls all Mexicans rapists Trump advocates for the sexual assault of all women you know I went back and revisit those moments and found the same thing time and again that's not what happened that is not what happened\nBut they made a decision after he won that primary or it was clear that he was going to win the Republican primary that it wasn't funny anymore that he was running suddenly it was scary and that they had to turn this man into the the scariest candidates at the world had ever seen so\nLet me ask you this when I when I tell my audience\nTo expect and I showed a lot of the ads that are out last night and I've been I've been showing these instances people that are in the public eye that are conservative or support the president you know they're being run out of restaurants I'm Talking about women and children good luck to anybody wants to try and run me out of a restaurant I give it your best shot\nYou know I noticed that it either happens to a guy with his wife or\nOr an older person or women you know what when there are a bunch of cowards the when they do that because I'd never treat anybody that way but you know this is the narrative every two and four years in elections in America that Republicans are racist sexist massage in is that they're uh\nNarrative every two and four years in elections in America that Republicans are racist or sexist massage in is that there are homophobic Xena phobic Islamophobia that they want dirty air and water Obama use those actual words that they want children to die\nAnd they'll have some commercial with the Paul Ryan look alike throwing granny over the cliff because they want to kill your grandmother that's what they do that to their play book we're watching it unfold today even Thirteen Days out of the election um do you see now that all of that is not true\nThere's not one thing that is true about that look look at the stakes for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce um the lowest unemployment levels ever recorded for these demographics ever\nYeah no absolutely seeing that now and in fact I think a lot of others are starting to see it as well which is resulting in what you just said that even I think the most\nUh these minority groups in particular that I think the Democratic party for so long has taken for granted that oh these are just automatic vote well that's not the case anymore I mean people really are starting to wake up and they're starting to walk away because they're\nSeen so how many people have joined your movement\nSo that the movement began on Facebook and in that are rich in that first initial Facebook group we now have over two hundred and five thousand of president I mean ... yeah all social media platforms we have about four hundred thousand\nIt to be clear for anyone who doesn't know this is a testimonial campaign so these are people who are going on social media clicking follower clicking like\nThey are telling their stories about why they are walking away so I mean they're they're making videos they're writing these stories down I mean people are there this is for me like a network of support and people are leaving are walking away from the left\nOf uh let me bring in buzz Patterson as we've been around the block a time or to a new around the Clintons a lot a Hillary queen we can't be civil with with people we disagree with something like okay you know if you don't want to be you know I ran into what's that ... the senator from that we ran into Linda when we were in Washington Blumenthal\nI ran into him on the streets right when I was going to do my show one night and I went you know and this was right in the middle of the cabinet hearings and he was being a lunatic and I I was ... center and how are you\nWhat's going on man because um I have no what am I going to confront him on the street and didn't scream adamant that I mean I don't get this behavior I don't it's not effective I said if you'd like to come on my show one day here's my number that's it why are people acting that way\nYeah well you know my story ... I I I went up to the White House or as the air force\nBlacks lake away and get the nuclear football for President Bill ... for two years after I lost that physicians you'd I Love the water off the

gym for that show\nAsk you this area because of our listeners everybody cheats and looks on their you keep your phone down keep it right that okay I mean you don't answer it anyway whether I call you up I thought like oh yeah\nWhat phone or Juno which countries have no minimum wage\nAnd I have never guessed you mentioned not fair Venezuela they actually have a high minimum wage now and they actually have price controls at the same time so they can really ramp up someone to say Ireland is\nYeah it's one of them yeah that's one of them Iceland's Iceland did that experiment where they gave everybody a minimum of you know thirty thousand dollars a year\nDid not know Finland that too and then they pulled it back yeah didn't work yeah they never works and networks actually uh well let me get to that 'cause there's somebody proposing that we do that a again a year in the U.S actually or Sweden Denmark\nIceland Norway in Switzerland\nNo minimum wage now folks will argue proponents of the minimum wage will say well but they have very strong trade and labor unions\nSo just because there's no minimum wage doesn't mean that people don't you know they're not going to work welding for you know five cents a day you know what I'm saying they they they don't have the option that they they they're more organized I guess but the big one I think you should look at\nIt's more like a city state but Singapore\nSingapore highly advance I mean there's no there's places wealthy I'm no minimum wage in Singapore now Singapore is a very expensive place to live\nA very expensive some of the highest concentrations of of wealth or in Singapore some of the highest savings rates uh they said like forty percent of the year or something in the number was foreign reserves there like one and number two or three or four or something as far as foreign reserves and there are little they're like\nFive or six million people huge ... Jeff if they would enact a Fifteen dollar an hour for minimum wage their economy would boom yeah I mean they would they could really be more down to ... to be with you just yeah I could you imagine what Singapore could be if they'd get their act\nTogether yeah and uh and Institute to a higher minimum wage but like I said\nIf you didn't have a minimum wage and\nWhat's the point of a minimum wage when who is going to work\nThe market's gonna dictated market's gonna market's nobody's going to take that job for a you know like if I go back to a welder there's going to be you know I yeah I'll do it for this price\nSo it doesn't make any sense so it works in some other countries but most countries do have some sort of minimum wage even the ones where people are fleeing from a and they're heading up Mexico right now the caravan they're leaving countries that have some kind of minimum wage but you can't get a job you know and I'm In which is very low yeah minimum wage doesn't do you any good if there is no job\nOr a ... a couple of more of these propositions that we have not gotten too and if you got a thought folks eight seven seven Ninety seven won three Ninety seven when we'd love to hear from you I'm this proposition so I get more questions on the propositions than about any candidate because infusing I think people have a good idea\nBy now of what Canada if they want to vote for I think so but you can look at some of these propositions and you just go what in the world is us about\nDo you think there's still some on a less when we had George Caleb on before we get to the props he said there was about Fifteen Percent of Republicans that we're still undecided on the Senate race between the valley and send them out\nDo you think everybody is made up their mind on the other races and maybe listeners if you have you uh love to hear from you on that but do you think it's\nPretty much set I I Can't imagine that there's very many people certainly not Fifteen Percent that don't know who they're going to vote for by now yeah how could you I mean it's nonstop you've got to know these for but maybe people don't pay attention like we do\nKnow that that could be and if you do pay attention everybody's a crook a liar so who do who do you vote for [laughter] they're all they're all according to all of them they're all everybody's bad um let's see proposition one twenty five\nWhat is this um it has to do with pensions what I don't get it so long I don't even know what to think about a few years ago we had a public vote did a lot of work I I was the mayor at the time and we worked\nAcross the state to come up with a plan for public safety employees\nTo start a new pension plan for them it didn't affect any existing officers but to start anew pension plan with different terms that this would not bankrupted the city's okay that was passed by the voters couple of years ago\nApparently the corrections officers\nAnd and it's you know attacks offset for you so you can direct some of your tax money to go to a private school to help pay your tuition\nAnd you know I guess in some ways it's similar to that tax credit you get if you make a donation to the public schools or um you\nKnow they push that every Europe's yeah ... and this is a similar kind of thing you get a credit for your private school expenses I think it's up to five thousand dollars well why wouldn't you and I think governor juicy has endorsed this I'm most folks on the left of a said no I'm\nA wildlife in mentioned this was when he was on the show was that yesterday and it was yesterday [noise] um if you're stuck in a bad school\n... as a parent you'd want to do everything you can if I got to drive my kid or get my kid on the bus to go to another school district because this school district stinks\nYou should have that right All right and let's say it's not that extreme Jeff let's say that there is a private school that really puts an emphasis on violin plane\nMen orchestra mhm and your child has that are ... yeah and you want your child to go to a school that emphasizes orchestra\nWhy can you not have that right yeah you have that right you pay it out of your own pocket and pay all your school taxes as well that's the big thing you get into it's like double didn't some probably half of your property taxes which largely funds are all schools um goes\nTo the public district school or to the charter school that day the public charter school if you go there the money follows a someone described it maybe it was I Can't remember what was the money follows the backpack\nIn that situation so if your kid wants to go to school where they can do that specialty private school if three o five passes my understanding is K. through twelve the money would follow\nYeah I if you'd be able to direct your tax money to that private school for your credit on your your tuition costs so what's the problem\nI mean are they worried than the big schools are going to disappear you know what I have seen as the public schools say it's going to impact the public school system\nI say more competition the better we make them better and maybe the public school isn't the school for every child well I envision where we have a lot more smaller schools and auctions or maybe your kid goes\nFor one specialty over here and and does something on line for something else\nI Wish there was more flexibility because I could see my kids I Wish I had the option where my kids watch as the traditional school maybe in the morning and then in the afternoon they were learning more specialized things you know what I'm saying we need to start tailoring this stuff just packing you know\nFifteen hundred kids into a bohemian school in St thinking that that solution from the Nineteen hundreds of fills a solution and that everybody has the same curriculum yeah it's it's no good it's just not working anymore so we'll see if prop three o five passes I Will vote for it\nOr you voted for it yeah uh and you're one of the Seventy percent or ... real quick I yeah by county\nOr this is from very news dot com number of registered voters are up and you have by county um increase registered voters by four thousand two hundred and fifty four voters a sixty you know for the new numbers are actually higher\nSixty five thousand plus Republicans and you have a pi county twenty nine thousand Democrats forty four thousand other which is independent\nWhat it is a complete difference from you got two counties bordering each other Coconino and you have a pie and in his reverse it is blue red\nDo you think all the university has any effect on that absolutely and it'll continue to um increase you'll continue to see my prediction is Coconino county will become the lower and lower and lower the city of Flagstaff will become\nUm what's the darkest shade of blue possible [laughter] that's kind of like our background on the other Jeff forward show logo yeah it is as blue as you can get\nThat's where it's heading yeah I'm just because I think a lot of it does have to do with the university speaking the University of Jerry want to get your take on um public housing\n'em I we've talked a lot about proposition for twenty two\nPublic housing has failed miserably since like Nineteen thirty seven when Roosevelt started building these big things all around the country\nThere is something like I dunno south of and they've been abandoned and exploded and blown up crime ridden most public a lot of public housing is not the way to go but Flagstaff is looking at this ... for twenty two\nWhich is the Robin Hood tax\nYou remember that we've been talking about this forever you know there's a push by ... and the vice mayor Jamie Whalen\nIt is so vague so veg you wrote in on that\nI imagine oh yeah most definitely no on that ... I took a heads up on that one from a city council member Scott Overton has been talking about this quote affordable housing bonds and you know millions for what purpose we don't know exactly\nHow he called a train wreck just train wreck and and now he's someone who's been on he's on the city council and he's been watching this from the beginning and he sees the pros and cons of it he calls it a train wreck I'm\nNot supporting that one that was a mess what's interesting here is there was talk I'm of can damning private property remember this uh the mayor of flights have one to condemn private property to use for quote unquote affordable housing\nNow I called that the ultimate political blunder when she did it because for twenty two what's coming out and it was going to the ballot timing was awful\nI called that the ultimate political blunder when she did it because for twenty two what's coming out and it was going to the ballot timing was awful\nThat's a good example Jeff though of it for twenty two pastors in the city council has twenty five million dollars to spend any way they want when they do it we'll watch out\nBut the interesting thing is this issue of condemning private property was requested or the city was going to talk about this and have a meeting on this it was supposed to be fast tracked it was the dumbest thing you could do politically if you wanted for twenty two to pass\nIt has disappeared off the agenda is gone\nI mean it's it's it's somewhere it's lined up right behind November six if prop for twenty two passes that thing you watch will move to the front of light absolute but for for somebody to get the money they get the money yeah for some reason this item that was just we got to talk about this and other items that came up\nAfter that have already been talked about by the council this items gone it's gone up but it's not gone it's still out there and I want listeners to understand that if you voted for for twenty two I I don't know what I Do for you if you voted for for twenty two\nSomebody asked me the other day as you well don't we need just because like step doesn't have any ... or affordable housing programs wrong just we have three\nLow cost housing unit she a cyber homes branding homes Clark homes we also have numerous units that have been built and rented under the tax a tax credit program\nWhere a private developer gets ... a tax credit for building an apartment complex and renting it at a low rate we have a number of those and we have what's it called scattered sites houses all over town that are in the the for double housing program\nCity has been very active in affordable housing is not likely big Nord it for years and now we have to catch up you will never have enough enough affordable have no city isn't it a myth have enough\nIsn't this just a mess at this point inside stuff I mean you might be able to help a couple select people and I think that's the biggest problem with the government stepping in as they ... some committee especially this proposition for twenty two will decide Jerry\nYour situation is perfect for this here's ten thousand dollars we're going to help you buy a house and then you know suing Betty and Bob are right next to you and like well what about me\nAnd they get cut out because somebody decides who gets yeah Andrew what's the criteria are there was a young couple of get a down payment assistance or very big ... and ... person does not it's very big it's it's very bag a city should not be ... and business there's also federal programs that every city has got\nThey get a certain amount of money and there's all kinds of federal programs a matter of ElBaradei folks eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one here Jerry neighbors back in a minute [noise]\nIn Arizona your words still means something for Washington politicians like murder mix Sally it doesn't mean much at all\nBad enough independent fact checkers caught in the valley lying about her own repeatedly making false integration or green\nOr what's even harder to stomach she lied about our future\nSally told us to protect our Medicare\nAnd she didn't she voted for a play on the wall Street Journal and wrote a century or Medicare and when she promised to protect millions of Arizona and so that the existing condition she lied about loading three times the got those protections let insurance companies ... people with diabetes asthma\nEvery broken promise every\nWe can trust murder salaries we sure can't trustworthy or senator\nPaid for by remember W.
