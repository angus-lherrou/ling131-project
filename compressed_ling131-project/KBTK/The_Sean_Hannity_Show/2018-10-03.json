when I Lived up there and I lived in Arizona I had the head to vote for\nBoth flake and John McCain and I used to call him when I Lived back there and I would tell them all the time I had to hold my nose to vote for you\nAnd it's up to you to hold your nose to vote for you know what I was ... whatever's going on at the time and now I'm saying the same thing that Jeff Flake I did help him get elected and I would wish he would just hold his nose and support the president he doesn't have to like what do you know the president which we all know he doesn't\nBut he should at least support the people that elected him and they're not well\nBut remember what he said it remember what he said it was sixty minutes on Sunday night he said well would it was asked would you be able to vote this way if you are facing the voters these\nScott absolutely not which means I'm only at doing this because I don't have to face the voters again otherwise I Would just do what was politically expedient so now I'll do what I Want to do that's basically what he said\nYeah but when he was even in back then when when he was you know this is I've been out of it was on for a couple of years he he missed major votes that we needed them on one was when he was home with his daughter at some dance recital and another one he went through his son's wedding\nAnd he said that you know the heat plant this was planned a long time ago and he wasn't going to miss it sounds wedding well who in the Senate would say okay if you're going to get married get married ...\nYou know he he he didn't have a chance I I probably I had a hard time even in I call him in and really hard time being played I always was played to the people I talked to and I always wish them a good weekend but\nHe he had been a disappointment for years and years and years he's he's just a it's a good thing is going away hopefully I think the only thing he's going to do is run at a Democrat and you might see that happening\nWell I Will tell you the Arizona is have a choice I Am very impressed with this woman Martha ... salad um she's a war hero\nAnd it's it's interesting she's going up against somebody that apparently is a bit of a resistor and\nAndme was outspoken against the war the\nDebate Sally was out there fighting so that's going to be an important race Arizona is a pretty ... polish state right now and but I Will tell you it's going to make a difference of Republicans win that seat if Dean Heller can hang on and the data and if Joe Donnelly is gone and Heidi Heitkamp is gone and Claire McCaskill is gone and\nAnd Joe Manchin and Bill Nelson are all gone I mean it won't be any problem with future Supreme Court\nNominees President Trump and the next two years old and we might not be

I think you said yesterday that in the primary her internal polling was accurate\nYou know you're you're the treasure and well let me ask you this ah this was the moment is it's a luck the position right are you I'm up right now is an election for a company who controls were right now I should know there's\nA there is not okay I'm On the presidential cycle hello the owners want plenty\nEvery four years okay no um\nBush has come up quite a bit do most people pay their taxes or is it the lender because I Would imagine most people in their homes have have a mortgage to most people to come in and ... mostly the lender or some kind of holding title company or whatever trust\nSend you a check for the property taxes\nSo the answer I think surprises a lot of people um most people pair off is really about I say yeah so I say about twenty five percent of their parcels in Coconino county I've a a lender mortgage I hang it on their behalf\nAnd singer so yeah about twenty thousand parcel\nAnd so we we do get a lot of traffic a lot of phone calls on a lot of mail yet payments I mailed him it's online by phone\nAnd people coming in the office and uh now that we have mobile sites around the mall um taxpayers and come out there and and pay their taxes in person as well\nYou know when I got my notice I did notice because the credit card option to which some people might need to you but there's a charge you got to pay the ... the discount rate defeat\nYeah so that the is charged by\nWe use a third party vendor were not set up ourselves to be able to earn profits credit card so he is the third party vendor who does charges see our office doesn't see it on and we can absorb that costs so that is the unfortunate side to pay with a credit card\nBut the ... is a one percent McDevitt to point three five\nIf it's a credit card or if your payment pay pal and the minimum is a dollar Ninety five and that if you've had the window on line on on the phone\nAnd folks are talking with the Coconino county treasurer Sarah but it's hard because of this tax or just recalled tax season\nIt's a ... year tax season you know you used to I I heard this rumor that people used to pay my credit card um and especially when you have larger um commercial property taxes there was a time when they do charge that feeling that\nI hear that was kind of cool because you could get things like airline hills [laughter] but that's that's gone away bankruptcy and a credit card for a ... on the program a share of the other day a former mayor Flagstaff and he talked about um some places that some commercial buildings or a hundred and twenty thousand dollars for example\nA in property taxes I mean do you see you see those huge huge huge some of the mountains right\nThey are um in in those cases we actually do get a lot of on wire payments and so they can send us payments I ...\nYou can actually go on to your bank and and then they'll pay check which is free and so an electronic payments on their what we call a box but it's all through your bank\nSo we actually see a lot of those huge payments come in that way\nOkay now let me ask you this because I saw this a lot um during the great recession unfortunately but what happens and what I guess what is your office has to do in this event was somebody does not pay their property taxes\nIt is my least favorite thing that happened and so\nIf you don't pay your property taxes on there is sometimes so for example on disk and he was twenty teens and we are talking about twenty Eighteen taxes now so you has\nTruly first half of the second half he decided but your payment into if you haven't paid by\nMay for twenty and Eighteen\nAnd you'll get a notice from her office in June on reminding you letting you know it is delinquent and then you got another notice in December twenty and Eighteen\nAnd if you still haven't paid um what'll happen is in February of twenty twenty we with Sen whatever the balances the ... what's called a tax liens fail\nAnd at that point there's investors who participate in the sale\nOn and what they're actually bidding on his the interest rate from gun so they have to pay the entire amount but they're just sitting on the interest rate which are why sale the average interest rate was about six point three percent\nOn and the interest rate by statute before it they'll sixteen percent a year I should disclose the interest rate is per year okay um\nAnd then if it purchased by investor and he was then the interest you're paying it actually that new interest rate that they've been on and they would have three years\nAfter they purchased the lean and after three years it's always will be foreclosed on but it's about a five year period of when you haven't paid to win an investor can actually began the foreclosure process\nAnd ... it is a long\nProcess but we really encourage people to come to her office and come talk to us because we can help figure out a payment plan to get you caught up\nAnd we can keep you on a payment plan through you're paying a little bit of every month and then you don't find yourself in that situation it's why we're trying to offer so many payment off a ... I'm so that way there's no barrier between coming ... office and paying\nOn and we want to be there and help people and that's why he lost the mall or going out to places like for ... to just try and get people that come talk to us and we can help them out and we can figure it out\nYeah and what's interesting Sarah if you actually go down to your office I've done this before and you look through the book these this would be what I think it's called the over the counter purchases there's a bunch of things that do go to auction correct that nobody took\nYes there are a lot on just to give me an idea I Would say I guess for the past year we had about two thousand\nParcel to be bent on and we only saw about five hundred\nAnd what's interesting is you can go um for literally\nHundreds of dollars pick up a parcel somewhere but there's usually a lot of problems with that there's a lot of by heading towards the Grand Canyon I Believe if memory serves me write that word before there was laws put in place where you had to have legal access and there's literally landlocked lots\nCorrect yeah and they do that is\nThat is true most that I Would say about eighty five percent\nOf what we thought the tax plans Dale are lot they're up in the Grand Canyon state Claritin states on your way out to the Grand Canyon\nOr any plan that like none of us might be outside your skill but you it's like since the seventies I think you think there'd be a plan to like fix that because it's really just you can't use\nThe land you can you know can can you just take the whole chunk and sell it and try to fix the the lots and make it a a partial that could be users that way outside the scope of of your office you have you heard anything about that\nYou know I'll say that and there's a lot of laws and subdivision ordinances and and that kind of set in place which does\nLimit and investors lying to purchase more than four particles out there and uh it's gonna take a statutory change really clean it up and leave the Scots that\nThe treasury attack because that's the concern and it's an issue not just in Coconino county it unfortunately there's\nIssues like that all over the state um and so the question is what the best way to fix and how to use that and we haven't found a good solution over the air\nYeah All right folks suddenly Coconino county treasurer Sarah Bennett's are or is there a you know lighter side here what you'd probably get a lot of interesting calls or letters or or whatever it was kind of the funniest or craziest or most interesting\nThing you've seen in this tax business especially during tax season\nIsn't that a lot I Will say we we got some interesting\nI'm like you said letters and phone calls and I'm going to say that you know we've gotten Christmas card the um you know family pictures in the mail they do like to keep though they won't just sister I Am I'm my last name is that it's\nHard so we do get a lot of um ... Bennett her\nAnd I almost wonder I almost went with that if you get the letters yeah we got that that is true we get a lot of the ... the that\nUm I mean even gotten some payments made out there that Bennett tire which is I'm using as well and you know have to address that but um that's how I think that that is some humor to the ...\nYeah I bet I was gonna ask you if the band will get back together but the license go that route but I guess I should have All right well uh taxis must go and people got to\nPay their taxes or property taxes when is the last date before they're delinquent\nSo if you're paying ... thumb and the first half is due by November first we close at five o'clock and if your mailing ... an online only the one or the Post's Marc de on if you want to pay for a year you've gotten Tony\n... and then the second half payment is if I may Twenty one All right Sarah ... is our appreciate the time good and put a no\nThanks for having me All right take care\nAlready folks eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety someone I I should've went with the\nUs should have a pet ... target I should ... shouldn't held you but I Know you help me back we were doing so good All right so what was your what your comments open lines um we're going to switch gears when we come back a lush and I've spent a lot of time talking about this over the past couple of months prop one twenty six\nSales tax on services\nAnd and things like that I Would probably be probably be on board\nBut my point to them is show it to me because we've been stayed over a hundred years and as far as I Know we've had the income tax the whole way long and now you're saying all of a sudden it's going to be different\nSo I Try to get some of their philosophical arguments but when I basically have been telling them is this is a pipe dream you're you're not eliminating the income tax so in the meantime\nAnd men and correct me if I'm wrong here I think what you'll get without a ban on sales tax on services is you're going to get all of them\nDirectly and so forth are biggest concern is we we want to hide it was tested and the change in culture structure quite yet then they can make that determination\nBut we don't want a politician making that you know old promise we'll do that later um and they never do and so as a result small businesses tax extra on consumers you know taking the family members to the doctor the dog to the groomer or pet control services\nYou know I I my husband told guy ... mostly back an extra tax but I Would have to pay but he also now because it's ... for the state house to\nHire somebody to help them you know make sure he's doing the books right and and submit that information to the ... the state every month and so we do\nNow you are putting an undue burden on both the consumer as low as small business person at without any ... on the back again and so I can understand some of your friend too but\nWell we'd like to eliminate the um the other thing but they haven't done it yet and because we haven't done it they're looking at professional services as a way to get more money and that's not right\nAnd how they ... against the yes on prop one twenty six which is a ban on sales tax on services so one of the other things they're saying is a and full disclosure here you are a realtor I guess I should disclose up to ... I'm a I'm a licensed realtor actually people may not know that um I don't I don't do much all he does a lot of stuff around the state but I don't\nBut anyway Holly I'm you um they're saying oh this is a special carve out for realtors they're saying there's there's exclusions in there and this is a special deal is there any kind of thing that says this service industry gets a band and this service industry just knocking a band\nNo we're protecting all small business to the core of it is new and I were small business people\nI just thought to be as well I'm a problem for some individual ... sell real estate I've got a friend um who is a tough control I've got another friend she kept her and all of us would be protected when Arizona citizens vote someone\nAnd let's stick with the the real estate thing or big transactions for a second because if it was let's say there's a ten thousand dollar commission there would be a sales tax there could be a sales tax if someone on June acted on that transaction on the actual commission\nI think there's already an exclusion in the constitution that you can't put a tax on the actual three hundred thousand dollar house for example is that correct\nThat's correct and so the ah Arizona constitution was amended I'm about ...\nTo ... a a transaction [noise] okay so um the queen buyer and seller so if you're selling your house for three and a thousand dollars a an extra ten percent four or five percent would not be taken off the sellers proceed up or it would basically banning a sales tax\nOn on hope that when we looked at it for a professional services\nIt could be figured hourly it could be on the phone and and that was just so many I Know that the politicians just keep looking for money instead of spending wisely what they've got and taking care of Arizona and the way that they said\nThat there is false ration from Iraq or the other set of fun to have their own ability will say well on on protecting themselves\nAnd I think we should be clear Holly in in the real world of business let's say you had a ten thousand dollar commission and there was a tax on it or a lawyer had a five thousand dollar commission and they had a tax on\nThere would be a bill in in the case of real estate that would be okay it's ten percent of the ten thousand the person who just sold that house now owes another thousand bucks and I'm going to collect that some people who liked to ... your class warfare kind of stuff to go after certain industries they might say well\nThe realtors going to pay the developers going to pay it but in the end what happens\nIn similar across the board and and we see that on anything from big ticket you know working with Tony I'm On on your state plan ... doing your taxes\nWith your accountant or taking your child to child care all of that would be taxable\nAnd it's interesting Hollywood I've been hearing from some folks who want to keep the option of taxing is the politicians would like to do exclusions\nSo they they I've you know we don't want to tax the lawyers because shouldn't pay for legal fees and you don't want to tax the gall bladder you know what I'm saying the surgery um so I think what what we're on the cusp of here's my prediction\nIf prop one twenty six fails at this point and I'm not I don't know which way it's going to go but if it did fail the politicians who take that as a sign as people want to have a tax on services let's figure it out\nI absolutely and that's my biggest concern and why with you know early ballots going out next week\nWe're just trying to get the word out to you know everybody that we know that this is what we're in top tier of as a consumer and it would be there would be broad based and across the board and and the folks that could least afford it would be the most\nImpact that yes there might be special provisions or carve outs of the politicians got a hold of that's already got attorneys are caught carving out a another industry but child care they don't have a lobby they don't have people who have their\nFirst authors a nail technicians um you know ... control um ... plumbers all these people\nThey don't have somebody down at the legislature watching the ... and so we felt it so important to really get involved and speak for all of Arizona's fault business we want a strong robust economy\nI don't know about you but I remember ... thousand Seventy thousand eight when the economy was not so good move all business wasn't able to invest I Want to go back there again the the ... were just recovering from what was I see positive things that had this allows us to\nCreate the market and creates the U.S stable economy so people know where the money is going on how it's being spent and there's a lot of small business to go out\nWith the election right on us and says he should our Smith Holly um have you seen any polling I mean I Know politicians have come out opposed to it but it's you know everybody I talked to support the people have you seen polling\nWe're we're we're constantly I'm was sold out um the biggest thing is and and you know this better than anybody it's all about the show got that day and so what is important to me is getting out and reminding\nPeople you can't wait on your navel check you and your family what if you believe in something\nYou need to show up in and tell people about it and so that that's why I've taken away from my family and my business to to really work for educators all of that this is a possibility and we just want to do the right thing and give Arizona taxpayers\nAnd citizens the opportunity to make the choice for themselves and not put it in the hands of the politician\nAlright Holly wish you the best of luck or balanced coming out next week early ballot so I mean it's\nIt's getting to the point where you got a few weeks to you know you've done all you can you got some time soon but you know I I think the argument stands on its own merits I I really do I'm taking tons of positions on propositions this year so far but this one just seems to make sense to me\nAnd that's our whole goal isn't what Arizona citizens to be able to look at it and say you know what to make sense to meet you and I want to vote yes so I Want to vote yes to protect myself and my family when a burdensome taxes\nAre and how they present your time good luck I think the bump stock\nAlready folks mines open he'd seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one\nWould love your thoughts I still I I'd love to hear from folks who are kinda arguing about the hey let's you know they can make it better than I can rent yeah Wallace hold out in you know most leaves on auction a first for sales tax on services and I've heard lots of folks argue that I've heard them on the left saying we want to keep this is our educational rent\nRepeal it wants to pass but you can't just have to do it do do it the same way past the repeal with a voter initiative Ali Mayberry\nWent out in her group and her supporters and got four hundred thousand plus signatures\nAre because obviously a lot of people thought heck yeah falling I don't want a sales tax on services exactly so if a better idea comes along and I don't want as us or you know an income tax but I'd rather have a sales tax on services later you go get four hundred thousand saying that you know it's not easy but it's a they did it so you can do it as well", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Kachina Village", "day": "03"}
