rabbi said rabbi Myers said that you know he's a citizen of this country and if the president wants to come here please con he was not objecting at all to the president's visit which I appreciate and when we start focusing on the blame game which is what we do especially the the let media\nThat then we lose sight of what really happened so you know what really happened is as we discussed an anti Semite killed ... that was his goal those were the words that were true unspoken from him he wanted to kill Jews but we also had\nPittsburgh Police who are amazing I Love these guys I Know so many of them they went rushing towards the gunfire while everyone else's courses rushing away we had a doctor of analysts\nWho went to care for a gunshot victim and he became a victim himself rabbi Myers made every effort to save as many lives that they could and he regretted that he couldn't save more these are the real stories and this is the truth these were not acts of the nation divided that's what the ones that the way the media wants to believe\nThat we're a nation divided but we're not we're a nation or a community like this one like any other when we're faced with adversity when we come face to face with a madman\nWe roll up our sleeves we face that evil with courage and the sacrifice\nAnd and and that is who we are as Americans and when they play the blame game on the media it just makes me sick because we missed what the true story is what the truth is and rabbi Myers I Love what you said he said the bullet holes are too numerous to count\nBut we will rebuild because we're tree of life we've been here one hundred and fifty four years you can cut off some branches that the tree will continue to grow we will be back\nIf we are to hold the house and hold the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think will definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house real clear politics average has the Democrats and two oh five Republicans at two hundred and you know basically you've got these dirty toss up seats or or thereabouts that are in play and that's going to make all the difference\nYeah that's right and and Sean ... are it by the people right now certainly the thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education literature through our organization is ignore the polls ignore the press ignore the pundits do your job get the litter\nOr everybody me you know I make a living for people not ignoring\nI saw your except it okay but I think you're right though\nBecause the polls are so often so wrong I mean let's go back two years Donald Trump lost every state according to the exit polls five Fifteen on election day\nWell that's exactly right and I mean look when I was state party chairman in Georgia where reelect is the first Republican governor in that state in a hundred and thirty four years the last published poll in a midterm election\nShowed him trailing by Thirteen he won by five favorite only off by a team points and particularly in a midterm election work turnout is everything it's all a matter of who does a better job of getting their voters to the polls and Sean\nI talked to a friend of mine who's helping to run independent expenditures and every target it's been in the house race in the country\nHe told me that in some of these house races dirt down to his view is twenty three hundred are undecided voters in an entire congressional district everybody's got their uniforms on everybody's blocking and tackling and everybody's going to the polls and the good news is\nWe've got the ability to identify twenty six million voters as eater evangelicals are pro life Catholics we have phone numbers on forty five percent of them we've got emails on about half of them uh we\nWe have the ability to get directly to them and we know nightly whether they voted or not and then we can follow up with more phone or email us ... and worked or not\nWhere do you see because I'm looking at six races believe it or not in Southern California that matter for the house there's\nThose races in New York house races that could turn tip the balance of power and New Jersey can tip the balance of power and Minnesota has house races that can tip the balance of power\nBut then I say that and I'm thinking well there were four hundred and thirty five races going on a in a daze in any one of them can tip the balance of power and while you use the poles and it's somewhat helpful it's much harder to decide and get a feel for how the house is going to go\nLook right now we really have a house is on the bubble we think it's plus or minus five or ten feet and we think when you're dealing with probably right now a hundred seats in play\nAnd probably half of those are tied again it's all about turnout and and look you remember the special election in Georgia sex when they had off off up you know two three four five and he lost by four\nIt's all a matter of who does the best job at the ground game and the good news Sean is the power brokers in the media and no longer get to control who wins or who loses we've got the ability to communicate to voters\nDirectly on line on their cell phone at their doors wherever they work play and live and if we do our job and get our bowed out we're going to have the potential to have a shocking\nAnd election night to the to the dominant media as we had two years ago\nI mean that's what I keep reminding people you can shock the world again we can go against history nobody thought Trump would win I mean the networks were literally when I read the exit polls the five Fifteen I was doing radio at the time and and the at that moment reading the exit polls trumpet lost Florida he lost North Carolina he lost Pennsylvania\nHe lost Ohio he loves Michigan he lost Wisconsin He lost that all\nKnew he barely won the state according to the exit polls the same thing happened in two thousand and for the exit polls the five Fifteen election day show John Kerry was president so you're right and I pay attention to the polls but more importantly\nHow do you get all these people involved that they're really spending the time making phone calls getting on you know getting the vote out and sending out these emails and letters and tax what are you doing\nI have to be honest with these Sean I I got to give credit where the credit is due first of all\nA to President Trump for providing the banner of the positions on the issues that have got these people so excited\nAnd secondly to the Democrats support during the cabinet nominations\nTrying to ... air and destroy a good man and his family and we saw a noticeable inflection point in this cycle when they tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh it's a reminder of why people turned out in sixteen and we've got thirty nine field offices and Nineteen states we have a team's operating in every state in the country\nThere overseeing walking teams that are going neighborhood to neighborhood\nWe had a woman the other day that was verbally accosted a guy got in his car and followed her all the way down the block screaming obscenities at her she sent me an email later and said not only am I not\nHurt she said I'm now going to walk every neighborhood in my town and knock on every door it's that kind of intensity that kind of commitment dark\nIt might not hurt that I'm now going to walk every neighborhood in my town and knock on every door it's that kind of intensity that kind of commitment to our country you know at at times like this Sean when people wonder you know if that kind of\nDecency and character still alive in this country the answer is a ... yeah it is in the heartland of the country it's at the grassroots it's alive and well\nWell I think grassroots politics works grassroots works and I think it works from the beginning one of the things though I think Obama lead the way but Trump and the Republicans did some catch up and we saw the benefit of their working twenty sixteen and that is to use the social media\nI don't think anybody has a more powerful platform on social media than President Trump\nI think that's right I think ah you know\nA rock Obama was the first social media Internet president in the same way that FDR was the first radio president in the same way that John F. Kennedy was the first president to master television but if Obama was the pioneer I assure you Trump has mastered it or not only and his use of social media\nPlatform but also the thing is that his campaign dead in twenty sixteen\nTo catch up with what the Obama campaign did and we for example a Sean when we took our Christian voter file and matched it up against social media platforms Seventy two percent of the voters were seeking to contact her on Twitter or Facebook\nOr another social media platform and we're broadcasting out thirty two million videos get out the vote messages and other targeted messages directly to those people and again I Want to stress the minute they vote they get dropped out of the turnout universe and all the videos we've been pushing their social media count then begin to go elsewhere\nSo I agree look anything's possible I ... I don't take things for granted\nI'm I was one of the few that really believe that Donald Trump could when I saw something happening because I was out on the road\nI also see it happening this time anecdotally\nYou know I can see it in ratings every single night it's a you know Fox is audiences enthusiastic 'em and you can see CNN fake news and and that mess that they're just desperate then they'd like not doing well they seem almost the audience seems depressed but\nThere were three virtual outcomes here one is we shock the world Republicans picked up Senate seats hold the house that would be the best case scenario then there's a split decision\nWhere Republican seats in the Senate Buffalo's he'd become speaker and then there's a worst case scenario you wake up you know ten nine days from now when you find out as speaker elect below sea and Senate majority elects Schumer and\nIt's really up to the people which decision which outcome they want but we'll get the government we deserve you stay home well that's a half of Oprah below sea and Schumer if you don't vote for the Republican you're basically voting for ...\nYeah and I and I really believe showing that the intensity gap in the enthusiasm gap that wants to separate the two sides has closed significantly since the Kavanaugh nomination you know you see different\nPolls would Democrats with a high enthusiasm maybe Seventy two percent of them Republicans maybe sixty eight to Seventy percent but anecdotally I'm telling you I'm seeing stuff out\nThere that I saw on twenty sixteen I was in Des Moines Iowa last week at an event with the vice president we have a very strong organization out there we have over a hundred and fifty people walking door to door just in Des Moines neighborhoods and\nThis one gentleman who was volunteering told me he was at the president's rally the previous a friday and Cedar Rapids bay filled an arena\nThat we're over two thousand people who couldn't get in they stood in the driving range for two hours and watch it on the jumbotron\nThey stayed there to show their support you simply cannot want it to quantify that with a poll or within analysis it's an intangible it's out there and it's real\nOr a quick break we'll come back more with Ralph Reed founder chairman faith and Freedom Coalition might cyber security some things that need to know cyber security\nThat's the protection of networks devices and programs from cyber attacks that are designed to access or destroy sensitive data or extort money from businesses and people strong cyber security is layers of protection spread across computers networks programs\nAnd realize not only ON Technology but also making smart choices\nLike keeping software updated in staying informed on cyber safety you know consumers also need cyber security to protect their digital lives in today's connected world it just takes one weak link criminals get in a thank goodness there's the whole new light pluck identity theft protection with the added power of Norton Security that protects\nYou against threats to your identity or devices that you can't see or fix on your own now new life lock with Norton Security\nSeniors living on fixed income will be hidden nationally art California tried than any day unless you're in California I'm reading every time the national average\nYou don't want California taxes in Arizona or California in high cost of living why would we want California\nDon't no problem one twenty seven dot com check the facts for yourself\nNo one twenty seven\nPaid for by Arizona's for Ford of electricity not authorized by any candidate or Kennedy's committee\nNo on one twenty seven\nPaid for by Arizona for portable electricity not authorized by any candidate or Kennedy's committee [noise]\n\nFor love or a financial studios you're listening to Ninety seven point was TV TK pitching a village northern Arizona is more stimulating\n\nThousand us troops heading for the southern border how many ...

the pumpkin patch I'm going to leave you here\nAnyway [laughter] and I had on\nI Am a I'm I'm Down here and Robert I'm formerly from our talk\nOut there on the island that's\nThe reason why I'm calling and I appreciate you taking my call but the reason why I'm calling is I think you Rush Limbaugh and went back down playing this red wage I don't think is the right way and I think it's a rich Nabil the Democrats are getting fed up with allies and the and the ... the the section of you know okay Larry and all of them and\nThat's really getting sicker that's ... by the name Trump so I think that just they just want to silence and they're going to vote Republican\nLeaning I I Am a realist\nAnd I try to look at things as I study these numbers more than you know\nIf the election were held today I think we'd lose the house by about five seats\nWhere if the election were held with the Senate today where we would hold Tennessee we pick up Missouri we pick up Arizona we barely hold Nevada I think we have a if people don't vote libertarian in Indiana will win Indiana and we'll win North Dakota\nFlorida too close to call\nMontana too close to call West Virginia leans Democrat although the secretary of state there is now up to and the latest poll Menendez is a long shot to be beaten in New Jersey but he can be beaten\nThat's that's where my head is that today and uh well I'm trying to warn people that this is real that you know here we have history running against us so there's only going to be one of three results on the morning after the night before\nAnd it's either going to be while the Republicans picked up seats in hold the Senate Republicans while they held on to the house and that's going to be the best case scenario or it's going to be a split decision they pick up seats in the Senate but lose the house\nOr it's going to be a disaster and that's you know speaker elect Nancy Pelosi Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer\nVery Frank with you I can see any one of those three scenarios unfolding with the third one the least likely\nSo you know I'd rather go full for the gusto and when it all one of the big problems for the Republicans as they've had forty five retirement\nGod I absolutely not you know she's running as somebody she's not at the end of the day that Democrats think everybody hates Trump like they do [noise] you know and to me they're completely out of touch they can see pass or angry is Sean and let's not forget don't forget election night two thousand sixty and when the media has to snares out there\nOne of the best the best case of Hitler and wind and the worst case of Trump won and yet Donald Trump still wants\nNow we have a president wherever the president is has a record Hillary's true colors of come out contrast after two thousand eight where it was best case Obama and then look what happened to two thousand tend to mid term stink about that the voters corrected their mistake Obama last sixty three house seats and what's there to correct now\nWhat part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change give the crumbs back\nIncrease it regularly watch jobs go back overseas see now that's that's the difference my opponent does talk about that they're hiding behind a bunch of smoke and mirrors and not running for really are but I think the ... the voters are a lot smarter than that right now and we're going to ... some people in November six\nI noticed the former New York city Mayor Bloomberg is you know putting tens of millions of dollars apparently into a lot of these house races are you seeing the effects of his money and others\nI'm not seeing Bloomberg's money in in this race but I'll tell you one thing closest Pakistan a million dollars on hitting me right here in my home district ... million dollar San Francisco money being spent right here in Lee high value in Pennsylvania attacking me\nBy the way I say this to everybody and said there are four hundred and thirty five members running for Congress and if you vote for any Democrat make no mistake about it you're voting for ... they're just not saying that\nThey're not saying it but that's the absolute truth\nWhat are the polls latest numbers show or in the district\nTwo points back where the latest poll shows that were to back to back well within the margin of error and we're and we're gaining momentum uh we we debated\nSeveral times I made an average debate she will not agree to any additional debates are we caught her actually listen as we caught her in the debates talking about supporting open borders then she correct herself and say no no no I support a strong southern border\nTwice she said that in the last debate which completely makes sense because during the primary she was running on a ballot eyes open borders but now as we get in the general election they're trying to pivot and we're going to and we're going exposure for what she really is\nWell this is a really important race a now Mardi knows Dina's running for the seventh district of Pennsylvania this Lehigh Valley district\nLehigh Valley county in Pennsylvania\nA it's a dead even race it's all going to come down a turnout Democrats are spending a fortune Republicans sadly of not spent as much and they should be meeting these guys dollar for dollar but I Hope people in the seventh district I Know we have a lot of listeners there are paying attention and and get out and vote early voting goes on in Pennsylvania right so people can vote soon\nYes and then we're seeing and talking to our election board you know there's so many presidential election is what they've told me what the amount of absentee ballot requests and what is being turned in so people are really really engage the really engaged\nAnd he's getting any feedback as though you know what's coming back Republican versus Democrat\nI haven't been getting any any feedback but I can just tell you that people who have been meeting and the people who aren't going to be here to vote have been asking for absentee ballots and they're making sure they're getting their votes in\nI have a good sense that there's going to be a lot of people showing up at the polls and it'd be laws and there's going to be a lot of people supporting Trump's agenda [noise] you know we're in the middle of the great American comeback last two years have given a lot of people hoping this country\nMore jobs lower taxes safer communities or do they want to uh uh have Nancy Pelosi take charge and have more welfare higher taxes open borders and sanctuary cities the voters are smarter than that Sean they want opposite went freedom and liberty they went opportunity that's what we want that's what we have and we must continue it\nOr we wish you the best Marty all the best thing I Know you'll bring that great training as an athlete to the hard work you do for the seventh district of Pennsylvania and Lehigh County uh we'll be following the race could look a week from tomorrow and uh I Hope you're able to sneak this out\nYes sir thank you thank you for having me on the show\nEight hundred nine four one ... listen you've got to understand this is now how close it is it's all coming down to get getting out the vote\nIt's one point here two points there it makes all the difference there are enough people in his audience\nIf everybody just made a commitment wherever you live on six hundred stations now and you made a decision that you're going to get out and you're going to vote and you're not going to stay home and you're going to put any effort and you're not going to give a half a vote to below sea or a half a vote to Schumer it could be you know shock the world again kind of night\n... to stay home than it's you know maybe we split split the baby in the sense that you know it's\nOkay we ... we saved the Senate and get extra seats there but we lose the house it'd be a lot easier and better for the country if you want to continue progress to win both houses as of today eight days out I can see any one of those scenarios unfolding any one of them All right let's go to our busy telephones ah let's say Hi to Katherine\nIs in palm bay Florida next on the Sean Hannity show\nHey Sean I Can't I'm telling you enough how much my husband and I just\nAbsolutely I think you are the greatest not because of just what you inform us because of your courage\nAnd the hearts and prayers go out to the people in Pittsburgh it is devastating I Can't believe Americans have forgotten the history and the genocide that went on during during the Holocaust I don't understand it but with that stab our hearts and prayers are with them I have a point to make about courage and by the way\nYou are right up there with President Trump and his entire family\nAnd those that stand by and I want\nAnd by the way you are right up there with President Trump and his entire family\nAnd those that stand by and I want the conservatives in this country to take part in some shared risk and stand up not in a violent way not in the vulgar way but maintain your credibility by being several\nStand up to all these bullies and oppression and the violence and the hatred that they're stealing on the lie telling about our gear presidents I'm comparing him to Hitler and style and which are just atrocities I Can't stand to listen to but the problem was that a lot of\nA lot of very frightened people I think President Trump as the most famous whistle blower in the nation he's taken the curtain back and all the corruption in Washington and then something\nI'm I'm a whistle blower myself unemployed nurse practitioner of laughter conned a surge in five years ago and still fighting today that's that's fine\nBut I just want to say if if the conservative talk to them shed risk and stick together and consolidated\nYou gotta let me tell you why are we are now I mean we're now at a point where there's a there's a group of so called conservatives never Trump or conservatives again that they're just angry they'd been so wrong Ben Sasse was one of them Bill Kristol is another one of them Jennifer Rubin another one of them\nYou know the if there's if Trump cured cancer they would be mad because oh he was Donald Trump that did it you know doesn't matter that he transformed the economy all things that they say that they is conservatives would ever want in terms of cap tax cuts deregulation\nOr energy independence a peace through strength trust but verify\nSecuring America's borders all of the things that doesn't they hated all because Trump is doing that which they advocated for but they wanted somebody to do it in a way\nThat that that set everything the way they wanted to say it but the problem is the old establishment way of doing things gets nothing done you know I agree he can be incendiary he breaks things he throws dishes and breaks them in Washington and he exposes the swamp but he fights hard\nBut we're getting the results in the benefit of that hard fight you know they're they're the type of Republicans have basically want to just sit in power in the corner and and act like they can be friends with people that are saying publicly to kick you and that don't want to be civil\nThat are running you out of restaurants and screaming at the top of their lungs that you so I you know it's it is what it is I the only thing I really want at this point I Want results\nI Want the forgotten men and women to be taking care of I Want as much prosperity as we could ever create for every American and I want to take care of Americans first and then we'll work on helping the rest of the world develop the same system in paradigm that we built that\nHas benefited our population and then I Want security or in a world full of radical Islam is and people that that want to wipe America off the map and chant death to America\nI Want to make sure that we have the meanest toughest bad US military and we can handle any threat to the world throws at us and we can do if necessary we can protect the world against evil\nWhen evil you know raises its ugly head because it's happened before and it's gonna happen again history has proven in the meanwhile it's you know basically\nYou know temper tantrum politics of never Trump or is there there's still mad they got it wrong and we wouldn't have to Supreme Court justices that are conservative had they had their way we wouldn't have had the tax cuts we wouldn't have the regulations to roll back\nWe wouldn't have America on a path towards energy independence\nWe wouldn't have had you know all the record numbers of jobs we currently have or the big GDP Growth we have or consumer confidence that we have that's why and eight days when people go out and vote this all matters a major question people have to ask is or you're better off than you were two years ago\nIn terms of the economy peace and prosperity Dr elections and if you want this prosperity this growth to continue

defense people and I mean not defend them but a in a way of protecting people because you um there's a lot of people out there that live in fear\nAnd so and control you're out there you're first responder and ah they look to you for help\nIs this is an elected position ... let me ask you this because they had on um the former mayor of fly except Jerry neighbors we've talked about this proposition to ah get judges this would be superior court by a merit based system does is it a little odd that any kind of judge position is elected position of partisan position\nI think so and that's one of the reasons why I chose to Iran has an independent because I'm\nFor up here the last elections have been Republican only and as an independent it gives everybody a choice to vote and uh I'm not loyal to any party and I have a\nI don't want to have an open mind but I'm a pretty free thinker and I like to hear what other people have to say\nAnd been in the general election gives everybody the opportunity to pick a candidate of their choice for the position of justice that\nAnd you're right it's a it's political because it's an elected position but it's judicial\nSorry folks any show is my guest running for justice of the justice of the peace out of the Williams or how big of an areas Coconino county you know familiar with the Flagstaff justice of the peace um Coconino county as you know is the second uh second largest geographical a size a county in the nation is huge area so what's\nThe size of the area you kind of cover the the geographical area\nThe area a for district three Coconino county that I'm running in is a covers to see on ash pork parks a and Williams\nWhile the elections coming up you know or any Seventy percent of people vote by early ballot but I saw the county returns I my guess is about half the folks that voted um but there's still half the folks out there that need to vote so kind of lost shout out to the uh listeners especially a listeners in your area or what would you like say\nIf I Am elected I Would like to have better communication with the community\nAnd uh what the court process\nSo that people are not afraid\nUh I don't I think people should not have to live in fear and I think there are still like that a justice of the pieces protecting their rights as what we need to do I consider myself a constitutional conservative so uh obviously I Would like to see that the constitution is um\nAlways have early voting which is the twenty seven days prior to any election even a small just fictional lecture and you can come into our office and vote early in person for those people who like to go and fill out their ballot and hand it to an elected official\nIn folks Leslie often my guess she's recorded with you have a by county have they ever talked about shortening that time up because one thing I mean the elections so long I've been having guests on for months on this uh and the elections so long it's a month long election rather than one day I ever talked about shortening up that early ballot of a bit\nNo they really have it I have been brought up and talked about but there are a lot of states who don't have early voting or only have\nTwo or three days of early voting and are just I think that really lends to turn out the market's usually we give our voters to cast their ballot the better it is in my opinion\nHow many ballots have been sent out at least in pike county and what are you seeing as far as the the early return how how many are coming back in\nWhat we've sent out over a hundred and twelve thousand ballots\nAnd we have gotten back over forty thousand it was forty six thousand and change and all those we're verified\nOver half of those so our return is huge for the first and we have it always we get a lot of adults and the first part of early voting only first set amount we get them back and then there's a little bit of a low and then we have an uptick again for the election but they're just coming out of steady with\nThousands of dollars coming in today which is it's wonderful for us on the administration side to be getting them in early and processing that many ...\nSo forty six thousand out of a hundred and twelve and so you expect probably this weekend and leading into next week I I can tell you right now I mean I have gas from for governor on a down ticket they're all coming in next week so I I guess they all sense that next week's probably the big week where people are like okay I got to get this thing in so next week's the busiest week you think\nOh yeah I think so I think it will all day and for those people out there who are not on a permanent early voter list and has just made me realize that they're not going to be here on election day or they won't be able to make it and to ... and early voting location today is the last day to call in a request and early ... cent\nWhen's the last time you can actually send it in our mail it winds that coming up\nWell that would be the Wednesday before the election is fully recommend people have it in the mail no later than that sometimes it's going to get to us and plenty of time but we have to have that ballot and by seven pm on election day so if you missed that\nDeadline for the mail we have Thirteen drop boxes throughout the county that we ... we have those on rotation we have bipartisan election teams going I think he knows about ballot boxes up and empty and those or you can drop 'em off at either one of our locations in Prescott or an ...\nIf it comes right up to election day and you haven't dropped off you can drop it off at any of those twenty five locations are about their locations at all locations are on our website all the votes in locations and all of our Dropbox locations\nOkay so so much so hang onto it up and they were driving by a polling place at six fifty nine a November six they up until seven o'clock they can drop it off at any of the polling locations\nAbsolutely absolutely and and if we're very fortunate again like we talked about we have a lot of people on the perimeter early voter lists so very seldom do we realize the line at any of our both of us in a while there are a few people and\nFor some of those just dropping off their early ... they do not have to stand that line and go right to the front where the Marshall as and they'll let them go in and deposit there early ballot\nWe've heard a lot about blue wave now we hear red wave we hear basically that there's going to be record turnout for especially in mid term or you send to not do is is are you looking at record numbers you think\nOh I absolutely think we are just in the primary we had a forty seven percent turnout that's that's very very good turnout for a midterm primary so I I think there's this general is going to be record setting\nYeah do you think with a male invalid it always amazes me he got Seventy six point six percent you set up our mailing out now it's like oh you're just fill it out and go put it in a box with the flag up right a right to marry me should have a hundred percent turnout in that regard well\nI Would love to see that I Would love to see that but it sure does make it easy again our our voters really enjoyed the that freedom\nOf getting it early getting this study a lot of them really don't\nUm they wait for that ballots come then they read about language and then it gives them an opportunity to really look into the proposition is the question the candidates and then get their ballot in and it's really nice to see so many of them getting him in early not wholly until the last minute\nAll right Leslie Hoffman she's a reporter with Yahoo by Johnny ... your time you'll be busy there next week plus so good luck
