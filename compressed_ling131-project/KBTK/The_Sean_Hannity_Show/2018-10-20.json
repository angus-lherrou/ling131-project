Sally was\nRisking her life it and fighting for anyway the cinema campaign would not say why she invited the which which is er clarify why she thought members of the cult deserved a seat at the table during discussions concerning war and peace the which is in question it should be noted claimed to practice only non violent magic\nCinema encourage the which is to wear colorful clothing come ready to dance ... stay in touch with your inner creativity and with the earth\nUm I don't even know what to say [noise]\nAnyway the people Arizona you're paying attention or we have a breaking tape that we're gonna that Claire McCaskill's team is going to want to pay very close attention to\nThat last week we showed you the tape project very to us with ah the campaign surrounding Brett is a news the former governor of the state of\nTennessee and now he's running for the open Senate seat of Bob Corker Corker but thank goodness Marsha Blackburn is now pulled out a fourteen point lead in the latest polls she was down for a little while\nA lot of people were concerned about it but I think now that they see that reticence staff has basically saying he's saying one thing to the people at Tennessee I'm planning to do something very differently\nBut where do you see the tape that we have tonight as it relates to Claire McCaskill another important red state Democrats Senate race that's going on member you vote for Claire McCaskill you might as well vote for Schumer you vote for any democratic congressman you might as well vote for below sea\nIf you stay home because you don't feel like voting and you're being lazy\nThat's a half a vote for ... Schumer\nAll right let me get into this this case that has really been a mystery in terms of a global affair crisis I'm the president now said that he has dispatched his secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia immediately to discuss what's been going on here\nAnd it gets almost more bizarre by the second now\nThe allegation has banned that the Saudi ... crown prince ordered the killing\nOf this guy Jamal ... now he's a Saudi national who's been critical of the Saudi royal families Washington Post contributor\nAnd he's a U.S resident but he's not a citizen he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey October the second he hasn't been seen by anybody since that day the\nTurkish government had suggested that ... was killed by a Fifteen members Saudi hip team who then dismembered his body and smuggled it out and\nOf the consulate in pieces to an unknown destination but so far the evidence supporting that up to today has been hero some reports claiming that ... murder was recorded but to date no audiotape know videotape\nNot even the Turkish government which is no great friend of America is currently feuding with Saudi Arabia over other issues saying an absolute saying it's absolutely short because show he was killed by anyone they can't say it let alone the Saudis now there's just began to break moments ago\nAnd a reports of now surface that Saudi Arabia is preparing a report in which in fact they will admit Jamal ... show ... this is the Washington Post columnist now this is a very dangerous we start seeing journalists killed\nWent missing earlier this month was killed by interrogation gone wrong\nWhen he entered the I guess the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nRight here to talk about it we have Morgan Ortega's is with us national security global affairs analysts former U.S treasury attach to Saudi Arabia lived in Saudi Arabia two years\nOr she along with dam bond Gino former Secret Service agent author as well as the now best selling book a Spygate thank you both for being with us um Oregon you lived in Saudi Arabia two years this just breaking this has been a mystery up until like an hour ago what do you think\nHe I yes I Lived there for us to counteract that I needed something like this fracking and the reason I get it because when the president that this morning but he's sending secretary I'm here to Saudi Arabia that the secretary of state when it people in the world certainly and the guy\nPresident said this morning that he's sending secretary ... to Saudi Arabia that means the secretary of state when it does these people in the world\nCertainly in the government has canceled all the plans to fly halfway around the world\nUm I I knew was incredibly serious done and that is so\nAh we're we're going to be under tremendous pressure to come clean with whatever it is so if there were ... keep it believed and we're still going to have to just if if the records out there is what what comes out or is that the Saudis are claiming some sort of responsibility for this looks like they're not going to they're going to be cleaned the senior leadership was not involved\nBut that people are in charge of it in order to be held accountable there's a lot\nTo how was that there is no until now because how would they not know until now uh when it happened in their consulate in Istanbul\nThat doesn't have to question and I think the big takeaway that I heard from this report we'll see what happens\nBut secretary on pay me to them and let the readout as it\nDoes not only need to to come clean on this and satisfy President Trump the secretary pail you know they have an audience and the and the Congress the Senate that they're also accountable to mind you this massive arms deal is a memorandum of understanding it has not been signed that President there's bipartisan consensus for sanctions people like Rand Paul have actually\nThe very locally um an supportive of the relationship I don't agree with Senator Paul for a number of reasons that I could go into\nWhy I think the relationship it is important but the Saudis need to understand how serious it is\nWe need to know who's going to be held accountable and I think that they're going to continue to see massive\nA movement away from their big finance form it's just a few weeks secretary Mnuchin supposed to be there we saw the Dow fell off this afternoon as reports\nAnd they were a threat to the right thing to think here yeah well they were threatening you know maybe even using the power of their oil of impact any\nOf the there was a price to pay or any retribution from the U.S dam bond you know I mean this is getting more bizarre by the men and how to somebody in this particular case walk into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never get seen again\n[noise] [noise] yeah that that's highly unlikely they're really two aggravating factors here windy already brought up the fact that this happened I'm\nIn a consulate I'm a diplomatic facility that that I mean that breaks every single a protocol moral ethical role imaginable\nSecondly Sean uh aggravating as well I mean aggravating is is probably in order to sign an enormous understatement here is that he was a member of the media not that it's ever permissible please I'm not saying I'm just suggesting that this makes it even worse on the scale of Savage read the fact that this individual our cars so he was a member of the media makes it even worse\nNow how could it happen in the diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing\nIt's highly unlikely but having said that you know there's there's two sides of this there's a sign that said wait back let's see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now but we do need the Saudis there's this is not as simple as a black and white\nSituation we do need the Saudis the relationship with the Israelis starting to improve we need them where honor razors edge with the Iranians of their nuclear program so this has to be viewed that way and I do think Trump get one more thing I I think the Saudis did screw up big time when they seemingly\nTried to make these veil threats that they were going to respond you know we were supposed to be responded to there was no you can't just let this go so that was a bad move\nYeah that too yeah that's the thing that not only the threats that worried me that Dan just said it seemingly the Saudis need to answer why they like the president on this you know the president came out and said that the king and ... among the crown prince that called Jared Kushner who's working on the scale\nUnless it's something that we don't know about it looks like they have like the president and I think that they need that there's a lot of explaining to be done there\nWell I think they're going to try and pass it on to an underlying that was in the consulate in in Istanbul and say oh we didn't know but I mean I Can't imagine for a second that they don't have cameras all over the consulate in Istanbul you spent two years in the in the in Saudi Arabia\nAnd well okay you're going to happen I mean ... there's been a women I chronicled the lot on this program and ... women voting and driving in cetera and being told how to dress\nA being told that granted permission if they can travel abroad et cetera um I'm sure you had

Maxine Waters and follow ... a great crowds have used the cabinet officials follow them into grocery stores gas stations department stores what do you think is going to happen what will likely scenario if they listen to or\nNot I don't know what look what happened when Trump wasn't citing his followers to violence against again look there's a big difference\nYou're talking about a campaign event twenty sixteen\nTodd I'm Still talking [laughter]\nReally make a tight listen I as I said I didn't like those statements I did not support them I continue to not support them and at the same time what Maxine and others are talking about is a small woman water we're talking about is getting\nIt's getting visible and active and and speak and that was part of democracy can be messy ugly\nIt is part of free speech and we believe in free speech I mean I like it and I said I don't like it but I Will still defend\nNow that ... that is well paradise hotel in use somebody's going to get killed mark as I Am buddy is going to be severely hurt or killed\n... we get a New York good that I don't care if they're right wing or left wing if they're involved in those ... somebody is going to get severely hurt or trial and I don't want it to happen at any of them a little money I don't want I don't want it to happen to\nAnybody here man and I believe you Sean I Believe here and I don't want it to happen to anyone either\nRight I got it right thank you Sally eight hundred nine four one showing us our number\nYou are listening to the best of the Sean Hannity show and stay tuned more memorable moments interesting gas and a lot of fun coming up next [noise]\nHi Michelle I'm often hear one of the biggest outrageous I reported on was the trial of abortion doctor Kermit Koch now how the woman goes into a clinic comes out of there is no police report I helped expose crimes the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions\nBy the way the individual mandate would tax the president has gotten rid of the ... rid of that taxing companies who choose not to elect to pay for what your neighbor needs it was one big redistribution scheme\nNow if you deal with direct primary care direct access to doctors and we've talked about health savings accounts and we also talked about atlas MD Dr Josh amber\nAnd Dr Lee s gross this model now has been duplicated around the country and what happens is there's no pre existing conditions prejudice at all if\nYou can afford a cell phone you can pretty much afford a\nA direct access to your doctor no insurance no problem you pay for what you need fifty dollars a month for an adult ten dollars a month per child\nThey negotiate directly with the pharmaceuticals so they have Ninety to Ninety five percent reduction if you have high blood pressure if you have a cholesterol problem you walk out of the doctor's office with the medicine and a greatly reduced rate than you'd ever pay at any drug store\nIt's actually it's now been implemented in his working in over five hundred practices around the country\nIt was pioneered by my friend Dr Josh ... joins us now atlas MD and Dr Lee as gross president of doctors were patient care I'm I Am I pretty much explaining it right is there anything I'm missing and I would call this concierge care for every American\nI the only problem is Sean every time you talk about it at our phones will start bringing and we've got regular patience to\nDo you have a lot of them too right\nWe have a you know a A R o pan over there and yeah we're fulltime family physicians but no you nailed it\nWell I mean so and you have all these pay now the bottom line is I think most people like\nMe and I have friends of mine that are doctors or you know and friends of mine that will take care of me friends of mine that will take a call at three AM if I'm not feeling well\nOr which has happened occasionally in my life and these guys you know I ... I mean I pay them and they take my insurance does but they do it as more of our friendship but this is something every American can have access to\nAbsolutely\nYeah attacks plane how you're making it work there and how it works for your team exactly\nUh you know I think this is like a lot of things um Silicon Valley style\nOr Netflix or Amazon Prime uh people are being be Hoover they they want a better product faster cheaper easier and and that's what Dr gross and I've done with our respective clinics\nIs just decrease the paperwork the headaches a half of the middle man so that now medicines are penny pill now you can call ... ... email your doctor now health care with your own private doctors cheaper than a cell phone\nSo this is now they implement how many places did you get this finely\nUp and running around the country I don't think you're explaining detail on up here just plain exactly what this service does and how this can be implemented for every American\nSure there's over a thousand doctors doing the direct care model across the country and\nIt's a flat membership freight based on age it's insurance free for unlimited home visits work visits office visits it free tele medicine so you can call text email your doctor we have no co pays for anything any procedure we can do in the office is free of charge\nStitches biopsies joined generations ultrasounds heart monitors lung monitors um and then wholesale medications and labs for up to Ninety five percent savings\nI mean this is a grassroots movement and patients just need to get out and let the doctors know that this is a better way to get health care and they support it and and that's why I think we've seen this gross so much in the last several years\nAnd then what's missing is the fact that it can be duplicated now I don't know the exact complications that might exist and say a big city like New York city you know nine million people or Los Angeles and San Francisco but in small towns and smaller cities it is working Dr gross that's the point\nThat it's working everyone but I think you know people really need to understand is that you know this is not a decision between you know\nThe former correct I mean we want to go down there they are trying to take down the path of socialized total government controlled health care you know at a time where people are able to choose their health care decisions based upon their individual DNA we're going to take a one size fits all approach to health care it doesn't make any sense and\nYou know Democrats don't want their healthcare chosen by Donald Trump anymore than Republicans walked or health care chosen by Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi so you know why are we inserting the politicians into health care with it but the government control health care system when you can have a better way through a direct primary care relationship\nWhere he's not as we leave this was the failure of Obamacare you spend billions and billions more\nAnd you get far inferior care because it never really was about the patient really was always about\nRedistribution of wealth and you know I can go over like I did yesterday all the top number we already have redistribution of wealth in America you have the top three percent of taxpayers paying the majority of income one percent pays almost forty percent the top fifty percent of wage earners\nPay Ninety seven percent so what they've tried to\nDo is ... ... for example they forced the young and generally healthy Americans to buy expensive plans that they didn't need and couldn't afford and then\nFor the young and generally healthy Americans to buy expensive plans that they didn't need and couldn't afford and then penalize them if they didn't get the plan when they would have been better off paying for one check up a year right out of their own pocket\nAnd also getting a catastrophic plan if God Forbid they had the accident or got cancer or at a young age which rarely happens had a heart attack right Dr amber\nYep this is a one size fits none model um it's too expensive for young healthy people and it doesn't provide the service that older adults need in an affordable timely way and so we need to streamline the whole system the problem is that politicians have always try to\nEnsure everything but now we're to the point of ensuring you medicines that cost a penny a pill I can get a thousand ... blood pressure medicine for four dollars and Ninety cents\nSo the big box retailers will show you Ninety pills for ten dollars highway robbery we can do cancer or for for six dollars a month in some cases\nThe fact is now we just need less insurance that means health insurance is can compete on quality and and lower their price just like your Fifteen minutes we'll say Fifteen Percent on car insurance we need to get back to a competitive model for the patients are in control\nAnd cares affordable and insurance is just for the big stuff but the rare stuff\nAnd where are you with Congress though in other words these are solutions no insurance no bureaucrats you know doctors being able to do what they do their the innovators in this upfront pricing lower costs no government mentally aren't all that is true\nHow do you get Congress how many people are in Congress that are supporting your model I Know for example Rand Paul and I think Lindsey Graham or two people say well block grant the money and then let the states determine how to do it themselves which would then would I think open a path for people like you to expand I didn't even greater level\nHealthcare is local I mean that's the important thing you know the health care should be between you and your doctors and one thing that's clear the calorie is not coming from Washington to say\nNow if we wait for a solution from Washington it's not coming we need doctors and patients to get the other six cause problems themselves and that's exactly what this loop and the movement does is it eliminates\nAny asking for permission from from Washington to take care of our ...\nYeah well look I Hope that these people in Washington and here you but it's it is interesting that the one look every American worried about their health care rightly so every American has been burned by broken promises you know and the fact that the Democrats have this perception that somehow they're the great\nThe great solution the healthcare after the Obamacare debacle is laughable to me but unfortunately with voters three weeks out of an election that's how some of them feel as I read these polls\nSo uh anyway I really appreciate both of you being with us Dr Josh number Dr Lee s grows the probably one of the defining issues that caused people make people think that Democrats are actually going to help them and that's not\nA we appreciate your time eight hundred nine four one shown as a toll free telephone number if you want to be a part of the program I Will take a quick break we'll

George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist printed that she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty\nI'm In no focus on Massachusetts whatsoever\nOn this is a no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about her ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about it and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean\nBecause you're a one percent are but she also herself detected fifty thousand dollars worth of closed in one year\nTo lower her own taxes that's all is at this point\nFifty thousand dollars in old clothes that's like the Clintons you know dumping their use the underwear as if that's all true they did it as a tax deduction by the way I don't think anybody wants their old underwear\nAnd they put a value to it you know I've always said the Jeff that basically liberals are generous only with other people's money that we had the latest numbers from twenty sixteen come out and the bottom fifty percent of taxpayers in this country don't pay three percent of the bill just three we have redistribution\n... percent pay forty percent of the bill you know I mean so I mean I don't know what else the tax cuts to the fact that they want their crumbs back they want to impeach Trump they want endless investigation they want to keep Obamacare disaster they want to eliminate eyes open borders I mean that's the whole thing and hate Trump that's it\nYeah she wants to get rid of ice in fact it was a Cambridge a warrant supporter of about a month ago there was arrested for putting a five hundred dollar bounty on ice officers I mean you know her rhetoric actually is dangerous in when Republicans wanted to fix health care make it actually affordable about a year ago a she was the one that said the\nRepublicans want blood money from the American people not just right after congressman ... had been shot by that Bernie Sanders supporters so you know she really doesn't seem to be able to temper her rhetoric whatsoever and I think if you saw on Monday after the backlash of putting that video out\nA and she got a lot of backlash around the country including Democrats like David Axelrod even as critical\nOr she went on a twenty six I Believe tweet a rant about Donald Trump I'm just obsessed with Donald Trump and has no focus at whatsoever on Massachusetts and what's important here whereas a you know I've been a legislator here for eight years I've actually\nPut two billion dollars in tax cuts back in people's pockets and they know it and we've been campaigning pretty strongly I think that again you're going to be pleasantly surprised in November sex with what happens\nIs that I Hope so are you may not notice about my background but I live five years in Rhode Island ah in Warren Rhode Island not far from the ... borders with Massachusetts and you know I spent a lot of time this is by\nThe way when it was the greatest NBA time in history with magic versus Larry Bird and and parish McHale I'm DJ and Danny Ainge\nI mean it was probably one of the best teams in one of the best rivalries ever and sports ... annual hall been up I've been to Boston to lots of beautiful city but I Will tell you that you know if the people of Massachusetts don't see through this I don't know what to tell them\nWhat looked Steve grow in the former quarterback probably around the time you were there is not endorse my race that Curt Schilling indoors but most importantly\nUnderway rarely home ready he needs to indoors you [laughter] you need to get that ...\nIs the most hated man except for the New England he's the most hated man in football number one because he's a phenomenal football player and they just don't like the fact that he wins that much and they don't like the fact that they as you know a pretty wide who used to be a model they just hate him for it\nRight well look at you know ... a lot has changed since you've been here unemployment is now at the lowest we've seen in New England in Massachusetts Nineteen sixty nine that's that's for the whole country but Massachusetts is even lower it said three point five percent right now warring wants to repeal the tax cuts of two thousand Seventeen that have given our state\nMore money as far as new jobs wage increases our states collected over one point two billion dollars in unanticipated revenue because of that she called the crumbs just like a Nancy Pelosi and she if she had her way would undo that\nAnd raise your taxes I think she said fifty percent would be the baseline and she's not sure she hit Ninety percent might be too much when she was on ah MSNBC a few weeks ago Ninety percent maybe too much but at least fifty percent and then of course she wants to make it fully government run health care which as we know has a thirty six\nTrillion dollar a price tag attached to it and of course\nThat puts a bureaucrat between you and your doctor a if you like government run health care that you love having a you know to wait for a hip replacement like Canadian Stewart dialysis like people\nAre so many Canadians come to the United states when they need heart surgery because they get better care that they're willing to pay for here that's why\nLike government has to ration health care if they take it over and by the way there is no incentive to drive down costs once government becomes the guaranteed pay or just like student loans you know Elizabeth Warren complains about the cost of college course she\nCharged three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to teach one course at Harvard or but you know the fact is when government becomes the ... of the loans or whether it's a student just solitaire not doesn't matter those colleges get their money and so they drive to cost a year after year after year when government gets involved and takes the free market\nOr whether it's a student just salt or not doesn't matter those colleges get their money and so they drive to cost a year after year after year when government gets involved and takes the free market out of it as competitiveness then that's when costs become completely out of control for us the average Americans\nWell I Wish you the best in this race and I hope our friends of Massachusetts in Boston and everywhere in between low low pay attention to you know the big lie of Elizabeth Warren and understand what a real true ambitions are here\nFor her to become president you got to re elect her and Jeff deal is offering a better economic vision and better security for the people of Massachusetts and I wish you well an
