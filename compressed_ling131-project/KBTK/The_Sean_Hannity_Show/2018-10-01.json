behalf of the Republicans and conservatives in the base over all these tactics against Brett Kavanaugh um\nIs that enough for Republicans to win I Would I'd love to see a contract with America and promises made by these Republicans to insure people they're not wasting their vote\nYeah look I think there there are sprinkler steps here one is to communicate as you just did that this is about America\nThis is the most important midterm election in my lifetime and I think will be decisive in whether we keep going forward or we return to this left wing fanaticism second it really is a contest between results and resistance\nAnd whether people want to continue to create jobs to do the things that work to move and the right direction or\nGo back to the failed policies of the eight years of Obama\nAnd then third I think the Republicans should have an eye open next week we'll have shut of very positive think of it as a pledge of if if we were elected hero the next steps are all going to take care of the next good things are going to happen and I think that there are enough things working\nAnd the FBI now is being told by Democrats well it's got to be white in scope and it's got to go on for as long as need be which is the opposite of the so called agreement between a senator Coons and not not that are of ... like last week\nExactly I mean Republicans bless their hearts are so literal that they fall for this stuff every single time and they feel that they have to debate the details of this or that case when actually there's nothing to do with the details with justice itself\nThis is a tactic designed to hold onto power when\nRon ... is an Andrew Gillum got the nomination for governor in Florida My very first thought was the sentence is going to be a race to watch this has to be they're going to paint him as one within twenty four hours they flip around some use some harmless phrase next thing you know the lead of every show Ron to San Francisco racist unit was going to happen because it had to happen\nAt work where there are in Nineteen Ninety eight a radio ad in Missouri by the Democratic party said oh you know elect Republicans black cross of courses are going to be burnt on people's lawns\n... well the James Byrd at I mean Al Gore telling a predominantly black audience Republicans have the wrong agenda for African Americans they don't even want to count you in the census at all\nAnd just really outrageous claims and you know one of the things I'd like to see come out of this that what has now become a predictable tactic that they get called out on this\nBrett Kavanaugh up until two weeks ago yesterday was a gentleman gentlemen\nAnd now all of these allegations all of these solicitations\nAnd it doesn't matter like if Michael ... is making the claim that thirty six years ago that there was a gang of boys that were routinely drug ... girls and then waiting in line to gang and trail raped them\nAnd if this was happening with the regular cars but nobody said it at the time nobody told the teacher a law enforcement official apparent that it just kept going on and\nWas covered up for this long because I Know where I go to why I went to school at one kid got in trouble for anything everybody knew within seconds\nWell it's ridiculous I mean his client is alleging that she went to nine consecutive\nPublic gang raped in a row and never said anything to anybody and no one else did either and she on the tenth one was raped herself and didn't say a single word about it for thirty seven years okay I don't have time for that accent or as a whole country\nWith all sorts of real problems to address it had to walk you really have to be a Republican senator I think you had to take that seriously people fall for the same gag every single time it's football and you have like the senator from Arizona's like oh really you're hearing really\nThere are plausible claims being made yes they should be investigated this is a guy who's had six FBI investigations into his background in the space Twenty years radical clearance that allowed him the code ... nuclear arsenal that vetted\nAnd yet we need another on the basis of claims that have no sense to actually shut all member tactical question for it I'm just making the obvious point she claims that this happens from him for people she says for president of course they didn't happen and no one has the brass to ask follow up questions I mean it's a joke\nIs what's actually happening it's a joke and only the Republicans in the Senate don't know it\nWell this is the point I either some said they had no recollection ever of anything like that ever happening or being at any party in the case of a best friend she said well I I don't doubt what professor Ford is saying about I don't have any recollection\nBut also professor Ford identified one person\nAnd that was mark judge mark judge having been in the room when the alleged assault took place and he has said over and over again that's not true\nNow they made statements under\nPenalty of felony and if they so when the FBI goes back to them if they changed their story they will be admitting to committing a felony\nSo I'm not really expecting a whole lot to change here except now the Democrats put out a statement earlier today and they are now demanding all the witnesses told the FBI how to do their job and meanwhile when they had a chance last week to talk about this Ramirez or\nA Michael ... client they passed and they punted and they didn't bring it up\nBut now they want to extend it into that aspect and put so\nBut why we playing along with this I mean they actually\nThat I can tell you why because Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski they they wanted this extra work done it was supposed to be limited in scope and uh just a limited amount of time it didn't turn out that way\nJeff Flake is not in control the Senate they could pass it without flake in where the leaders other than ... and I hate to say it Lindsey Graham seems to be the only person\nWilling to tell the truth but where the rats were the other night in Republican senators out there on television and make your case not just for Brett Kavanaugh but common sense and presumption of innocence but where are these people and\nThey they control the United States Senate they haven't passed any of the agenda pretty much\nThat the president land on they're giving the finger to their own voters and on this one thing they can't just tell the truth why is that the Oregon what are you afraid of exactly I don't understand\nWhat do you think that you've been in cable news a long time you were back in the crossfire days I think even had a stint shortly at MSNBC I don't know how that worked out for you but uh\nI got fired yeah um well I mean I think that they are one opinion network and that's\nAnd as all conspiracy all hate Trump all the time but\nI'm now you've been doing really well in the Fox news channel news shows doing really well\nAnd uh what what is the difference that you think is happening with cable news today I mean we're on the opinion side of things and\nFox obviously I was a news division but I kind of look at what I Do is a talk show host as being the entire newspaper we report news sometimes it's straight news we even do investigative reporting other days and we give strong opinions other interviews we have people give opinion um we do sports\nIt's to me it's the whole newspaper all these other people claim to be reporters and they're anything but\nWe break a lot of news on our show\nWe have reporters working on the show they are all my job is to buy new things to flushed out\nKnow I I had been in this my whole life to what my family did I don't feel insecure about you know why you're not a journalist whatever I don't care what you call me but we bring new facts\nHawaii every night and I see our drop or David Ricardo explain workers to really confusing time I wrote a book about it that's what the book is how do we get here why did this happen\nWhy did Trump got elected who didn't get a black grow up what actually happened what actually happened was the people in charge made a series of incredibly dumb decisions\nAbout our culture our economy our foreign policy they never said sorry and they never learned any and so voters got mad at punished for that but why would so that's I that's what I think my job is to explain what gets me and I think you know maybe disagreement but I think that's a valuable thing to do right\nOh I think the other thing is I'm a believer in strong opinion but at least we're honest about it I'm not totally like for example there'll be days on this radio show we're all we're doing is reporting news same on TV there'll be other days we're doing investigative reporting there were days I'm just giving opinions and taking calls from people that I have opinions\nAnd that's what it's all under the umbrella of being a talk show host you know people say well Hannity you even said you're not a journalist no but I Do journalism is part of what I Do but we don't just do that [noise] um anyway talking\nA little bit weird that all the attention

where there's plenty of evidence and accusations against him well there was no destination but just basically to double standards\nIf they were here you're raising a great point if they cared about the issue they would be demanding FBI investigations\nWe can go back now to Juanita Broderick and we can certainly go back to keep that was where there's Dr reports said text messages and audiotape maybe even a videotape of him you know being emotionally abusive physically abusive towards his ex girlfriend\nSo yeah I think that would be a consistent\nOpposition for them to take but they never

to Don is an Iowa Don how're you we got about a minute it's all yours sir\nHi shot at you for taking my call and thank you for a continually bringing up the true for everybody\nI'm Glad to be here every day thank you for giving me this microphone\n[laughter] I'm basically all I wanted to say is is the obvious\nThis of this whole case is that um Ford is perfectly willing to do a judge Kavanaugh\nWhat she has accused him of doing it to her assaulting him on a daily basis with this fall state in the first and and just so much fake uh evidence everywhere\nListen she she identified and there's a there's a part of me that really sympathizes with this is such a serious issue in and I don't think we give the Republicans enough credit for how they've handled this including the president they handled it with the proper seriousness the topic deserves\nEpidemic a lot of them are young kids I mean these kids you know they get and mom and dad or grandma grandpa was medicine cabinet biking and Percocet oxycontin and they think it's fun and the next thing they know they're addicted and there's no more supplying grannies medicine cabinet\nAnd it eighty bucks a pill and then they find themselves really addicted and somebody offers a ten dollar baggage heroin and now they're a heroin addict and there were citizen rate is like eighty five percent of your addicted to this garbage and they can't get off it\nAnd then the next thing you know they're going to buy a bag of heroin that God only knows who's putting it together\nAnd they drop what is the equivalent of three grain of salt that's how tiny you would be a ... inside of the heroin and these kids die and these adults or even die\nWell I think I think there's another point to the DEA chief with interview today and he made it very clear that the biggest threat to national security\nIs the Mexican drug cartels so what's happening is it's not just that people are the article in the hill I saw that too that John Solomon wrote it and and and John Fountain wrote this article at the DEA chief I'm ... and you know the deaths in and took some statistics from the film that we did and just said you know\nThis is very serious and we're we're looking at it very closely but there's a huge misconception that the borders just about immigration when in fact the kids are dying on the other side of the border national security helps us both not an immigration issue it's a life or death issue not right or left to lie for\nI don't think anybody I don't know anyone else and media here that line I did life or death yeah no no not right or left life or death I I heard the line life or death you give them credit for that\nNow that was very good very very catchy but it's but it's true and deserve bowling often reminds us this can happen to you because it's happening to a lot of people and I don't think there's anybody listening to this program that hasn't been impacted by opioid addiction or addiction of some kind alcoholism but this is the worst\nBut it's a hundred and Ninety to tap I day a day that every day one death every seven minutes and that then by the way and there's even a lot of lives with nor can which were versus the effects are ... but not that no not a problem\n... definitely nice kids don't know it so it's like even if they're taking coke or his antics which is pretty scary for these college kids they don't know that ...\nThat no one time one dead one notes terrible alright well congratulations again when it becomes a\nBoss or when it becomes available we will tell you how to get a hold of it

those big steak foreign cutters down their own university\nOh you bet and [laughter] so what else\nI had a question have you heard any Democrats say that if the FBI investigations cruise these allegations faults that they will vote for Brett Kavanaugh\nNo maybe ... management in the end would do it I we know that Claire McCaskill's out we know Joe Donnelly is out\nI don't think Heidi Heitkamp is going to be in the only shot at any Democrat I think at this point is mansion and but you gotta remember he comes from West Virginia\nThat's pro Trump forty two percent and he probably wants to keep a job and thirty six days so I'm not even sure although I think it did vote for Neil Gorsuch if my memory serves me well but look they they want endless investigations here they are out now on a fishing expedition they want us that this was about blood thinning and destroying at all costs\nThis isn't going to be limited in scope to them this isn't going to be in a in a week no artificial timelines as soon as as soon as Jeff snowflakes that okay\nThen no bar got moved a thousand times because that's the way the Democrats play and Republicans fell right into the trap and I guess if they ask for more extensions will get more than what we need to get no no no we need another investigation into this\nWell despite new people fifty new people that have just come out today

taking my call and good to talk with you it's good to talk with you what's going on I'm very angry that Senator Feinstein oh you have a right to be totally\nMishandled the I I Do not see how she could perform her duties and responsibilities to the Judiciary Committee\nAnti American people are siding with one of your constituents\nUm I don't get it either I out of she she sat on this for six weeks she sits privately with judge Kavanaugh and tells him nothing about this nothing while simultaneously\nWorking with professor forward to hire an attorney alternately became Deborah cats who was a woman that really set some awful things as it relates to Paula Jones and then she supported our Frankenstein\nThe creepy senator from Minnesota at the time so it's not the cause for professor Ford's attorney it's a radical left wing or and now we have friends that Deborah cats now out there\nAsking people in the Georgetown ... community to come forward if they of information well that sounds like a fishing expedition to me\nIt ... I don't think there's a person in the country that not aware of what's happening right now as it relates to Brett Kavanaugh and ... even if they didn't watch the hearings they're very aware of what took place last week and if they wanted to come forward I don't know if they need letters from people\nTo do so that's my opinion a it's a yeah I think we need a full fledged investigation absolutely positively\nNo doubt about it and if we don't then we're going to you know look we get the country we deserve in the end if you liked the progress that America has been making under President\nTrump then you'd better go out and vote and thirty six days if you don't like the radicalism that you see on display now the last Fifteen days\nFifteen days ago Brett Kavanaugh had a stellar reputation if you don't think they're going to have endless investigations into Trump\nThat they don't want to impeach him there this is who they are what they do they can run on their record when Obama was president for eight years 'cause it's a disaster if you want the progress to continue for the country for the forgotten men and women I mean we barely have time to mention that the president got you\nKnow incredible new deals with both Canada and Mexico getting rid of a bad deal NAFTA now he had to break a few dishes and add to threaten the trade war but ultimately got it done because it was these what one side of trade deals and so if you don't say you're willing to pull out of a deal\nYou're never going to get a deal done and the president is effective at at negotiating\nOn all fronts I don't care if it's\nNATO and ... those countries that don't pay their fair\nEuropean ally countries of ours that have been taken advantage of us on trade issues\nIf you don't say you're willing to do it nobody will believe you and nobody will move\nBut now he's putting America First in thirty six days you'll decide their agenda is enlist investigations impeachment open borders eliminating guys keeping Obamacare and they want their crumbs back if you want that than stay home I mean go to go vote on but for the Democrats on\nElection day in thirty six days if you want progress to continue for the country\nAnd you don't want to give them this power which ... which they will abuse then you can stop it if you voted for Trump two years ago\nEverything you voted for is now in jeopardy and

I was looking at this tax bill it's fascinating because there are so many things on here that I've never heard you know a ripple about I've never heard any protest because I think people don't know\nAbout what property taxes an actor and then they get it and and all they're looking at us their house tax bill\nA lot of people never see their house tax bill because it goes to a mortgage company ... so they're not writing a ... year two thousand dollars for property tax they're not seeing it at all\nAnd so it's so easy to pass additional property taxes if you're a politician because you figure well nobody's even going to notice\nYou know I can get away with a lot of stuff on this on our tax bills now in the city of Flagstaff fist\nCategories Fifteen the lines\nOf property tax and of course every single one of them have said oh this is just a lot to a week for the last days is a little more than that\nWell I have one here for an eight plaques are and you have one for a commercial property yes I and you said in the first segment if you're just joining us it was a hundred and twenty thousand a year this is a typical\nStrip shopping center with a major tenet of some kind usually a grocery store is not always\nThe asked me the amounts are so the hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year from a strip center who gets money ... well I Would imagine that the school district gets the bulk of it\nSchool district gets about thirty three thousand thirty three thousand okay and then um the desegregation fund how much that was a twelve hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars a community college probably has a couple on there yeah they get thirty eight hundred dollars okay\nUm public health service district I hate that one\nWhat is that it should be abolished\n... hashtags abolished like health service district where where does it go that's Fifteen hundred dollars if I wanted to follow that Fifteen hundred dollars Jeff\nWhere does it go they do have some nice SUVs I've seen them parked around found there's a duck and change a little button and hit their um these health service district was created at the height of the bursting a bubble\nDuring the greatest a debt economic downturn that happens a since the great depression and I remember because I was involved in in protesting that Eighteen and a half percent tax increase\nAnd they found a way a because they were able to create a health district right um some of this a pretty short but they could create a health district\nBut the thing is is the money just dumped into the general fund so they found a way when people were struggling and they're real values of property we're decreasing and they were losing jobs\nAnd their property taxes were actually going up because it's delayed by Eighteen months they found a way to tax people more to help what was the sinking budget that's my analysis of where it came from Jerry in where the money went where the money's going now I who knows who would have a lot of money that Fifteen get on an ape Plex here\nUh so if you're living and you're talking about affordable housing the uh health district is\nSeventy eight dollars a year\nOn and they play now again that people will say well that's just a couple of ... a lot today\nUm and you just have to cut back on your ... vacation but the reality is it all adds up to many thousands of dollars a year\nWell the ... the fifteenth categories that I mentioned for this shopping center adds up to a hundred and twenty thousand a year\nWell and they'll say they'll always say that it's it's it's people rich people are paying for this I went out to dinner this past weekend and just for example the wages you remember how we were told that that was just going to be [noise] you know the rich people need to pay their fair share and start paying stop paying starvation wages\nI can tell you that those menu prices have increased dramatically and I started and that's an eleven dollars per hour I started thinking what does this mean at Fifteen fifty and at Fifteen fifty coming from eight Fifteen so approximately double in wages give or take\nThe apartments pay everybody pays property tax and yet it amazingly so many of 'em are voted in by the people they like it better when it's too bad it got to be so we will answer your question throughout the week and we'll talk\nAbout how you can uh appeal these things but I can tell you and I'm going to give you a spoiler alert the ship sailed\nYou appeal it yeah now you can't you cannot say I don't want to\nThe fire district but you could appeal rate the value of your daily the value but you miss the boat ah just about yeah but there's hope for the day thank you\nVery law right thanks for listening eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven or Jerry Lewis welcome while black man he is a candidate for legislative districts six been a couple of weeks walk back to the\nProgram manager me up yeah and congratulations on your victory in a primary election Republican primary well thank you get you on the ballot now that we're in November yeah we have two Republicans running for two seats and then of course two Democrats\nRunning for those same two seats yeah we do um and of course you can't forget a silly Allen who's also running for Senate\nFor so we have heard it so that last week and she has some she loves taxes so do you I hear actually in Korea they ... the more you know yeah you know one getting they'll let you take off those so we can start complaining to you about these property taxes how about right now\nI'm ready to get to work now so the thing is wall um last\nYear we worked and Senator Alan also worked on this represent a sore part worked on this and others in the house and Senate tried to get a bill passed that would limit the amount that local municipalities can be a Hot Tin can can raise taxes right now they do what's called the two percent increase every every year so they can do that\nIs that the only tax that they can just ... is it because they say oh we're just trying to keep up with inflation I ... I think they're trying to\nKeep up with inflation is but I don't like the two percent bill where they can just raise it I don't that's not part of that's not part of our Republican I don't that's not how the constitution altered the framers a wish that they had in mind when they were talking about that so I think any kind of an issue like that when he took it to the voters\nAnd remember that two percent ... accumulates because well yeah Jefferson I did not raise property tax for about five years and then the next council it came in raised to ten percent while they go low we got two percent per year\nAccumulating over five years let's let's do it yeah and that's the that's the challenge and um\nThere just seems to be this insatiable quest to continue to raise and let me ask you a position on when we got a lot to talk with wall and um [noise]\nWe're going to get all that plus if you have questions don't hesitate to call eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety someone but let me ask you this has been somewhat controversial and somewhat more controversial Walt\nThan I thought it would be in his proposition one twenty six\nAnd I've seen a pretty big split I seen I have seen or the left coming out portions of the left against us I have seen portions of the rights coming out against this\nI for example an elderly six I've had on the folks who are running with senator Allen who's who's four process on one twenty six year which would ban sales tax on services\nAnd then I've seen others that are a Ford I've had on Americans for prosperity and they're like I'm sitting here and they're like ... we oppose this and I'm like huh yeah who did I miss and what what do you think the ban on sales tax on services well you know I'm for it because I don't\nI don't believe that we need to continue to check small business and that's what we're doing that we're going after small business and when we do that we're going to put them out of business or we're going to make them leave\nArizona and I think one twenty six nice when you send a clear message that we support small business in our in our district and in our state and when we go a gift that uh we're just we're hurting folks there we're going to hurt the consumer\nAnd we have never ever had a tax on services so if the legislature suddenly imposed a tax on services that is a brand new tax that's coming out of everybody's pocket brand new ... it's not brand new and used to be zero now it's just like yeah yeah\nThe ... you you were arriving when we're talking about it but there's this new thing that it's not a new tax it was just zero\nYeah make sure we are in our data is not making sense well you you are in favor of the ban I'm an autographed is on service yes so that's a yes yeah well I go to get a haircut you know I I should well I don't have\nHair but we have the same Barbara yeah we have a son marvelous yeah but the folks who do you have any hair and\nGo get here because they shouldn't you know have to be alerted with that ... an artistic\nWhich it just always when we can't find a solution say raise taxes that's that's not the solution and we and we can't do that\nDo you get the theory behind it though because I think I Do they want to go folks are saying don't vote for one twenty six who who may be conservative and who are generally against new taxes their whole position behind it is we're hoping to change the taxing method which is to go to more of a consumption taxes\nAnd we need this as leverage so we can try to get rid of for example the income tax and you know and what would you say that I mean do you get that\nA garbage can have both yeah can you can have a make income tax and have a consumption tax we have to do something and\nThen we're going to get rid of the uh ... income tax that's a good thing you know Texas or they do that work on that consumption tax if we're going to do that we can't do both and I don't trust the I like to know attacks on services and then\nTo get rid of the ... taxes but you know we still need that money yeah it can't do that and Walt and well black ones I guess he's running for legislative districts six I don't it's like the Ronald Reagan thing trust but verify yeah\nLet me know when you're running that bill [laughter] folks when you're running the bill that says we are going to eliminate\nThe income tax and maybe property taxes are going to switch to a consumption model everyone's going to play pay some kind of vat tax type thing or a sales tax type thing Internet you're gonna pay all those sales taxes and then you're not going to\nLet me know when the bills written and you're voting on it and then I'll support you yeah but not before because I don't trust we're not going to get all did you happen to notice and there was an article in the Arizona Republic this morning\nThat the city of Phoenix\nIs considering loving a fee on all of the marijuana dispensaries and cultivation medical marijuana legal in Arizona medical marijuana to generate in Phoenix fifty million dollars a year\nAnd the the mayor of Phoenix now though the Williams no longer Greg Stanton the mayor was quoted as saying we
