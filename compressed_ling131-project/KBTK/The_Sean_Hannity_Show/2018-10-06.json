down an end our bender in my new book addicted to outrage I talked about how thinking like an addict or a recovering alcoholic can actually help heal the country addicted to outrage until now wherever books are so Arthur Brooks from Arthur Brooks\nDot com um make sure you listen to his podcast the Arthur Brooks show\nReally smart guy really good guy musician um grew up in you know in the Pacific northwest I'm like it's kind of sounds like you kind of had you know a typical Seattle it'd be kind of family uh and uh went around the world it in a in a documentary I think the documentary is called a so called Arthur\nThe pursuit 'em and um and he's got a fascinating life and it was just really searching for answers\nCame to find that capitalism is is what solves all these problems that we have and is made huge huge increases in happiness around the world and health\nSo my problem here ... ... and the only loose and I can't tie up is people like Rockefeller that have you know they do something because you know they're ... they they discovered oil and they were smart enough to put it all together\nAnd they accumulate this power and then with all of that money comes corruption and they start to control everybody else's lives and start making all the decisions because they have all of this money how do you\nHow do you reconcile that because I don't want to take money away from people\nRight now I got a glass and you know it is distressing when you see something like a family where there was a patriarch it was a good entrepreneur but then kind of built in ... around the\nCastle and that kept\nA bunch of wealth and the family for six generations and made it harder for other people to rise to record and capitalism that's a big problem that's actually not capitalism that's a different system that's a those basically that's a system of wired deals you could find in any socialist system any monarchy any place all around the world\nAnd that's something that we have to fight whether it's capitalism more or whatever so whatever is on whatever economic system that we've got\nWe have to democratize opportunity of the problem is not that we've got very rich people the problem is people have a hard time rising and we have to be putting\nOur resources and our energy in our law and our initiative toward people that are at the bottom not so they can all get to the top so that they can get to the middle the essence of the American experience them the moral basis of the American experience is that the the you know three generations ago the Brooks is in the\nBacks were who were just like scratching out potatoes some ways they're they're\nNothing more than ambitious riffraff who came to this country and wanted to get to the middle and support themselves and their families and we have to be warriors for system to make sure that people can go from the bottom to the middle\nYou know right now it's a very distressing thing you know you go to any good Ivy League university and you're going to find that there is a system of preferences for legacies [laughter] you know if you went to university so your four or five times more likely that your kid is going to get into that great university which all it is it's just saying\nYou you got into the lucky genetics club\nYou know that's that's actually not compatible with with a system of American opportunity with a system of equal dignity of experience so so that's actually what we need to be thinking about don't worry about Google\nWere a lot more about the fact that people at the periphery of the bottom of our society can't try is today that's that's really an American thing\nAnd why can't they rise that can't rise because we have a discriminatory system of unequal education were poor kids are locked into public education systems their parents don't have choices number one number two\nIs we don't have skills training in our communities we tell people that if they don't go to college there somehow losers [laughter]\nWe don't have a vocational and technical education systems which are the ultimate education reform we don't have an apprenticeship system in this country\nAnd most importantly glad we don't culturally value the skills that come from actually not going to college where people actually homework skills where they can get when they can get ahead if we do those things we can really recreate the opportunity society\nHow did the printed system go away\n[noise] went away for a bunch of different reasons but part of it had to do with the fact that you know back in the Nineteen ... until the Nineteen sixties there was a parallel tracking system in America\nWhere white kids would be tracked toward college and black kids especially in the south will be tracked toward the trades\nIs to is to give voice to the fact that you you want is a social systems 'cause you want something more poor\nPoor people have more equality where people have more opportunity right\nAnd get people to say yeah yeah yeah okay well let's figure out the best possible way to do it and then make the positive case for capitalism and democracy and free enterprise and entrepreneurship because it was lifted more people out of poverty in any system in human history it's created a system of\nOf equal opportunity that nobody's ever thought of in the history of humanity and say\nAnd now the problem is not that this is an equal but ... we haven't actually tried to make it as equal as possible and push it all the way out to the periphery of society let's do that together\nCan you give the arguments 'cause most I think even most conservatives are sold on the the Netherlands or Sweden when people say I want socialism like Sweden can you describe what that is\nYeah so I just have this movie the pursuit that that that you mentioned in the last segment of coming out in the spring\nAnd part of it is actually filmed in Denmark Denmark is considered to be the happiest country in the world it's a it's a social democracy it has the highest tax rates in the world about Seventy five percent of your income goes to the government\nAnd so I went there I went to Denmark and hung out with some families there and the truth is if you're into that\nYou know more power to ya but I don't see very many people were actually trying to move to Denmark I Do see lots of people in Denmark that are trying to move to America why because of the antithesis culturally of what it means to be an American that all you know Danish society Scandinavian society\nIs built on the idea don't stand out\nDon't be different don't think the ear something special don't try to if you if you're\nIn this country America is built by oddball like you know like Glenn Beck and Arthur Brooks we're due to actually try to do different things and in Denmark if you\nYou know if you want to get rich or you want to start a company or you're really super religious like you and me or or you want to have eight kids forget about it but then to look at you like you're a freak and that's a big problem so if you want to socialism is not just the social deal socialism is actually a cultural deal\nAnd so and and and basically where everybody has the same amount of money everybody has to be a lake as well so if you like being a weirdo if you like being an odd ball if you like being yourself you better stay in America and you better make the American system better don't try to get the data system\nAnd that is one reason why it has been successful one reason why it is now falling apart and one reason why would not work here is there was no diversity there was no diversity now that they have open up the borders there's diversity and people don't want to live their life that way and it's falling apart my wrong people\nAre different people are different it's like it's a country of it's a boutique society of five point three million people that the Danes they basically they they're like ... [laughter] you know they they kind of live in the shower\nAnd then when there's a whole bunch of of immigration look for in America you know despite the fact that we have these controversies about the wall and about the immigration system\nAnd that a lot of people listening to us today disagree on this fundamentally we all come from immigrants and we all like immigrants we like hard working people who come from different places and integrate into our society most of most Europeans that they can't handle it\nThey don't know how to do it they don't think of themselves as fundamentally from some other place like a thousand years ago the Danish ancestors of current Danes were Vikings living in Denmark a thousand years ago I have the slightest idea where my family was but I mean God Knows they weren't in Seattle\nUm Arthur ... one last thought people came into it and they saw what they want it to be one way or another I don't think it changed anybody's mind um it was all about politics and the politics of destruction I think um\nBut we you know when when Lindsey Graham spoke yesterday kind of feel good do a lot of people in this audience and I thought it was righteous indignation myself I think there are a lot of people that feel this way knock it off this is shameful what is happening um but there is a difference between a righteous indignation\nAnd and playing the game the way others are playing it um they're they're playing for destruction\nIf we reach out and play for destruction as well I think we lose and we we have in our own destruction people think that that is surrender you what you want me to surrender you want me not to say anything\nThat's not what I'm saying I'm saying fight the right way people kind of given up on being able to win a without playing dirty can you make the case that they shouldn't do that\nYeah I Know there were Glenn Beck speaks truth right now everybody's got a lesson this is the truth you know there is not a long term or that comes from being a bad person\nThat you know here's the key thing here that most people listening to us so they are conservatives like you and me and there were watching the the the and they have a they have their own filter bubble look we all hear things through our own experience and through our own biases I got it I got it\nBut standing up when in in righteous indignation look if you're a senator and you're in a hearing fine but for the rest of us standing up to\nThe left standing up to the other side when they're wrong around the Thanksgiving table or on social media and it's a very limited impact fly because\nWe're not going to actually be taken seriously unless we hope\nGiving table or on social media it has a very limited impact why because\nWe're not going to actually be taken seriously unless we hold our own side to the same moral standard so if we really want to be effective on the right what we need to do is we need to look at contempt\nAnd hatred and mockery and sarcasm and derision on the right and call it out and said these are not these arguments are not living up to my own moral standard\nAnd we hold ourselves to a higher moral standard we will not lose I've got the data on this one\nIs and and the long run the the moral high road which doesn't have to be weak don't have to give in to anybody else's argument but the say through love and respect I Believe that you are not living up to your own objective\nAnd said our own side we will not stand for hatred that's not who we are that's the secret to long term success\nI I Believe that we're entering a time and yesterday I think only hastened it\nWhere people see this and they don't want to be a part of either side they don't want to be a part they're good Democrats who do not stand where they have to enter bothered by that um but I don't think they have anywhere to go because\nUh we have been painted as haters but also um we are we shut down people not the way they do necessarily on the left\nBut it feels good to do that do you see any movement on the left that common sense Democrats are starting to say wait a minute I I'm not in lockstep with this\nI Do this is this is not what gets all the publicity screaming ladder is what gets all of all we'll see on the writing on the left I look at the data Seventy percent of Americans hate it they feel that they're being out on that and again this is half right wing and a half left wing Seventy percent of Americans believe that were being held hostage or being terrorized\nBy powerful people who are profiting from us hating each other\nAnd saying terrible things to each other and they don't like it they they they they want to fight back we have uh the the the opportunity to create a new moral movement where we can bring are brothers and sisters on the center left and even on the left together to try to solve some problems in this country and where we can say\nI don't hate you these kinds of what's going on in the Senate right now what's going on at the hearings right now as a proxy battle it's like an angle and the civil war where the Soviet Union in the United states are sending troops against each other than the Nineteen eighties\nTo fight it out on somebody else's battleground Americans have to say enough with\nThe ideological this ideological warfare between right and left and we're we're being the ones in the middle where we're effectively being held hostage we want better than this in this country we we don't have to back down from conservatives at all would have to recognize that we don't have to agree\nIt's okay in this country to have actual disagreement that's the basis of our excellent you know your message has always been so good pled because you don't hate anybody and we have to as leaders we have an opportunity to help Americans to love their enemies and in so doing to find the basis of our strength\nArthur Brooks thank you so much for being on the program we have to have you

the all the people that he abused and then you got to tell us ended up where there's plenty of evidence and accusations against him well there was no investigation but just basically the double standards\nIf they were here you're raising a great point if they cared about the issue they would be demanding FBI investigations\nWe can go back now to Juanita Broderick and we can certainly go back to keep that was where there's Dr reports and text messages and audiotape maybe even a videotape of him\nYou know being emotionally abusive physically abusive towards his ex girlfriend so yeah I think

for a\nContinually bringing up the true for everybody I'm Glad to be here every day thank you for giving me this microphone\n[laughter] I'm basically all I wanted to say is is the obvious\nThis of this whole case is that a Ford\nIs perfectly willing to do a judge Kavanaugh what she has accused him of doing it to her assaulting him on a daily basis with this fall state in the first and then just so much fake uh evidence everywhere\nListen she she identified and there's a there's a part of me that really sympathizes with this is such a serious issue in and I don't think we give the Republicans enough credit for how they've handled us including the president they handled it with the proper seriousness the topic deserves\nShe gave the names of four people and none of the pork and corroborate her story including the guy that was supposed to be an eye witness to it at that point\nThey were really you can't go any further with it and he adamantly denies it so it's um it's a matter of just simple okay if somebody corroborated it we'd be in a very different position today I got to take a quick break final have power\nFree for all our Sean Hannity show and we will continue from our nation's capital Hannity tonight nine eastern on Fox\nAnd you're listening to the best of the Sean Hannity show we'll have more of your favorite gas topics and memorable moments that's all coming up [noise]\n\nHi Michelle mocking here if you tell them I work you know the one of the biggest outrageous I reported on was the trial of abortion doctor Kermit costs now and how the woman goes into a funny comes out of there is no police report I helped expose crimes the mainstream media tried to cover up\nBetween a senator Coons and not enough in honor of ... like last week\nExactly I mean Republicans bless their hearts are so literal that they fall for this stuff every single time and they feel that they have to debate the details of this or that taste one actually has nothing to do with the details with justice itself this is a tactic designed to hold on to power when\nRon ... is an Andrew Gillum got the nomination for governor in Florida My very first thought was the census is going to be racist watch this has to be they're going to paint him as one within twenty four hours they flip around some some harmless phrased next thing you know the lead of every show Ron to San Francisco racist you knew it was going to happen because it had to happen\nA lot greater there are in Nineteen Ninety eight a radio ad in Missouri by the Democratic party ... uh you know if you look Republicans black cross a cost is going to be burnt on people's lawns\nOr ... well the James Byrd add I mean Al Gore telling a predominantly black audience Republicans have the wrong agenda for African Americans they don't even want to count you in the census at all and just really outrageous claims and you know one of the things I'd like\nTo see come out of this that what has now become a predictable tactic that they get called out on this Brett Kavanaugh up until two weeks ago yesterday was a gentleman gentlemen\nAnd now all of these allegations all of these solicitations and it doesn't matter like if Michael ... making the claim that thirty six years ago that there was a gang of boys that were routinely drug ing girls\nAnd then waiting in line to gang in trail raped them and that this was happening with the regular cars but nobody said it at the time nobody told the teacher a law enforcement official apparent that it just kept going on\nAnd was covered up for this long because I Know where I go to where I went to school in one kid got in trouble for anything everybody knew within seconds\nWell it's ridiculous I mean his client is alleging that she went to nine consecutive\n... gang raped in a row and never said anything to anybody and no one else does either in she on the tenth one was raped herself\nAnd didn't say a single word about it for thirty seven years okay I don't have time for that actually there's a whole country\nWith all sorts of real problems to address to what you really have to be a Republican senator since you had to take that seriously these people fall for the same gag every single time river football\nAnd you have like Senator from Arizona's like oh really you're hearing really there are multiple claims being made yes they should be investigated this is a guy who's had six FBI investigations into his background in space Twenty years radical clearance that allowed him the codes ... nuclear arsenal\nThat ...\nAnd yet we needed another on the basis of claims that have no sense to actually shut all men not tactical question for it I'm just making the obvious point she claims that this happened to him for people she says for president of course they didn't happen and no one has the brass to ask follow up questions in the\nBook it's a joke is what's actually happening it's a joke and only the Republicans in the Senate don't know it\nWell this is about either some said they had no recollection ever of anything like that ever happening or being at any party in the case of her best friend she said well I I don't doubt what professor for to saying about I don't have any recollection\nBut also professor of foreign identified one person and that was mark judge and mark judge having been in the room when the alleged assault took place and he has said over and over again that's not true\nNow they made statements under\nPenalty of felony and if they so when the FBI goes back to them if they changed their story they would be admitting to committing a felony\nSo I'm not really expecting a whole lot to change here except now the Democrats are put out a statement earlier today and they are now demanding all the witnesses telling the FBI how to do their job and meanwhile when they had a chance last week to talk about Mrs Ramirez or\nA Michael ... client they passed and they punted and they didn't bring it up\nBut now they want to extend it into that aspect and put some\nBut why we playing along with this I mean they actually\nGot to tell you why because Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski they they wanted this extra work done it was supposed to be limited in scope and uh just a limited amount of time it didn't turn out that way\nJeff Flake is not in control the Senate they could pass it without flake in where the leaders other than ... and I hate to say it Lindsey Graham seems to be the only person\nWilling to tell the truth but we're the rats were the other Nineteen Republican senators out there on television make their case noxious for Brett Kavanaugh but common sense and presumption of innocence but where are these people and\nThey they control the United States Senate they haven't passed any of your gender pretty much that the president Lana undercutting the finger to their own voters and on this one thing they can't just tell the truth\nWhy is that for art or were they afraid of exactly I don't understand\nWhat do you think that you've been in cable news a long time you were back in the crossfire days I think even had a stint shortly at MSNBC I don't know how that worked out for you but uh I got fired\nUm well I mean I think that they are one opinion network and that's it and is all conspiracy all hate Trump all the time but\nI'm now you've been doing really well in the Fox news channel news shows doing really well\nAnd uh what is the difference that you think is happening with cable news today I mean we're on the opinion side of things and\nFox obviously as a news division but I kind of look at what I Do is talk show host as being the entire newspaper we report news sometimes it's straight news we even do investigative reporting other days and we give strong opinions other interviews we have people\nWe do sports we do culture pop culture it's to me it's the whole newspaper all these other people claim to be reporters and they're anything but\nWe break a lot of news on our show and we have reporters working on the show they're all like job is to buy new things to flushed out\nInterviews I mean I you know I I had been in this my whole life to what my family did I don't feel insecure about you know why you're not a journalist whatever I don't care what you call me but we bring new facts Hawaii\nEvery night and I see are dropped more than ... ... it's a really confusing time I wrote a book about it that's what the book is how do we get here why did this happen why did Trump got elected who didn't get a black to grow up what actually happened what actually happened was\nThe people in charge made a series of incredibly dumb decisions\nAbout our culture our economy our foreign policy they never said sorry and they never learned any and so ... got mad at punish them for that but why we're so that I that's what I think my job is to explain what gets me and I think you know maybe disagreement but I think that's a valuable thing to do right\nNo I think the other thing is I'm a believer in strong opinion but at least we're honest about it I got totally like for example there'll be days on this radio show we're all we're doing is reporting news same on TV there'll be other days we're doing investigative reporting there were days I'm just giving opinions and taking calls from people that have opinions\nAnd that's what it's all under the umbrella of being a talk show host you know people say well Hannity you even said you're not a journalist no but I Do journalism is part of what I Do but we don't just do that [noise] um anyway talking\nA little bit weird that all the attention that we get there is like nine people in the media who disagree with the prevailing story line and they need to be crushed her silence why don't\nYou know what I mean there are less than nine Tucker there's yeah I Know it's a handful of us Tucker there's not that many and by the way there's a orchestrated effort and millions of dollars being spent to shut down any anybody that dares\nTo not hold that prevailing left wing view but anyway we're putting it up on Hannity or on the website

quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nAll three cases that the the Democrats now want or expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know floods investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work but if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen\nAnd then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nWill the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mr Ramirez was calling former yell classmates and asking them if they remembered and that she wasn't short short herself civil is Brett Kavanaugh\nSo that should go away and this one I think is the worst of all and I I guess there's no standards at NBC News any more if they're going to put on somebody that they can't corroborate the stories whose changing or story almost you know by the hour seemingly\nOr even the Democrats have declined to fully embrace the Julie sweat next story but on the original story that Christine for a story\nI think what we're going to find and what we're already finding is that the people who gave statements to the Senate Judiciary committee like PJ Smith and mark judge amazingly enough\nThey're telling the FBI the same thing I told you this shirt committee which they have no memory at all to support this\nNow I think it's probably a good thing to get additional recollections or you're not remember\nA Senator Whitehouse and other Democrats made a big deal with this party entry and the Brett Kavanaugh calendar July first Nineteen eighty two thirty six years in three months ago by the way\nUm and it listed who is that the party and it didn't match up with um with Christine forks account of this but they thought this was a big deal so let's talk to those people and I think my feeling is that that I think there are three additional people calm Bernie and squeeze\nA who had not been interviewed earlier a and I think you're going to find three more people who don't know anything about\nA Christine ports are allegations so uh I listen I I I don't think this FBI thing FBI investigation is a bad thing I think that they will find out\nThat there is no evidence to support this did find out actual real evidence to support it then I changed my mind but I don't think it's there\nWell if you go through I I thought it was really devastating new report by Rachel Mitchell um now he's the independent prosecutor she prosecute sex crimes and she was hired by the Senate and I think rightly by the Republicans that they wanted to be\nExtremely courteous and thoughtful and and take this very seriously and not make a political so they brought in an independent prosecutor to to question professor Ford who showed incredible respect on her\nBut she pointed out that he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove itself\nAnd then she goes on this cases even weaker than that and then she Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them and for reasons discuss below I don't think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nAnd then she went on to list all the issues there was no consistent account and she gives the example after example of when the alleged assault\nHappened I mean the dates keeps shifting back and forth dramatically actually\nThe failure to previously identified judge Kavanaugh as the assailant a inconsistent descriptions of the alleged assault a failure to remember key details who invited forward to the party how did you get to the party where did the party even take place how did you get home from the party\nUm and and it goes on from there but every case is similar in as much as there is no cooperation their big holes in the stories and at some point when do we ask is this becoming a witch hunt we know that Deborah Katz says her friend sending out emails\nAnd she's a woman that went after Paula Jones and supported Al Franken so she's not exactly consistent on the issue of of sexual misconduct\nAnd they're sending out letters to here so and so ... do you know anything please call us do those letters went out\nI Know some core operation you know the ... case right here at times they said they call they talked to dozens of people not to me that says twenty four people or more I mean that is a lot of people can look at it on on the Rachel ritual thing\nYou know she was a lot of criticism for her and um I think that the way she approached it was not a really good way given the limitations of a Senate hearing where they owe it and she had to be interrupted every five minutes but she did\nIt listed a lot of information I was looking today at her questioning of a Ford about her therapist and therapists notes and the white we even know about this because remember\nFord says it took place in the summer of Nineteen eighty two she did not tell anybody for ten twenty thirty thirty six years\nTo two thousand twelve and she ... she says she's in marriage therapy with her husband and she tells the therapist about that and she later also tells an individual therapist about that as well and she checks the therapists notes and therapists notes do not mention the name\nBrett Kavanaugh and she says as a matter of fact it's only her husband remembering that at the session she brought up Brett Kavanaugh's name that\nIs the only evidence that it took place in the therapy sessions and by the way you would think such therapy sessions and the ... there are would be confidential but of course she gave them to the Washington Post so there's probably no longer\nA confidential so even even her account of how she finally mentioned this to someone after thirty six years raises a lot of questions\nIt really is amazing now we have Judiciary Committee Democrats now they're wanting to investigate the quote ice throwing incident in college you know this is what it sounds\nLike you're telling the truth but that's what they say\nNow we have the Democratic hold a Hawaii senator the one that sent to men to just shut up and sit down and Renault yeah Geraldo is now saying that she wants that investigation into the ice throwing incident I'm at a ballgame and on top of that now they're questioning the veracity\nAbout was he truthful about his drinking he said he ... he liked to drink beer then he likes to drink beer now he said yeah there were plenty of times like a lot of college and high school kids I drink too much beer\nBut they're saying well he must have blacked out in this event um nobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said to somebody I blacked out\nCorrect so does he look till the fishing expedition this is now a destroy Kavanaugh expedition they don't care\nAnything except destroying him so here you know ... question\nBut we're we're told us that things could change\nYeah I'm from an emphasis on the sex misconduct allegations to work a truthful about his drinking and I think that's a reflection of the fact that there really isn't any evidence to support the sex or allegations and now they're\nTalking about whether he told the truth about drinking although you mentioned many times in his testimony that he did um in fact\nDrink today rocks harbors an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word of his testimony about his drinking\nTricare mischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nOr they got to let it go there thank you so much Byron York uh with us on Washington Examiner eight hundred nine four one showing us our toll free
