Sally was risking her life it and fighting for\nAnyway the cinema campaign would not say why she invited the weight which is er clarify why she thought members of the cult deserved a seat at the table during discussions concerning war and peace the which is in question it should be noted claimed to practice only non violent magic\nCinema encourage the which is to wear colorful clothing come ready to dance ... stay in touch with your inner creativity and with the earth\nAh I don't even know what to say [laughter]\n[noise] anyway the people Arizona you're paying attention or we have a breaking tape that we're gonna Claire McCaskill's team is going to want to pay very close attention to\nThat last week we showed you the tape project very toss with ah the campaign surrounding Brett is a news the former governor of the state of\nTennessee and now he's running for the open Senate seat of Bob Corker Corker but thank goodness Marsha Blackburn is now pulled out a fourteen point lead in the latest polls she was down for a little while\nA lot of people were concerned about it but I think now that they see that reticent staff is basically saying he's saying one thing that the people at Tennessee I'm planning to do something very differently\nBut where do you see the tape that we have tonight as it relates to Claire McCaskill another important red state Democrats Senate race that's going on member you vote for Claire McCaskill you might as well vote for Schumer you vote for any democratic congressman you might as well vote for below sea\nIf you stay home because you don't feel like voting and you're being lazy well that's a half a vote for ... Schumer\nAll right let me get into this this case that has really been a mystery in terms of a global affair crisis I'm the president now says that he has dispatched his secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia immediately to discuss what's been going on here\nAnd it gets almost more bizarre by the second now the allegation has banned that the Saudi ... crown prince ordered the killing\nOf this guy Jamal ... now he's a Saudi national who's been critical of the Saudi royal families Washington Post contributor\nAnd he's a U.S resident but he's not a citizen he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey October the second he hasn't been seen by anybody since that day\nThe Turkish government had suggested that ... was killed by a Fifteen members Saudi his team who then dismembered his body and smuggled it out and\nOf the consulate in pieces to an unknown destination but so far the evidence supporting that up to today is been hero some reports claiming that ... murder was recorded but to date no audiotape know videotape\nNot even the Turkish government which is no great friend of America is currently feuding with Saudi Arabia over other issues saying an absolute saying it's absolutely short because show he was killed by anyone they can't say it let alone the Saudis now there's just began to break moments ago\nAnd a reports of now surface that Saudi Arabia is preparing a report in which in fact they will admit Jamal ... show he this was the Washington Post columnist now this is a very dangerous we start seeing journalists killed went missing earlier this month\nKilled by interrogation gone wrong um when he entered the I guess the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nRight here to talk about it we have Morgan Ortega's is with us national security global affairs analysts former U.S treasury attached to Saudi Arabia lived in Saudi Arabia two years\nOr she along with dam bond Gino former Secret Service agent author as well as the now best selling book a Spygate thank you both for being with us um Oregon you lived in Saudi Arabia two years this just breaking this has been a mystery up until like an hour ago what do you think\nRight [noise] yeah yes and I lived there for ... can interact that I needed something like this fracking and the reason I get it because when the president that this morning but he's sending secretary I'm here to Saudi Arabia that the secretary of state when they see these people\nAnd I did is because when the president said this morning that he's sending secretary on paying to Saudi Arabia that made the secretary of state when it did these people in the world certainly in the government has canceled all the plans to fly halfway around the world um I I knew was incredibly serious done and that is so\nAh we're we're going to be under tremendous pressure to come clean with whatever it is so if there were court to keep it believed and we're still going to have to just\nIf if the records are out there as well what comes out or is that the Saudis are claiming some sort of responsibility for this looks like they're not going to they're going to claim the senior leadership was not involved but that people are in charge of it in order to be held accountable there's a lot\nTo how was your ... there's no until now because of how would they not know until now uh when it happened in their consulate in Istanbul\nThat just didn't have to question and I think the big takeaway that I have from this report we'll see what happens with secretary\nHunt pay me to them and let the readout as it does not only need to to come clean on this and satisfy President Trump and secretary um pail you know they also have an audience and and the Congress the Senate that they're also accountable to mind you this massive arms deal is a memorandum of understanding it has not been signed by the\nPresident there's bipartisan consensus for sanctions people like Rand Paul have actually\nThe very locally um I'm supportive of the relationship I don't agree with senator call for a number of reasons that I could go into\nWhy I think the relationship it is important but the Saudis need to understand how serious that says\nWe need to know who's going to be held accountable and I think that they're going to continue to see massive\nA movement away from their big finance form it's just a few weeks secretary Mnuchin supposed to be there we saw the Dow fell off this afternoon as reports\nAnd they were threatening stickier yeah well they were threatening you know\nMaybe even using the power of their oil of in fact any of the there was a price to pay or any retribution from the U.S Dan bonds you know I mean is getting more bizarre by the men and how to somebody in this particular case walk into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never get seen again\n[noise] [noise] yeah that that's highly unlikely she'll never really to aggravating factors year one year already brought up the fact that this happened\nIn a consulate I'm a diplomatic facility that that I mean that breaks every single a protocol moral ethical role imaginable\nSecondly Sean uh aggravating as well and you know aggravating is is probably in order to sign an enormous understatement here is that he was a member of the media not that this is ever permissible please I'm not saying I'm just suggesting that this makes it even worse on the scale of Savage reached the fact that this individual aka so he was a member of the media makes it even worse\nNow how could it happen in the diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing\nAnd highly unlikely but having said that\nYou know there's there's two sides of this there's the side that said way back let's see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now but we do need the Saudis there's this is not a ... as simple as a black and white\nSituation we do need the Saudis the relationship with the Israelis are starting to improve we need them were on a razors edge with the Iranians of their nuclear program so this has to be viewed that way and I do think Trump get one more thing though show I I think the Saudis did screw up big time when they seemingly\nTried to make these veil threats that they were going to respond\nYou know we were they had to be responded to there was no you can't just let this go so\nThat was a bad move yeah they're ... to ... and just assumed that\nThe thing that not only the threats that worried me that Dan just said it seemingly the Saudis need to answer why they live with the president on this you know the president came out and said that the king and ... among the crown prince had called Jared Kushner who's working on the scale unless there's something that we don't know about it looked like they have like the president and I think that they need that there's a lot of explaining to be done there\nWell I think they're going to try and pass it on to an underlying that was in the consulate in in Istanbul and say oh we didn't know but\nI mean I I Can't imagine for a second that they don't have cameras all over the consulate in Istanbul you spent two years in the\nIn the in Saudi Arabia and well okay you're going to happen I mean the the women\nI chronicled the lot on this program and ... women voting in driving et cetera and being told how to dress or being told that granted permission if they can travel abroad et cetera um I'm sure you had to cover up if you left\nIf you went out and public anywhere and what was life life like for you as a woman

to I'm All right let's go to our phones we had a rubber does in a king North Carolina Robert Hi how are you glad you called sir\nA very very very honored to speak with you a very but I Do need your help um I have a daughter twenty to a lesser she didn't vote for Trump She\nUh pretty much one against the grain of everything he used on ah luckily have been able to get her to see the good and everything that Trump has done for this country\nWhere I'm Adam ... is with judge Kavanaugh um she just I Can't get her to see the conservative side of it how the Democrats are going to\nBad mouth anybody call anybody for to bad mouth you know our values and I I Can't\nGet oh look I mean we spend a lot of time going over all the allegations and in the case or professor Ford or best Ramirez or\nMiss sweat they get that cetera I mean in every particular case and um I Would just lay out to your daughter and then go over you know what the allegations were how they came out whereas any corroboration and any of the cases I mean\nI thought the most outrageous one was the final one to get by miss sweating egg you was claiming and her story shifted in changed dramatically within the course of a week from my perspective\nAnd I think you know she was basically claiming almost on a weekend basis that these kids were drugging\nThese young girls teenage girls and boys will wind up in the halls and they were waiting their turn to gang rape the girls\nNow ... hard pressed you know again that the media looks high or low why didn't far to find any cooperation and they weren't able to the case of miss forward the one I witnessed she placed in the room so that didn't happen or even her best friend says she doesn't remember any parties that she was out with judge Kavanaugh so\nYou do need some type of corroboration if you believe in due\nProcess in presumption of innocence\nAnd I think we I think the Republicans handled it with the\nSensitivity of deserves with the severity of deserves considering the severity of the allegations\nBut I'm not a person that Russia is a judgment on ... you have to I Believe that it served this country well to follow the rule of law\nAnd due process and a presumption of innocence and I think that happened in this case and I think the person that laid out the best case and that was what Susan Collins\nAnyway thank you Robert good luck with that um let me play you know twenty two days I just want to remind you\nWe now know I was telling your earlier in the program today Democrats or advice don't talk about open borders in an elimination guys anymore it's not helping us don't talk about impeachment is not helping us even Maxine Waters admitted that they're telling your don't talk about these things\nYou know but remember this will be their agenda in twenty two days they will want endless investigations they will want impeachment they want to open borders they want to eliminate ice they won Obamacare and they want their crumbs back\nAnd this woman Nancy Pelosi would be your speaker so pretty much if you vote for a Democrat you're voting for Nancy Pelosi and her views on her values which are radical San Francisco views and

say Hi to skip is in Utah skip Hi how are you glad you called\nExtra thanks for taking my call I'm listening to question what are these people run on a single sheet of most of the scares me the most is they seem to be running on a hatred for America I'm not put up with everything that America stands for is just seems to be being destroyed by these\nI don't want to wait until the broad brush in St Louis left the left hates America I think there is a a a significant even at times portion of the radical left in this country that literally\nThey hate us\nAmerican exceptionalism America's role in the world\nUm they don't like our economic system they believe in they don't believe in capitalism they support socialism they bought redistribution they don't want freedom um and you see an anger that has emerged because I think they are now focused all of their anger on Donald Trump and all things Trump\nAnd you know it's just it's just pouring out of them\nYou know we've tried a lot of these policies we've tried apologizing we've tried bribing dictators under Obama we tried redistribution under Obama we've tried socialized medicine under Obama and he's the first president never reach three percent GDP Growth in the history of the country\nYou know we know the disaster of Obamacare no millions lost their doctors their plans and they paid twice three times the amount they weren't pay in spite of promises a we know that at the end of his eight years we had Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps and eight million more in poverty\nYou know numbers means something\nAnd frankly to go back to the failed policies now look Obama might even be considered moderate compared to where the Democratic party is in the house and the Senate today\nYou know you have one moderate that Joe Manchin that's it and the rest of 'em are all pretty radical left and they don't apologize for their quote socialist belief that is the emerging Democratic Party\n... weekdays at eight Ninety

North Korea the total line we're not we're not in distress the problem is is that the other side of the left wants to paint embarrassed that country is is going down the wayside because not because it is because it isn't because they just don't like the commander in chief\nSo they do all these things like a fly the flag upside down and ruin a person's life which is totally totally a inappropriate unprofessional and if the white did anything near that they they would have us hanging upside down\nYeah and you know what they I mean some people I've gotten some flak for this because people say oh it's a it's a it's a freedom of speech issue um and some conservatives did it during Obama's tenure as I say now conservatives did it wrong if liberals do it wrong\nWrong wrong wrong is wrong and I agree with you know what it is their First Amendment right individual has a right to bought firefighting upside down you know however it if if if the country is in distress where you know and that I mean even on nine eleven\nThe flight was not flown upside down and we were attacked yeah we lost over three thousand people I'm On an all day and they didn't fly the flag upside down and that's the cause of the stress but we did do it why because because we believe in our country believe in religion and she\nUh President Bush at the time we believe in the armed forces\nAnd why would we want to spend a negative though across the world that like that um when a when folks just unhappy with the commander in chief not happy with it you know kitten volunteering don't don't fly the flag upside down\nHustling absolutely and I and I think Walter ... as a commander in a tank over there where I'm sure you were under some some certainly distrustful and stressful situations and you'd never do you know what I'm saying it's like oh just because you don't have\nAnd as you said as I was coming in today um I Would look at the My Lai and there was a trainer had military vehicles on and they had\nUm a convoy of vehicles at the top of the and got down to a Bradley takes you know brought back some memories there yeah and that what we're talking about you know somebody flying the flag upside down\nSo you know I Would dare say if you feel like you're in distress get in a Humvee a riot in the middle of Baghdad or Lucia or are in Afghanistan and when your vehicle starts blowing up around yet that's the stress what we're doing right now we have people that that are just upset commander in chief he has\nA a President Trump and lovers five doesn't like it so I can show them just the stress the like and it's not worth now\nWhile black means my gas and he's all over the state right now I'm a bit more voting right now are you got a couple of weeks lasted in November sixth obviously the
