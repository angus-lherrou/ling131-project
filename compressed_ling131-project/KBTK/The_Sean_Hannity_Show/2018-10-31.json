we can do to educate them on the importance and the seriousness of this election and all that is at stake and Sean I've been using your talking points to convince my adult children that every single vote is important and what's at risk if they don't vote and here in our house we turn to boats into three to five\nAnd then possibly even more because our kids took the message to their friends their college classmates\nAnd some of them ended up voting as well so I'm a couple of weeks ago I spent three hours on the road driving a mail in ballots semi adult child who's a student at University of Colorado just to make sure that that one single vote is cast and counted so\nHey everybody do whatever it takes to get their vote in um offered to drive them to vote ... percent pay for their overpay

almost every parent who's that Syrians are\nMaking sure that the children and making sure that they understand the issues are going to be voting on I think that's a that's a great statement that you

up today did they just like these people in without any inoculations I mean why the CDC or somebody getting upset about their\nWhat will listen I I I Want to be very clear 'cause I think a lot of people of um I I think that's almost been used as like a scare tactic they uh people let me tell you what I think Mr Speaker see if you agree with us\nYou know I think the Ninety nine percent of people that were in a caravan they see America as the land of milk and honey and opportunity which we kind of take for granted sometimes as Americans and I'm sure that Ninety nine point eight percent of them are probably good people that just want a better life\nUm we can't vouch for any of those people in terms of other enemies of America that are mixed themselves into that ...\nThe idea that we're going to have five seven fourteen thousand whatever the numbers are different estimates remember everybody just get to our border in charge across a there is no respect for American law our constitution our sovereignty or we don't know we need to be able to vet people\nI Believe in a border wall with the door because uh we just want to make sure the people that come to this country can sustain themselves and secondly I Want to make sure that they're not enemies of this country and we can let them that's all it's for the safety and security of everyone that is a citizen here\nYou know I think that's basically right and I think part of what people fail to realize the\nDegree just short period of American immigration which really made us the extraordinary country than we are that period began um when there was no welfare state to people who came to America came to America expecting to work and they came to America expecting to learn English\nAnd uh I take good as the

I Do I have a kid you know I'm not really enough empires and Kristen Stewart although the you know [laughter] and where will\nNervous because I didn't know what you were talking about but Don I talked

that can I tell you what you inspired me to do\nWith ... told me I Love inspiring people okay so\nI ran around telling everybody that I got on your show and everybody was like were you nervous afraid and I don't know but what I realized was when we're talking about the young and how are we going to get people to tune in to a conservative talk radio\nI laugh when I said well let's see North Dakota right worked in the oil field\nAnd now in the evening I came in after scrubbing toilets a certain amount of cleaning business out there either cleaning and catering business right yeah so I come in at night and I was in my truck because that's where I could contain audio and I hated the ballot the angel of show and it was created for\nPeople that don't normally listening to talk radio so the silent majority Eighteen year old rough next sixty year old black liberals women were listening to my children at the highlight of it I had a following of like twenty thirty some thousand\nAlso internationally as well yeah that's good for you well let me ask you this\nI'm back here in Minneapolis and it might actually go read and do the job that we need to do and prove to try that we a hundred percent a hundred and fifty percent support him because it's mass of the Trump train and I and some fat Newberg\nHas closed the gap for Clovis shower ward low is Thirteen percent higher than Allison\nThere's some really good signs here for going red in Minneapolis\nWell the last thing is I Want to remind people there are very important\nHouse races in uh Minneapolis or in well in Minnesota for those race um that are going to tip the balance of power like Southern California it's interesting New York New Jersey\nOr places like Minnesota Wisconsin Michigan California state you wouldn't expect that's where a lot of these tossup races that I keep talking about our um look let me ask you when you move to North Dakota and you're in the radio show and you started your own business\nAt Bloomberg weighing in with another two or three million dollars in this last week as well\nUm you don't many cultures are normally your adversaries John and I'm proud of mine\nWell you know I mean the same thing we were talking earlier maybe water is a Walter season California's forty fifth district but I think there's that Michael Bloomberg is the former mayor of New Yorkers spending some nine million dollars alone in Southern California and how much they poured into the race of negative ads against you\n[noise] it's been it's been ... about two to one at this point no you're not spent two to wander the good news people know me and so\nYou know their lives that they tell really aren't getting the narrative but we're all male in state every all ballots have been out for a ... for a week and a half now and so every day's election day every day is election day I got the most left wing opponent I've ever had\nA you know she she woke up the day after Hillary law and decided that you need to be a member of Congress and this march and more angry protests in Seattle them grades in the district\nYou know thinks it hating the president and somehow a qualification to be a member of Congress Bush on I think we're all hoping for more than that aren't we\nDo get it well of course we are we want to help the forgotten men and women and we have a trajectory of success or that I think has been unparalleled the as quick as any politician as promised stuff and then make those promises happen\n[laughter] yeah it's it's it's just ridiculous that that is essentially what she's running on and on and so we're we've been doing everything from going door to door or eight thousand house personally I'm a second pair of shoes\nAre winning people become make phone calls doorbell with a volunteer contribute you know Dino Rossi dot com come help\nYeah what what do you think you get a day by day return in terms of a Republican Democrat or do they not give that information out there and\nWe don't register by party in our state so it's only based on what we've I deed and uh and our people are voting but so we're there's clearly in a masters we really got to get people to Maryland I doubt anybody listening to us right now if you haven't senator about do it now get your family to do it all your friends get it in because\nThe sooner comes in the same work take off your list a heartless doing gets at the heart cases who may or may not vote must we talked to him\nWell she's just writing running basically on hate as you said so that's the main difference she wants Obamacare let me guess she wants to impeach the president he wants to open borders she wants the crumbs back anything else that's any different from the rest of the checklist of every other Democrat running well\nThat is a checklist we have a few other things that are that we're in the ad obviously we we we don't have a state income tax or state she favorites that\nThat's been turned down nine times by the public are here but she's she's still on that bandwagon\nOr you know and she's actually all the time for a for not being a fan of Obamacare when Obamacare team in Boston healthcare myself my wife and my my four children and I ended up with a lousy plan to cast too and at times as much coverage things I Want coverage covers and I didn't want covered the twelve thousand dollar family deductible on top of that you\nKnow my goal is to have as many health insurance companies chasing people around for their business we can possibly get so you can decide what's your plan or some bureaucratic politician decided for you it's called freedom\nWell listen we wish you the best Dino Rossi a that is the difference in this between\nRepublicans and a conservative agenda or the radical left agenda Nancy Pelosi I keep reminding people vote for any Democrat anywhere in the country is a vote for her and it is because all electric speaker\nAnd a vote for any Democrat in the Senate well that's pretty much a vote for Schumer so I Hope the people in Washington state's eighth district get out there for Dino Rossi\nUh I Know you have done a good job and you worked hard and a sadly you have to take all of the incoming it's pretty pathetic\nUm but thank you so much for being with us and we wish you all all the best is just one of those races the Washington state eighth district where this was the tipping point the balance of power\nIs right there if you're in Dino Rossi district there I think you wish you the best\nThank you very much on take care\nRight eight hundred dying for one Sean as hard toll free telephone number if you want to be a part of the program all you've been telling me all day that you want to do something funny and that you're not even

coffee coffee it it is coffee say you know if somebody said to me today talk talk so yesterday I answered the phone and this guy was calling from Texas and he had a nice town it but it took them Thirteen Years to get there so I said please be this up a little bit and he goes listen they became [laughter]\nThis is talk here from New York I hear you talk real time [laughter] and that's just the way it's going to be I was like you know look like nobody calls me ... ... oh who drank baby maybe\nOh you're from New York I hear you talk real fast [laughter] and that's just the way it's going to be I was like you know a click nobody calls me ... to ...\nMaybe maybe the last person I Would think that will get insulted at anything settled baby assigned sweetheart dialing honeybee ... like all the baby sugar bye honey bunch\nWe can make a song right I think oh there we go so anyways so and I was thinking that it will be a lonely or I had a good so we're going to keep interrupting your show has your terrible listening oh no you're not\nTelling them you're on my head right I can reclaim lifetime just think about Maxine Waters is the head of financial committee to think about that for one second just a brief diversion so\nI was thinking it might be nice if on election night you hosted your own show and I think we should take a poll and see if America would like to see host your own channel okay well\n... ... you're saying is which has been a factor all my twenty three years of fog since I don't work on election I this is true and it's all Fox the news division that takes over and I went one year I went in and uh you know I was on for five minutes and I'm like I I Want to be home alone\nAnd I want to have my three TV sets off for depending if I can set up another one in the meantime\nAnd my six computers and I want to do what I always do I want to be looking at percentages and finding out beforehand whether we're winning or losing now the former president of Fox News bill shine can attest to the fact that has emails to the fact\nThat I have called it right before anybody else every single election year because you know I'm sitting there looking at let's see uh uh Cuyahoga County and Palm Beach county and the panhandle and southwest Florida\nAnd I could figure out usually Broward County all these important counties whether or not Republicans are going to win or lose now there's a little tougher because of\nThe different congressional races my guess is it's going to be late into the morning before we can ascertain who can maintain control of the house\nIn large part because California matters Southern California we've been featuring the seven important races there on our list on Hannity dot com the thirty most important races Seventy total important races although they're all important and I'm just not sure people understand what a Speaker Pelosi means\nTo heartbeat away and you have a woman who says we have to pass the bill to find out what's in it yeah that's what you went running your country then by all means staying home listening at the end of the\nDay will deal with whatever it is where I'm\nGoing to rage their ... well you can rage away as long as it's not against me I don't really care I'm going to be so mad at Republicans if they don't go out and vote well very\nVery sad that we found ... she's already found the grave shift she's got this thing covered\nUm I'm not so sure I'd want one of the unknown factor is the ... the greatest hope for Republicans in my opinion is that\nIt absolutely there is an unknown Trump factor\nAll bets are off because I don't think Trump supporters of the type of people are going to answer anybody's call for any poll ever I don't I've been with calls me I never get called for a poll\nAnd polls you know I look at them I Know the conventional wisdom is I read real clear politics every day you know Nate Silver as as an eighty five percent Democrats take the house\nOf but I also know that they got it wrong in two thousand for two thousand and fourteen and two thousand and sixteen and not only did they get it wrong they did it in a colossal spectacular way\nSo I'm just saying to the American people don't be swayed by polls don't be dispirited if you think you can't win assume that you're behind and go out there on the field that is why we play the game\nAnd you know sometimes your favorite team wins and sometimes your favorite team loses I didn't particularly enjoy election nights and two thousand and eight\nYeah because you can't tell you cannot complain if you don't vote so go out and vote I Can't complain because I'm basically I'm not talking about you everybody knows you vote\nHas nothing to do with the voting\nI said oh we can do is informed people has everything to do the voting no it has everything to do with every but my my vote is meaningless in New York for the most part\nB and more new phenomenon spread by casual contact and when you got to you don't need an added\nSean Hannity starts to what\nThe institutions in our government and all they talk about what about twenty million Americans and or the starches for\nOnly vice may apply except

Waters and Nancy Pelosi are trying to impeach President Trump\nTunnel Halloran is an Obama Chicago Democrat and he votes like it I'm sure he supports Maxine\nLunchtime Halloran sneaks back to the swamp vote to impeach our president\nAnd immediately repeal our tax cut that's the open border Democrat plan in two thousand Eighteen\nAnd we can forget about the wall left wing billionaire George Soros in the open border Democrats are putting illegals before our veterans every day\nThat's why voting for lieutenant colonel Wendy Rogers is a no brainer\nI trust Wendy to protect our Social Security she is a retired air force lieutenant colonel that keeps promising Wendy Rogers won't matter president be impeached without a fight no way\nDon't believe Soros in the open borders Democrat

on Ninety seven was a big talker [noise]\n\nActually helium issue continues to um I I don't know I'm just amazed by this because I had no idea and I continue to get calls regarding helium or if you weren't listening to the show what last week\nBut what he has done is he's fabricated out of whole cloth a conspiracy theory and I just think that um enough is enough and that's why pseudonym and he's wrong he's wrong on what he's saying about me ah regarding prop one twenty seven\nNow this is a personal lawsuit I mean obviously the attorney general's office is not there is you personally doing this\n[noise] yeah I'm I'm suing it and and what he's done is\nAnd I just want to make sure all of your listeners are where the look prop twenty seven is the solar mandated ... spending millions on that as well and it's failing it looks like it's not going to pass I have not actually taken a position on it but one of my duties and responsibilities as attorney general is we have to review and improve all the ballot description language\nAnd so just to put that in context we'd actually done it\nOr did it for six seven current ballot propositions so this is something that's unusual or extreme and so we reviewed language we wanted to make sure to accurately reflected what would happen with that new fifty percent mandate\nAnd so um there is language in there regarding that these new mandates will go into effect irrespective as to cost\nAnd apparently Styron his allies in California blew a gasket on that um and the reality is is that it's accurate and no one's just that it's accurate because it is um it'll move the corporation commission away from there\nYou know kind of current charge in the constitution about focusing on you know Justin reasonable rates to basically focusing on these rules will energy mandates and it's so it's accurate in too I just want to make sure everyone out there knows whether you're a Democrat or Republican independent wherever you fall on this issue whether you want more green energy or not\nYou know I'm I'm In favor of of of you know looking at alternatives you know to you know a coal fired or whatever you know but I but I also think we need to be respectful of the impact that has like our Native American communities we also have to recognize that you know when you come in and you do this stuff is going to have\nCosts whether it's in jobs or cost to consumers and so people should know that and so I always will air on the side of giving consumers more information and that's exactly what we've done this contacts and apparently when you stand up to a California billionaire he's going to come at you with a negative attacks\nYou know apparently during attorney general privacy is mad because I I'm just I'm just speculating here because it must not be doing well because why would you divert millions of dollars just to to go against you and other candidates are facing his rap as well ...\nI think Arizona's are smart enough to see through the BS I'm look I'm a I'm a public official and I get to you know Senator McCain said politics ain't bean bag I understand that but that doesn't mean you get to make up crap about somebody and I think this is why people are so disgusted in politics today 'cause I'm not even just about winning or winning the race like\nThey want to destroy your reputation and I and I'll tell you is the attorney general you know is is a government official someone that's been a prosecutor most of my career I understand maybe more than anyone does that you gotta have credibility and so when you start throwing around these words when you went with a prosecutor\nOr about me that affects me it affects the four hundred and fifty plus lawyers at work here in ages office because they have to have credibility when they have to go when they go into court people have to know that they're doing the right thing in the right way and Jeff you know this I've been on your show before we have and if if you look at what we've done whether it was suing votes wagon whether it was soon ...\nFor those fake blood test you know whether it was actually defending\nThe saints minimum wage law which you know a lot of people the business community and like I said look my job as a genius to defend the law or even when we made sure we sued the universities and went all the way up to the Supreme Court to make sure that when they were illegally offering in stayed benefits including tuition\nTo people to not have legal status we went in and sue the universities to make sure that they're applying\nThe law and so I've consistently done that and that means that you know uh sometimes we've you know\nBe upset some people but the reality is is that my record speaks for itself in fraternities record amount of restitution individuals' more than forty million Simon Angie I'm you know we're doing a great job and so I guess when you do a great job or the left is just the hard left I should say is going to just make up\nStuff about you and that's a made up a load of crap and I and I I've lived here my entire life I bet all around the state and I just think Arizona's are too smart to small fall for for ... for a smear finding out to California billion and I think once again job I just think one of the Republican Democrat or independent\nYou should be offended by this notion that some billionaire is going to come in here\nAnd try to buy an attorney general's office like what is his motive what is he trying to do I mean it's bad enough the\nColorado steals our water\nAnd he sees a California California does our water from the Colorado River um now you got this guy tried to buy an ... office and I just think people are going to see through it and say it is a load of crap and um whether you know they agree with me all the time or not and um they're going to know that it's the wrong thing to do to support in our state California billionaire\nYeah and it's a you know we send us a lot of these attack on the system is kind of like when the people were calling at the court or doors\nAnd I had this happen or just the other day a red after I had congresswoman Martha ...\nAnd people were calling on my social media posts that we do the pod cast after the show they're calling her evil and I said you're not you you may disagree but come on I don't think her opponents evil and we've gotten to that attitude and then they started calling me evil and I stepped out and I was like oh yeah that that's\nJust that's exactly the problem I I you know I I you know you ... recently we've seen some of these stories about people you know being you know confront in restaurants or have any\nLast year I mean I was at a Starbucks and people started yelling at me and it was it was a democratic activist they\nIt puts them on line and you know I look I I had people show protesters shop our office down and talk to them I'll say look this is why I think you're wrong a town of civil conversation on this for example on us in the tuition issue and I said look I'm sue the universities are pushing 'cause I Want it to be lower for everyone but I have to follow the law as it is in these you know I'm a first year\nOn us in the tuition issue and I said look to the University of ... I Want it to be lower for everyone but I have to follow the law as it is nice you know I'm a first generation American and one of the reasons why so many of our parents or grandparents fled countries like you know the Soviet Union or owner even Saudi or even you know\nBrazil or you know other places in South America Central America\nIs because the rule of law meant nothing this is what makes United States great is that we have a law if you don't like the law you change your representatives you change you know the policy makers you vote for Congress you know people over to your senators every six years he's there is a system in place for changing how the policies in laws are made but what you don't get to do is pick\nAnd choose which laws apply to you 'cause actually do in third world countries are in communist countries\nAnd so I worry that people like ... are attacking the fundamental institutions to discredit that made our government and so what is it ends up happening that as people become more divisive and they start using words like you just said they started calling people even older they start you know including the reputation her character\nAnd the problem with that as it is hard then to have\nA civil war normal conversations\nAnd it's hard to one side wins one side loses to accept it and I and I'll tell you what I once when I was getting to not talk to as I remember\nLast year I sat down with uh\nThe apple pie career which is which has endorsed me by the way um and when I sat down with them you know they had asked me about like\nPersonal bomb or something that's all I have a beer or something I go I think he's wrong on policy but I don't I don't think he's an evil person and and that's I worry about is nowadays if you disagree with somebody on the left especially the hard left a hard left talking about as what they do is they destroy your reputation they try to destroy you personally\nAnd that's why when things get out of control when you started dehumanizing and calling people evil or a ... their motives are their character um\nYou know that's when it starts going beyond politics and I just think it's enough enough of this and that's why I Hope people understand and respect the reason why is pushing back against dire it's because to me it's not just about to say jeeze race it's about sending people\nLike him a message\nThat not only is there is not for sale but were sick and tired of this politics personal destruction [noise]\nHard votes more with attorney general Mark Begich when we come back\nSet you up for that show\nDuring this important election let's keep growing Arizona jobs in our economy improving our schools and stopping illegal drugs in human trafficking\nBy securing our southern border police boat for proven leadership senator Sylvia Allen representative Bob Thornton retired army veteran wall black men in disbelief our nation just witness the radical left shameful they condemn the U.S Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd guilty without any evidence don't meet for our liberal opponents want higher taxes open borders control over your money your children's education in the daily life\nRepublican independents and Democrats messenger and yet this radical modern fired\nFor a more prosperous freeze northern Arizona and please vote for\nBanking paid for by committee thrown that there'll be Alan\nBlack men for how\nYou know what Kelley Blue book says is the best selling vehicle of two thousand Eighteen signs up the whole new two thousand Eighteen Ford F. one fifty you heard me right more Ford F. one fifty some sold in two thousand Eighteen than any other vehicle fine this is Ryan sandman Babbitt board and we're proud to represent America that's selling tracking port is constantly\nProduced the most innovative in luxurious truck to celebrate this great accomplishment Babbitt Ford is offering the best possible incentive yet zero percent financing plus up to thirty three hundred dollars in bonuses cash rebate on select", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Kachina Village", "day": "31"}
