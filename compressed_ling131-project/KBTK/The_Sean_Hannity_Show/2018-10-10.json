[noise] I don't remember the great achievements of beginning to shift\nThe American judges\nBack to people who believe in the constitution and who believe in America there's only affecting if Mitch McConnell's the leader I mean the key is done this year where President Trump is truly historic and our holiday than others not just the Supreme Court justice although obviously will shrill\nOh though we were able to finally have a success and she even a victory last week but that doesn't\nThat's just the beginning\nOf the fact is\nThat the president and the Senate majority leader of work together to move almost one out of every four federal judges towards a more constitutional more conservative more American interpretation of the ... of of of the law\nAnd this is a remarkable achievement\nIf the Democrats would when as soon as I said of course much more complicated when you've you've got quite a certain running in Tennessee saying oh I'm really a lot of well who's going to vote for ... for short periods\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name and I think the reason for that is there there are credible witnesses you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a deal Jake two on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is I let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one\nAnd I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and here right outside of the story I think the president has been extremely measured I tell you who's not measured at this particular point\nUh you you've got Rod Rosenstein believing that he can hide behind the fact that he's the number two at the oj I can tell you got to people on the phone today Jim Jordan Mark Meadows who are not going to let that happen\nOkay Jim Jordan why is this even an issue why isn't you you have the power to subpoena Rod Rosenstein who you're not and bring them in and put them under oath\nYeah I mean and and this is why that should happen and I hope I hope chairman Goodlatte will do that we've already subpoenaed than McCain memos and the kitten that was what the New York times\nCited that there were people in that room with Rod Rosenstein who set by the time was talking about recording the presence of the United states so we have the FBI former chief counsel a council Jim Baker saying he took that as seriously when he was told about that meeting\nThat Rod Rosenstein was thinking about recording the commander in chief of this great country and we have in the Cape memos that reinforce that we've subpoenaed that became memos and we've ... time\nTo come in and answer our questions neither one of those things that happen\nSo that that you know Mr rather than it is leading that you played Shawn he talked about trained he he talked about facts and and the here and do this and how our our our ... our justice system works well one of the hallmarks of our justice system is transparency show what the documents give her the Cape memos and more importantly comments or questions that's what bothers both\nWell why would the committee allow him to pull out of this\nWell I can tell you that committee has shown weak leadership and I've I've I hate to criticize anybody a but we've had two weeks I can tell you this the speaker of the house majority leader of the house\nOr Jim Jordan and I was chairman Goodlatte in the room and and two or three other staffers we all agreed that we would do is move expeditiously to have him come in to a transcribe interview and if they did not if rod did not because I suspected that he wouldn't come in\nA than we would subpoena him and compel him to do that and I can tell you that ah it's it's more excuses on why he should not be transparent and and I for one I'm tired of\nSo we're basically saying Republicans that have the power ... and could\nLiterally force him to come and testify under oath an answer these really important questions if there was a plot a scheme a plan that you've got three people corroborating Lisa Page Andrew McCabe but now James Baker\nAll saying that he talked about taping the president of the United states in the hopes that it would provide materials that they could invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment he says no no no I didn't say I was just joking about it I don't see what's so funny about it and said sarcastically I don't I don't even see any sarcasm and that\nAnd they are saying that they all believe he was saying it seriously\nYes that that that is accurate and even if he was joking you ... the guy who was in effect running department should not be joking with support it's about\nRecording the commander in chief of the United states that ... that even if it's a joke that's not something you do it particularly at the time that this was happening remembers not this is back in May of twenty Seventeen when the whole darn cities in an uproar because on late night the president fires give them call me on may seventeenth bought Rosenstein named Bob Mueller the special counsel\nIs one of the ... happen in between there remember Lisa Page set up to that point they never had any evidence of Trump Russia collusion but there was little menial leaks\nStrategy so that they were creating an atmosphere where people were thinking there was some type of a reason to appoint a special counsel which now gets back to what the insurance policy was a page and struck we're talking about and it seems we got our answer now\nWhere you're writing I think not only were they leaking arid of gyms exactly right you know there's a whole lot that has gone into this you know where we've got actually a memos that have been subpoenaed testimony that there\nAre a narrative that was put out there by the department of justice and FBI and yet they knew that many of the things that they were putting out in the media could not be substantiated\nI I Would go even further than this you know you you did the lead and\nI'm not even sure that Rod Rosenstein read the five application many side you know when you start to look and here's some of the testimony is chilling the amount of documents that they failed to read and I I'm not so sure that Rod Rosenstein even well did\nThey fail to read them do we know they failed to read the more they didn't care I mean there's two different possibilities here\nI'm One of the big problems with all of this is every single item we're discussing here and the Grassley Graham memo pointed it out the Nunes memo pointed it out that the bulk of information used to obtain the Pfizer warns\nThat that they were literally committing fraud on the size of court they never substantiated they never verified they'd never corroborated any of the steel ... of the of course the first deals\nYou know dot CA and as a result was used as the bulk of him\nIs not even steal agrees that there's any truth than what he wrote\nWell date today that's correct ... at a steel ... said believe all the things that were given the British or but here's the other problem\nIs even Bruce or knew that some of the things that he was writing there were not accurate and and yet somehow they get put in a three oh two and they get used as a justification to actually a further investigation in terms of the president United States it's just stick\nIt truly is stick me\nAll right so what's the next step why is it good latte and Gowdy demanding that that Rod Rosenstein appeared tomorrow under oath and answer these questions whether or not\nHe talked about several viciously taping the president of the United states for the purposes of of bucking the twenty Fifth Amendment we need an answer to that\nYes we do and the American people need an answer and that's what we'll be pushing a chairman Goodlatte indicated that he would do that so now is the time obviously to get that done and make sure Mr Rosenstein get in there to answer these important questions now that we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting back between midnight and may seventeenth\nOf twenty Seventeen where he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who's come forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so look we've got to subpoena ... we've got to bring him into the gas the questions\nI Will take a quick break more with congressman Mark Meadows of North

Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker of all said that that Rod Rosenstein or talked about surreptitiously taping the president\nOf the United states in the hopes of getting something on tape but that might invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nIs it the same Rod Rosenstein that is up to his eyeballs and conflict\nHaving written a letter and recommended the firing a James called me the same guy

you and I sit down and have a cup of coffee and we'll chat a little bit so if Rosenstein or July as as I suspect she might um he doesn't he's not looking at a fashion misleading statement of Congress he's not looking at\nAs a borderline category five I'm a ... and when it's all done they may call it a category five I'm not sure they're going to be going to look at the damage but there's a lot more left with this storm\n'cause even though it's weakening hurricane force winds are going to go all the way in the central Georgia I've ever be costing one Seventy five but they're gonna be ... to eighty Ninety a hundred miles an hour Atlanta you will escape the worst of it but I guess it's probably going to come right over Augusta\nVery close to Columbia South Carolina just north of Fayetteville by this time tomorrow when we're talking and then we'll move off the mid Atlantic Coast between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk, Virginia\nVery late Thursday nights on out to sea to the south of New England just glancing blowing the Ninety five quarter in the meantime for you folks in the Carolinas\nAll right you you're not going to have the kind of a kind of cold long siege bought in as six to twelve hour period\nFor much of the interior Carolinas they're going to be wind gust into forty fifty sixty miles an hour that's going to cost power outages three to six locally twelve inches of rain will aggravate flooding situations in areas that were devastated by Florence I'm I'm Sorry to say that we've got a call it like it is\nWell as this comes through tomorrow into tomorrow night so it's a multifaceted storm with this park Sean as you can definitely say it's all it's a when a storm surge there's tremendous rain right now I pray to God that nobody stayed in the path that this\n... this whole thing I don't know if anybody ever read what happening Camille in sixty nine where they they they try to get these people to evacuate pass Chris Sean and\nThe ... the storm leveled at Ford apartment building so I I'm praying that people did it you know cut out of there in a heated the warnings\nYou know the president has been awesome with this FEMA has been absolutely spectacular in this rough period we've been going over the past couple of years and if you if they listen you come back and rebuild later but uh you know I I fear of people who stay in the way of\nWell I Do too that's why I always tell people just just listening to authorities I Know people have said because I'm I'm looking and seeing online and and various media sites social sites people are literally live streaming the hurricane and there's some of them are even on the beach for crying out loud meaning that they're ...\nThey're showing that probably live streaming away from the center because I don't think anybody's lives screaming where this this thing's a bulldozer about twenty miles wide bulldozers wherever it's coming in\nDirectly it looks like Panama City was on the west side of the wall and you know I guess this court say porch saint Joe it's going to be you know I I fear for that area and there\nIs all the perfectly said Panama City was ground zero it was and you also talked about the direction that the storm would hit you are right about that which as you predicted yesterday and and the day before and ever since Sunday that the angle at which this storm was coming in and made it that much more devastating\nYeah again it's different from a different from Florence Florence did not come in at her peak this came in all guns blazing as far as intensity goes and it's one of these cases where everything came together but you could see it coming together even back on Saturday and Sunday ...\nAs you know I don't know a sudden that email out say could play on the show and see what's going to go on this week I've got some good news for you we're not going to be talking about a more hurricanes this year hitting the United states once we're done with this\nIs gonna be the last one of the season a lasting\nImpact storm on our coasts yes I Believe\nYou know why it's so important that we put you on and you have this incredible encyclopedic knowledge of every hurricane that's ever hit the United states for crying out loud but\nMore importantly with the knowledge that you have you can import that knowledge to our audience and you can save people's lives because you know think about you know the years before media that we had meteorologist and the ability satellite imaging for example and the ability to actually track and follow these storms\nAnd all of a sudden people will wake up and they're in a category four or five hurricane than they had no idea where it came from um ...\nThirty eight hurricane you know you looked at Long Island is legendary their those people had no idea what was coming in\nWhite Joan I'm old but I'm not that old I wasn't there for the thirty eight hurricane and Long Island in here\nIt's legendary out\nThere when you add it to\nWell I saw a hurricane Gloria destroy my sister's house so I did watch that and ah it hit pretty hard back in the day but our job is already whether bell dot com or will have the very latest he'll be joining us tonight on Hannity or as we get updates uh let not your heartbeat troubled I Know a lot of you are going to have a lot of damage\nYou're going to be in need of food and water medicine baby formula costs blankets\nA I Know that like in past hurricanes that the government has gotten their act together they pre positioned a lot of the supplies that you will be needing a I Know a lot of you are going to be very devastated by the laws of\nOf the our homes et cetera but\nI'm the American people the most generous on earth than any help we can give you I Know that will be available as soon as this thing passes I pay attention those that are in Augusta heading up to Columbia South Carolina because that's going to be in your area of tomorrow with eighty to a hundred miles per hour winds that's pretty devastating\nUh All right let's get to our busy telephones here as we say Hi to read it in Charleston South Carolina Reese Hi how are you glad you called\nThank you sir thank you for taking my call I'll be brief out which is calling it I'm Wondering what the possibility of getting the president to\nEither director suggested deer Jay that we'd go after these false accusers whether it be the DNC Hillary Mrs Ford is not for a criminal part but for the civil part and the cost of the wild goose chase ... they were sent on\nAre trying to investigate these things from five and and so on and so forth and then strengthen the laws against false accusations 'cause they ruin people's lives\nOh I you know I I never said this but you really think about it\nAll of that information was disseminated to the American people\nTo lie to the American people to feed them propaganda misinformation so that they'd vote a certain way but more importantly than after the election that they lost in spite of all of these efforts all of the line that kind of always takes place when and that's what the Democratic party does every two and four years\nSpite of all that then they use this phony information\nAgain and again and again I\nHave a media elite strategy feeding information from one source to multiple sources to seem like it's a real story when it was a concocted story of a scam if you will and that creates an atmosphere where everybody calls for a special counsel and now we're discovering that people were talking about\nWell to some and the FBI now admitting that they had no evidence of Russian collusion at all that's why they disseminated the information that's why they leaked it to their friends in the media that we're willing you know accomplices and all of this and then they talk about undoing a presidential election surreptitiously going out and recording the president\nUnbeknownst to him so that they get and then in both the twenty Fifth Amendment and then I guess the whole insurance policy is in place done and finished I mean that's what happened here\nYou know certain all these things are again being being paid for about a tax payer and we're basically taking it in the rear end every time they do this\nAll true there's and unfortunately you know when I say this is the biggest abuse of power scandal corruption and American ...\nI Am a thousand percent right and we still haven't gotten it right there is a reason Rod Rosenstein does not wanna testify have the information recorded or do it under oath because he knows he's up to his eyeballs and every aspect of all of this\nAnd yet he's the guy that has all the power I mean it's amazing isn't the literally the well the eye of the hurricane of you well\nAll right ... thank you appreciate it I'm let us go to James in Cleveland James how are you glad you called\nI Am fantastic Sean thank you for asking 'em for small like to give my thoughts and prayers and everybody on the coast going through the hard times down there\nHopefully uh everybody has the right thing in places saved and got out there I was saved by the reason I called actually is because I wanted to tell you that I I was a a number of Trump or back in two thousand six Jean\nAnd I'm completely changed my whole point of view on that I didn't think he was electable and I didn't think was conservative back then and I was wrong in fact I lost a hundred dollar bet with a fellow toys from mine over it paid him up the next day\nPretty much since day one I've been defending his actions are the president's done a fantastic job here's help my family\nAnd myself so much I remember three things in my entire life\nThat I've noticed that the federal government actually do for me first was the Bush tax cuts and now this fabulous cut from the European Trump this time around us because so much money in my pocket you know the other thing that affected me\nWas when my Cadillac plan was cancelled because of the sea and Obamacare and costs me nine thousand dollars out of pocket since my company dumped are Cadillac plan well thank you now grounds for that and thank you Republicans for more money in my pocket\nYou know I'm Glad you said all of that because there are a lot of people out there that are still the never Trump or land and they won't recognize that look I can understand that they don't like the president's style\nUm it may be that there is at odds with how they would manage things but you cannot argue that he's governing as a strong conservative that gets results and I'll take results over

[laughter]\nI don't know I mean you know you just tell the bell rings but we're in a very heavily democratic district you're going there I mean there there is however we're talking about how it's broken and it's so polarized both of which I think are true um and you're also coming really as an outsider in a moment where I think people like watching what happened today and want to storm the gates and you're going to actually do that\n... what's what's your plan [laughter] well I think\nA lot of the ... there were changing our strategy around we got our hands you know a lot of inside baseball and inside the beltway here now you can only hit that term thrown around but\nThere are various ... organizers when Congress and I think that organizers operate differently in eh forget from kind of strategy and what it is we're all about organized all\nAnd I'm really thinking about that word Oregon I think that people don't strictly hitting our actions that we're in bringing together at ... strategy of putting pressure on the chamber instead of only focus on the pressure inside\nThat she was really interesting thought\nIt's very interesting is a very enlightening interview so anyway the sum it up uh\nAlexandria Ocasio Cortez the socialist darling she just we just need more organizers were just more organized and everything will be great but what was interesting is this part about storming the gates this is Chris Chris Hayes talking about\nAnd you're only getting really as an outsider at a moment where I think people are watching what happened today I'm On a storm the gates and you're going to actually do that\nObviously referring to 'em that weird is zombie apocalypse that happened in front of the U.S Supreme Court or the doors doors locked and you had to is like a zombie apocalypse who people work long at the gates ...\nRemember this I played this for you the other day\nSo it's just the enormous should we expect us that you don't get your way you\nHe'll be remembered it [noise]\nIt's just going to be the new norm in American politics [noise]\nFolks I Love your dog age seven seven\nNinety seven one three Ninety seven one eight seven seven\nNinety seven one three Ninety seven one you're listening to your show in a lot more to come back and [noise]\n\nThey ... that show Monday through friday at three PM on Ninety seven point and one of the doctor\nLike step areas consistently ranked as the most expensive city to live in in all of Arizona\nNo surprise you are right and it's tough to find an affordable place to rent will listen up if you live in or a moving to the Flagstaff area checkout Flagstaff for lease dot com because they've got some great affordable rental options for you check out this deal that's like ... dot com\nA one bedroom one bathroom home for eight hundred and Ninety nine dollars and that includes utilities that's right one bed one bass eight hundred and Ninety nine dollars with utilities\nFlagstaff ... dot com also has two three and four bedroom homes as well as office space throughout the Flagstaff area so what are you waiting for go check out Flagstaff the number for lease dot com that's Flagstaff for lease dot com\nFor current availability or give them a call at night to wait five to six seven nine zero nine ... nine to eight five to six seven nine zero nine [noise]\nThe\nCrazy radical in very unhinged progressive left [laughter] they're not just against our president and his conservative agenda they want to destroy our country divider people and regulate our freedoms tell America becomes Venezuela\nI'm Wendy Rogers I'm a retired air force pilot and solid conservative and I'm running for Congress to stop these leftist bully filmed a long time more taxes add jobs and stand with our president to make America great again\nMy opponent is Tom O'Halleran\nLeft wing open borders anti Trump progressive\nOut of touch with Arizona I approve this message and ask for your vote for Congress to keep America moving in the right direction and that means stopping the radical\nNow [noise]\nI'm\nWendy Rogers please get out and vote paid for by Wendy Rogers for Congress Wendy Rogers dot org\nMajestic market has been placed in Flagstaff is the pen and Langston Hughes proved in majestic marketplace voting bench still flank tapping five category ... spears inhalation and been bartending sad [noise]\nMajestic marketplace has been doing business in blanks down for over Fifteen Years and they gave you for your support majestic marketplace at a place in the center\nAll and represent absorb less paying a pitcher and by the way I'm going to have governor juicy on tomorrow and in a you will be a subject of conversation that we're going to have sure\nUm I ... I Love it and you uh you know I've had lots of family that went there it's been part of this community for a long time ready to change terrific it's been a it's been a I I Wish she'd come on the program\nOh I should call well I also had after I've sent multiple invitations to come on a program in and talk about issues okay and um I see what I can do that'd be great because I have that conversation\nBecause here's what's happening here's what I've noticed representative dark\nIt used to be that um maybe just a certain fringes like any is getting too big and that was when it was like you know ten thousand right but now to tie it back to what you're talking about was voting they're around twenty three thousand and they want to go to thirty three thousand and now they're buying property right on a busy court or and and people who are traditionally are like I really\nSupport most everything any does are scratching their heads saying wait a second\nThat's pretty big for a town of Seventy thousand\nAnd back to your point with the voting so what does\nThirty three thousand students who I'm assuming a large chunk of from out of town and are here for a short time what does that do to the votes for the community members who have lived here for decades and generations\nI just look something up here Jeff ... this is from a website says world population review and chose Flagstaff, Arizona population in twenty Eighteen at sixty five thousand tank so in other words we're talking about you know if we if we have thirty thousand students going to enter you I'm fifty percent of\nElation a has just been increased and in other words um you know so we we've gone just with those students arriving from sixty five thousand to almost a hundred thousand if you have a and and often times they were talking about kids that are not here during the summertime there they're not here during break so that probably here you know six months and months out of the year\nI think the community is ready to have this conversation with the president of the university and just to say wait let's do a check in here right because there are a lot of folks that have lived there for a long time that are starting to say hey what's going on interesting is\nWhat's driving it so you know we see the Hubble we see the different student housing that's been built here in town um ... incredible increases in the density a ... student living off campus um million dollar question for your job is where's the additional roads to deal with the traffic\nAnd especially if we're talking about having fifty percent of a flex house population increase another thirty thousand plus individuals' each year\nUm and not increase our infrastructure does that make any sense\nYou may be previewing a question for the governor tomorrow [laughter] you know I thought yeah no it's a it's a good how are you represent absorb yeah and it's just it's questions that need to be asked and I you know I I have fun very everyone has program I Hope we can have this conversation if I can make\nSomething really clear based on what we were just talking about a moment ago or I Want any student that wants to vote I Want them to vote\nA and nothing that I've done legislatively has been to hamper their ability to vote I think common sense dictates that if if they're from a city outside of Flagstaff\nThat they can get a mail in ballot and then their vote will then a positively impact the committee where they live or their family lives were their friends or neighbors live as opposed to them coming into Flagstaff and voting locally and the impact in the city a city that they don't live in\nFulltime or a representative Bob thoughts my guests are eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety something on that one more thing I Want to point out I'm In this time\nYou've got your tax bill right I I have yeah yeah I got my tax\nBill and a lot of folks I'm with you know average size homes are saying half scene between a hundred and fifty to a hundred and eighty dollar a dollar increase\nYour every year right that's a very common figure um\nPeople are hurting that hurts because you don't have any more money in your pocket now there's all these questions out there and and granted those are all voter the voters have to decide if they want him their property taxes uh maybe going up but there's also the thing there's something you did\nLast year that not many people were willing to tackle and I and I don't think anyone gives you credit for this and they should and that is trying to stop these automatic increases yes and to just require that hey if you want to use my house is a piggy bank mhm uh if you want to increase my property taxes two percent or as flecks tested what ...\nHalf yeah like I'm just you need to come to me and asked me just ask me and then maybe say thank you after you do you read a bill\nAnd and the intention of the bill was um\nThat anytime a property tax increase would occur uh the government agency ... that wanted to impose that increase would have to go to the voters and get the approval of the voters which I think it's completely reasonable you think about a home\nIs the most expensive thing you're going to buy in your entire life\nUm and so then do you ever actually own it let's say let's say you pay off the home you've lived in ten years you pay off you no longer have a mortgage\nYou still have every year two three four thousand dollars that you'd have to pay to your local government agency or or multiple agencies maybe some to or the county some to the city\nUm I think and and what what really kills me\nIs you never get out from under that even though you now own your home no longer have a mortgage you're always paying the government\nOr for the right down that piece of property and then what happens if you don't pay your taxes after a couple of years they come in and they take your home out from underneath you sat and sell it for the tax obligation so uh I think it's extremely important that taxpayers have the ability to approve\nAny kind of property tax increase you run it again yeah I'm planning on it yeah and maybe I'm\nI don't know it didn't take off last year but I I Would think that especially uh in your pockets in the Republican ... I think that would take off\nI had a number of members that found out about the bill after the fact in works really supportive of it ah the bill had been assigned to one committee and uh the chairwoman of that committee chose not to hear it so in other words it it got stopped immediately\nUm buy her a she refused to hear the bill I had a conversation with her\nUm other members found out about it and came to her and tried to convince her to hear it\nAnd that when something is assigned to one committee that's a good sign usually when it gets to Fifteen committees it's it's ... death of a bill ... any\nAny bill is assigned to two committees it's assigned to a primary coming into the rules Kennedy or if it's scientists three committees in troublesome if assigned for communities that\nAre just shredded yeah that's right that's a deaf deaf now yeah absolutely are here with representative Bob door if you've got a comment um we'd love to hear from you we have some time to take your comments do so will try to work those in eight seven seven\nNinety seven one three Ninety seven but represent ... stick around for me because I Want to talk to you about this I wasn't going to do with the segment this hour\nBut there's a flag issue Oh yes I got to talk about this so folks hang type back in a minute [noise]\nFar that show Monday through friday at three guys and my wife\nA shocker [noise]\nFolks you've heard me talk about twilight\nJanitorial you know that's why like janitorial company I use for all my business cleaning I use twilight janitorial because I Need a great cleaning service for my business and I know you do to\nSo focused on your business not on cleaning it and let twilight janitorial handle all your company's cleaning give twilight janitorial a call today nine to eight\nEight five three eighty sixty four that's twilight janitorial\nNine to eight eight five three eighty sixty four\n\n[noise] I Know that one now welcome to simply you know the boss B.
