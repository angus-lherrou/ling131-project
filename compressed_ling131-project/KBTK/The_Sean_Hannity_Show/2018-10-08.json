apologies Dr Sebastian Gorka is with us or how are you my friend this book is a must read for everybody and how are you good to see him\nVery excited show and thanks for having me or I didn't think uh this title would be as appropriate as it is often low Seventy two hours but mine we are in a fight right now for the future of the republic\nIt is a fight for the future of the republic the one thing I Love about you and I've come to know you very well is that your patriots and you understand evil in our time\nEvil abroad the need to defend and keep America strong and you understand the political aspects of it as well because if you elect their own people and what are you going to have policies of appeasement again in that renders us more vulnerable\nJust look at the last eight years what do we have we had a commander in chief who started his presidency with an apology tour and then he blamed all the bad things in the world on America what resulted the rise of ISIS Russia invading its ... Chinese Chinese re militarization\nOf the end of the Obama administration just one metric take take politics out of it for a second\nWe had sixty five million refugees in the world that's more than we had at the end of World War two when you don't have American leadership the world is the most dangerous place now that ... thanks to Donald Trump now we have a commander in chief who believes that even exists read his wall so speech listen to what\nHe says about ISIS about what the Chinese are doing what he said at the un\nLine yes absolutely absolutely so that's why I wrote why we fight but but you're absolutely correct we have domestic issues here\nHe will exist not just outside of our borders look what they did to the godly man Brett Kavanaugh in the last four days a man who had the probably the cleanest most spotless record in an American public life goes from being\nA stand up standing federal judge to amass rapist they will use every tool because they lost the election and that's why the next thirty days are so important showing\nIt means ah everything and good luck everything's riding on this\nI don't know if you would have asked me three weeks ago I Would have leaned in on the side that history would would win out because the party that wins the White House\nUsually ends up losing seats in a midterm election they totally not happened three times only really picked up seats three times in the last hundred years the last was after two thousand and one of the attack and die on number eleven September eleventh\nUm but there's so much at stake here\nThat is what literally jumps off the pages I'm reading through your book that we better defeat America's enemies and we'd better do without apologies tactic orca we don't get to do that if we're not in power right\nWe we have to take very seriously this concept of the left so the left has been taken over by the radicals\nThinking about the fight but JFK would not be allowed into the Democrat Party today a hardcore anti communist stronger national security you wouldn't be allowed into the DNC what do we have we have the crazies we have the capacity of Cortez is we have the Maxine Waters and control\nWho have made a pact with the devil may have said very simply\nThe ends justify the means we want power and we will use any tool well guess who use that philosophy in the past\nAbout philosophy drives to the labor camps to drive to the ... and Dr death camps whether you are right wing extremist whether you're ... or whether you're a communist that's the philosophy and we've got to stop that Sean we\nHave to stay true to the principles of the republic\nYou talk it in a book about the a will to winter and then again the title why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies and here's what we can't have any more and you talk about the will to when you talk about will\nIs if you go back to Vietnam we lost fifty eight thousand brave Americans and we allow that war to become politicized it is and we pulled out you know in Iraq and Afghanistan\nWe pull out leaving it dates of our withdrawal and we lost nearly six thousand kids in the end so many others come back without their arms and legs in their in their faces just figured fighting for their country we cannot commit American troops ever again\nUnless we're willing to win the war if we're not willing to do what it takes to win the war than we are not get involved ever period unless we have to you have to win these wars or else they'll start to be involved in the\n... so my book is about two things it's about all the threats we face in the country so whether it's ISIS Russia or China but the second part is much more important this is the one who hitting on it\nDo we have the will to defeat our enemies because Vietnam is a great example we were the most powerful nation in the world and a bunch of guys with wooden sticks and Ross the rifles defeat us how that's possible because we lost the war at home because we allow the left to undermine a will to win\nAnd and what are the most important things is the individual rules to win\nIn addition to the ... of the threat I have full vignettes of American heroes I go back to the Bobby was two hundred years ago I talk about a Korean hero a trustee pulled her I talk about a man who spent six and a half years as a naval aviator in the Hanoi Hilton but the last story very very important for what we are seeing right\nIt took a chambers most kids have no idea where the country but this this is a man who was kind of an old before capital was born in Nineteen forty eight the first live televised Senate hearing well the medical would occur chambers who have been a communist agent of the Soviets went on record saying\nHey I no longer communist but I Need America to know whether the communist off in the government including el ... his he was a guy who was working for the Soviets what happened to this man who stood up for the truth\nBut you choose him of everything cheating on his wife ... of the best ... being responsible for the death of his brother none of it was true but what does he do you have the will to fight he stood up for the truth justice justice cabinet why they're so short his his his people but here's the scary thing\nThe Democrats have done this before don't be surprised at what they did to Capitol they've done it seven eight years ago\nI they have done it every election in my lifetime they play the race card the jet rye or you know they divide America old versus young rich versus poor black versus white this is the identity politics which which they have mastered and I keep playing them in their own words it's not like I'm making it up\nQuick break we'll come back more with Dr Sebastian

happened to be here with you today on this Monday afternoon eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one or email talk with Jeff iCloud dot com are busy program I I actually I've got a busy Monday I got a lot of things going on so I have for this hour\nUh we've got this great interview that we did with a PS would be a chief nuclear officer of the plant but at four o'clock I got I got a lot of stuff to talk about we're and talk more about Brett Kavanaugh I'm now a justice Kavanaugh\nWhen you talk about that when I got some interesting college and university numbers that I Want to share with you unless we're going to go over some of the propositions and then this entire week uh starting tomorrow Tuesday Wednesday Thursday\nJuly listener comments those three days or for the entire two hours and I got a ton of gas including congresswoman mixed Sally how we got candidates for governor I'm a David Garcia I I think we're also governor do see this week\nUh we've got folks on yes on for Eighteen we've got a ton of stuff out of the city council candidates are so you're going to want to stick around all week for that but anyway here's the chief nuclear officer at the Palo Verde plant which I'm touring this Friday that's going to be really cool uh Bobby\nMeant you know we've been talking so much about electricity in Arizona electricity in California I'm In particular the Palo Verde nuclear power plant and I had a ton of questions for you and I'm Glad we're able to ah to finally connect\nAnd uh I I Hope I can keep up with you chief nuclear officer so I I Will try my best um the first off\nLet's talk about Palo Verde where it is or what it is you know kind of give us maybe this thirty thousand foot kind of history in in view of what Palo Verde as\nRepresentative so public Rudy is one of the largest ... months from America\nAnd it's located fifty five miles uh west of downtown Phoenix\nThere's three fourteen hundred megawatt reactors out there so we produce about forty two hundred megawatts of power so we can power about four million houses across the southwest and where do we do provide power to California Arizona New Mexico and El Paso Texas [laughter]\nSo it's not just ... when we think of the great it's not just like hey Arizona you turn on Palo Verde and that that\nElectricity goes around here so it's it's a regional thing that is exactly correct\nAnd and so uh so it was built in the eighties I'm In ... came online in the late eighties [noise] ah we've generated more electricity for the last twenty sixth consecutive years than any other power plant in the U.S and we take great pride in being part of Arizona\nWith it and I have filled woods do this for years because I Love what he and so when I tell ya I sure appreciate the convenience and ease of a modern gas stove I'm saying this as a wood aficionados my forty years in the industry I've seen gas the\nTechnology advancing get better\nAnd better and better today's gassed those compete head to head would then if you're buying would you're going to save money buying gas gas stove the\nDancers are so realistic I called him my gas woodstove and like all the ... would woodstove customer satisfaction tells the tale I get two to one calls from folks who purchased a gas stove thanking me for helping them to make the decision to go with gas is warm\nAnd cleanliness of gas make the decision simple ... roof dancers keeping folks warm since Nineteen Seventy seven on fourth street next to sonic\nNow I now back to the gym for that show I Ninety seven was the\nBig soccer gets the all new jet for that show this afternoon it for a Ninety seven point one the big talker\n... far they show\nCome back we're talking with the chief nuclear officer at the palace Verde\nPlant uh Bobby meant Bobby meant and you've been you've been at in this industry for a long time um I I mean this is how\nDid you get involved is in first of all you you're in the flags if we broadcast from Flagstaff we cover all of northern Arizona ah but you got off the Flagstaff a lot I Do I Do so uh I'll start with\nUh my background nuclear power I joined the nuclear navy out of high school a as an enlisted electrician a served on board submarines for six years are providing the propulsion and the power for those those submarines\nThe strongest navy in the world in in the in our technology ... was second to nobody\nUm I got to um to see other fleets up close and uh and we did a really really well against the fleet so that was enjoyable um and then in Nineteen eighty one I joined the commercial a nuclear power business and so I've been generating clean energy since Nineteen eighty one using a nuclear fuel\nSomething I'm very proud of and in a you know today it's a big topic a bit for us in the nuclear business it's been a big topic for a long time and we're proud\nThat we generate fifty six percent of the cleaner energy in this country\nIn Arizona we generate over Seventy percent of the cleaner energy that then we use in in this state so when people think about\nAbout clean air energy and and they get to look at the Grand Canyon and and the the beautiful sites we have across the state I take great pride and the fact that um the people look at ... had been generating electricity that helps them keep it clean\nAbout first of all thanks for your service and it takes us to go at a submarine and that close to a confined space I've talked with folksy for it that's a that's incredible and into working on a U.S or what I see him as a small nuclear reactor within that confined space\nAmazing stuff technology is absolutely amazing I bet you mentioned something that that caught my ear to the ah nuclear energy you called a clean energy for\n'em because it it doesn't ... it's not like call a coal has\nLet's look at the nuclear power plant ... very\nIt has a lifespan still\nA a quite a long ways it's eighty years apart from from what it was built correct that's correct okay\nSo we can go out to twenty sixty seven oh for the units now uh we were talking during the break the ... at a coal plant produces a ashtray and then not to mention a certain other things that come up in the atmosphere whatever\nUm what does a nuclear power plant produce in that eighty year span as far as waste is so in the eighty year span\nWe are going to create these canisters or we talked about about a football field full of them so if you think about eighty years generating forty two hundred megawatts every every day of the year except when the units are down\nAnd and we run the Ninety two percent capacity factor that's a lot of power out of a very small footprint and then we have the technology in technology is just going to continue to improve Jeff of how to how to ... re process that that fuel\nYou retrofit none of that the plant was built in the eighties early eighties do you have to retrofit is just kind of still running on the same principles or has technology changed over time\nIs a really good question and I appreciate it um\nI think that the nuclear industry may be the strongest industry in the world at learning from the stakes and force in the industry to make changes Nuclear Regulatory commission is a very strong oversight of us from Washington DC\nUh but we also have the Institute of nuclear power operation which is a self governing drive towards excellence body that evaluates every plants performance every two years so you you take the lessons learned from from different events small events large advance\nAnd uh we take those and make modifications to plant continues to be upgraded\nA will be digital some day you know when we started all analog rentals we'll be all digital and as we move into new technology and in a solar comes in\nWe want to be able to maneuver the plant um during the day some because we want to have room to take that solar especially when California is going to take us to repay us to take the electricity we want to create room\nA word that helps our rate payers get that electricity that comes with money\nBy folks Bob ... is my guest he's the chief nuclear officer poverty plant um let's go let's go back to say because there's still some people they hear nuclear power\nAnd by the way thank you for your little um [noise] your safety guy here and we'll put that up I talk with Jeff deck I'm 'cause safety is important it is safety is a huge factor some people think back to first of all three Mile Island ... that comes up [noise] um\nI you look at Chernobyl which I assume was horribly antiquated bad technology um but but are accidents very common I mean to talk about safety because that's a big concern with with your organization with Albert no I absolutely appreciate\nYou talking about because we talk about safety all the time um and the and it's a focus from for us in just when we talked about safety\nYou have to read a logical safety and safety culture creating an environment where people can talk and raised raised questions and concerns and and have their voice heard\nAnd people appreciate the fact that they disagree ... and so uh\nIt'd be great thing to spread across America at this time but we don't go into that that but uh so we focus on safety and if you look at the margins that we started these plants up with back in the seventies and eighties to the margin we operate\nWith today we increase the margin sometimes a hundred and fold\nThese plants are so much safer than they were and if you think back as cars are built in the seventies compared to the cars that are built now\nPlanes seventies planes now there's no comparison to that technology to today's technology and so I feel [noise] I tell people you want to work at the safest place in in Arizona ...\nMine justice if your number support it even safer than TV and radio just a to point up to injustice very not having sex with a ... and so uh so we we take great pride in and be in a safe place to work in Arizona\nHow many a couple of questions here how many new because we're going to get electricity aspect of this you're saying but how many nuclear power plants are there in the u._s. but that's my first question one hundred okay are there any being built now or plans to be built anytime soon or is this something that's getting\nHarder and harder to do this to being built a down by August of Georgia and the other so those those are president being built\nI Believe what you'll see 'em for the next wave is small modular reactors or the new technology and and which is implemented even more safety precautions\nSo I I think that that's what you'll see a being built in the future in this country modular Missouri right what's the what's that mean well it means that it may be um for example uh one of the ones that I'm On on the board for is a new scale reactors and uh they build fifty megawatt modules\nAnd then they put them together uh for for about five hundred megawatts interesting and so uh so that that is the way I think you're in the ... you are going dumb [noise]\nJeff far that show Monday through friday at three PM on Ninety seven going on to the doctor [noise]\nLikes that various consistently ranked as the most expensive city to live in in all of Arizona\nNo surprise you are right and it's tough to find an affordable place to rent well listen up if you live in or a moving to the Flagstaff area checkout Flagstaff for lease dot com because they've got some great affordable rental options for you\nCheck out this deal at ... dot com a one bedroom one bathroom home for eight hundred Ninety nine dollars and that includes utilities that's right one bed one bass eight hundred and Ninety nine dollars with utilities\nFlagstaff

Flagstaff for lease dot com for current events ability or give them a call at nine to wait five to six seven nine zero nine\nRenewables renewable source renewable resources and and the big thing about this initiative which we talked about a lot is it excludes nuclear and you know when everybody goes in votes on this and has a couple of sentences there there's a whole you know\nPlethora of papers behind the new as a constitutional amendment correct ascribe that also has as what I call very I'm more much more strict requirements for hydro there's a ton of stuff in there and folks in Arizona I have to decide if they want to go to the strategy is from uh\nCalifornia billionaire has pushed this uh it was a similar plan if I'm correct that California has passed ... so what's going on in California first of all do they have nuclear power plants in California well they started with a\nTwo nuclear plants so if with two units each one south Los Angeles and in one between Los Angeles in in San Francisco the one south Los Angeles has been shut down okay one north or in between the two is going to be shut down and twenty forty F twenty twenty four and twenty twenty five\nI'm based on not having a place to put their electricity during the day\nAnd so in in ... when you look at this proposition one twenty seven and and people say a it won't have an ... won't have an effect on Palo Verde I think that the record speaks for itself look at California because they put the fifty percent renewable standard in\nA early in a couple of things that have happened over there one their electricity costs have gone up three times that of the average increase across this this country of ours\nAnd the second is they're shutting down all their nuclear\nAnd so when people say it's not going to have a negative effect on ... the wrong and if the people that wrote initiative cared about ... they could have put an end of the ...\nAnd at least two places this does not include nuclear\nThey made a point of exotic could've except now this is the only I guess I should I should certainly earlier this is the only nuclear power plant in Arizona and a script so they could have easily said except for the one plant that already exist there is there any plans to build any others\nYou know you're not okay so that would have been pretty easy so it does proposition one twenty seven say that any existing nuclear Palo Verde 'cause it's the only one that it has to be shut down or I ... as being made as to what's going on in California as far as their closures\nSo I'll take the\nSee neither one of the above a [laughter]\nSo [laughter]\nBut what what I Would tell you is is we have what happened in California but if you think about it just so most of our renewables are going to come from solar and the the proposition says the fifty percent of our energy has to come from renewables over a year period\nSo if you think about that in our peak electricity uses an evening when no soldier is available\nHow much power is going to be generated from solar during the day during the daytime it's gonna be a hundred percent you can't get to you can't get to fifty percent for the year without hitting a hundred percent so if you hit a hundred percent solar during the day in the summer\nIn the spring and fall when we have about half what it is to use it's all going to be guaranteed solar so where are you going to put public murder you can't store it you can't just say we're going to put it on the grid and live voted you grow up and do breakers store trip and that's not alone\nSo what you're going to do is you have to shut ... and so people start talking about the economics and how what what the prices we generate power over any truth to\nIt really doesn't make any difference because what is going to control this is the fact that California is still trying to sell us power during the day because they have too much\nWe're going to have too much so now we're not going to be able to buy California's power and ... and ... and then on to the rate payers and we're going to have nowhere to send it transmission limits us going into New Mexico or into the north\nAnd something that the um I found out about and we were talking about about California's initiative and their energy initiative eventually they want to get to a hundred percent from renewable resources correct and that no\nSixty percent ... hundred percent clean okay hundred percent clean but nuclear will be probably off the table by that point\nI'm going to make that assumption you don't need to the nuclear it will be off the table by that point\nUm is there a provision in their law that allows them to buy from Arizona for example off ... do we sell ... cells over to California right now today by our nuclear power they could they could they could buy it in their offshore during the day yeah citing basically out of their state and federal right out of mind the fact right now I have I have\nThree owners over there and and uh so they get\nThey get a percentage of our electricity all the time the SP one hundreds of California just passed specifically says that they can use nuclear\nOr for the forty percent of cleaner energy they can also use carbon capture a on fossil fuels saw a change so you see California is they go further down this they're changing their their direction\nI'm not a hundred and eighty degrees but they are adjusting so you think about proposition one twenty seven and and this to the constitution that makes no sense to anybody I don't believe the fact that if you want to move forward\nUm you had a commissioner Tobin on a few weeks ago and he talks about eighty percent clean by twenty fifty\nThat's something that everybody can get in to discuss and how do we get there and is it is a totally eighty percent\nBut the thing that commissioner Tobin a talks about is every four years we'll review the plant and\nLook at it and it's just yeah and he includes nuclear heat up but you can adjust it whereas this constitutional amendment I'm your pigeonholed into this and it is it is mostly solar I guess when I'm ... but that that's about\n\nThat's yeah for that show Monday through friday a three year old boy what\nA soccer [noise]\nFolks you've heard me talk about twilight janitorial\nYou know that's why like janitorial company
