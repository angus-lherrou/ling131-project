husband and I got a piece for our wedding and um we didn't get to the insurance part but as far we park is our life insurance I only got part permanent part term and of course we watch the insurance part last night and we just got\nA ... about a week ago so I take that our financial advisor in fact we immediately wanted to get rid of that term are All right the permanent and just have term and he said Dave Ramsey is talking about oh why Herman insurance not portfolio base permanent insurance which is what you\nDo is it felt bad shall we still didn't get the term\nI apparently he doesn't know much about Dave Ramsey [laughter] okay Dave Ramsey does not ever invest I was real clear on the lesson you heard me yeah when you never tell you under any circumstances to use life insurance has an investment vehicle\nOne hundred percent of the time it sucks\nWhen you say because what we told him we wanted to do it\nWhen I Would say you need a new financial advisor that's what I Would show you you don't have a financial adviser you\nHave a life insurance\nSalesman okay selling you insurance\nSo what we were thinking we should do it for it to four hundred thousand just the term H. and then that money we were 'cause it looked like three hundred dollars a month but I don't want 'em and just go ahead and open up our Ron Ron R. IRA and start getting money into that\nIn bed with mutual funds okay that's exactly what you learn in class was uh yeah so you already knew what she said yeah he didn't like which tells me one of those things\nEither this guy's a liar or he's ignorant\nRight [laughter]\nHe's a family friend who's in the um actually one of our friends did apparently gave them our number ... for as well\nYeah yeah okay so I I don't know which is I mean I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I've never in my life told someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nRight and the last thing it on our term policy um on your class he said you know twenty or Thirty years whatever was on ... and our term policy was until we were eighty wet hand [laughter]\nOkay\nWhy don't you jump on the sand or insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy for I think it's going to blow your mind how much this guy's overcharged you for everything he sold you\nOK okay and you're probably going to end up just canceling everything with him so this kind of really needs a good firing okay\nThat sounds like well Oregon ... I'm In the end of it like\nAll right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... number for some reason heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically um\nThe people who sell investment based or whole\nLife or permanent life or portfolio or universal or anything where there is an investment going into insurance\nAre not happy with me they don't like me and so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they sell crap crap in a bag that's what it is\nOr or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business\nBecause they sell crap rap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing\nWhen you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return regardless of what they quote you after they take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to four years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been in a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money\nAnd that's where you should be when you die\nWith cash value permanent portfolio universal indexed universal life insurance they pay only the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone\nSo you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you a bad right of return and when you die they keep it all\nSo bad savings account it's bad investment broker the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nOr basically the payday lender the middle class their crap\nAnd that's what Dave Ramsey has always had for twenty five years here on the air upset it\nFor twenty five years is alive owned myself I have never owned while this show was operating any kind of whole life or investment based life insurance of any kind\nEver not did get a horrible northwestern mutual whole life grotesque old school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Brittany it was a guy my wife knew from college\nCame around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from him\nI had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was\nAnd got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy anything other than\nFifteen to twenty two year\nTerm life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you the best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops several companies the best way to buy insurance of any connoisseur a broker that shop several companies and get you the best possible deal\nWhether it's your car insurance your homeowner's insurance your long term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind\nLetter broke her shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of deal and that's why we've endorsed for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from Zander and I don't own Zander insurance around any of it that's the other a lot is always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the day Ramsey endorsement but the reason he done well is he he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd they don't sell your name the list of people when you go on there either so that's ... it's real simple takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance has been cost that much\nSo just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that yet again yet again yet again yet again yet again\nYes you need life insurance hope by the way a broker ... you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with get with the help they usually indoors local providers for your ... what we call PNC property and casual you got your car and your homeowner's insurance you can shop most people say three to eight hundred dollars a year\nOn their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agents in the business a captive agent can sell for one company like a state for major\nForeign nation wide and Asia\nOr Peyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent was it nationwide that's nationwide and you know but um and they're both good guys I like both of them there's nothing to do with that what you're paying for those guys\nWhen you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in and neither one of those guys were cheap I'll just tell you this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nFocus is one of my favorite times of year the kids in school football season is here and people everywhere are preparing for the new routines well while you're in preparation mode think about this was the last time you checked on your financial plan\nAnd then you know you put money mutual fund they don't bother you you know but you you put put her in her in a house they go out here [laughter]\nAnd so there's a ... you know you got the hassle of buying it you got to pay the taxes you gotta pay the insurance I mean they're dealing with managing real estate all the aspects of it is a hassle factor I've got a bunch of it I'm most by far I have more in real estate than I Do in the stock market I've got a lot in both\nBut a real estate will give you a better rate of return but it requires\nManagement by you or someone else and even if you have somebody else to what you got to manage the manager you cannot ignore it and so\nMy real estate with an internal right of return which is the tax benefit the the you know that appreciation schedule in other words the actual cash on cash return ... modest expenses as a return on investment and the growth in value or you put those three things together and real estate you get the actual return which is called the intern right of return the IRR\nOkay what you would compare to a mutual fund right of return to do apples to apples higher hassle factor but most of my real estate is Seventeen to twenty percent right of return I are are\nNot casual cash is about ten\nOkay or a little less in some of it okay but uh I our our total with increases in value and other stuff so I'm making more on that than I Am on the real ... on the other maybe double what on that are making a mutual fund but I've got a lot more hassle with it\nI mean it's um you know even though I don't management of my son in law runs our our real estate company and he manages all of it and I don't I don't put up I don't personally\nDeal with a renter or something like that or anything or vacancy or a broken her condition and all that he deals with all that stuff but but you know I went over all the ... this morning with him and to see how the properties are doing we check on him and he's telling me the stories of the drama he gets to deal with and such is real estate but I Love real estate do\nI get all of course I'm sure they might price point with a hundred thousand dollar house so at five hundred thousand I have I can get five home mhm I'm all in a hundred thousand each mhm now so I don't I own an outright autographs minus expenses are free and clear or somebody else and wanting to buy three\nAnd four fifty percent\nYeah well I don't ... you know I don't I think I Know your answer there on a leveraging I\nI'm not going to leveraging the I don't I ... I Want the extra pain in the butt of dealing with a banker on top of this right and on top of that I got risk and it just takes all the joy out of this whole discussion um what's the average price point in your area nationwide it's a little over two hundred thousand\nYeah probably about that I mean I can get a three bedroom one bath three bedroom two baths for about a hundred maybe a hundred and twenty ... single family home yeah\nI I'm probably gonna bump on up in the hundred and fifty range in you and do three three one fifty one suddenly fives rather than there are rather than five ones and the only reason I'm telling you that is get a good by on whatever you by whatever it is not above bonding right but the higher the clash runner\nOr the more they pay in rent or their users are dealing with generally speaking\nAs a general category it's not always true\nI mean there's some wonderful people that rented every\nYou know people pay two dollars a month [noise]\nOf vote with their lives and my\nI both myself and my home the shuttle\nWas if you don't want [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare\nI don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally an forever is with timeshare exit team\nThey have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution they've exploited thousands of timeshare owners this year alone\nThey're the best in the business because they simply a more options for exit than anyone else it could be a long process\nBut there with you every step of the way and timeshare exit team is so confident in their exit service that if they don't get you out you get a full refund called eight for for\nNine nine nine exit and schedule a free consultation eight for for nine nine nine ... or timeshare exit team dot com\n\nThat fifty two percent of Americans have less than ten thousand dollars saved for retirement [noise] if you're in that majority retirement may sound like a hopeless situation but it doesn't have to be my name is ...\nAnd I want to help you harbor past your dream retirement we have to start thinking that retirement begins with some magical age like sixty five or Seventy retirement begins when you have enough money to enjoy the lifestyle you dream about\nIt's going to take more than a dream though\nYou have to get serious about making a plan I've created an assessment tools that helps you know what you need to do to reach your dream return get your free assessment at ... dot com what your goal is to live comfortably travels the world or have enough money to help grandkids with college\nAnd to be able to give like crazy you can reach the number you mean it just takes a point ... dot com to start making your plan today\nIf you listen to the Dave Ramsey show you know we offer lots of books and resources in our online store but\nDid you know we have kids products to you can help get your kids and grandkids started off on the right track\nFinancial ... junior helps parents teach their kids about money it's packed with fun tools and activities and lays out how to give to save and spent wisely juniors adventure it's it's a set of six colorful books that teaches values like honesty hard work and the dangers of debt\nWe also have the juniors adventures bank was separate slots forgiving saving and spending and we haven't forgotten teens we offer powerful series on DVD\nCalled generation change that teaches teens how they can be who God created them to be how to do more with their money and how to get the most out of life\nThe online store is loaded with stuff for kids their product bundles and failed going on all the time visit the online store at Dave Ramsey dot com and make sure your kids know what you wish you had known at ... dot\nCom Hey Rachel Craig here with the gift ideas for kids you'll feel good about giving junior that been Starbucks on new with new colorful illustration and a shorter workout\nTheir stories are do find that kids won't even know that they're learning valuable life lessons but it's a senior and it's not favor bank are only to\nGive a gift that mean something that year you'll find junior and the online store at ... dot com or call us at ... late twenties you Pete AAA teaches seven three two to three\nMm\n\n\n\nThat I remember being twenty two for the rewards for humility in fear of the lord", "show_name": "Under Oath with Matt Englett", "year": "2018", "city": "Kachina Village", "day": "20"}
