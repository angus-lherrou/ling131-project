Phoenix, Arizona welcome to the Dave Ramsey show bread what's up\n[noise] [noise] Hi thanks for taking my call there sure how can I help\nI have a question are we are my wife and I are just getting started and baby step to ah we've got about Ninety thousand in\nAnd we currently have a three vehicles two of them are mine that I use her work they're both paid off um I use a truck and then I also have\nCome your car that I use regularly on most days of the week but the truck I have to use one per week to court trailer\nHer car she owes about eleven thousand on and we're all ... percent interest we could probably get by just sharing my two vehicles [noise]\nUm but we just didn't know since the car loan or their ... an interest should we just sell it to you know get rid of some of the dead or should we should we keep it because it hurts\nThe zero percent wouldn't enter into my decision it would just be whether or not I wanted to work hard enough to pay off the eleven thousand dollars in debt and how fast you can pay it off water all three of these cars worth\n[noise] uh the truck is probably worth about ... ... my car's probably also worth about Fifteen her car we think we can probably sell her for about ten\n'cause one rule of thumb is you don't want vehicles things with motors in them totaled up being more than about half your annual income because then you've got too much stuff going down in value OK okay not violating that though so we're good or the second rule of thumb I ...\nIf you're a business owner needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter dot com slash Dave\nIs is that she's got to stay plugged into a properly balanced medication regime and plugged into counseling she has to want to be well\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situations solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago but\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January took myself you know\nOf of her checking am because\nHeart when I got ... got involved more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\nHe was doing drugs yeah what we know and and so he wasn't in his right mind\nI rest my case you know so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to participate in her healing\nFinancially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom did this baby and have a good life and make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent from mom of eventually\nBut if you can get her back I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and not be perpetual but to do that was yeah I mean but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go of the seat again\nBut you like going to see last time not because she was healthy but because she was unhealthy\nYeah and I'd like to get her up and running in healthy you know we got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life she's got to balance that stuff but if she doesn't\nShe going to hit the bridge every time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially here we are again ... ... you know and it's just I'm ... but\nThe good news is I I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating\nFor the people that habit and those that love them but the good news is I have seen a innumerable number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper amount of medication and some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\nThem are now she only did he medicated that she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not Medicaid\nWell there's you you don't want him just in a in a fall the rest of their life\nIs I mean they add controlled her yet she definitely has a ward of the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen yeah uh as as as early mentally ill and she is with us She's not on a couple of different methods she does\nWell her ... her only shot then is what we're talking about but our goal is this girl to be forty four and all this to be a memory\nCan happen\nAnd it happens to people all the time so what\nDoes she say right now when they call her\nAnd so you get nothing so she does take up the phone\nYou know you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them because you just you know 'cause they're going to just I don't\nThink I should be talking she should be telling them\nEither want to have you got a long conversation it's got nothing you get nothing because all they're going to badger her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs going then we start negotiating in trying to work our way through the death right\nWell my husband thinks that if this goes on a year or two and they will eventually come back and want to negotiate and\nI are going to negotiate after two months oh really yeah\nOkay I think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months\nHow their their during our pliable today but she's got no money and you're not giving or any you know so they get nothing\nThey get nothing today now\nSix months from now she's balanced on her meds taking care of the baby working still living under your roof you can give her the emotional support you put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people call collectors\nAnd so let's say I mean she'll she'll a little bit here Thirteen entered their eight under their did she say look it can we work at a deal\nYeah or you know they\nWere Thirteen hundred bucks you haven't seen any money in two years I'm now back up and work and again I got
