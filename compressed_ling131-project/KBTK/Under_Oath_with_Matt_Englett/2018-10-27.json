lobby of Ramsey solutions just stopped by because they were in the neighborhood from Anchorage\nAlaska [laughter] not really but thanks for coming by guys are you for having a ... absolutely so you guys have a question\nWe do we have a question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years ago there were going to retire from our jobs and a lot in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp\nFor officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\n\nThe camp will be\nA the the operations of the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is on your own own will be rented or on\nWe currently own property currently on that property and we'll be living on at a time and um I Would suggest you keep that separate\nFrom the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and ah then you would carry law journal liability on\nYour land or in case something happened with the rent or which happens to be your nonprofit and in the nonprofit you would sit down and talk about what kind of a you know you need\nTo get with the insurance broker and what kind of a insurance is appropriate then\nFor a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I'd be concerned about uh that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that who are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the time they could sell the the nonprofit or you either one and so\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property\nOr they they will be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the nonprofit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure\n'em things that they don't own you don't have an ... interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit\nOr how I Would keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not you know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do with let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land you know you got mess on your hand\nYou're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do with let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land you know you got mess on your hands up the land is owned by the nonprofit usually what I'm saying yeah keep that separates a in so treat the you know the landlord heck can only ensure the buildings\nThe business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liability associated with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenant for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords house you see what I'm saying it's a treat these things separately in your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the types of uh of interests people shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it in mind but you wouldn't want by there even if they did so you you said you would go to insurance broker and they shot five different companies that right airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you how that ... works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash what would happen in the same kind of thing here they would find five different companies that right camp insurance\nFor for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means in insurance where they find somebody that I write you a policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs so much of this cover company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and it costs this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\nBecause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the foreign plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can you know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in your shoes\nIs but the main thing you want is liability do do hold harmless agreements or carry any weight in any of this\nUm no I ... yeah they carry weight but I'm\nThe\nThere are no agreements that keep someone from ... you cannot contract away liability okay so let's say that a floor was rotten and one of the cabins okay and um\nThat's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless\nYou you are liable for that uh you're standing in my building if you slip and fall and uh because we didn't you know properly and stole the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a Harley Varmus before you walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff's effort in ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called ... those moves or risk management move your your managing your risk I but I hold harmless is\nIt what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts that keeps honest people honest\nRight it's like do you know you are you are walking across that employer you fell on your face 'cause you trip\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any of the insurance companies lawyer is going to call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case to not have to write him a check\nBut you need the backup in case you were to lose that uh and it'd be proven that that you are liable regardless of the hold harmless but I I\nI Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and have an attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents that are often Brenda about how if you die you're not that they're not liable they're still level\n[laughter] they'll still loose [laughter] so I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you hey thanks for the Gulf and his regime you're joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money\nAnd a\nJump in and we'll talk AAA eight to five five two to five all\nRight Lindsay is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Lindsay how are you\nI'm Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um okay I have a ... fan and and I knew I Apologize if it's something that you've touched on our website and find new to the baby and I know that number wine eat out a dollar\nAn American the fine mhm my question is do you ever think jak saving more than that\nAnd and the reason I asked my husband works in oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing happened mhm I stay at home I can ... get funding and how do you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get better baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in a stable environment with his job is what you're saying and I agree with you\nOK but um\nThat's one level of quote worry I'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off how much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years oh no never happened to have a very lucky we never been laid off you go in and they get home pretty clean I mean within a\nCouple of weeks she a couple of weeks to do something ... going to work on something when he comes home if they did get laid off so\nYou know if he looks up and five of his buddies were laid off last week I was pushed pause and almost all the money make a little baby step thing and just pile of cash but just generally worried about it you know generally worried about is what we all have and that's why we get out of that\nOf the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners checkout one dental dot com it's not
