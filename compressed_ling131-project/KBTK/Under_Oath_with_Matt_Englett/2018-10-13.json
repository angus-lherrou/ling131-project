I think the only people credit card mhm and my mother on it I don't remember\nThank you for joining us America we're glad you're with us Chuck is on the line in Pittsburgh\nI jog welcome to the ...\nHave thanks for taking my call sure what's up [noise]\nWell my my wife and I have a ... a about a hundred and forty thousand dollars in the past two and a half years good for you\nAnd what we've only got about two hundred new thing to do because we have our mortgage oil three rental properties that we\nHave mortgages on and and the two and a half years we've had a little graduate high school he's in college ... about how the today show he's taking out loans the other half and\nI stop contributing to a four one K. O. five got a beginner baby step save but I just feel like I I'm not sure what to do next I feel like a\nLot doing everything I could do for my family right now\nWhat's your household income about a hundred thousand okay\nShow can the two of you you and him a cash flow the school\nAnd stop the studio is\nIf we don't if we're not as aggressive on these rental property as we in the past couple of years\nOkay if you um I mean it it's a matter of\nChoice for you I personally wouldn't put my kid into that I Would rather get them through school debt free and then work on the Reynolds is there a reason they plan doesn't sound good\nNo it it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear a because he's got\nTwo younger brothers that are going to be going to college to here in the next few years\nAgo yeah well ... maybe stuff for five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement five is kids college what you want or cash flowing in this case\nAnd a six is payoffs mortgages how you know rentals in the house and so forth a but really um you know in your case you're going to really is you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt to pay on your mortgage is\nYeah which is stupid\nIn an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I think a lot of our Confederate that we should just have a a a a three maybe four month emergency fund them then yep\nAnd then and then let them stop taking out student loans\nYeah and clear 'em out and then do the same with the other two and then but\nIf you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids if there is money above that then we started throwing it at your either your mortgage or your rentals one of the to sound like a rentals are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still there\nIn the house is tiny but then and then around your house mortgage must be small\nIt's about about fifty sixty Seventy thousand hippies\nOkay or immoral fifty 'cause you said to Fifteen yeah yeah and for what was the only one\nOnly twenty five dollars and write them a check like a year now and I was going to feel good and my son is still on the take out a loan\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental okay I knew there was one in there somewhere to make that math work All right ah yeah still I'm just going to playing along on those minimums and take care college without that first\nOnce we got college without that then we find money we throw it up to have to probably go knock out a little twenty five one out and then among ... house out 'cause it's pretty even with the other ones\n... how about ... back in the war on K or not\nSo I get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now now okay yeah well no says you get your emergency fund right yeah emergency fund is maybe step\nThree and then maybe step force Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement then we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it up the rentals in the house\nThat's your order of attack maybe steps four five six in order actually three four five six 'cause you're finishing up the emergency fund in order right but it's not like about four or five and six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent were taking care of college and then of course money left we keep going down the list in the next thing on the list is mortgages\nDoctrine is that so there's still a prioritization even though it simultaneously that logical\nYeah I guess I was just trying to jump ahead before skip a tree or two and three I guess technically\nYou're given five are skipping a pilot yeah yeah yeah and you had any skip three to yeah [laughter]\nYeah so yeah you're on around the oil we watch your back\nYou can do it good plan man thanks for calling him a lease is with us in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Hi Lisa how\nAre you I'm In the it's an honor to talk to you how can I Do I Do and for you [laughter] okay\nUm we had our house currently on the market right now we live in July for two teams [noise] um I Know there's not an ill in our area [noise] um we just lowered it down to one Ninety nine nine [noise]\nWe've had only one showing we've had\nHundreds of heads on line [noise] um what we're struggling with here we have one day for the house they average stays on the market and my area as three hundred and sixty nine good\nLord what is wrong with the area\nWell it sort of a weird situation it's rural um Pennsylvania\nWe have like an elite area about Fifteen miles from us and those houses are selling for about a half a million [noise] um\nAnd then ... and that that occasion because it's on lake we're on water on a on a dream but I'm a military than at our house is kind of out of the local market so we're waiting on a vacation or\nYou know you're not in in Harrisburg proper them no no I'm In like northeast up here in New York border but so is your biggest problem is you have a very limited market yeah the\nUh I mean three sixty nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment that we're in I mean and all that says is you're in a very rural setting um and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff\nRight and you just have a limited market I don't know what to tell your other than a\nIs there anyone in that resort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort is or is there a a real her up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that usually there are signs everywhere the kind of\nSpecializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but one of the have stepped down they knew you were there\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our realtor that tests not not purchasing\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is there someone who dominates that resort area\nThe higher and stuff\nUm [noise] not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out to our nearest town they get a kind of a high ... I mean we had a professional photographer [noise] it look gorgeous on line it's not you know these rural it kinda like everybody's second job [laughter]\nSo why are you moving [noise] we need to get it or we have an hour drive to work we can't can't do it anymore you know okay three kids you know well number four hours a day and my husband didn't know how how significant like that we just say oh well\nI don't think I don't think prices your problem or you've got a marketing problem you know what I mean by looking at\nThey're looking at it on\nLine all their workers they're not they're not clients are lurking they're just like the picture flip through and they when they realize where it was I walked away there were not client's location Gillum was not the house and it was not surprised\nThat 'cause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor um same set up as ours here on for one eighty nine half the size of our house but double the lot you know\nBut he found a buyer for us to\nI mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this is a this is a really tough one\nI mean do I pick another will call yes\nAnd that's what I was trying to get your dues to go up there and look at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses that when someone going to look at that ... million dollar house and says Gulf I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go oh I got this place down there in the fringe\nAt under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it and that's who your sexual yourself through your realtor is the person that\nCan do that this that the people that are gathering the leads in the upper area and they can find them down to you for the people that don't want to spend enough to be in the other area\nAnd and that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you're not a good potential buyers\nAnd it's probably not your real first of all they probably just don't work this area\nAnd they and they don't have a central Myers ones you need it it's a very unique\nSemi rural ... situation oh I'm Sorry this is the day Ramsey show\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches are being recorded every\nDay and hundreds of millions of people have had their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy the I've seen first hand when people are stressed and freaked out when they become an identity theft victim and those who have credit or id monitoring plans to find out really quick how unprotected they are in so many ways that's why ... id theft\nYou know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were\nAt the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple\nAnd he wasn't that way on one\nOf those ads [laughter] that was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend actually said don't you lie to Iran's eight or ... in the beginning so I mean I'm\n... what's your all's income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the\n... what's your wired it was really difficult to to give up something that\nYou know I felt like we were doing well and everything is we we can do that mhm but it also kind of boils down to the are getting older and we have\nYou know what do we want to do with them as they get old ... and and what we want to show than and so we had you know we kind of had to have a heart to heart as you know we needed to see what was important\nAnd they're going to see that yeah well and the other things are obviously in terms of time spent somewhere where there's the beach with a lake that kinda stuff\nWith the income you've got and no debt you can do anything you wanted to yeah I mean you can go to like in Europe if you want I mean it's you know you can do whatever you want to ask as not even anywhere near as expensive as those houses are so right it's um you know you are your freed up to still have incredible\nUm family memories doing it doing recreational type stuff is what I'm trying to say interesting\nVery interesting\nShow 'em so a big pile of it was that what was the rest of the debt\nSo our our whole debt is um\n[noise] by paying by virtue of paying those off we're able to pay off the home that we live in ... and so we we use the cash derived from that mhm plus cash flow and some savings to pay for our home that we live and\nOkay so it was just three properties yeah that's where I was all your real estate I mean that's all your debt which Robert he's okay ... ... worth what one point six wow you guys are
