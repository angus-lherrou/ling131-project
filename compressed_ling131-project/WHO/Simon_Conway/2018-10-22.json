just so happy with this whole the whole thing 'cause I just this is setting up a showdown where I think people are going to die no matter what happens here 'cause if they get in and they stormed the border we you know they're going to get the first in the country we won't catch 'em all or they'll get released by a judge\nYou know and there's probably cartel people embedded in here they're going to sell drugs that are going to kill thousands of people there could be another truck driver who killed ... you know somebody likes their route\nOn the other hand you're right the only way you keep 'em out is if the military start shooting and that's going to result in people dying so I just I don't see a win solutions for this honestly\nWell from our perspective you know what I'm Talking pure politics right now the winning solution is they don't get to our border\nWell that would be true but I don't\nI guess I don't have any confidence that the Mexican police are going to stop 'em in the last thing I Would say if I'm just super frustrated about this because the non lethal solution to this would have been the wall and if the Democrats would have let us fund that two years ago can be

and this is just the beginning of the tip of the iceberg um you know as I indicated you are with these kind of ... ah this is work that's being done I guess the explicit wishes of the and I ate the national institutes of health which traditionally is that\nIs the funding organization in America that funds this kind of genetic engineering restricts but these are scientists have managed to find private funding and a and aren't doing it in places where they don't they can scrape the regulations some of them are going to Mexico some of our going to China to do some of the shady stuff\nGets your stuff this is\nA trend that we're seeing in science that whereas traditionally science has been funded by the government organizations are Oregon is our foundations like a Rockefeller Foundation or Ford Foundation you know kind of upstanding foundation they're getting a lot of their money from these kind of expect trick billionaires\nThat have their own agendas and usually it's profit driven or they see a profit in it and I think that's\nWhat makes it a little bit even more unsettling and we're not quite sure about the motives of the\nBest ones sky and that was launched by the way it was all about profit which only to a doctor Michael Gillum he is the author of the end of life as we know\nAll this news from the frontiers of science and apparently he's in Minnesota\nApparently um you know I spent some guy to friday's here I'm looking at my producer for confirmation I and I didn't even call him about this but he's doing a start up I Can't remember his name see being remember the guy's name who was doing the cloning thing I'm looking at my producer\nOr we didn't corn about that but apparently he's got his start on very small I'm interested in some crazy dude\nHe's a very smart guy I'm recording to something else and then he told us he stood up he was looking at cloning and I'm like well he's like human cloning I'm like really he says yeah what fifty sixty hours a week then he said really sexist thing goes you know my wife just been looking after the kids\nThat's when he said that's when he said and it goes so when I'm home on a friday night you know on like tired and or maybe I can get the ... dinner and I'm like is this guy for real and he was real\nAnd he's working on human cloning right now [noise]\nYeah there are a lot of wackos out there you know all about\nYour your your ears start chronology I'm back in the seventies biology textbooks\nClaim that uh cloning a mammal would be impossible we'd already clone salamanders and made all plants and all that sort of thing but she put the dog the dog was that we could not calling a mammal and then in the early Nineteen nineties well ... ... ah right\nOh no I was in England and it's all about Dolly the sheep\nRight and I covered that for ABC News when I was their science correspondent and and then what happened was a more recently in January of this year actually um oh what what I what I wanted to finish what Dali was cloned everybody would say wow that's a mammal but they'll never flown to finding\nYou know they'll never clone something really close to being a human well guess what January of this era Chinese scientists the Chinese Academy of sciences but now that they had clone some long tailed ...\nAnd so there was a primary and and the basic an ex expert observers in the field say that was the last hurdle in principle theoretical hurdle for its own any human being\nI Can't predict what it's going to happen but I can assure you Simon it's going to happen whether it happens in my lifetime or not they all happen\nAnd it's not going to happen here right I mean it's going to happen in ...\nWell in all likelihood yet because you know they there are very strict relate a red restrictions\nHere yes ah in the United states against that kind of a fiddling with the human genome yes uh but but there are plenty of places has extent\nChina Mexico I mean there are plenty of Korea for example there are a lot there's a lot of action going on in Korea I'm I if I were a betting man I Would say would be one of those countries I Would if I if I had to bet right now I Would say in either in Korea or China [noise] those\nAre the same question about whether or not that could happen here because you know we we here I'm trying to drag you into a\nDiscussion about a pro life pro choice but we hear we we find a human life is very early stages very disposable that's a fact that ... yeah maybe so is it not like room here within our regulations in the United states to produce you know an embryo that we would then\nI'm using a court destroy\nYeah well I I mean yeah there are side of the United states I Believe me who\nAre are are how do I want to say this undertaking clandestine research and what they need that ... the parts that are dicey parts that are explicitly against the law they duck out and they go to Mexico or they go to Korea or China or Russia Russia is also another place to live ... he's the kind of thing\nAnd then they bring it back to the United states so they have ways then I tell stories in this book of people who are doing that right now on so I that\nIf if people are thinking that somehow our regulations that going to keep people even in this country from doing that kind of research um they're they're really a dilute their their delusion they're they're\nThey're killing themselves but is there are so many ways Simon up for scientists to get around it and unfortunately as I said these are ... these are people who are just determined to do something because they can not necessarily because\nThey [laughter] and in some ... right\nWell you know you know someone someone small then you said that are going to tell you I talk to them I'm not sure if you're aware of that\nWell I I'm not the first one to say that but you know what\nOne one of the things that one of the things that concerns me is this private money because that really changes everything um when you have people like based those in Branson and my skin and others who were just you know can do things on a whim and ... and have the money\nTo fund it um it's very it's a it's a horse of a
