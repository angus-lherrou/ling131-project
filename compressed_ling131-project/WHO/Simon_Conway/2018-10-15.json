H. town [noise]\nAnd he said that\n\nThe story of the analysis you drop Simon Conway on your radio I hard radio ...\n\n\nWe all across the state of Iowa where it is Simon ... always fight the gene on a Monday there were plenty most stuff\nToo I guess rooted I bought a coming right out I've got so let me I'm a little cargo Renee encouraging Chris and Rob on the phone and as another one and there's one vacant line or want to weigh in on the mall but uh that we were talking about and I'm about to get you guys but I go do this for us\n[laughter] [noise]\nGuess that a cartoon exploding along what noise means\nBut it's a ... for me to put a thousand dollars in your hand and in order for me to do that now you're going to study what two two hundred two hundred yes you do and you're going to need a lot of luck if you're gonna win right so if you text lock to two hundred two hundred L. U. C. K. luck\nTo two hundred two hundred and you get a call back from a funny numbered in ... now you pick up ... look to see one or two on to do it right now good luck [laughter]\nWhy [noise]\nI'll be\nFollowing years we were talking about the ... we were talking about the fact once a generation Democrats seem to get very by them\nThis time it feels different to me because\nThis time it feels like it's coming from the top\nOf the liberals former attorney general he turns around and he says kick him\nA guy who wants to be president says in faces a woman or just failed to be president says you can't be civil anymore\n\nThere's more as well as plenty more so now we have ... mouths around and I also Dakota a whole bunch you have let's go to the phones we'll start with a Romney thank your patience running your own son to kill my show\nYes sir hey today today it's\nIntersections what about your ... your home the ... going to take a look you ever about to please step that are raped his wife daughter\nWell you know I mean we didn't get to a right by the way but we want to point that out but you know if the if the mob prevents the math from getting home is he going to want the police to step in what was he just won the ah the mall to prevent him from getting home\nI mean it's a perfectly valid question and uh you know I I don't know the the answer to it but the the video that I saw with two two motorbike cops literally watching this happen\nWas appalling that video was freely available online by the way you can find it a just a a Google or go to YouTube I guess I look for a Portland antifa intersection you'll probably find it a Ronnie thank you very much appreciate it have a great the rest of the day off from Renee let's go to a credit card trick\nHi Simon I I think this ah in action and an activity by the leadership is putting good people in in the Pearl\nI I'm I'm I'm old enough to collect Social Security let's put it that way I'm In good shape and take care of myself I've also got a permit to carry and I do a lot of shooting and some math guy\nA runs into me the intersection and tries to drag me out of the car\nI have an inclination prior to pull out a glock forty three and and myself I'm not sure that I should have to do that I obviously wouldn't be looking for problems uh um I mean the bad guys usually the guy with a mask\n... you know wrong and are those people uh in Portland I'd masks someone I didn't but a lot of them that\nI can see this happening leadership in Polk County I can see it happening\nLeadership as well but you see then you then you come up against me\nI mean this is probably a character flaw in me if I'm coming to an intersection and I want to turn left\nAnd there's a bunch of citizens wearing masks dressed in black who will not cults who say you can only turn right and then stop cursing at me when I point out they have no authority to say that I'm Still get that son right\nOr left I should say if I only want me to turn right I'm Still going to do it\nTo make that left son I might run over somebody's while I'm doing it it wouldn't be deliberate they shouldn't be in the road right\nNow I I Know what happens once I've run out with a person's fault then what happens do they try and dragged me out of the ... do they then discovered that I'm Carrying the someone have to die because they wanted me to turn right where they had no authority to make me turn right\nOr again I think that's their plan is to try to make them a good ... victims were were not\nI mean you see in Iowa now we have stand your ground would it be reasonable if I was dragged out of my own come by a mold that I was in fifth of my life where I point out 'cause that's been in Iowa now if I'm In the death of my life I can shoot\nWell I'll point out because I worked on the stand your ground is only as good as the prosecuting attorney and they can still bring charges they can determine that you weren't you were at all it's not a it's not a panacea\nYou know they can determine that I was not standing my ground but it was something else they can absolutely make that determination yeah but I'm telling you the only reason I Would ever draw a firearm on another human would be that I was in fear for my life when my family's life\nI agree I agree and I don't want\nHurt anybody I'm never going to hurt anybody on the line guy\nHe's the only person that can say you're in fear for your life is you\nBut I think the video would probably ... ... actually well I understand where you're coming from and I hope I never have to face an ounce steak Craig thank you very much appreciate it oh let's go to Chris now Hi Chris you're on assignment commercial\n... when I was going good man how are you good good\nSo my thought is you know in in these liberal liberal areas like Portland\nYou might just want to let them do what they want to do you know if they're if that's the the liberal mindset and that's the way they want their police the police and let them do what they want to do because that's not going to happen and the rest of America\nBut wait a minute what if what if you're a conservative who lives in Poland what are what are you saying move\nYou know it just it you're going to have more liberal people out there are walking you they're going to do what they do so well\nWell I think in in areas where it's more moderate more conservative we're going to have police that are backed up and told you know you go through and you take care of this problem\nPolice watched it happened\nI Know and I and ... a liberally backed government in that area it's not surprising so they're going to get what they vote that were\nWorking so what your well your ... are really when you think this old wife or a Chris 'cause I'm not sure you're well what you're saying to me is\nThat if you happen not to be liberal but living a liberal place this is okay you have to put up with it if I if I'm multi tells you something right where they

I remember the ... I'm Jewish so maybe the rabbi stays in my mind ... who is uh having people around his house he say nice to have similar problems not that long ago a but I mean how many people showing up to the Bible study\nOrganization is less than ten a better question is who is showing up and and they're individuals that are unable to get out early\nAnd able and capable of getting out to get to church or get to a Bible study\nI should point out not in the ... [laughter] that's right exactly right\nBut it it doesn't matter in some respect it certainly matters to them\nDoesn't show of cool not only the only\nTime they have in the week to be able to get together and and study the scriptures that are so near and dear to their heart and so Ken is providing a very valuable service to his his friends there at the evergreens and yet they said let\nMe just get this whole story in front of the listeners because maybe that\nI Will I'll just what I went on just a quick aside I Love this cool the evergreens karaoke\n[laughter] yeah the evergreens ... they are so at this at the evergreens they had the um these folks want to have a Bible say in ... they had nobody to lead it and so Ken how he and his wife move in and Ken is retired Lutheran minister\nHe still does some work for the local church there but he he's he's retired largely in and clearly has spent his life or doing things that are you know like Bible studies and so he\nSays oh look I'll eat the Bible study and so they apply to use the community room and they they say well first\nYou if you use the committee room you can't call this a Bible study you have to call to book review\n... that to me is like striking number one they have to call the book review and then somebody complains about it they they are the squeaky the grease on the wrong squeaky wheel\nAnd and they say you can't use the community room any longer to do this facility final moving to someone's apartment so they start holding in someone's apartment and that works well for a while\nAnd then they find that come back and say okay fine go ahead and use the commuter him again so they go back to the community room\nAnd then the management changes the rules and no longer good they use the community room for any religious activity of any kind in fact the the the rules have changed so much that they can have a birthday party there but you can't have a a a church service you can't have a Bible study\nOr across the rights that if I were it is the Simon come way show and it is Monday let his German would just go through talking to the um [noise] uh liberty Institute a regarding hard and their attempt to kick out a couple of HG plus the roads for a Bible study\n[laughter] [noise] ... you're on my show how'd your high\nIf I was calling about in Rick I'm\nWhat you were just yes discussion about what the Bible study absolutely targets and what I was saying that this is a spiritual\nWarfare battle ... edits at a basic level anything that has to do with the Bible anything that has to do with Jesus it's like a red flag out there\nWell not just not remember the you know they they went all through a rabbi for doing something for having a a suburb of service that he's house\nExactly it's the same thing and\nWell not not Christian snow Christianity obviously\nRight but and it's just you know when we look at even President Trump and the battle fighting you know the evangelicals are the ones that have been standing behind him and the battle that went on in them for standing up for what he's trying to stand up for\nFor the rights of America what country was founded on and people need to open their eyes start in what's going on and take a stand and like what in Carson and hot and that these are these\nRules that are written there and we need to take a stand back and say oh this is the law you don't get away from us keep giving up this we are going to get it\nYeah no there's no I understand where you're coming from I Do it's a it's very important stuff other we stand up for out for our rights are being real\nYeah and I really feel like we're we're we are taking\nBack what has been taken away from us\nAnd that's where the big battle comes in because they don't want to give that ground\n... again where you're coming from juvenile some breaking news are going to go through that right now so much by\n\n\nBreaking news from news radio and forty W wake your biological\nSupposed to use that for ... for me 'cause it's just me at all I can tell you are not apologize to our news bum and I was not my intention\nOut all of us are David Young for Iowa you know Congress and young who's just announced that vice president Mike Pence will join him at a rally on this coming friday a at a ... one forty five\nOr doors open the twelve thirty is a holiday in the morning to national apple does open to all funny a one forty five is the thing that's great actually cause wouldn't have finished the you know when they could do pull you know what I could do the vice president comes out to his office or do you think they're going to\nGet some zombie burgers no income right 'cause on friday we have the uh the puppy jak foundation drive through\nSo you know learn the or the vice president to bring the motorcade through the drive through a there'll be well I don't know I ...

T. O. then all of a sudden that boy it is and it's a it's a form of deception really dive in what it is is it ever these ...\nBut he never said that the media for the plays along with the game which is a lot of coverage that will uh you know with with the with Texas it's large Hispanic population will\nFinally be the year that it turns blue\nAnd the Iranian incredible irony is that the current US Senator Ted Cruz we had a\nOr whatever you want to call it depending on who's saying it um it's\nHe is the ... percent Hispanic yes it's remarkable ... we're in an\nEra of deception it just praise than lying or from the media and they don't really care there are no consequences anymore so they don't really care how dishonest they are and this is one of the worst examples going in this in this year it takes something to get up\nOn that list because there's so much fraud and defeat out there\nAnd they are but he's been described as kinda G s and I'm just wondering\nI'm Wondering which which candidate you write write is the you know easy pending out he's a girlfriend or any office to his buddies while he watches cars jak I did that\nWe're not let's talk about it but it happened or is he the Kennedy the ... very well which one is it really does have a driving thing is about ...\nWell that's a very polite kind way of talking about what Ted Kennedy did um and and that this really is I think it comes back to your theme of political called the problem with the left is they get to support somebody or say hey this there'll be a good candidate or whatever for some reason\nThey have to a sea of fire everyone everyone on their side has to be the next ...\nGod like figures and so it has to be this\nGlorification ah up this person it's weird you know you don't see that on the right ah I've never actually\nSeen that on the right before and I wouldn't even say that's the case with Trump or anyone to where it's as someone has this kind of God like\nStatus [laughter] so so uh work has achieved that very quickly I mean of course we we saw this\nWith Obama I'm In the years before he ran for president so so they're saying well even if I work doesn't win because you know the polls are now starting to show him slightly behind despite this massive amount of money\nSome live more Schmidt\nPouring in from California it's pouring in from New York are pouring in from blue states that weren't going to turn we're going to flip Texas blue ... you know and they said this every single election cycle we have the main thing democratic candidate that's got a clip Texas blue\nYou know and they do this in the southern states the media is always trying to flip state blue\nRubber canned the problem is they just don't have enough people that believe in their cars they just don't have the numbers [noise]\nWell you know the the way the reason that their reasoning is well you know if you look at California or new look at Texas a the makeup is starting to look pretty similar demographically that's that's their argument\nAnd they believe and why is that by the way because people in California don't want to California taxes so they're leaving and they're running to Texas and that is the reality that I Want to face\nThat's the truth uh but anyway the alumni demographics assigned to look similar but ... down neglecting to take into account that a whole bunch of people who now live in Texas did indeed is tape from California and not trying to create California two point oh\nWell that's exactly right and there's another consideration just because both states have large Hispanic population make them similar Texas has a large Hispanic\nPopulation made up of people who have been in America for many generations that are not new to the country that have been in Texas for a many many years of inside whereas in California you have a large Hispanic populations is new to the entire country\nOr in many cases and there are illegal in Texas of course many but\nI'm saying that in California I mean you have a large illegal population people who are newly arrived in the country it's a whole different thing it really\nIs but it's also the fact that even prepared to sent to me makes them nothing but racists oh look look at all the Hispanics right well we know 'cause they know brains to think for themselves\nAnd you know it's funny because it is a natural ... says constituency for Hispanic voters may case yeah there are a lot of conservative traditional family value\nVery much better and that are there and and so the logical place for many is is in the conservative side of things and not not on the liberal and so I think\nThat I think they're going to go\nBadly for the left wing media and their friends and the Democratic party but\nI Will not allow free him up to run for the president saying\nWell that's it I mean if they want to make data or their presidential good luck good luck with that it's got to go very badly\nYes\nSome it is it is really interesting thing Brian I'm joking aside is interesting to watch the news they they feel like in order to when they have to have some kind of cult\nFigure uh they do it again and again and again I'm by the way I'm being very specific I'm Talking about the left and that can that I can do no wrong\nSalute you can do no wrong so when he outlined his\nBottle something driving incident where would you rather may say when he was economic who would the truth about a sun driving incident right right [laughter] yeah it's kind of a he lied exactly\nCorrect and the truth he's always said well I'm I you know I've always been open and honest about what happened that day while he was open and honest about it a DUI when he was not open and honest about was that he caused an accident while it's rock and attempt to flee to the right and the only reason that the real details\nForward on this was because the Houston Chronicle expos they on it earlier this year they went through all the case filed the court documents and published a\nDamning expos day on the real story of what really happened with Iraq\nBut I mean I clearly no candidate I mean it's clearly not a candidate because if you're a Kennedy you successfully flee the scene\nYet than you think that fully kill someone\nAnd hung up on who's going to point out on that yeah indeed and and you know it's a\nYou know whenever you talk about that and then there are still some or Mary Jo ... relatives out there and I I personally feel bad about him I don't want them for a second to think I'm joking about the loss of their relatives because I Know it it was a disc gusting moment in American history\nOn the the media complicit\nA ball into the whole Ted Kennedy explanation\nIs truly disgusting and we we just witnessing again and again and again and we kinda shrug our shoulders and move on but there's a real human who died\nRight there is and and the way that he behaved I mean he easily could have done something to try to save up some um but and and also the authorities you know the local authorities in Massachusetts that that did everything they could to cover the whole thing up to the extent that they could because the with the Kennedy\nUh I mean it it it is really a dark moment in American history\nIs also a interesting while I'm going you know just going to talk about it if you listen to move Moran\nOne thousand and twenty fourth a Native American or maybe it was just strong evidence no no proof\nJust just evidence so that is the uh the case\nOf someone sent me um I think that said if you ... for breakfast this morning that makes you more policy oatmeal though of more calls and Native American which is really fantastic but I'm Wondering if you've heard the statement of who's now been released by the secretary of state of the Cherokee Nation\nNo no I had with this is late today this is this is Mike drop moments stuff I'm just going to read it to you one more time uh this is from\nTurkey notions
