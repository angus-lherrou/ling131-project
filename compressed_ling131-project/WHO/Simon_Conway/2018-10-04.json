thought no nose was but basically he said\n\nOne time member of the Trump Administration or to some economists my good friend and he's joining us at\nRight now I buddy I'm good to know what ... says you're currently retired in Iowa [laughter]\nWell that's good I'm Glad I'm Glad they're keeping somebody you put up with us out of the right on the\nMatter it's all relative retired is is a relative or\nYes uh yeah but you don't know a Sam is a form of combat pilot is a Pentagon analyst or he was in charge of a space command\nWhich I absolutely love ah he was a part of the Trump campaign and that was a member of the Trump Administration are being a White House liaison at the department of agriculture and Phillies they decided you had enough of the swamp and came out to Iowa\nRight it's good to be oh\nIt's good to be ... so are you watching to see you are you laughing or are you concerned for the future of our country\nI Want to you after a while because it is ridiculous the what's going on I like the uh uh the ... is really showing their their colors or during this whole cabinet off it would just\nGoes to show you how desperate they are\nTo keep good people from serving the people in this country\nAh what Kavanaugh's going through has been the most publicized of all these but there have been dozens of us who were associated with Donald Trump here we're close to Donald Trump or who have suffered the the same uh politics to personal destruction\nUh and and gone through all of this ourselves is just not been as highly publicized a as certainly the cabinet masses bad and I think Grassley uh he's really you know bristled up\nToday and I'm Glad to see that and I I really appreciate that but he's got a lot more work ahead of him this is only the beginning because we still have to unpack the entire ah FBI department of justice CIA national defense a I'm a ... defense\nThe chief or ... in all of the other aspects of the the intrusion into the Trump campaign and all of the things that they did to us as there there there are victims out there oh they're not being published\nI Want to I Would just want to a split second ... comments in into yeah this is the first part of what he had to say\nI think that's what I'd like to do when we get all done because this is almost rock bottom I Would like to have the future mending things so we can do things in a collegial way that the United States Senate ought to do and particularly when it comes to the Supreme Court nomination\nSo that you know that's part of what he had to say right um he's\nNaive Disney I mean if Republicans maintain control of the Senate and President Trump gets a another a\nSupreme Court nomination it doesn't matter it is that going to do the same thing again\nNever never I I never you know there are some uh outlets like I said that are exceptions to that\nAnd I've been on with them and the frankly or you know some of those people I have a tremendous amount of respect for\nBecause they are they they're very much interested in the dialogue there very much interested in the contrast the news and if you can do that in a calm and and and gentlemanly approaches fine yep\nBut what happens is is avidly if it is the big generates into a ... at best a personal attack\nAnd then it becomes even worse because\nEverything that is sad normally after you've come off the air with your your on television with somebody like that normally everything that is that if you come off the air is negative and its negative about you is negative about your candidate is negative about what you stand\nFor and then it gets personal and then that is the worst part of it is because they're not above making personal attack\nNo they're not as and that that it to me is is what separates uh this whole issue here the people who can keep an intellectual conversation going are more than happy to talk to\nSo that others I'm well I'm going to do the right now is I'm going to put you on hold because I think ... billion everyone to wear the same time might be causing me the problem so ... you're on the hanging off when you're putting you on hold a in order for me to bring a let's see Mike

just think I'm I'm cutting you show only because of time I want to bring ... to ... as well uh uh ... maybe ... ah\nI I just think it's naive to think that we could get back to a ... foot discussion
