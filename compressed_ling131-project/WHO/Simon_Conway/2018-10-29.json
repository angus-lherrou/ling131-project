Arab or the new Thursday June of North Korea\nOr and if you are like the on employment rate will like it has hasn't been so fight the sixty nine and a hundred other things you ought to be able to stay\nAnd boating too conservative Supreme Court justice or if you want that to continue or it's going to come to a halt if only for the speaker of the house\nAnd so that's the reason that you should elect a\nRepublican or through the Congress and keep the Republican control\nAnd they could I mean ... if I I really do think that if uh the Democrats take the house are they going to spend a fast amounts of time or trying to investigate anything that has the word from next to it\nAh yes and I would say it this way I was facing sad but basically\nThe last two years the first term of this president will come to our home if a\nIf the if the Democrats take control out\nNow of course history is against ah the or the Republicans maintaining the house\nUh it's very unusual in the ... midterms a full the party in power to maintain that power is usually a switch and uh uh ... this is the fact is we have\nAn incredible economy right now even the people that are trying to attack the president are not saying anything about the economy unless the bronco bomber and trying to take credit for it but then a side not many people are saying much about the economy is booming\nAnd we tend to vote without pocketbooks normally uh it's hard to imagine people are going to vote against that\nWell I sure hope so it's just not getting it and it's going to do\nBecause maybe people are having entirely waking up to ... great progress has been made\nA or we don't talk about a and a than a you know I think remember Kavanaugh's becoming a A R a file cry between now and the election\nSo I think that's done more to turn things around or for Republicans than or even the economy\nYeah I think that's a big part of it I I think ah no I don't think enough or people who are conservative are actually saying remember cabin are on the doorstep so I think they should be a but I don't think enough probably a a\nOh I'd say senator your obviously not up for re election we have no Iowa senator up for election this time around I said before I dismissed\nOr the new Democrats are hoping ... taking anything in the Senate isn't it more likely Republicans are going to have an increased majority in the sense\nI Would say at least one and maybe two or three and Newt Gingrich said it could possibly\nBe a fix me why don't I don't really know a a foot or it looks are\nIncreasing for instance North Dakota's things but the good uh we're full on even\nOr an ad in Indiana I even or an addict and uh uh Missouri uh where uh where even\nWear Heller was behind in Nevada ... if I can go and I\nAnd I'm a ...

talking points the Democrats can't condemn divisive\nRhetoric or possibly Simon maybe I took him out of context\n... or what he said was you didn't by the way a well hey you know what he said well 'cause I actually left the the last part of the ... oh\nI said he quoted a Michelle Obama if you remember said when they go low we go high a hold of went about what it's for the Washington Post ... ...\nNo no when they go low we kick him\nThat's what these new Democratic Party is a bell\nI'm caught so I did leave the under the quote off yeah\nThat's what he said that seem full well he said so uh I don't know how you don't know that it can be perfectly honest with you I'm sure that uh the most Democrats said that when\nYou don't justify that they're going to use that again has done is\nA bit

curious and it made me get your back on it or why Democrat Republican all the time all we claim that President blame the president of the ... do we not realize there are\nPeople in the middle of the things have to go through in order for the president President you said that's what I Want done ... but people below him have to work to get it done\nWhat are we going to start blaming those people [noise] see I find it truly remarkable here we have a a a president who\nSaid what he was going to do with very specifics when it came to Congress and China on this show more than one time he said he wanted the tires three forty percent\nOr but he was going to be nice and start at twenty five that that's a that's what he said on this show and then we here in Iowa\nWe elected him by ten cliff points and then they're going whoa whoa whoa whoa no I'm not one you meant what he said really\nRight for the la la dark keeping that promise huh yeah but\nI mean I don't understand every time you turn around one of the country or the president or oh you know really why we just start blaming oh why can't we start blaming the people that are in the middle are supposed to be worked ... thing\n[noise] appreciate the cool ah Brian I really do thank you very much like take a let's go to Irene Hi Irene you on the Simon ...\nHigh I just wanted to clarify what Eric Holder said\nI just read it from the Washington Post is the Washington Post Roman\nWhat he said was if they go low we ate was talking figuratively\nOr it could well wait a minute hang on to say you left off the end of his quote he said when he was told he was actually talking about Michelle Obama he quoted Michelle Obama or is that when they go oh we go on and he said\nNo no when they go low we kick them\nThat's what this new Democratic Party is about that's ... that's the full but what\nBut on my crime oh glorified a guy who basically I packed a reporter ethically Eric Holder was not talking about is the ...\nHow do you know\nBecause when he said when they go low oh hey go low he met when they talk car\nUh-huh so that's when you should that's when you should win\nThem what do you mean oh here we go lower\nAnd Eric Holder told you that no no oh okay I've got common sense okay\nSo when when when Democrats say violence stuff they don't mean violently so All right let's move on from Eric Holder and let's talk about actually I Know you talked about much hay motives how\nTo me why you believe that he met them physically\nWell because the Senate and then he said that's what this new Democratic Party is about let me ask about Maxine Waters she says anyone who works for President Trump should be arrest in restaurants in public places do you agree with that or did she not mean that way\nNo he met okay do you agree with that but she would you agree with that man\nI must give you agree that it not\nSo much I mean I wouldn't do it you wouldn't do it if they would you what if you saw other people doing it would that be OK pardon if you saw other people doing it would that be okay\nYou mean like when I watch the Tea Party harassing everybody\nNo no no not so don't don't try and play what about Islam we're not doing that [laughter] what about people who work on all the president so if you saw Sarah Sanders ah oh Sarah Huckabee Sanders in a restaurant in Iowa or would you and you saw people harassing a what'd you defend huh oh what'd you sit back and say nothing\nI'd sit back and say nothing\nWow he tells me that tells me a lot about you man or if Cory Booker said uh we need to get in their faces a what do you think about I think that's a that's something that ...\nNot for me I think that\nAgain if you saw somebody getting in the faces a for I don't know governor rentals or would you or would you defend her would you sit back and just watch it\nHappen okay what what I'm staying home I resent me these real life questions because of what you're saying\nAnd I hope you don't understand what you're saying what you're saying is what I see is okay but in some chai and I'll watch it happen if they happen to President Trump won ...\nSomebody really violent if I was a politician and somebody was screaming at me the way that the Tea Party screen uh-huh I Would not consider that I I mean I may not like it\nBut I asked you very specific questions did knife body slamming somebody\nYeah I said the same thing or not I said exactly the same uh thing bill I really appreciate your call I appreciate your service to our nation\nAs well uh it was a very disturbing or of phone calls to me it was very disturbing I was very pleased that Brian coding immediately afterwards\nBecause he's also a Democrat and he's like no no no no no that that is known it but the problem Democrats are now facing and I feel bad for Brian is because more and more of us assigned to think men they really are violent mon clearly Brian is not\nBut I cannot believe that we have someone in
