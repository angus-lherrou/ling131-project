S. S. support this in particular and he's delivering on that promise I talk about I guess this is really a A R unusual from a politician's point of view\nYou know politicians run for office and make a whole bunch of premises while they're running for office doesn't matter what office this happens right and then again in office and they figure out the ah the promises that they might is both sides and they are by the way equal opportunity ...\nUp here we have a guy that was like ... it's like someone made a list he'd made he made it looked like someone made a list of every promise he made and he's like going from one by one and deliver it is\nIt's really remarkable and I don't care if you hate the president if you pose briefly before screaming at the radio or throw it across the room or cussing at me if you poll was briefly a to get rid of all the hatred just for a moment\nAnd I actually think about what it is that I'm saying we've got a politician\nWho is to doing what he said he was going to do\nNow even if you hate what he's doing the fact is delivering on what he said he was going to do is something we should all be able to say you know well that's pretty good he told you what he was going to do and on this in on this issue in particular he said what he was going to do now we've had to remind the administration a few times\nOf of that promise made but in the ... when the president says it\nUh it's pretty easy then to go advocate on that issue when you're talking to a PA are USDA\nAnd reminding them about the president is said isn't you know I guess what that means is I guess next time he campaigns ah or it might make your rival is curious that nobody's going to deliver it is a remarkable thing\nUh I was not unique to America having grown up in a in England exactly the same thing happens that they will run for office is that now the other and never do\nUh so it's a it's a very strange thing to have a lead to actually delivering about it we're we're happy that he's been living on this so how about a ... a vegan a dilemma right well uh my expectation is I think you know you had secretary Purdue on and I just remember back when he was in the state last uh\nDuring the farm progress show at the end of August that he had spoken with the president\nTo say that we're experiencing a new trend we know weather changes and and our farmers need to be more resilient and uh the practices that they use in their fields both in terms of getting a crop in and getting a crop out need to accommodate for that so you know we we're we're definitely looking at those things but in terms of a role for government and for our department or you know\nI don't know low exactly what to say about that but are farmers you know are used to dealing with Weather Channel\nShow I mean the bottom line is it in the office of climate to shift question from bill and this person in the gym at one of the hurricane thing where we could not be moral um [laughter] run out of ammo I Lived in Florida when we go all the way into your V.
