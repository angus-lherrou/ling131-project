I think we all know it's the ... uh with with most of uh the the student athletes that are\nThey don't have time they're not that interested because if they are going to make it in the ... in the pros or they're not going to need it right I mean that's that's basically the deal so how how do we go from where we are right now\nTo where we stopped paying these are these student athletes and and creating I guess another pro league\nWell I mean you hit it on the hit that everyone knows ... yeah we all agree we all agree that\nLaw enforcement officers were killed in an armed black men at an alarming rate we all agree\nBut what do we do about it when we know there's something needs to be done all we're doing is having conversations about it before and dealing on bills people were burning Nike Nike shoes and apparel people were doing them both for solving the problem\nActually solving the issue the issue with the kids are not getting education how do we solve eating kids' education when you have all the universe\nIs assault accountability but we don't have accountability with law enforcement we don't have accountability but our education system nothing's going to say\nWell let's talk about to you you went to a\nUh UNC in University of North Carolina Chapel Hill I'm a ... what was your education like\nI'm right I was five star athlete no I'm\nIn the culture of the sport education aspect of it was more about being a player and being an athlete and make sure I got to practice on comic Iraq showed up and I was a fine ...\nAnd did you did did you did you graduate\nNo I did I Lived through earlier of the year\nOK okay and then we have people like um a lot of Gerald he went back to school to pleases mom long out of his lung often use a superstar nana fell\nYeah I mean a lot of athletes but once my mom\nRealize that we make into the list among third year and I didn't attend India's a classes\nAnd the other papers when she found out she knew how much of ... education system was clear out whether or not our graduate wow we're both\n[laughter] you made you made the dean's list in the end you know the and you said you know you didn't attend a class\nIn the class [noise] wow why well already\nI mean if if you're on a where there is a big uh FBI investigation of mind and the three thousand plus Buddhist faith in the same courses and not having to go to class at all\nAmazing stuff so uh I repeat how do we get from where we are to a place where we all openly paying these players and essentially a creating almost to a division to a lower division pro leagues in football and basketball\n\nI think the easiest part is changing the whole dynamic of as as it was just the academic requirements um the athletes are regulars do\nThese are people who are actually your employees they're just like teachers\nDo for the actual athletes they should be paid on performance based um requirements are things that they should be as athletes\nUm the sports industry should have its own career field just like business um doctors and lawyers\nUm every once you if you're interested in sports you should be a part of it and the revenue that comes from the ... any kind of the the deal for steel apparel deals with the players because they're the ones that's actually out there getting you'll huh\nSo what do we do about things like um for playing a guess code to a drunk driving\nA which has happened here in Iowa this year it was something about players do we do we are banning them for a couple of games what do we do do we treat treat unwind the pros\nOf course you treat 'em like there are pros I mean I mean that's that's the hope when the consequences of repercussion\nUm you know drinking is it something that's a part of the college very unfortunately you know drinking and driving his top promoted should be um but ... says that would be you know held accountable for their actions\n[noise] All right well I'm very interested in stuff we will we will watch it and we will ah will see what happens though don't don't go anywhere yet because I Do want to bring one corner on who says you're down plan your education\nA rash of banging a second let go and talk to a shower why why is he downplay you just said well you said the two and he said yeah sudden final year as it turned out to me he made the dean's list and he didn't intend to single class\nAre an eye on the air yes China oh I thought you were going to break down trying to get back\nNow\nThey're like little threat that\nWay my point why our ... it turned out that whenever the\n... I don't believe I Am I getting that kind of getting married and buy the paper is not correct\nMight well apparently not lower shower and that's the that's the point and Sharon's on home out apparently no you you did not get your education I I get the point you're making is going to be very interesting to watch what happens ... thank you very much for joining us did I really do appreciate you say\nThank you so much have a great rest of the day there you go um I yeah the point was sharing was ah was making ... ... is incorrect because as he pointed out and he said yeah we didn't attend a single\nClass and he made the dean's list\nAmazing\nWe all across the state of Iowa what do you make of all this is I'm income which show\n[noise] the radio station Iowa depends on the radio in Des Moines W weight you know [noise]\nSo letters gentleman on you get to sleep on a fleeting oh man I slept so will last night I don't know why I gotta confess so a little bit heat on in my house slots coal mine and maybe that was part of it as well but ah I slept in my state and I'm a bed and or as you know I Do think though that gives me\nQuality sleep that improves my performance on the radio I fully agree with that right\nSo what are shut McCants makes the dean's list in his last year\nIs that if you see all these great athlete but never you're hearing about it for racing for ten years I used to be an athlete\nI mean I've been out for a few years ago and it was something you know that people worried about that we have him about what you know it doesn't solve our but five hours a day and so it wasn't as bright as though there is a vote for it\nWell he never went to class and made the danger that\nQuick five hours of football and that this is all the courts where yet though that is a case but now we don't hear about a week and I was really we always hear about in your transferring\nAll right so let's let's deal with this straight up yes or no answer should college athletes be paid ... should own college athletes be paid only the ones that make money for the school only go on and the right\nGuy straight up so I Love it I got to move on I Want to get told me they were asked to go to news but thank you very much I appreciate you I'm\nTom you're going to get the last word before news what are you making what you've heard\nWhat's really sad is that you're going to give these guys that degree because they have the ability to throw a ball okay a shelf life of most athletes isn't really a very long and then once you're out of that field what do you do well you got this worthless degree it's not much different than in inner cities and I think what video a while back\nWhere in Paterson New Jersey they were passing kids through high school giving him diplomas when you have any being shown up for classes yeah there's a cash award for the administrators and the superintendents so\nIt's a shame that education is really got down to this level because people are coming out short change of an education you've got this fake sheep skin it means nothing and maybe you got this ability to make some serious money but most of these guys don't have the mentality to do the right thing with the money anyway and end up broke\nSo a prison where we come down to the the hard question should we just stopped the Shannon pay these guys\nAren't you pay him but the degree they better have to earn it I mean I don't\nKnow what I'm saying ... so you know someone like a ... does not make the dean's list for not turning up in class for oh yeah um if he wants to make the dean's list has to get the right GPS a gp I end up in class\nBut the ... you can show these guys is being students are being you know even worthy of of\nGraduating money goes to the semi pro they get to go to university if they choose to go to class they can get a degree if they choose to a tree that like a joke they don't get a degree but don't make a pro team a then getting out of a\n... of the universe the normal protein and with a a with a high school diploma not so look enough\nFair enough just capitalize on what you're good at but don't you know don't give them that kind of reward for hot really deserve\nTo understand you can always go and play in Europe if you're a basketball player the smoke enough the MBA a Tom thanks so much money on you or I should and I'm Still mad at you for not bringing in academic sandwich but will that another day have a credit for us the day [laughter]\nIs six Seventy three my apologies to a news department we are across the state of Iowa and as soon as I'm going to show\n[noise]\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news propaganda severe weather station news radio ten forty do you\nThirty four on through the end you'll send W.
