Congress woman said a if a if you see 'em in the restaurant confront them drive 'em out and we've had that happen\nRight yeah I mean your colleague Senator Ted Cruz although he did actually go back and finish his middle thankfully\nI'm I was in DC not that long ago was I was having a dinner on a patio\nWith a Congressman Steve king on somebody thought it was perfectly OK to come up and harasses we did not give an inch by the way as you would not expect I wouldn't have given in Chung show we stayed there and we ate a meal and uh we corrected them on the things that they were wrong about what you go\nHillary Clinton she wanted to be in the United states saying publicly you can all be civil with Republicans what does that even mean\nWell it it's a it's kind of a political civil war\nAnd uh and [noise]\nI don't want to get in anybody's face known anybody that gets in my face I Wish they'd step back out two or three feet let's have a civil discussion you listen to me I'll listen to you\nKnow that's how we should be my point I guess senator is we seem to have moved away from that\nDespite your best efforts I genuinely think you will you magnificent I I'm I'm struggling for the right adjectives you were truly incredible over the last two three weeks\nAre you still do you still Trump strong you were a leader you were a statesman you did give them way more than they would have given the Republicans if the situations have been ... ... or ... herd everybody you investigated everything\nThat is how we should be no matter who is in power but I'm I'm I'm thinking maybe we've moved beyond that and it scares me to be honest well\nWell I'm going to set an example by being Iowa nice guy and I hope I hope that that sets a pattern for other people\nThe election as you pointed out is coming up in a not very you know very long from now or less than a less than a month away a how important is this a in terms of the president's agenda of the uh the you retain let's start with the Senate\nOh well let me uh let me answer that first of all between now the next twenty eight days I Hope they're the battle cry remember Kavanaugh\nIs at the top of the Republican campaign uh when you get beyond the election uh and uh it's very important\nThat the Republicans control continue to control the Congress\nFor this reason that ah with this attitude that span expressed not just with Kavanaugh but for a long period of time by the opposition party or the the Trump presidency will come to an end\nA on January the third or if the Democrats take over one or both houses that that's even short of their threat of impeachment even if they didn't ...\nAnd I don't want the basis for impeachment would be but then they all they don't have to have a good reason ah then ah but they're going to just a stall his program for instance we'll never get the wall built if if the Democrats take over the house\nNo absolutely right and how do you deal with senators the happily going out there and I won't use the L Word to because I Know in the Senate no one gets to the L Word or but senator Cory Booker is being economical with the truth you like that phrase um when he says\nThat you give us a you get off the Senate willing\nH Kavanaugh when he knows it needs sixty seven seats to impeach a justice Kavanaugh and he knows he's unlikely to even when the Senate how on earth is he able to go out there and challenged in saying that kind of thing\nCall because he's running for president [laughter] and uh and uh I challenge among the fact that he shouldn't\nOther people get in their face right that's what he said that you know\nA Senator Chuck Grassley is always an honor and a pleasure to talk to you or once again I really do think you are truly incredible over those weeks of the Kavanaugh confirmation I got to ask you this finally final final question have you had enough of the Senate Judiciary might you want a different committee or an opportunity going forward\n[noise] uh I Hope you don't consider it impolite if I gave you the same answer that I have been given for six months on that issue as three on November the seventh\nI Will ask you on the bottom of the seven Senator Chuck Grassley thank you very much and uh once again a really a representing Iowa in a way I Would wish to be represented I generally appreciate it personally or have yourself a great rest them as I say\nThank you good Bye bye bye what did you make of that five on five to eight votes in forty to wait for ten forty we are across the great state of Iowa this is the same income which show\n\nYou know [noise]\nOnto Daniel ...

gubernatorial debate is in my studio we'll get to him right after we get to this\n[noise]\nHe asked me a cartoon exploding along ... noise means they sell your next opportunity to win a thousand dollars a year but hopefully we'll put a grand in your hand or at least somebody who's listening to the show or you know doing these checks the bank me I came back\nTo two hundred two hundred us banks to two hundred two hundred and if you've got to call back from a funny number to Nextel picked it up bank to two hundred two hundred doing right now good luck\n[laughter] that's why [noise]\nIt is\nThe ah gubernatorial debate tonight to we have three major party candidates because the Libertarian Party was became gained major party status in our state after the last election however\nJak Puerto the libertarian candidate for governor has not been invited to the party but he's in my studio a welcome back how ya doing great how are you Simon I'm absolutely fantastic I mean is this helping you in a way that they are they're excluding you\nWill certainly get a lot of people are paying attention to us now that that's for sure right you know it that's been great I bet op ed published in I think most all of mine was largest newspapers about this the Cedar Rapids 'cause that did an editorial emergency editorial\nIn a religious yeah they had an emergency meeting you just you know who they are they all had to come in your day off by thinking wow without an editorial that I should walk looted and so it's been really beneficial in your having me on the way we we've been ... years but\nYou know you were going to have a debate I guess right here hopefully not but\n[laughter] I mean so we know roughly speaking where they stand on the on the issues right we know where the governance that I've been putting this out I I think this time there is if you say that there's a clear choice between the Republican and Democrat\nI Know where you're coming from and I'm coming to you a\n... it's really stuck this time the stock differences are wearing sometimes the lines get blood you know if you're pro life is for example\nOr the governor is is the person you vote for because a friend Hubble is proudly are connected to Planned Parenthood so right I mean so that's a stark choice completely different Fred ... says he's going to get rid of tax cuts that side of the governor signed into law last year\nA stark difference where were you on just those two issues\nWill so you know there are differences between the two of them that's for sure I think there are mainly about equally bad for different reasons but still like her bed and so my you know idea was going to be that we're gonna talk about issues that are ignored such as many boards and agencies and state has it also um you know the things that criminal justice reform or completely\nGo I'm going to let you get to them but I asked you a question you'd come into the studio way too many times to think you're going to get away with that right and so on those two issues where he said let's let's stop them and then we'll go from that\nI think you asked a abortion first of All right so I Do think we should ... that's one thing I Would agree with the heartbeat bill that isn't the going through the courts right now when you get overturned but that's kind of word that stands right now are you as far as funding it's something I think we can do right away this state should not take your tax dollars\nAnd then pay something that you're completely morally opposed to send you that you believe is ... should not take your tax dollars to do the what\n... what about tax ... says are we going to numerous times saying that they have to ah is gonna rip pillows\nI Want to go through and I want to actually address spending some my problem with the tax cuts like there was some fundamental problems with the ones that never address the spending so we cut taxes but we haven't really cut taxes we've shifted the tax burden a little bit so we're not going to accept some online purchases we're not going to exempt some blood\nAnd so we moved to Texas round without actually looking at the spending so the only way you're actually going to get tax cuts from this long term is if the revenues go up for things like sales tax\nIn our economy grows in the state brings in more tax revenue that doesn't happen you know you got spending I would've got spending\nThat okay take a look at tax cuts and I actually also want to go through and look at things like corporate welfare Ellen even playing field for businesses will say I don't think we should do things like the research activities tax credit you know where the state's many cases giving a corporate welfare too large financially\nSet I listen I I completely agree with you except you have to get the other states to agree otherwise we get nothing\nBecause ah as I was told Debbie ... to her face in this studio she is the head of legal bribery and the state of Iowa that's a job right ah and ah and I'm sure various corporations have a heads of legal shakedowns but the problem is if you don't play that game\nThen they're going to go to willy nilly who do play that game who will give them a whole bunch of uh a tax breaks if we don't play that game that come in here\nIt's that simple I don't want to I don't want to focus too much I Want to move on because you said something very important to me as well we have way too many bullets in this state\nAbsolutely so even the Des Moines Register's writing a editorials now you know I never thought it through the day and they're putting out editorials that agree with me but uh you know even they've been doing his best bet are not taught outlaw all that well we don't do that but I got to\nThe uh if it's real thing we've got three over three hundred state boards and agencies many of which have been there for a decade I no longer a proof much of a point\nMaybe they did years ago but it can be consolidated eliminated made more efficient there's also some things that we look at like what the state does if we look at just for example of technological infrastructure we have state websites for every agency and departments are let's combine them all under one make it easier to find stuff\nBut all of our security so there is an upfront cost to it but you give it a couple of years it pays for itself\nWhat right because how many departments that but there are not cheap people will pay and part of these websites looked like they were designed in two long enough to wind up security issues and everything else yeah really genuinely really awful absolutely awful\nOkay so uh if you were on stage tonight to and you go to the uh the big last question what is the one thing that you would do what would be the one thing\nFirst thing I'm going to do would be to look over at a all these words and agencies so when we just talked about okay we're going to go through because the governors said the recommended budget so governor rules is going to have that recommended budget so where do you have a full year to look at this go through every ... every agency line by line every department find out what can be consulted eliminated and then made more efficient\nAnd go through and then present that proposal so it's going to be the biggest thing right there that I Would do get across something\nOr you someone who believes in zero based budgeting\n[noise] I think everyone should have to be justified yes I think that uh now which\nSo we ... we're not going to say OK department of education rather say okay department of education we know we gave you a ... billion dollars last year but we're starting this year with zero justify every time\nI think we should know of course also coming from the understanding of governors not a dictator and has to Penn State legislature so they're going to surge there'd be pushed back there now I don't like to make I hate it when people make promises that as governor ongoing\nThirty I'm to Daniel in W.

Jones\nOr if you haven't heard was called for targeting\nLate in the game at Minnesota or it was reviewed it was a failed so a ... a middle linebacker is going to miss\nThe first half of the game this Saturday at Indiana and and that is critical because the Hoosiers loved it throw it all over the field that they've been running the ball better but the ... are facing\nA quite a quite a pastor in this uh Peyton Ramsey\nHe can really uh throw the football you know we'll talk about his numbers\nAs the evening wears on a bus with the past rush hopefully they could harassed the shop more out of Cincinnati collapse the pocket get them to make a decision sooner than you'd like to put the ball up but that Indiana office is far from one dimensional with\nFresh material back goes db Scott this kid has a a true freshman\nOut of Syracuse and to try these numbers out he's six foot two two hundred and thirty five pounds a true freshmen\nAnd he's already rush for five hundred and thirty urge averages five yards you carry\nA with a log of forty five he's got for touchdowns he's caught eight passes so indeed Indiana's not a one dimensional like they have been off and on for a lot of years and just throw throw throw out of that spread Stevie Scott is the real deal but hopefully the hawkish\nGiven as you can get them to put the ball on the ground a time or two at Iowa defense has been a solid\nThroughout the season and hopefully they can be solid again this Saturday and they'll need to be because this is one of the better officers that they'll face it's a very creative\nVery wide open a and it's it's typical Indiana they've got quality receivers uh Ramsey has thrown\nA Lebanon touchdown passes to seven different guy so he he will spread it around his throat for Thirteen hundred yards completing passes at a sixty seven percent rate\nSo he had Nathan Stanley have very similar numbers very very good quarterback so that's where we'll start tonight when we focus shut out of Iowa and Indiana the Hoosiers are foreign to\nBoth of their losses have come in Big Ten play\nBall talk I sit there for and won inclusive of a by week Iowa is one and one of the capital shoving loss to up\nTo ah Wisconsin on opening day of that of course knocking off the golfers\nLast week the ... right out to a quick lead which was good fourteen to nothing\nA family was intercepted right before half time of course which gave Minnesota an easy touchdown and they were able to close the gap to eleven by half time and then of course the other big turnover for Iowa even though they want the turnover battle for to to a Stanley ... was the victim of a strip bumble [noise]\nDeep in his own territory or recovered\nThe tan and run back to the three were Minnesota\nBut the other show that that got to go first to within one touchdown midway through that third periods where things were a little dicey at that ball but but then came the swinging gate the fake field goal\nOf the touchdown and a couple of restraint field goals and a couple of more Iowa touchdowns they're able to put pulled away for a forty eight to thirty one victory over Minnesota so that was the Indiana or those years
