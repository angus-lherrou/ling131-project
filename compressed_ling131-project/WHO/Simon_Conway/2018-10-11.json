to do that than it is to ah to actually just continue to cite throwing money on it but it is very interesting to that that was the some she he was singing from\nYeah I mean when we talk about you know\nI talked about ... how you know proud I went to find the largest state we got wages going after taxes going down and white oriental men at a family or or making it a thousand well see I'm a thousand dollar reduction in their tactics and Brad wants to reverse that will mean it'll be one of the largest tax\nIncrease tax increase is going to stay and I guess that's not your act on it though and that and we're paying taxes for it\nAnd we're seeing wages go up we are seeing our economy browse and that reflected at the ballot back yet with a hundred and twenty seven million dollar ... and hopefully we'll be able to allow that more faith for Iowa\nOr you know I'm going to be talking a bit later on to other find people from wallet called\nBut they do ah almost daily surveys and various things and uh today's daily survey\nWas the number of uninsured people in the state of Iowa watch me in the country and the state of Iowa we have the six lowest number in the unit I was only five states better off than us in terms of\nNumber of uninsured ... and you know what the only thing that we ... we saw last you know with Obamacare and clap\nAdan with one of the individual individual churches coming back in with at many of the increasing about fifty seven percent if he didn't qualify for the subsidies at that point we had about twenty seven thousand island that moved out of the market is so that's why I was proud last year to work with the legislature\nTo pass an alternative health care plan that will provide options for Iowans that this could I mean they were paying\nMore for their health insurance and they work or their mortgage they were borrowing money or they were going without ... ridiculous so you know even with a long number that we\nHave to continue to look for um option for for I\nWas very interesting because in addition to that oh we're also will be six cheapest as well it was only five of slaves cheaper the mouse or as well going into a a well on on yoga you're going to be very interested in the reason the governor OK\nAccording to them it's expanded Medicaid to lose the primary reason\nOut because we get the help and monitoring apple two thousand and Thirteen we met I what scares prior to that and that was I going to expire so\nWe did have a program that if any place that already covered them and if we hadn't been moved them over than they would have not been covered so we have a you know about six hundred and eighty thousand I and ones that are in Medicaid but my hope is climate that we're really want to work with them and help island um\nEspecially if they're able bodied adults are helping get the scale and help them get a job to move their Medicaid so uh we had\nYou know if that's the biggest barrier to economic growth right now is people and that's opportunities for Ireland and so uh we want to help than I did get a scale and backs them up with one of the great jobs that are available on and and that that's what we'll be focusing on you know what we're starting it already but we rarely get up next year\nBut hopefully then we can reduce the numbers on that if that will be even bigger cost saving\n...

the in the nation according to us is more to look for the second lowest unemployment with third that's Manny\nOur budget is balance we're investing in education and healthcare and job training and I mean so we have a lot of positive things going on and\nI Want to just keep building on their momentum that we're seeing and I think it's a positive thing and even when he asked well I mean and I think the I Will dismiss counselor said last week that uh this is the best autonomy that they gave us ten years and they asked about twenty sixth largest employers in his state I was in storey\nCounty on

election time a little bit if you are honest about it or you can feel that we're doing really well\nYeah and I honestly I don't understand I prefer my opponent I'd never seen anyone work so hard to make a positive\nThing negative I mean even with the Fifteen we've been working year round we've been working on this for years Obama just almost a really brought that renewable fuel standard hall and so and you know I was proud to get that\nOne we got NAFTA renegotiated with us MCA and I think you know that was a better deal that they were able to get renegotiated we really have even some positive things happening from the trade perspective that will be put us in a better place\nOr going forward to make sure because I'm telling ya are farmers and are manufactured they are going to do what they

been a Republican who are coated with a woman in the house can you imagine that a headline read up\nTill now would have been all over the paper all over the news if a double standard you know it's sad to see what's going on and I hope we don't see that uh\nYou know move into Iowa last year we were able to get a lot of things done and a bipartisan manner and I hope you know we can continue to uh you know there were differences tax that was one of them I wasn't one single democratic legislator that voted for\nThe largest tax cuts in the history of the state of Iowa but you know for a lot of other
