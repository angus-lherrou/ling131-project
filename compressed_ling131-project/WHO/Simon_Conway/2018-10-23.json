O. radio news clear and fifty five degrees our top local story this hour ... police are investigating the death of a one year old child\nI'm not so happy with the entity giving them money I don't understand why a public utility is giving out\nMoney for these kinds of things that I don't really it rubs me the wrong way and it doesn't stop with the west Des Moines a five million dollar project there was a one point five million dollars annually over the next ten years for naming rights of jak trace field and\nI wanted to talk to Joshua Mandel bomb he is a staff attorney at the environmental law and Policy Center obviously also one of our council members thank you Josh for coming in here I really appreciate it happy to be here and I didn't coach you on this but get a little closer that Mike so they can hear every word you say\nYou were also told me when you got in here that the the the Y pool also has their name on it\nIt it does it and this is actually something you know you see utilities all over the country doing things like this to to buy or build goodwill with the public\nSure ... we I looked it up really quickly and MIT American aquatic center\nAnd it premeditated American both kinda chipped in I couldn't get the number of breakdown right away ten million dollars so I Will where's this you know where this I I actually reached out to him in American and I said where's all this money coming from the get comment and I didn't get a response\nBut where do you know where this money is coming from ... how do they have this much money\nWell it's a profitable business and a part of the business model is they use shareholder profit right or to build goodwill\nOh and I think a big piece of what what this does is it they try and cover over maybe some of the things that the public would otherwise be unhappy with by building up their goodwill and giving to what are what are good projects for the community\nSo I I consider this isn't correct in a legal sense at all what I'm about to say not even remotely correct\nBut I kind of consider man Mitt American kind like an arm of the government kind of it's ... you know because they don't have any competition we we have no choice but kind of have to use them that's not a legal definition any lawyer out there you are probably like well they're not an arm and the government you know\nThey're they're not but we ... them monopoly status right\nCorrect so this ... there's seems to be this idea that this money who was designated these increases in rates were that was designated for since the sustainability efforts that may not actually be happening now is that what I'm hearing\nYet so there there are a number of pieces in this but Mitt American are pretty aggressively went after their energy efficiency programs up at the legislature right and those programs\nAre are designed to over the long run I mean that we need less energy and ... payment American less money they do right\nThey don't necessarily want to do those things but because we give them this monopoly status which typically require them to do things that are in the best interests of their customers sure\nSome of these projects maybe look I Know that like ... they're they're the big debate is these these uh wind turbines like they're more expensive to build their costs so much more money to put up the money then the energy they saved there's that whole the whole debate\nThat aside the whole idea behind this has to save money in the long term to cut the money that the stuff we spend on energy in the long term that is why they raised our rates correct but that that's really that's why they say they did\nThat is what the energy efficiency programs are for is to to save money in the long term and what you do is if energy efficiency works the people who help implement it saved in the short term bright their bills go down but because as as a whole we need less energy that means less\nBillion dollar energy facilities in the long run right\nBut instead they're not doing this right\nThey they went to the legislature to get that cut\nBack and okay so they raise their rates they charge us a lot of money or at least more money to get the sustainability efforts going and to help\nUs out in the future save money the future but it it just I mean is this let me ask the strictly this kind of beans which\nWell and I'm not sure you know the right piece that that you're talking about I mean I'm not sure on that and that right but I Do think this is is a bit of a a a bait and switch right there over the long run they're gonna get more more money out of there are\nCustomers because they've changed these policies and it's gonna\nHarm people over the long run\nSo should public utility like as you said this is happening nationally um so many Americans not Standing Alone in this there are other um national energy providers that are essentially running goodwill campaigns and donating millions of dollars to football fields et cetera\nYeah it it happens regularly since the law as it exists they're not allowed to use any rate payer dollar's on any form of advertising ... uh\nBut they are allowed to use shareholder dollars so that's what they do they use a they use a chunk of their profits to build goodwill and and do things like this\nAnd that being said obviously if you raise that could be wrong on this but if I raise rates on people doesn't that decrease my losses and therefore raised profits and therefore I have more to give to these projects\nThat the profits are also coming from the rate payers\nMhm right so is this something that should be happening let me ask that is is in your opinion my I'll give you my opinion my opinions no my opinions is you don't put your name on all this stuff you're a public utility you become efficient as humanly possible and you pass\nSavings back to the people paying energy should they be doing this\nYeah the thing that concerns me the most is they do this to build goodwill\nAnd they they invest in projects that the community likes but then they use that to cover for decisions and actions that people might otherwise really object to and and have concern for\nSo they they're buying goodwill at the expense of bad policy and taking actions that that cause harm over the long run that's what's really disturbing\nTo me now are there are some things to you that are disturbing looking into the future or even most recent in the past\nWhat are some things that maybe don't sit and very well and you can use them as as an example or you can use other energy companies but what are some ways they're trying to build this goodwill what ... where we're where's the sleight of hand what are we not supposed to see\nThat so it's a great example is the effort that they made up at the legislature and I was had these longstanding bipartisan energy efficiency programs that have saved customers a ton of energy and a ton of money over the years but that means Mitt American selling them less less energy\nAnd it's a really good example as they were up at the legislature fighting to cut these programs and denying that they were uh\nThat they were involved in\nA way we want the seriously I was a lot of interesting thing okay\nThe legislative proposal mirrored a filing that they made it the utility board it was a essentially lockstep with their plan and they said they had nothing to do with it [noise] I\n[laughter] or something [laughter] okay we're seeing a pro uh I'm\n... and they you know if they felt comfortable saying saying that\nThat's up to them right at the time they were being very aggressive and going after energy efficiency all of a sudden in the middle of the legislative session you see their name go up at\nAt the wise pool I and and so that to me is is a pretty good example of it you know it's a savvy move but it helps them a bike goodwill and take a take the focus off of their negative actions\nBut you know look I'm looking at the looking at the looking at the whole thing generally though they're doing this with our money I mean they can say it comes from different budgets that's fine but it is without the increase in rates they would not be able to do this\n... their profits come from repair\nMonday [laughter] that's a good answer\nA so Josh what is it what are some of the things that you're you would like to see change in this area well\nI'd like to see more more energy efficiency I'd like to see customers saving money on their bills and needing less energy over the long term but can write it saves money right ah I I'd like to see\nGood accountability I you know I think everything that utility does should be because we give them this monopoly power\nThey need to have that checking that accountability right so we need to make sure that what they're doing is as economic as possible and if there are more economic things that they can be doing then we should be\nWe should be requiring them to do that you know one of the interesting things\nI I I watch utilities all over the country and just this week in Indiana utility\nI did an analysis that they were required to do and it turned out that they could actually save more money for their customers by retiring there coal plants because they were old inexpensive mhm\nAnd that to me or if you follow the economics yeah you do what makes the most sense and it's gonna save your customers money and I'd like to see\nAnd the caller told dispatchers her son was unresponsive the boy was pronounced dead at a local hospital no other

book space for Seventy five people the night of November sick that single speed was my first choice she said But Dave Morgan the owner refused\nHe says as our core beliefs rest a bit left of what we

certain people\nIf we don't agree with them we don't if we know here's the thing\nThere are certain ideologies and opinions that I just completely disagree with and I don't want to associate at all [noise] so\nI mean here's the thing I think Dave Morgan\nOh weird they just I just noticed in this Des Moines register article they um misspelled his name is more in any way\nI completely think he should be able to do this I think you should have the right as a private business owner to do whatever the heck you want to do with your own private business I still agree with this but we should also have the right to not go there\nWhich we do right\nGuess to sink maybe single speed should just take up utilities because then you know no one can do no one can say or have an opinion just have to do it [noise] so I I totally think they should have the ability to do\nThis thing I just you know we and we should have the ability to not go in and not ... not support them and it goes back to the wedding kick the gay wedding cake right this is where this whole national debate just exploded someone did not want to make a wedding cake for a gay couple because he said it'd who disagreed with his religious beliefs\nAnd certain people ... about that you can't do that well I'm curious if those same people mostly on the left\nAre okay with this behavior I'm going to tell you right now they probably are\nBut I'm I'm all in favor of people making ... choices and decisions out of their own personal feelings you want to have a stupid business practices go\nAnd\nWe're supposed to be free here right and we're supposed to have the freedom to do stupid things\nAnd you and I have the freedom to not go there but here's the question we don't want to live in a society\nWhere a black person for example can't do anything or go anywhere because they're discriminated against so where's that line five one five to eight for ten forty we might have time for one quick call but where is that line\nThe law ensures access to public stuff just 'cause that's my really quick synopsis\nBut if it's a private business\nCan you let's say can you discriminate against whoever you want where is that safe line I don't want to discriminate I don't want to discriminate for people uh in my business\nBut I think business owners should have the right to because right now you you think about this we think OK well there are\nCertain levels of discrimination those are defined and most people agree with those but what about the day that you don't agree with those what about the day that you have to accept certain people that are extremely dangerous to you or that\nOr you've completely fundamentally disagree with in the future what happens then what happens when the acceptable discrimination applies against you what happened when it works against you\nThat's what my question is it seems OK right now but what happens in the future it's like a slippery slope kind of thing right\nWhat happens when you scale this methodology up\n\nI think individuals should have complete freedom over their own property\n\nBecause it said you and me from government overreach now does that mean some individuals are going to do things with their own property that's really evil and disgusting and idiotic of course it does but I think they should have the ability to do that\nAnd that's why I think\nDave Morgan should be able to do is he should not get any legal recourse on this\nI also think if you're a Republican and you don't like it you should exercise your ability to not go there\nCan't we hold both of those I think we can\nI think we can up next I'm going to talk about just disgusting Washington Post headline that just was going to make you want to roll your eyes

New York post which is the official tabloid to the United states\nIf they would just call it straight\nJust reported directly I I Wonder if Hillary Clinton would have won there's this ad I don't know if you remember\nThis but there's this ad that the Clinton campaign ran that was pure genius it just was a recording of some of the crazy stuff some of the very ...\nAnd not safe for work comments that the president had made on the public record and all they did was play these clips and they showed little children watching it and they said did you know do you want your children is this the leader you want your children looking up to\nAnd I was like oh my word that is a genius ad and if they would just covered it straight 'cause let's be honest CNN and the New York times specifically\nUm they're ... they're not shy about the fact that they want to take out the president they are not shy about that at all they're okay covering it ... a falsely there okay essentially making things up and being deceptive as long as it means undercutting the president they're totally okay with that they made that very clear they're very unapologetic about that\n... family biased so get this Washington Post makes this headline the president says it's OK to grab women by their private parts man accused of groping weapon a woman on flight invokes Trump\nLet me read that again if it sounds like a confusing head headline and if it sounds like it's written poorly because it is\nAnd it's because they're trying to make it sound like Trump is making this okay that Trump is okay with this they have to I mean it's the worst written headline ... and they're trying to bend it in such a way to bring Trump into a story that has nothing to do with him\n[noise] the president says it's OK to grab women by their private parts man accused of groping woman on flight invokes Trump that's actually the headline\nThe article goes into a gentleman who while I'm not going to call them the gentleman [laughter] I'm going to call him some creep\nUm is allegedly trying to grow some woman on a plane now says that he grabs her breath says what the article says and then as you read the article it's like he rubs up against the side her side in her elbow so I'm not entirely sure\nWhat constitutes of grabbing someone these days and I don't want to say this guy's guilty of something that no one witnessed\nBut what's interesting is the ... article goes into how Trump is essentially how Trump is to blame for this unsavory behavior\nIn June here's the article the Washington Post in June a white woman I don't know why we have to put that in there by the way but it's in there in June a white woman who uh costs ... Hispanic Oh yes yes yes now I Know where this is a no so that this is my next point\nBut basically they try to accuse Trump\nOf essentially endorsing this kind of behavior and they pulled him into the article and then it goes on because they're not that's not good enough\nIt's not good enough to try ... tight Trump\nInto this guy who tried to grow up on a plane and its Trump's fault that's not good enough so now they go after a white woman who is be reading a Hispanic man and his mother while they were doing yard work and it was caught in a no viral video calling the pair animals and rapists\nAnd this is also Trump's fault is what this article suggesting and here's the thing\nI Want\nI mean this is like such hard work\nTo try to stretch and manipulate this story in such a way to send this kind of agenda just cover the guy straight yes he said something disgusting on that Access Hollywood tape you can grab a woman by the ... blank\nYes he absolutely said that we all heard it it was a clip\nWe I think it's disgusting hopefully you think it's disgusting but let's not try to tie him on to every single vial thing that's ever happened\nBecause what this is going to do is just to have people dig they're healed in deeper because when Trump says fake news fake news everyone's out to get me and the Washington Post runs a headline like this it confirms that bias\nPeople hear him saying that they look around and look at the Washington Post they see this headline and people to actually know how to read look into the article and say oh\nThe president certainly does not say it's okay ... okay to grab a woman by their private parts and he is definitely not endorsing this behavior\nAnd smart people see right through that fairly quickly and say oh well presidents right the media is out to get him and if you don't believe that just watch CNN for five minutes\nYes I Do this often whenever I'm traveling I watch CNN why\nBecause it's like [laughter] it is it is crazy we're watching um\nOh what was the comment we were watching the CNN this weekend\nWe were in Omaha and there was someone trying to accuse trumpet this conspiracy to murder someone and even if it was done lemon show and even done Lehman said something like that seems a little or done lemons guesses like\nThat's a little bit I mean these are fellow liberal they're kind of calling her out saying this was a little crazy she's like well if you think that I think that's crazy you're a baby that's ... that's how her comment and this is where we're [laughter]\nDo you but here's the thing people seemed do you read past\nThe headline this is what I Want to know I Do because Everytime I see a crazy headline I think there's got to be something more to this what's really going on do be honest with you can give me fake names that's okay we can take the fake names but do you read past headlines five one five to wait for ten forty do you actually read\nPast headlines or are you just skimming headlines for news I really want to know this\nBecause this is why I Believe news agencies are writing these headlines the president says it's OK to grab women by their private parts man accused of groping women on flight invokes Trump\nOr people stopping there are you stopping there let me know five one five to eight for ten forty Justin Brady in first time in Conway from the same income show [noise]\nLeave it on the news radio ten forty dollar you wait Joe\nMoments of clarity by the sauce man's reader of cookies barbecue sauce\nWhen I was a kid I stole a calendar that Paul months what is clear is the cookies [noise] the one that America ... from the original cookies sweeter Smokey barbecue sauce two wings of the same ... cookies secret ingredients makes everything taste better shot through the barbecue sauce was your there's grocery store\nOr a visit cookies BBQs duck or [noise]\nGoing to get into the world's largest computer chase store to use our automatic computer repair system like your computer on the counter in certain credit card interest in green by a computer is working slow and strange push the button a computer as a virus\nThe green or if you're frustrated an unhappy with a gigantic support system please read the rent or [noise]\nI reveal that companies us help you with troubles to take for granted and don't\nValue your time experience that dramatically different way of getting computer had six hundred monkeys in West Des Moines filled diagnose your problems give you a free estimate and fix it right the first time if your computer is running slowly and not working like it was when it was new called six hundred monkeys a three to seven zero six hundred\nSee the end you'll send W.
