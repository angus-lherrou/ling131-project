yesterday because there's this weird phenomena isn't that a ... as it gets bigger and more people start to take up because walk five million\nIs [laughter]\nYeah it it is a it is an amazing\nThings one of the questions that I've never really answered on the radio that someone asked me a little bit of goal was\nWhat's the difference between making millions in power but yes here's an easy answer back when Powerball was started it was just a small states because Iowa in many states like us couldn't get a million dollar jackpot so we pool or money together to get the million dollar jak but we'll became popular so the bigger states started asking then all of a sudden Georgia when they started so we want to hear\nAnd the little states are too big and so they said well the heck with you will start her own and they started making millions so they couldn't play Powerball and we couldn't play make a million to two thousand eight with one of the recession went down in this back to the political discussion here for you so you go\nIn that year we got together and we were going to merge but all the political powers to be let 'em then who's going to be in charge type deal\nSo we decided to cross sell and that's how we got to sell both in Illinois now sells both also\nOh well you know I mean they should have put you in a judge I mean no one good to have a better last night and then you have to run the\nRun the ... now people call me a son of a rich once in a while he loses how about that for a job with that all my life I think Mr [laughter]\nBut it is it is really\nFun to give away the money and to and to see the smile they I've given Away Nearly a billion dollars over the years it's a pretty crazy okay\nThat that's not right now is the money and when people come in I I always\nLike to ask when they come in the winners of the big ones where did you keep the tickets so if you went on friday night cash until Monday morning where do you keep the ticket some people say well the back of the toilet they tape it to the matter is known to make sure I spent a bag we do it but the best one above all Mary new Bauer had the answer for that because she said uh she talked to a guy and he put it in his false teeth container 'cause you nobody'd open\nThat [laughter] yeah I\nI mean it's right if you when you count climate to Monday what do you do first\nThing call your town and call your lawyer you want to get some good financial advice you do that a few just come in and usually people who can handle money before they went ... usually can't handle it very well afterwards he really wants to professional advice after we can't give you any names I don't say Simon Conway\nWho don't know I Know I knew when I when I don't know if I went on a friday okay I Want Barrow Monday [laughter]\nWhere are you calling him out of my own every man I Will be here on Monday already will be here on Monday by where I absolutely we hear all the here with you I went it how about that I was just\nRight at the ... year absolutely I'll be wonderful yeah I Love that we're apart yes Henny ... they got I got ... and nobody would nine hundred million hot enough but we can bring my we can bring my bank can I can take it away I just gave me a receipt\nYeah about a a guy you can give it to them if you're driving pennies brief us so yeah this is weird phenomena people jumping in when they don't usually play when it gets bigger and bigger and bigger and I'm always you know in the back of my head is five million isn't enough\nUh so uh that was interesting but you got to go palatable as well as three hundred and forty five million\nDown there tonight and drawing for them the Powerball is tonight so some people have never played before and they ... sometimes it's intimidating how do I play\nCan I Do that on my cell phone will not not yet we maybe someday we'll be able to walk into any of the twenty four hundred convenience stores that you have in grocery stores and just say I like uh Powerball put two bucks down it'll pick the numbers for ya\nAnd about eighty percent of the people do the quick back where the computer picks a forum at about twenty do their own numbers birthdays anniversaries but about twenty percent of the people when on their own numbers and about eighty percent when a quick fix it doesn't make any difference\nIn that same ... that ... that's the most important question isn't it was like if you did a quick ... how are you more likely or less likely to win and it's like a exactly\nThe same same when someone playing in New York why more people maybe winning a big state because ... ... ... more people are playing yet so we all have exactly I say we all I Can't play but we are people who play that and of course we always do you play with your head not above your head\nWhich means the best way for me to encourage people to plays do pool play at the office let's each throw in a couple of bucks or cover all the numbers this kind of a fun one too you can cover twenty ... you know the Powerball twenty six twenty seven number you get fifty sixty bucks together by all the red balls at once you know you're guaranteed a winter that where you go\nAnd I'm so that his secrets and we probably shouldn't say that when we get on the earth\nNo you're fine Matthew oh God okay not to say no we we usually I mean we usually have a little sweepstakes round here uh when when one against the is figure Terry I'm you know like a one to two hundred million all three hundred million is there a figure where all these people that don't usually play suddenly start jumping in\nThe recreational markets and some of the west coast states you can see anything from twenty to thirty five percent\nBut Lucas Wilson a med farm Iowa says the products they're making contain three percent THC per does as required by law to buy the products people must register with the state in their doctor must certify they have a qualifying condition and products are expected to be sold starting in December we have more on this uh WHM radio dot com\nAnd then American energies attaching its name to West Des Moines plan to thirty million dollar recreational facility which has to be two miles south of Jordan Creek town center\nWestern city manager Tom hadn't has no doubt the area can support the new wrecked plaques which will have hockey rings indoor outdoor soccer fields and more\nSports journals growing or like twenty or certainly you're an organized sports soccer and hockey\nThe facility which is expected to open in the summer of twenty twenty is being funded by mix of individual and corporate donations and revenue from hotel motel taxes gas\nPrices are nickel lower this week the last week\nBy I mean even the high on my own campus I've I've got tired of being criticized the eyes a it isn't but I felt the left the party line but I simply don't speak out on campus that any more it's just too much trouble\nAnd as a lump of Harvard I'm completely against Carver discrimination that gap Chinese Japanese in the ... well I mean\nWell I I mean on the guests discrimination [laughter] you know if if you go to Harvard and I accept that it's not always\nJust about highschool GPA de la schools look for the full rounded\nOr a student's student athletes for example people involved in student government in high school and they want the old rounded students but when you were talking about a ... league schools that are that qualification the GPA thing\nHas to be right up there and surely Harvard she'll be looking for the best students not to excuse me know X number of the best black students ... X number of the best Asian students or X number of the best white students they should just be looking for the best students\nWell I agree but Harvard with very but that being a leader\nHuh how excellent yeah what about\nWhat are what are some of these schools that was the policy when it comes to the football team that I look for the best a percentage of white people and black people or do they just want the best players\nWell there that different of course how that measure of\nWhat a thousand\nDifferent as well as the exactly the same time they are they on the best players they get and then the veteran academics thing that\nYeah but there you can find out because of the team loses the\nIf you don't have good [laughter] whereas if you have a bunch of people who aren't any good and budget professors aren't any good it's not as easy to measure\nThe [laughter] time was wrestler pleasure talking to you professor Warren a a a ... going to lose me uh the book is called the university we need and uh you should check it out thank you for joining us it was fun I enjoyed it\nBack very much for about oh I'd be safe out as up or they go what did you make it out so I Will try and squeeze some of you in a right after we take it very quick time out this is ...\n... on use radio ten forty ...
