silent what you'd call it [laughter]\nIt is an invasion and I've ... for some time and um I spent a lot of time down on the border and I spent some nights down there I've written with a broad border patrol sometimes for a couple three days at a time flown a lot of it walk some of it written most of it but I Can't say every single mile\nAnd a going into those uh those cells and then helped interdict are illegal drugs\nBeing smuggled in when or what the numbers we had probably about ten years ago now when I got some testimony from the border patrol K they said they thought they introduced at about twenty five percent they were trying to cross the border and when you do the math on that it meant four million border crossing attempts a year at the peak and maybe half of that now\nWhile and I asked her what divide that out but that comes out to eleven thousand tonight\nAnd that's been going on at five and half of that now you're down at a you know six I'm fifty five

okay they're not here or there nobody Mexico yet last I checked they were at the Mexican border or the first few hundred over the Mexican border we brought them all a this is where we we just saw it a nice try to do with them this is where we the United states of America needs Mexico to stand up and said oh lemon [noise]\nThat's that's right and that's what the president has said that if um if that doesn't happen then we're going to shut off all the foreign aid going down there in Mexico and the Central American countries included where these folks are coming from I think that's a good and a strong in a bold position to take and he said that two or three days ago\nAnd this morning it probably in the night some time they made that announcement that he'll send the military to the border\nDone he has to follow through on this ... I mean you can't make that kind of be an empty threat I noticed in the president makes empty threats no but it is in particular can all be an empty threat\nIt has to be really you know I think of the time that Ronald Reagan said to the air traffic controllers if you don't come back to work I'm going to fire you know they didn't believe him but if he was going to have a presidency he needed a firearm yes and this president to maintain his presidency he needs to follow through\nOn us sending troops to the border and I would say it could go this strong the president has the legal authority to decide whether or not tell our borders to allow people through whatsoever\nSo if he declares an emergency he could shut down the entire southern border for any use whatsoever because Congress granted him the authority to do that and the state of national emergency\nSo that ... emerged but it doesn't mean that some some judge out on a pile of rocks in the Pacific maybe judge watching I'm thinking about what do you come out with some kind of decision that decides he's the president instead of Donald Trump that could happen and probably would happen\nLike that part of the rocks out in the Pacific politics but I Do like I was trying to find a way to to stay on as a judge weapons may oh I Know a soda plenty of judges on the mainland that because one of the state of Washington and we ought to bring them into this year he committed and see if they get convicted as they ought to keep their job\nThey we got about a minute and a half away but you could put these almost one person I Want to bring on\nBecause she has been a text messaging me on Facebook and she has a very very important question to ask if you move over that you're comfortable you can hear me All right uh Chanel on Egypt off your question pretty quickly so the congressman as time to answer\nI don't know why\nAren't we oh terrible line so I'm putting a strain on hold a Chanel wants to know why it's so difficult for our ah deployed military to vote ...
