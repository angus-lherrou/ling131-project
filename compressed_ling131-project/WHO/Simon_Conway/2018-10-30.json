I Know they would because otherwise politician and do it you'll becoming a politician by the way I just got in case you aren't aware that we really hate it\nHate it so here's here's what we've done in this race and I and I was asked um this question by the way really newspaper quite a while ago they said well you pledge not to go negative and I wonder if there was this\nI've spent the last eight years and the attorney general's office indicting people when they do something bad that's talking publicly about uh intentional acts that they made that are bad ... right\nI Will never shy away from educating people about my opponent's record [laughter] when I Do it I Will do it in a way that isn't menacing [laughter] you know it's not scary it's just statements of facts of what has happened but not I think the voter education is important nasty though\nIf it if you think it's nasty and then you think it's an ivory\nYou said you weren't going down and went bad but I Do think it's nasty yeah I was sick of it the greatest invention I Believe in the last five years is the thirty second fast forward button on a TV [laughter]\nI agree 'cause I watch nothing live anymore anyway but I almost nothing I live it's actually a question I just hit those buttons a whole bunch of\nTimes yeah my wife and I watch watch very little TV we actually cut the ... cut the cord awhile ago we'd get a broadcast and then other than that we are streaming and so it's great we don't have to watch any ads at all now I actually got my oil yesterday and I saw one of my ads for the first time [laughter]\nAnd I thought All right\nAre we covered that we covered those couple of things that your opponent has also a costed or ... what she says it will cost us if you become the state or a she says\nShe says if the state ordered to it cannot be a CPA shocked anymore if I'm I guess it's called a CPA exam anymore and therefore a whole bunch of the oh they have to be outsourced and that's going to cost us five million if you cost that it\nUh well\nIt's a lie so there's no reason to which ...\nActually that's a very good question because specifically both let's start with the first part that they have to get outsourced\nThree current elected county attorneys that are all Republicans as well as a former state party chair have also that's not true that know whoever is elected suit on her condition the audience the second part is interesting too though this five million dollar figure because you can go on the website for the non partisan Iowa league of cities\nAnd they say that the cost for a CPA firms ranges from about fifty two or maybe a hundred and fifty a hundred and eighty dollars an hour\nAnd my opponent in her interview with the Cedar Rapids 'cause that said the state ... office building about eighty dollars an hour\nSo number one it's not true that you have to outsource them but number two Kevin if you did have to outsource from their firms that do it more cheaply than these orders office does\nNot get a we have rub sand in Studio he wants to be our state or two we're asking him a few a few questions about uh about that uh we live in really nasty dangerous times things to me it's pretty disgusting it is I'm Glad to hear you say that\nI'm a we had a we had a cooler last night nothing ... nobody running for office we had a cold last night uh who uh told us we I'll tell you how we got on to it in a second that said if she saw for example Sarah Huckabee Sanders having dinner with her family in Iowa and she was being harassed or she would sit back and watch it happen\nA immediately afterwards we had another person's self identified as a Democrat we have lots of Democrats listening to the show by the way I said that's disgusting he would intervene\nI was very pleased that he ... it was the very next uncle wait till I was really pleased he he cold because\nOtherwise we we end up with this opinion more and more Democrats are becoming the mope mhm so let me deal with a couple of the ... questions in the last a few weeks we've had some really disturbing things\nWe've had Eric Holder saying if they go low we kick him\nA with a hub Maxine Waters wanting wanting people to do exactly what I just described to seek out a Republican serving a the president harassed them in public places we've had Cory Booker say getting that faces we've had Hillary Clinton say you can't be civil I could go on and on as you well know\nThere's a real simple question he prepared to condemn that language\nYeah I don't think you should say that you should kick people emissions or because there should be a recognition of the fact that well you and I are sitting here relatively more to reality there are other people out there who are not and who take that sort of thing very literally\n... she said it because you know somebody's gotta cross that once I get it I you know when the president when he was a candidate that was a particular rally and that there was somebody that was going beyond ... and the president said was to the effect of roughly ... like I don't remember the ... well it it it was easy of course I condemn\nIt and you know to a matinee there's actually this is something that came on really early when I was running a because social media is just awful and I I get a ... and ... I'll take this up on Twitter ... but\nI very early on would comment to my ... to people who are posting on my own post and they were calling a Republican names or if there were some saying something really ugly\nOr I Can't catch 'em all but there when I see it I say hey you don't need to do that it's unacceptable we can find better ways to talk about this well I'll look that up and send it to you and I said some things on my I'm very committed to that I don't know if I don't remember if we talked about this dilemma themselves on but\nWhen I was in college actually put together a class on conservative thought okay ah because I think that\nWe should be more able to have conversations with an understand ideas that are different from our own\nI mean you know I'm I'm not a Republican I never been a Republican I Am a conservative so ideologically you and I are opposed but I can easily see us you know go and breaking bread together having a male they're talking about some of the issues of the day probably not to convincing each other of anything and shaking hands and say see you next week for ... yeah you're a ton of by\n... ... probably would have been [laughter]\nUm and I can see I have many friends who are Democrats yeah I Do that when yeah and that's ... ... we all we have\nMore of it you know I've always throughout my life tried to reach out or to have relationships with people who think differently for me frankly it's much more fun and it's much more enjoyable and it's I also think it's important because you have to recognize\nThat people who think differently are still human being who still have families and who still have things that they live in life that have nothing to do the ... with politics you might love to\nPolice went to the eight hundred block of Indiana but San Diego spleen the scene they stopped one car and took some people into custody the driver of another car went to mercy\nCertain precincts as they found signs of the gun battle near the Evelyn data center building\nWe recovered one hand gun on the north side of the Ellen Davis center there are right about the eight hundred black Indiana but it was it was in the parking lot on the street and this shell casings there and a little bit of blood so I we were pretty confident that the scene where the shooting occurred\nA witness told police that one of the young men at mercy was seen with a gun that triggered a brief lockdown ... says no guns were found at the hospital he says they're still talking to witnesses and others about the incident\nA man out for a walk this morning into mine shot and killed a pit bull that attacked him to my ... my hair was walking his own dog around six thirty this morning on east twenty seventh street on the northeast side when a dog attacked him and his dog police say he got a hand gun and shot and killed a pit bull acre has bite marks on his arms\nAre top national sorry president Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump are in Pittsburgh paying their respect to those killed in a synagogue shooting last weekend Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner also traveled with the president eleven people were killed and it gunman stormed a synagogue Saturday morning\nEarlier today and another subject the president announced he plans to sign an executive order to end birthright citizenship\nIowa Senator Chuck Grassley is reacting to that saying the U.S welcome immigrants to pursue the legal options for permanent residency or citizenship he also says birthright citizenship for kids a permanent resident immigrants under the fourteenth amendment is settled law\nHas decided by the U.S Supreme Court but he says there's still debate among legal scholars about it and he plans to review the president's executive order W.

H. O. radio news cloudy and fifty six degrees that are top local story this hour a very busy afternoon for Des Moines police\nI'm doing well thanks very much so uh what did you make of what the president had to say\nWell you know the president is trying to get this issue out there this has been something that Congress has neglected for a long long time they have understood that there are people all around the world we're taking advantage of what is fundamentally a misinterpretation of the fourteenth amendment\nThat if you just come to the United states to have a child to your best shot automatically be recognized as US citizen\nAnd you know you go back and you read the history of the fourteenth amendment which was ratified in the aftermath of the civil war the intent was to ensure the emancipation slaves were recognized as American citizens\nOr if you go back and read the debates that took place the frame ers were very very clear that there should not applied to people who show up you should not applied to people who have allegiances to foreign governments and people who are in the country illegally or even worse\nTourists are people who aren't even living here but just come up for the express purpose of giving birth in the United states they have no real allegiance to the United states they are not subject to the jurisdiction in the ... in the bigger legal sense and therefore their U.S born children should not automatically be recognized as American citizens\nThe person who drafted the whole scene amendment also said though the way we're using it is a is not what was intended when he dropped it\n... that is correct if you go back and you read the contemporaneous debates that took place in Congress and the late Eighteen sixties they\nWere very clear about who this applied to win who did it did not apply to and by the way I mean to this day we do not recognize the U.S born children of foreign diplomats are to be us citizens because they are clearly not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states\nAnd that really is the key phrase that's that clauses in that sentence for a reason\nTo be subject to the jurisdiction of the United states doesn't mean that you just have to stop at the red lights like the rest of us\nAre it means something larger than somebody who is subject to the jurisdiction of the United states\nI even if they are outside the physical boundaries of the United states they are still subject to many of our laws are they're required to file tax returns if there was a draft they can be can scripted or people who are subject to the jurisdiction of the United states can be charged tried for treason or people who are not\nSubject to the jurisdiction of the United states can't ... the United states has no authority over them once they leave the country and they they can't be charged for instance with ... and because they have no allegiance to this country\nAnd so how do we get here Ira\n[noise] how do we get here uh you know this has been neglected for a long time you know for a long time it's simply wasn't that big of an issue the only Supreme Court case that has come up on this issue came up and Eighteen Ninety eight and it was with regard excuse me to U.S born children of Chinese workers in the country at the time\nWe had the disgraceful Chinese exclusion policy in place\nAnd but you know we still had Chinese workers in this country and the Supreme Court ruled that you know because they were legally admitted to the United states that\nTheir children should be considered us citizens or the courts have never considered\nWhether uh the children of people who are in the country illegally should be recognized as citizens or birth tourists\nOr should be recognized it as a citizen you had\nYou wouldn't now have people uh ... it's become a business here in this country where you have companies for profit bringing people women in the late stages of pregnancy\nFor the expressing tend to giving birth in this country so that child is a U.S citizen and that eventually the rest of the family will be able to benefit from that so that this is an issue that the Supreme Court needs to decide\nThey need to look at the fourteenth amendment the wording a bit of the intent of the brain tumors and make a ruling about whether this was ever what the fourteenth amendment intended to do\nOkay so we got two things going on where you're the president he says he's going to sign an executive order he knows full well that will be challenged and ah and they'll probably lose at least in the early stages and\nHe wants to go to the Supreme Court at the same time that's going on we got Lindsey Graham saying he's going to draft legislation say exactly the same thing in the United States Senate hum and so that's interesting as well\nAnd that that is em look there this is not the first piece of legislation there had been bills introduced they've just never gone anywhere because there really is no strong leadership in Congress but this is an issue that Congress should address the long time ago I think everybody\nRecognizes that where there is legislation or where there is an executive order the Supreme Court has been going to wind up with this and that's clearly that\nClearly is how it should be a ... this really is a complex constitutional issue it requires that the Supreme Court look at at the issue that they never happened they've only looked at it in the context of foreign guest workers who are legally in the United states\nOr they never looked at it in the context of people who have violating us immigration law by being here or people who are coming as tourists under false pretenses that is something that Supreme Court does need to look at and make a determination uh because you know if we're going to wait around for Congress to get its act together\nIt's going to be a long long time I can tell you that\nIt's not a president's calculation is as a conservative majority on the Supreme go if you get to the Supreme Court about back me\nOr you know that just seemed I Would guess that's part of is thinking ah by ... look I mean we have nine justices on the Supreme Court with the presumption should be that they were all on his jurists to want to uphold the constitution and you know I think any honest judge who looks at\nThe you know the history of this amendment the what the framers of the amendments said at the time that they were introducing this amendment that they would break\nFully conclude that this you know we have going on now is not what they meant really meant back then\n... I don't regard Kevin ... by the way as a conservative or jurors I regard him as an originally and I think it's gonna he's very very close to ... I was I think it's going to be very interesting going forward\nI went to the ivory moment who's the media director for fad the federation for American immigration reform and before I let you go Ira are there a few caravans that's holding them I don't know where that comes from\nA headed throughout southern borders and yesterday the or the administration announced they were sending an additional\nFive thousand two hundred troops or through the board of those regular a military as far as I can tell how to back out the two thousand National Guard troops to that and into a border patrol or this president is not messing around he's quite determined\nThat said it's kind of an does not cross border right\nWell yes because if this caravan crosses the border you can bet that there will be an even larger one uh starting up the very next day a ... and let's be clear the military is being sent to the border strictly in a support role now they are going to do\nDo do good jobs that need to be done behind the scenes of the border patrol a which is the duly empowered law enforcement agency can do their jobs rather than doing a lot of clerical work uh so ... you know this is a demonstration to people that look you know if you have a legitimate political asylum claim to make you there are many opportunities to make it\nA but we're not going to tolerate people showing up here on mass or you have to have some kind of valid claim you can't just come here with you know a ... you know a claim that everybody else is using just establish you know the the credible fear\nOr that you need to get into the system and then tie up the system and nuts for years and years there has to be integrity or a\nPolitical asylum system is there for a very important reason to protect people who are truly in danger of persecution at the hands of their government uh we we simply as much as we recognize that there are many many dangers that people face\nIn all walks of life that we cannot be responsible for every bad thing that happens to people anywhere in the world uh the the intent is to provide protection to people who are being politically persecuted based on race race religion\nOr ethnicity those sorts of characteristics by their government or what we're dealing with now are failed states you have countless failed and failing states around the world life is miserable in those countries and there's no disputing that uh there is crime and violence in those countries there is no disputing that\nBut you know if you look at the University of people who live under such conditions\nIt runs into the hundreds of millions of people maybe even the billions I it it is simply on feasible to use our political asylum system to try to deal with the consequences of massive failures of governments around the world\nRight now they've been offered asylum some of them are by Mexico and I turned\nIt down there that is correct scan why would you turn it down\nRight I mean logically if you were a scraping political um political persecution your home country you seek political asylum in the first opportunity not at the second third or fifth or sixth a\nOpportunity that you get what you have now are people who are just shopping around for what they think they're going to where they're going to get the best deal or that that's not the intent of political science that they intend to political asylum is to protect people\nCourt imminent danger and you know once you have been in this third said country that is your opportunity and we shouldn't allow people to just pass through other country's turned down opportunities to see political ... even when they offered as you point out in the case of the Mexican government and try to come here so I'm\nIn you know these are the sorts of things again Congress needs to clearly define\nHow we're going to use political asylum the twenty first century\nYou know if these laws that were devised during the height of the cold water Cold War when you know they were ... to the occasional Soviet ballerina who snuck away from her hotel room in the middle of the night\nOh be horribly unfair\nNo ah we would um [noise] we were talking to Jon Michaelson earlier on if you missed that that's what you're a ... radio office for\n... however\nThere is no fourteenth amendment John told us that he's right why because no such amendment was vulnerable legally ratified body three fourths of the states all of the union as required by the constitution\n\nSo it was claimed by the secretary of state July twenty eighth Eighteen sixty eight\nMhm it felt ratification didn't exist\n\nAmazing how [noise] five on five to eight votes on forty two for ten forty we are across the great state of Iowa this is the Simon ...
