fast simply safe wants to put one of their home security systems into your hands for installation\nHome security is fast becoming a do it yourself set up the eye why for those of us in and out do it yourself set up especially for those who ... who know about setting things up more than most people in fact\nNow how did home security become something that you can do for yourself in a lot of people do big of a rush come out what are you doing telling me about why can't you go out and get a real this is\nThat's the point the reason you can do this yourself from the reason you can't do the others just wires stop and think about it\nYou have a house like let's say you're going to have thirty different sensors throughout that was I'm just picking a number of every one of those things about that but why\nAre run into what you want to do that you're not going to do that you're going to hire some team to come out and run a site survey and then they're going to run the wires and you're not going to want the wire seeing so they're going to have to be behind the wall or taped up the base boards or whatever that means miniature construction you're not going to do any of that\n[noise] and then when something goes wrong with one of those wires that might trip the whole system or at least provide a fall somewhere you've got attracted to\n[noise] you don't need any this anymore now the sensors that you get from simply say for justice ... may be better and effective as anything else you'd get communicate to the central base station in your house over why why\nSo there aren't any wires and this is why it's do it yourself and it's fun at the same time and not just the doors and windows sensors you get glass breaks sensors you've got HD cameras motion\nDetectors they all connect me a white five that base station\nEmits loud siren if there is any kind of a intrusion our problem and if you want the twenty four seven monitoring which alerts the fire department or the police department of bears a break him that's fourteen Ninety nine a month and that sell you're you're still not talking any wires\nIt's easy to understand how to operate it it's easy to operate it\nYou'll become familiar with your system unlike others we are going to be totally dependent on others to come fix it and keep it running this\nYou will know you can put it in a condo you can put it in an

want somebody to open the damn thing it's got to look natural normal like almost like some buying somebody's expecting\nMaybe unless it could be how I learned is meant to be found baby that we hold if they were\nNo no no that's of course so I mean if you're really wanted the thing to blow up you need to have an open if it's meant to explode it's got to look real like somebody would open it without

take Iowa in the wrong direction [noise] I\nRun off and I approved this message paid for by the camera for Iowa [noise]\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news traffic and severe weather station news radio ten forty\nPeople who seem to know about explosive devices do not think this is a serious attempt to blow anybody up but he's still as far as I'm concerned it absolutely is still terrorism what do you stand on this\nWell look at the optics of it you know and I'm a big proponent of why we have to look at why up behind it but we figure out why which I think a lot of his already know that and then you get to the who who did we did and I'm not worried about how\nEasy out there in the security world to see how this was\nPut together but why and that's where the outrage the um you know let's throw everything aside for a minute this is very different than in Austin where we had the explosion but we lost like ... what I'm looking at here again it's all the ... of really tried to\nSubvert our voting process and the next less than two weeks into the election\nSo ... you you as I pointed out of a protected or presidents and are indeed a former first lady Barbara Bush if if one of these ah was addressed to ah one of your protect to use ... what would you what would you um next ... be\nWell I mean I've done it you know most of us a lot of the secret service has done it you know where we had X ray packages and so there's a whole that whole not\nEverything but basically we see something suspicious um you know you get\nMore than one I look at it and then right away your call\nIt's called the local police and usually they have the bomb squad comment if you're in a major city and then the FBI or to come in because at that point you know you're looking at the federal next to this and eventually the secret service would turn it over to the FBI and and the ATF who are the best in the world at the\n[noise] um so we're hearing as a a Florida connection the the envelopes where I'm really bad and we put together a there's a whole bunch of a postage stamp some but they don't appear to have gone through a post office for some reason [noise]\nUm there's this seems to be deliberate misspellings is not designed to throw you off to make you feel like dealing with an idiot when maybe you're not dealing with an idiot Florida was spelled incorrectly for example uh Debbie Wasserman Schultz ... incorrectly or Brennan\nOr we spoke incorrectly and Brennan doesn't work CNN do you think this is this is all deliberate I mean it looks like they were designed to be found not designed to do any home\nCorrect I think again it all the optics behind it and you know when you look at the misspellings but\nThis is typical of very in the class of going online it's almost like a bad movie you know first of all I Want to throw out there that thank God nobody was hurt but this is going to look\nAt a movie okay where everybody has seen some type of packages like this before and whomever is doing this as copying it from a bad movie it's really you know put together ... and this is what we're getting again the optics less than two weeks out from an election [noise] so\nIt it strikes me I'm not I mean it's almost like they're they're telling us when we go with his friends ... hinting or at least some of my senior hinting that they've done a ton of DNA and they're going to get this person pretty quickly um [laughter] do you think that's likely\nWell I I I think that will get somebody I don't know how quickly and when they're saying a ton of DNA you got to remember whomever touched us besides the bad\nPerson or person may have left DNA so you have to sort through all that there may be some fingerprints on it you know it has been handled by the post office you know there's many different hands on that and so they have to sort through all of that but you know they have ideas I think you know when you're trying to practice down the same way is that\nYou know when we just saw deniro Robert Deniro receiving this package was early in the morning down and so a whole New York you can't walk around New York city today without a camera was it\nWho delivered when was it delivered so there's a lot of clues that left behind but for the DNA part I I'm not too sure about that yet because there's so many people that may have handled these packages\n[noise] I'm not saying a ton of forensics and not not just in a a a ton of forensics\nYeah absolutely so just the way that you know ... every\nPerson leaves the signature as to how these makeshift bombs and that's what I'm all in the right now because of big clues time and there's been no debt nation if there was if there were some\nBombs that were actually act\nOr in a way to blow up they would have said oh we have not heard that so that's a big clue but just the way that they're still putting together a construction if there's a a clock on a blessing half which we have not heard about so all they'll get it back together and they're kind of back from what I understand uh to\nTo where you could wrap off the Internet where unfortunately you get most of his\nOwn place yeah well you know as we know you can get information on how to build your own new on the Internet and these\nAre very very uh very sad the I'm All right so I'm told on me I'm I'm looking at ... some line I'm told but you never attached wires to both ends of the pipe bomb um clearly a they were why is to both ends that's another thing I ... the picture of the envelope to picture of the device that\nCame out really quickly law enforcement can't be happy about that kind of you\nKnow and I wouldn't be either you know I when I saw that right away I I was taken back that you know\nObviously I think was the end that put that out that quick\nAnd easy to jump to conclusions when you have an active ongoing threat against people is the wrong thing to do and you know they they should really be\nHeld accountable for that because you got this point you know you don't want that information out there things because you want to start tying point a to point B and when you're receiving all these packages to see if it's coming from the same individual\nRight because evil so well what you've done is you've ah basically put out the blueprint for uh any copycats this is what it looks like this is what the envelope looked like a few go I mean\nReally a a messes with the investigation as well I was seriously wondering what CNN was thinking about from the fact that we go I mean we got an exclusive\nOr maybe they won thinking and I know\nYou're just you just do my work closely we're thinking in trying to get out a new one it's not really news at that point and you're hurting the investigation instead of helping it\nOh I was talking to a robot to be on oh he is a our expertise a former Secret Service agent is go actually nearly ... years and our global security operations and experience\nAnd uh we uh we love having him on who's also a buddy of my buddy or ... or you know he doesn't talk to the little people any more than [laughter]\nHe knows I'm joking by the way I'm so he's a buddy of mine my buddy done bungee knows well what do you get a row with ...\n[noise] yeah we did when San was new agents are and I didn't know this but he recently told me that he inherited some of them by my faces the wise though what I worked out in Long Island New York oh wow that was something that I was like I said well I Hope I did a good job and what you inherited started laughing so I'm not sure how to say\nThat [laughter] um well I've got you on a because I I think we've taken the whole or\nA bomb thing about as far as we can we can take a I'm not trying to play gotcha unemployed got you with anybody a source you haven't heard of this I'm I'm I'm probably going to leave our conversation right now the New York times ran a series of fantasy stories or which included one\nAbout a secret service agent\nHelping a Russian assassin gum down the president did you win this\nYeah and they put it out two days ago\nThis got thing on so many different from and\nYou know that goes to the narrative Simon as to what we're not hearing that from one side of the aisle been\nTrying to see in the middle you never in my life that my Thirty years than almost Thirty years with protecting presidents have I ever seen news outlets doing something like this and if you don't think that that's stroking the flames of violence on top of\nEric Holder on top of Mrs Clinton what she said on top of Maxine Waters\nI have a great just tell you in Brooklyn and this does not help our country\nRight it really does I mean on on your right on so many levels festival like going to peace in the New York times ladies and gentlemen it is a piece of fiction or buddies fantasizing essentially about assassinating the sitting president of the United states so that's one level where it is truly disgusting and\nThe level where it is truly disgusting is uh some of the ah quite literally the brain is men and women in a in service the nomination are indeed Secret Service agents protecting the president of the United states they are all quite literally willing to take a bullet for the president\nA ... that's an incredible thing to be able to do\nAnd to suggest that one of them would go in and\nHelp the Russians assassinate the president of the United states is truly disgusting\nAbsolutely you know so many of us in that served I mean I I take that personal and the\nWhole ... you know
