another thousand miles to go to reach the U.S border but I don't think their prospects of of getting in a very good uh it it is a problem\nBecause if the United states simply allows people to enter your show up in this way then there are going to be more and bigger caravans all the time and I'm actually surprised it took\nSo long for this one to form after what happened in the spring when the group smaller caravan\nWas allowed to enter and make asylum claims but it's clear that this is not\nThe result of the humanitarian crisis you not refugees this is a political\nStatement or stunt really organized to make the case or open borders and to challenge us sovereignty and people are joining it because of the opportunity not necessarily because they're lean on last or\nPersecution and so we need to deal with this early there are a lot of things that the U.S government can do\nFirst and foremost would be at this point to work with the government of Mexico\nTo try to break it up and we've done this in years past exceptionally on Mexico is not interested in just ... and in encouraging that if people are not going to be allowed into the United states and you know I've spoken with Mexican migration officials\nBefore and they don't care about these things if they think people are going to be let into the United states but this is different now and uh so we need to try to find a way to work with them but\nIt you know there are going to be people who break off from the ... fourteen thousand people a lot of them are going to go out on their own and pay smugglers to come in\nAnd we're gonna have to turn them right around that's the only thing that's going to dissuade people\nYou know I Want to hang on just pull up number out of yeah uh I run a ... I read a lot of stuff this morning\nOr those were the are the highest numbers I read and I don't want to tribute to a particular organization 'cause you know I read Fox and then I read CNN I when I got to I Want to get the equal a bias from both sides my\nAll time no I I don't mean nothing like that it's raining in just\nThat it's growing it really is\nI understand but those are the two highest numbers I read this morning in fact I was doing a poll on the second one was a thousand and then I read something somewhere else reset it already grown to an off thousand I'm just a recording what I'm literally reading a that's out there on the Internet from from what should be reliable ... let me put it that way\nOr the way they are I'm sure but I Do we live in now and so yesterday we had a long discussion a day before yesterday I'm Sorry on my show require a long discussion about what the president could actually physically do if ten thousand people showed up on the southern border ... us um on on on like how long is it ...\nBecause we don't want him to shoot anybody out of the girl the president's going to give ... I Hope not a ... I Hope not one death is one too many ah\nSo what kind of he actually physically do if they get the it's interesting what you say about Mexico because it goes if Mexico re believes we're going to turn around and suddenly becomes Mexico's problem\nRight exactly and that's you know and I I think that they do have an interest in helping with that but I went this large number some\nOf them are going to get to the U.S border and the the really what should happen is we need to announce loud and clear well before they get to the border that\nPeople who cross illegally are going to be apprehended and detained and we moved quickly under an expedited form of due process\nAnd and ... and if you want to ask for asylum\nThen make the case they should apply at our embassy in Mexico city and if people\nShow up on math at the legal ports of entry than we may need to close those ports of entry and of course that would be disruptive to legitimate travel and trade but we cannot have\nA huge group of people like that\nShowing up and asking for it because it it is clear from these reports that this is not as I said I'm I'm a humanitarian crisis user people coming here because they think that they will be allowed to stay they've been led to believe that they have that realistic\nBeliefs because everyone else before them has been allowed in and but but you know we can't sustain that we've got to stop this we can't have our policies encouraging people to take this journey like this\nSo it's too dangerous and it's not they're not going to succeed and it's a huge burden on American community that they are led in so enough is enough it's got ... we may have to simply close the border and get support for patrolling the open parts of the border in South Texas to make sure that everyone is apprehended so\nMuch how much power does the president have oh oh does he need to recoup Congress to DC\n[noise] no I mean there there are things that I Wish Congress would do to fix some problems and the law but we can't wait for that um the the president has the authority under immigration law section to twelve F\nTo deny entry to any person or group of persons that the president thinks is\nI'm a a problem for the country that should not be let in for security reasons and this is a section of the law that he relied on for the travel ban that was upheld by the Supreme Court so he clearly has the authority to deny them enter you simply say anyone associated with with this caravan is not going to be\nAllowed to come into the country and yet\nThere are other emergency authorities that the president has\nNot just you deputy ties local law enforcement agencies um that have been used before for example when people came from Haiti in large groups by boat on their\n... and ... uh our border agents the could quickly set up facilities we have a mass migration plan that's been devised ... it was under the Obama administration that says that the H ... should stand up\nAnd facilities to shelter people while they're being processed but that way they can be kept in custody in the vicinity of the border if necessary if a lot of people tried to come in legally that's what should happen\nAnd got the you know to catch and release policies are causing too many problems that need you know need to be ended and this is a good solution for the short term in the medium term Congress is going to have to act\nAnd in the long term you know of course we would be happy to work with Central American country than Mexico do you know improve their economic prospects but that's a very long term solution and that's not going to help with this particular crisis we we simply can't have people can encourage people to do this\nSo the president has said who is in ... he began to do it or I don't know that we got an e evidence of that yet\nUh but he was going to stop cutting off aid or to these countries of origin or for a for allowing this to happen that's essentially what he said I'm ... is that a solution I I don't know there is\nI mean I I can understand why people are talking about that and it's something that we can look at but the reality is that this aid is peanuts in comparison to the amount of money that it sent home by people who are working illegally in the United states and they're more interested in that\nIt's much more it's much larger amounts and so you know cutting off aid is really I don't think going to be particularly effective maybe we can tailor it a little bit better\nUm but I I don't see that as a long term solution either and sometimes that harms the very people that were trying to help and keep in touch\nWith talking to a Jessica Vaughan or shoes or frankly the smartest person not a ... when it comes to this subject so we're always pleased when we go home yeah\nA Jessica you're just taking on another role because we understand that some of the angel families are people who've been on this show in actual fact a rough planning to go to our southern border or to come from these caravans\nThat's right wow you have good sources\nAnd I'm a ... a ... year old ... is um a to do with a a a really ... we're going to

you're on assignment ... show\nOn now I'm living the dream baby everyday you know that\nOkay I appreciate your guess what he's saying but around the white sand is the weight will never ever go down as what I hear\nRight when he can hear you so let's give them a chance to answer okay\nYeah so on the rates going down so we worked hard every single day to get more efficient at the service we provide and our goal is to continue to make our rates low and stable ended extent we can bring those down we will for example the ... energy bill that was discussed yesterday had an energy efficiency component of it\nWhich we reduced roughly in half and so that lowers your bill\nSo your your bills have gone down no very recently or will go down very recently once if we get energy efficiency approved or are we told his board based on the law that was passed him and and you will see that flow through your bill so there are ways to get your costs lower and then we continue to find ways to operate our business more efficiently and keep costs from no driving the rates up\nOkay All right Bob Richards that I'll be looking for a bill to go down there and we'll see what that apple\nYeah you you may both buddy as a side my only financial interest in American as the bill they sent me once a month or but I'm going to say thanks Thanks Greg I'm going to say I came up from Florida I'm trying to remember the name of the company down that um which I count because it was ... years ago and ah and it feels to me like what cheaper than Florida all we\nWe are so we're ... lowest in the country okay ah rates are about thirty three percent lower than the national\nAverage I'm fifty one percent of the energy consumer ... resources are going to a hundred percent I mean we're doing very

property rights\nAgenda at going by now is that true\nNo that's a um it's a long story we don't have time\nFor we we really done I've got about a three total I Want them to tell you\nYeah my question is is\nYou're paying for all these when turbans with the industrial or the with the production tax credit and I'm a lot of other incentives and things like that well eventually that were knocking these turbans are all going to have to be replaced\nAnd I'm Wondering about that costs down the line up and Ontario I'm crisis got so high that they kicked out the liberal party that brought in the green Markey act and I'm just wondering how you're going to avoid\n... well let's let's us given that very question how you're going to replace these things when the time comes at the tax credits go now to\nThe idea is to keep operating for you know forty fifty sixty years primary process not re power bunch of when turbans we're gonna continue to keep all function operational and we work with the counties that require us to set aside the commissioning funds\nTo guarantee that we can find those things and so we have those things set up and I were to have no problem at all in the future if it comes to that point to remove those turbans to make sure we know take care of that and without raising or customers rates that's all been baked in to the economics of the projects\nUp gentleman I when I was a little all hung on I Would want everyone gets to go and do that when you got a question you know you're at a ... so you're taking the time thank you\nAh I'd made it very clear repeatedly without him in the studio I'm not fond of wind energy because it's not doable without that tax credit a ... and I do not believe we should be a part of something else that I Believe it stifles um ingenuity in the wind energy a business I'm not against wind energy\nI'm just against us paying for it but but I Would also make the point\nThat every single time we've had this conversation I have said if I had the Adams job or a previous justice job I sent it to him as well I Would do exactly the same thing he's responsible to shareholders and his customers are Gregory you're on the Simon
