{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WHO", "content": "You know you have shelter and food right and so maybe some you know you're going to want to have some lights on and you know maybe a TV so they're saying that you're still going to pay for yeah so the way that you fill that gap that you have in between which have coming in and what you need is one of three ways so you could either work in retirement maybe want to transition from fulltime to part time\nMaybe generate rental income whether you have wrecked houses are farm\nOr take withdrawals from your retirement savings\nNow fifty five that's where it gets a little bit tricky because if all of your money is tax deferred which means is that things like IRAs and for one case\nWhen he take money out of those ... prior to age fifty nine to have you have additional tax liability ma ten percent tax penalty unless you do it a couple of different ways you could do a Seventy two T calculation\nWhich is equal substantial payments for five years or two fifty nine and a half whichever later or if you do separate from service and you are over the age of fifty five\nAnd you can take money from the ... that you were contributing to our world tribute you're contributing to and then from that job where you left so that's where I work around get around the temperature of tax penalty so it just have to get a plan in place also big one's going to be a health care\nYeah I was gonna say yeah yeah because you're not gonna qualify for Medicare until sixty five she had ten years of health care that they have to plan for and we start looking at the prices of that it's if your employers providing right now they're probably picking up you know anywhere between Seventy five and Ninety percent of the cost of that\nThat's what people think cobra so expensive because they're seen the full price of their health care and not just with their pain\nBut price health care and that's usually the the game changer for a lot of people think about retiring early as how much have to pay for that and you know with the laws now you do have to have it or at least pay a fine if you don't and\nSo that would be the biggest one I think would be health care and then provide that income for more years because retire early that's more years you're going to be relying on it but it's not saying you can't it's just going to be a little more challenging but all you have to just run a plan and see what happens\nYeah great question will and we certainly hope that you can make that happen but is there to point out certainly some good things to think about\nIf you do have a plan in place that's fantastic if you want to get a second opinion which\nI'm thinking maybe you might then she sent an email and reach out to Eric and has have a one on one conversation to really run those numbers could that plan in place and find out again whether you don't have one if you've been doing it yourself it's a great resource or if you do need that second opinion again a great resource five one five to six Fifteen hundred\nFive one five two to six one five zero zero already to another question for you here Eric from Jeffrey in five and he says uh Eric I've heard you talking a lot about being aware of the risk in your portfolio I'm\nSixty five so how much risk should I be taking your\nWill Jeffrey as you've probably heard me say on the show many times the number one an search any financial question is always going to be depends and that's really\nBecause I don't know your entire situation now you look at it from a rule of thumb planning standpoint using the rule of one hundred then you'd want to say if you're sixty five maybe sixty five percent of your portfolio should be and things that are safer and only thirty five percent proposed subject to risk\nBut I don't know what other income sources you have coming in you might have a tremendous pension and between the pension and your Social Security is covering all of your income mates well guess what\nYou can take on a little more risk because you have your base incomes met or on the opposite side you have no pension\nAnd all you're relying on Social Security a lot of income coming from your investments you might have to take less risk because you don't want to have a bad market uh eat away a lot of your portfolio specially subjected to reverse dollar cost averaging\nSo rural farms are just starting point starting conversation points of what you should look at\nBut we do know that the closer you get to retirement you kind of want to reduce your risk just because you don't want the market in an unfavorable market to take away a large amount of money that you could use for retirement and\nAgain getting to that see a and I talked about earlier the capacity attitude in need\nReally jeopardy that determination is what kind of raid returning need to make make your plan work and then that will show you how much risk you can take so\nCommon for best thing is going to have a plan and we get a term and that pretty quickly and our two sessions together as you know what kind of risk you need to take at age sixty five to make your plan works so simple one just give us a call and get on the counter five one five to six Fifteen hundred\nYou're listening to retirement ready with Eric Peterson thanks so much for the question Jeffrey five one five to six Fifteen hundred to get yourself on the calendar with Eric ... Peterson financial group Iowa was retirement specialist right here in central Iowa five one five to six\nOne five zero zero final question for you this week here is from Vivian in ... and she says Eric I don't think my kids are expecting an inheritance from me because I was a single mom for most of their lives\nBut I really want to be sure that I'm not a financial burden for them as well should I work until I'm Seventy so that I can take the highest possible Social Security\nBenefit well that is a one way to do that Vivian and um you appreciate your question and being a single mom uh I was raised by single mom I Know the challenges that can be faced by that usually are putting their kids first before your own\nResources and retirement and those types of things so and not want to be a burden that's what a you know my my host wanted as well so I feel for you but however working till Seventy it really comes down to depends but if you enjoy what you do and it's not ... then you know yeah he's going to have a larger Social Security but it's gonna be the biggest at age Seventy\nBut if you're able to maybe take Social Security at normal retirement age and then do something else that maybe it's not as ... maybe still wanna work part time if you look at the two benefits together so your normal Social Security benefit a full retirement age and maybe working part time if that's more than what you get at eight Seventy might be a better opportunity for you\nTo really depends on what your plan needs but working till seven to get the biggest benefit is one option it's going to give you more income and I don't know whether assets you have or\nYou know what kind of income need that you do have but\nIf you enjoy what you do and it's not a backbreaking then yeah you might want to continue doing it sometimes working keeps us or our mind sharp too\nYou know sometimes people retire and they don't have anything to do and retirement is not what they envision that would be so if you do anything else do you like working like want to work but it always has a plan in place so we invite you to make the drive up to meet with us and we can look at a plant and see what you really need to do or anyone else's listening out there that's the whole thing is getting a plan\nAnd the first step is to pick up the phone and give us a call at five one five to six Fifteen hundred and common for retirement rent is review so it's a two step process to many process and the first means you get to know you and your situation I understand where you're at\nWas it that you want to accomplish what are your goals what are the things that concerns me most about retirement\nAnd then take a look at where you're at right now and then we take all that we did analysis and that the second meeting present the findings so we show you the risk that you have say something about taxes and look at your income plan and see if you know if it works and then what are some of the obstacles\nYou know what's just reversed dollar cost averaging look like you know what kind of raid returned do you need to earn to make your plan working ten you reduce your risk\nAnd if so what are some options so again if we're fit than we are we go to the third meeting and and show you some strategies so that's really determinations low bar there's no cost you just have to be over fifty and have at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollar saved towards retirement so that sounds good to you\nThan to yourself a favor into your family a favor and your retirement a favor and cause the Bible and five two to six Fifteen hundred\nGet yourself on the counter and find out if you are indeed retirement ready with their retirement readiness review five one five two to six Fifteen hundred great offer from Eric\nAnd pretty easy to take advantage of no cost around ... five one five two to six one five zero zero to talk with Eric ...

Des Moines news traffic and severe weather station news radio ten forty\nIs within a designated patrolling area\n[noise] night scope or the makers of the road but they say that the data secure and it's only seen by the security controlling the robot\nThey're able to stop it and tell us what to look for but nice scape says they can't follow a specific person [laughter] yeah right okay the company says it costs between six dollars and twelve dollars an hour for the new robot to hit the streets\nQuite frankly in Manhattan I give us thirty minutes before someone knocks it over and then just strips it down for parts [noise]\nOr when you consider all the bad drivers on the road imagine for just a moment that all those drivers now have a drone accessible to them that's right\nAnd twenty sixteen drone came within two hundred feet of a plane that was approaching LAX but what does that collusion has actually occurred All right Kevin poor man he's with the University of Dayton research Institute impacts physics division and he said I Want to find this out\nThe answer that he arrived at isn't very reassuring his group is able to launch things that high rates of speed so it was able to simulate a crash using the right wing of a moonie em twenty plane and then a drone\nWith a DJ I've fandom to quad copped urge to point one pounds and then he had the biggest their cat in his lab could actually handle so the banter wasn't certain says forty foot cannon released at a speed up two hundred and thirty eight miles per hour it hit point zero three seconds later\nAnd although the drone was obliterated it held together long enough to strike the wing is one object that's key here rather than multiple fragments\nNow wired magazine describes a slow motion video the drone entering the wing as like a spoons for chocolate moose than if you're a kids club member and you're watching the video can actually see the drone go in\nTo the aircrafts way explains that the drone traveled deep enough into the wing to damage its main weight bearing spar and other words the aircraft would crash\nAnd let's now turn to something even more frightening yes Facebook that's right I

users out there yeah love that I ride Jim in Pennsylvania Hi there Jim\nI came to talk with you again you better what's going on well wait wait wait well we'll we'll\nUse it and I talk to you again so you've been a caller before\nLong time ago I did a long time listener and I can just called them\nOh well thank you Jim I appreciate that pre sheet that\nLists every weekend so I actually watch\nWell good way to either [laughter] so ah so how can I help you today\nWell I should've minding my own business but you didn't\nI didn't have an acquaintance chew recently\nUh reconnected with a a daughter he had it in a very well he was in the military in Europe okay uh and that was a\nWell Nineteen Ninety eight she was born she reconnected to the people in his family are pretty concerned\nAh so I thought I did that old easy button and just do a background search on it and she was like a no avail ...\nOh man so you can wait whoa wait so so you put so she's what Nineteen she's Twenty years old okay All right so she's Twenty years old and\nThat's right because you said Nineteen Ninety eight um [noise] you couldn't really find anything about her leg on Instagram or Facebook or anything like that oh I did\nI did I found a a [noise] a Facebook account that looked like it had origin each a January twenty Eighteen oh but that's not very much of a social you know not in Iraq\nAnd so so you are trying to do a background check on this young woman so that this way you can tell your friend more about her or you afraid that she's not really the daughter or that she's going to scan him or what it will all of\nThe above [noise] okay uh she does for for money or they're not rich by any means or the family just ... but a lot of concerns over this and it's causing trouble in the family so\nI'm sure and then all of a sudden you have a kid coming out of the blue right and you're like okay I don't just\nA bystander doltish well\nHere are good friend I mean you're worried about right you want to make sure\nI was I was concerned and a regular show or they don't like she anybody get hurt a ... and and I heard you talk about these things before in a different stage for the people up\nUh ... dot com yeah his book goes all up and I'm coming up with nothing\nYou know there's also family trained now\nWhere okay you\nMight be able to find something in your family tree now it's supposed to be like where you put your family tree together but it really there's a lot of information they're\nA little and of course much like any other site Jim you have to be careful especially when you look at people searching sites is that what appears to be an actual box that is going to help you find somebody is nothing other than an ad so you really need to\nKeep your wits about you and don't do this if you're having a beer glass of wine okay ... click and other places are and then of course there's the surge which is another place for you to check but I mean if you are really trying to to find information about this young\nWoman is that you know I'm surprised that that\nYou know he can't friend her on social media or somebody that he knows could friend her on social media\nBecause that would be the easiest way you know especially if this is his daughter and so you know what how can and then you could then he can share his credentials with you if you want but he if he wants and then you could start snooping around and see if there's anything else out\nThere I don't think he wants anybody ... think oh he doesn't want to know I don't think he wants to know [noise] why do you\nHave a you have an uphill battle all around right what does your gut telling you\nMight get is telling me that she is his daughter and I don't think she's got a very good background and I think she's just out to get which you can do it\nAnd say well maybe you know you can do your background search you can see what you can find on line\nAnd you know maybe you're just cancel your friend on the warning signs things to look out for\nA you know as far as you know first she's going to ask for ten dollars then it's going to be a hundred dollars you know whatever it may be you know as it goes on\nI and maybe you know he needs to text you every time that she ask for money so that this way you have a record of it because he's not going to want to remember it or it sounds like he's probably not even been a tally and now that I think about that\nWell we're not that close ... like I should I'm just a bystander and all of this so there's a connection to uh [noise] uh other people uh that I'm associated with it and everybody is concerned strip him a and it's taken a toll on his own current family\nYou can folded up and put it in your pocket not right what are you and if you sit on it you're not going to crack the screen that's pretty cool\nSo yesterday's launch of a mid range galaxy a nine the world's first for camera phone go told does eating that site a scene that that consumers would use the full double devices a tablet with multi tasking capability and then folded into a more portable phone\nI'm positive we need to do affordable phone this he says the full double phone will be really meaningful to our customer and stress that Samsung must deliver a user experience that is up to his standard\nThe exact also wants to avoid the product becoming a gimmick a fate that is entirely possible for a folded phone or rather he wants to concept to have the same levels of success as the Galaxy Note which was written off at first by critics for its large screen but it's since been recognized as a as valuable by rivals in the form of devices like the iPhone ... s max\nI have an eight I Love the thing I never used the darn Silas at all but I Love the size of the screen and the extra juice and processing power and storage that it has\nUm the catch would be that it would be buyers as Samsung word to announce the phone in next month's developer conference that would mean it's unlikely to sell the phone for some time but it could be available by November if they push hard and the big worry they have is a way it is wild way going to introduce the full bubble phones first\nSo there you go guys a folder both phone ... we could call it the new flip phone if you will [laughter]\nThat'd be something wasn't it All right so next up\nOh let's see here\nOh this is a good one those of you who have or know what a secure secure update or is a secure update or is a program that we make a truck\nThat you run on your computer and it automatically and silently installs third party software updates for your computer so you always have the most up to date versions of job a flash and it will be reader and just a score of other programs or ... how many as a score\nYeah I think it's a it's slightly over a score of other programs um that that get automatically updated um and one of the big reasons that the customers like secure update or is if you've ever been on the Internet\nAnd you see a pop up that appears on your screen that says you need the latest version of flash player to continue click here to download\nAnd the pop up looks just like a real pop up I mean it's exactly the same how do you know which one is the fake one that's going to infect your computer with an unfathomable encryption crypto where a virus and which one is a real adobe update that needs to be done\nSecure update or is doing the real updates for you so if you see the pop up you know it's fake you can just ignore it yeah so uh this is exactly why we make secure up they're secure up their security warning attackers are using these five tools to hack you in one of those tools\nIs a fake update\nSo basically there is a fake update going around right now that is installing ransom or not ransomware crypto mining software on your computer pops up and says the Dolby update and when you install it in your browser it installs an extension that mine's for crypto currency using your power and your computers processor\nIn the background while you're computers turned on\nNow anybody who knows anything about crypto currency knows that you're not going to mine anything\nOn uh computers Web browser it it's not even worth your time writing the code unless of course you can push this out to a few million computers mining simultaneously as a group as a as a a pool basically then they combine they're processing power together and they can make something really big happens\nThey can make hundreds of thousands of dollars for the attacker and all he has to do is get your computer infected it only uses a little it only uses a little bit more power like a lot more power so you could run on your computer for a month before you get your electric bill and you're like what is going on my electric bill is so high\nAnd then you might not make the immediate conclusion that it's your computer so because your computers performance hasn't really degraded 'cause it's been running slow anyway because you know all the patch has been the last six months\nSo yeah this is the newest thing that's coming out this is exactly why secure update or exist so that you don't get this kind of garbage infecting your computer because even if you have great anti virus software like Samantha ...\nThese are the vulnerabilities that can circumvent any anti virus so you want to make sure you've got good anti virus and you've got sick you're up to running on your computer to do these third party updates now right along here with the security mysterious gray hat is patching people's outdated micro tick routers\nUm ... you may not know what the microchip router is not something that we use too much in America so uh you don't have to worry too much about it but it is one of those riders that's pushed out by an Internet service provider so how many of you know the brand\nThe internal brand of the wireless router that's built into your new a spectrum cable modem\nYou know that's where I talk to customers I don't like using those integrated ones that are built into the router I prefer to disable those energy built into the mode of disabled those ones that are built into the modem and get a separate router that you can control and upgraded update because it makes your security so much better\nAnd this is what a Russian speaking gray hat hacker is breaking into people's micro tech routers and patching devices so they can't be abused by crypto jak hers button that herders they'd heard a or other cyber criminals the hacker who goes by the name Alexei\nHe says he works as a server administrator any claims to a disinfected over a hundred thousand routers already Alexei is not trying to hide his actions and his boost as posted up his hobby on Russian logging platforms and he says access to routers and he access as writers and mixed or changes to their settings to prevent further abuse\nI added firewall rules that that block access to the writer from outside of the local network and the comments I wrote information about the vulnerability and left the address of the router on a telegram channel where it was possible for them to ask questions\nBut despite adjusting firewall settings for a hundred thousand users Alexi says that only fifty users reached out to him about the changing made to their routers a as a few said thanks but most were outraged\nThe vigilantes server administrators says he's only out there fixing routers that have not been patched by their odors against the ... vulnerability that we came to light last April so what he's saying is\nIs a firm where update for your routers guys and you're not installing them so I Am using that vulnerability to get into your router and I'm installing the my critic patch that closes the vulnerability and on even leaving you would note saying hey I hacked into your stuff but I patched it and now you're secure\nAnd if you have questions here's how you can reach me [noise]\nAnd he actually responds to people I mean\nI mean we've joked in shock for this was like an ongoing joke in the ... have you ever got one of those Microsoft scam calls Oh yes we've detected

into the computer right so and I don't want to lie to people so is there there's a good possibility your computer could have some vulnerabilities that need to be a plug and we're going to do that for you for free over the shock desk\nOr we just the remote access to your computer and\nAs history shows us four and five people will allow you the access to the computer so we're we're how how much

problems even if there are no problems they always find all these atrocious problems that they want four hundred dollars to fix it but what is\nThe PE ratio was basically the lowest ever the market was trading and I speak of the S. and P. five hundred index here was trading basically at seven times earnings and so that was an extremely low level of valuation\nAnd then we have the polar opposite which is the record high level of evaluation for the U.S and the five hundred into action that occurred back in the early part of the new millennium in fact that occurred in January two thousand\nAnd January two thousand\nThe ... to march of two thousand call it the first quarter of year two thousand\nWe saw the price to earnings ratio on the standard and Poor's five hundred index escalate to a record high which was basically thirty times earnings think about this now in December of Nineteen Seventy four at the bottom of the massive bear market that lasted almost two years\nWe had evaluation of seven times earnings on a price to earnings ratio basis\nWell look at that extreme and the first quarter of two thousand when you had that level up to basically thirty times earnings that is more than four times greater\nThan the low evaluation that prevailed\nAt the bottom of the Nineteen Seventy three Nineteen Seventy four bear market\nSo there we have a range including the extremes of the range so we can marked down okay\nWe have a figure of seven and December Seventy four basically that's his lowest it's been historically there is this for the U.S and the five hundred index and then we have a figure of thirty in the first quarter of year two thousand\nAnd that's the highest it's been\nFor the U.S and the five hundred index so we could call that the total range including the extreme low in the extreme high\nThen we have a range of normalcy and the range of normalcy would be in the mid to on occasion the upper teens\nCertainly a range of normalcy would be in the Fifteen to sixteen times earnings range however\nDuring extended bull markets you can see a slightly higher range of normalcy which can reach as high as Seventeen to Eighteen times earnings now\nThis gives you an idea of what to expect most of the time\nMost of the time you're going to have a price to earnings ratio is going to be from the mid to the upper teens something in the general area of Fifteen times earnings\nRanging up to something in the general area of Eighteen times earnings and that is how you can determine what the valuation of the market is relative to its historical record\nObviously inflation is very important here because the higher the rate of inflation then or the um the last\nUh integrity is given to future earnings because the future earnings are degraded because of inflation because of the degradation of buying power that results due to inflation\nObviously in a low impatient inflation environment or that is good for a price to earnings ratios because those future earnings are worth more when inflation rates are low\nI bought Brinker this money's talk [noise]\nDiabetes high blood pressure anxiety meds everyone's on them if you're a fifty year old

where Bob is on the line hello but\nHey how you doing today Bob thanks for the call what's up [noise] hey I Would just like to get your uh advice or my wife and myself with both like to take Social Security at age sixty two and just to see what your opinion would be taking it then early because\nMost people would like us to work to sixty five or sixty seven\nWell that's your decision but uh as long as you aware are aware of what you're living on the table potentially in a lot of the says do life expectancy and you know if you're a heavy smoker you don't expect to be around long anyway is sixty two is fine but\nKeep in mind that you are living on the table if you expect longevity you are living on the table above than eight percent increase annually and your Social Security benefit by delaying each year\nRight when we get to\nI think we'll be at that critical mass by sixty two we're going to have almost a million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars saved and I do and we are eligible for both patches from the state of Florida\nAnd with our pensions and everything else we're looking at about making about eighty eight thousand dollars a year in income at that time in our life\nNow does that eighty eight thousand include the early taking of Social Security\nYes\nOkay so is that enough for you to be a to meet your standard of living are to be a net saver or what it was eighty eight thousand do for you\nWell it's a almost what we make now okay yearly um are at my pension is three will be three thousand a year plus\nAlmost two and a half percent increase for\nA Social Security be about sixteen hundred and she'll be able to work till she's eight sixty five plus draw Social Security because she doesn't make that much money at the school districts you were working\nYou know here's my answer Bob and and uh want you to think about it I Would ... and you fill out the blanks but I Would not take the Social Security any earlier than you have to take it and I'm going to tell you why\nBecause every year you're delaying it goes up about eight percent an annual income value therefore I Would take the Social Security only when you need the money\nOkay All right thanks for your ah opinion on that appreciate it\nBob thank you for calling let's get Patricia on the line in a Chicago hello Patricia\nHi I'm actually in ... and I'm enjoying today's program
