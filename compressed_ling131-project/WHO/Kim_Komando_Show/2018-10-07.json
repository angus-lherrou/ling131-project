{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WHO", "content": "Is a multiple of cash flows is that you know the value of all the property plant and equipment cost plus you know the good really built up in the name recognition all those kinds of things and I don't know kind of business it is but I'm assuming you have employees so it's got you know could be a services business could be a manufacturing business\nBut you need to find out what the value of it is and then work out a deal that recognizes that value in the best way possible you know running that effectively without you being there it's able to do that\nYou have to look at from a casual standpoint so if the businesses able to generate cash flow to you that you can spend and enjoying retirement\nThat's similar to what you do if you got a value for the business and went in turn around and reinvest it that somewhere and took money from that so they're kind of the same thing\nAs just one of them you have the money so if something prematurely happen gee that's an easy transition to your family versus was locked in the business of something happens to you\nHow does your family still get that income so just make sure you have some good a legal documents drawn up you go to the different scenarios about what happens if something happens to me has my spouse compensated has my family compensated for the value this business\nBut talked to a business broke her be the best way to kind of start that conversation and lawyers have to be involved accounts have to be involved\nBut the kudos for building up a successful business it's a tough thing to do a very rewarding thing to do and I think a turn it over the employees is a it's a great option just make sure you have the proper legal documents in place and that you are getting full value for what you have built and your family is taking care of his well been\nIt certainly seems like you're off on the right foot to be thinking about it this far ahead of time we encourage you to continue to do that and meet with the right folks as Eric just said we wish you the best thanks running in and now let's move over to Olivia Olivia's in West Des Moines and let me ask our long term care premiums are going up this year pretty significantly\nShould we just pay the extra cost or cancel it and take her to ...\nWell before you start canceling things I think you need to a review of the Libya because there are some times that you can\nModify one of the three things in a long term care policy to help adjust the cost increases the long term care it's going to have an amount that it pays called the daily benefits sometimes you can modify that I'd drop that down or take off the cost of living increase it has on it\nThe second thing that's going to have is an elimination period this is a number of days you're expected to pay for that long term care out of your pocket before the insurance company starts pain so that can go anywhere from Ninety Days all the way I've seen it as three hundred sixty five days so basically you pay for a full year out of pocket before the company starts pain\nSo if you're able to modify that sometimes that can reduce the premium as well and then the maximum amount that it will pay you know some of them are unlimited which means that companies on the hook for as long as you're in that nursing home they're going to keep paying someone they limited to three years or four years or five years something like that so I Would look at some ways to help adjusted costs down\nAnd are men maybe you can take those dollars and go look at something else that you can use to make up the difference or to help\nCombat the gap that you're going to have as opposed to just cancel it now the one thing it is you watch your policy that we do decide to cancel it not accept this rate increase\nTypically what they'll do is they'll give you long term care benefits up to the amount of money that you've put into the policy so let's say your total ... and this policy or ten thousand dollars\nYou should have and not all carries have is a vast majority of them do you should have ten thousand dollars with a long term care benefit in that policy so if you do and her long term care facility then you can get to use those benefits up to the amount of money you put in so check with your policy and see if that has it\nBut yeah I always say if you can modify first deceive and make it more affordable versus just cancelling it and taking the chances on your own [noise] this is also one of the issues I've had with traditional long term care is that they've been raising the prices are pretty significantly because\nBack in the day they didn't have the right cost of what it is they had the the last experience which is how insurance needs to be calculated\nAlso long term care a little bit different in that they have to get governmental approval usually through the state to do a price increase so that's even more difficult for insurance companies to adjust the price that's why you see these big increases and it's one of the things that's actually brought down the mighty General Electric is it's a long term care liability so\nIt's just it's a it's kind of the state of flux best I Would just be get some some good information could solve information for somebody like us explore the way she might be able to cover this potential\nMedical issue down the road this this cost issues he may have some other ways you might be able to cover it without having to write this premium checks every month but you know check to see if you modify the policy first and then see about other options that can fill in that gap\nAgain thanks for writing in Olivia's well and let's finish it off with a question from grace that comes to us from Ames, Iowa she writes in and says my dad just died six months ago and I'm a little worried about my mom who's in her late seventies and is now in charge of handling the investments for the first time in her life\nI don't know much about it myself what should I tell her to do\nWell I think that she definitely needs to get in touch with somebody that uh\nThere you can trust and like and that explains things in a manner that's very easy to understand\nI find this a lot with couples is that normally one person really enjoys the financial aspect and the other person does not and they just want on the bottom line hey how much can I say and and something happens to him which did we have a husband goes first or something happens to the person handle that stuff\nCan I still pay my bills can I still spend money and how does it all work and so\nThat's why a stabbed wishing that relationship is important especially should make this transition to retirement and if you'd been the what we call it do it yourself or you've\nHad it on your own what happened something happens to you for a minute station ... minutes of grace and your mom to come in and meet with us and they had this done a couple of times where we've had people respond from the radio that are a little more advanced in age and\nI always tell them hey who do you rely on to make your financial decisions with you and they always say it's my kids I said well let's have them in the next meeting because I Want to make sure they're comfortable with the things that were doing\nThey understand that they know who I Am they know the reason why we're doing these things and when they bring in the kids kids are like yeah this is great this exactly what we wanted it we have developed relationship with the children as well so\nYou need to get somebody that you can that you both can trust you both need to meet with them and make sure it's going that direction that she wanted to go but if she doesn't like handling it he definitely some professional assistance and that person should be an advocate for your mother to be able to protect assets give her income ... she's worried about\nLower taxes all those things because what things can happen to our taxes\nThere was going to change because she's going to go from a joint status to a single status she's going to pay more in taxes and the same income which is totally unfair\nBut that's what happened so some taxi efficiency planning as well and that's something we do very well here Peterson financial group so grace I invite you and your mom to come down and meet with us to probably enjoy chip cookies and coffee and then kind of a trip out personal give us a call the opposite I went five to six Fifteen hundred and set up your time to come in or anyone else listening out there\nYou know to suddenly bring up in in asking these questions from people that write in are probably getting a lot of people out there you know and so you had questions like these and you want answers\nThen our retirement rest review is the best way to get those answers and the nice thing is is complimentary to pay for this it's a tremendous value\nPeople get a lot of value for what they go through\nBut all they have to do just pick up the phone that's the hardest parts pick up the phone give us a call and get on the calendar as the longest journey starts with the first step take that first step towards a better retirement give us a call at five one five to six Fifteen hundred\nJust have to be over eight fifty have at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollar safe retirement so that you\nDo you favor dear family favorite deer retirement a favor and give us a call at five on five two to six Fifteen hundred\nThey now are using algorithms to examine the fat

radio if they're in the room as long as they're clear we're good to go or at your ready\nGood there's a dark side of technology that a lot of folks are brushing off it's the use of robots for use then how do you say intimate situation things that happened between two people\nJust like there are those gentlemen clubs where someone might pay ten dollars for a pole dance and those ranchers branches in Nevada where prostitution is legal the city of Houston was wrestling this past week with how to deal with the company that wants to open up a brothel filled with robotic sex toys that's right [noise]\nThey wanted to open a loved ... brought the one issue soon so that people would be able to use it human like dolls\nA kind of sad that it sounds familiar it was in that movie west world K Houston remains the only major U.S city without zoning construction of the site for the proposed robot bravo had already be good\nBut it was stopped after the city inspectors visiting location and they figured out that the business owners that they didn't have the proper permits\nSo Houston's city council actually updated the local audience to specifically ban individuals from having sex with a device that resembles\nA human being [noise]\nOkay I Know what you're thinking maybe the city council couldn't fair in a way to tax the robots but those of us here at the Kim commando show a we have come up with the perfect name for that how about\nA Sears and Roebuck yes Sears and Roebuck yeah okay [laughter] okay the kids are back and let's talk about selfies research out this past week that death by selfie is on the rise\nAn average of forty three people a year have died while taking selfies in the year two thousand eleven drowning and falls are the biggest killers\nThe studies show that men account for seven to ten of these fatalities millennial daredevils those between the age of twenty twenty nine make up almost half of all sell the death so here's what's going on\nLegislation politicians are getting together and coming up with no selfie zones so it's right\nYou're going to have no selfie zones near water bodies mountain peaks tall building a U.S woman died on a highway accident just seconds after uploading a selfie of herself singing happy on her car stereo\nOr there was a ... a young Mexican guy killed himself he was posting with a selfie with a gun next to his head\nOr a tie woman was hit and killed by a train this past spring she was wanting to take a picture of herself and her friend on the rail tracks\nBritish woman Luis she's thirty seven her partner Michael thirty three they fell about sixty feet to their deaths after topping off a beach walls so now we need these no selfie zones\nOr maybe it's just the latest crop of the Darwin Awards\nAnd we

this week you can now use the free app yes I said the free app to fill out forms signed documents and review PDF without ever leaving the app\nIt also had to do besides directly into acrobat reader\nIt's also going to recognize blanks and informed that proves that you know the drop box around and where to put the tax and it was always a complete nightmare so over a commander dot com you have a whole article about the brand new way that do these changing the PDF that you're going to love and meanwhile\nA few updates from Google this past week that you need to know about that if you haven't used Google Translate it's really slick I used a lot when I was in Europe over the summer I Love it especially when I was in a restaurant and I look at the menu and I didn't know any French and I could say definitely don't want the snails\nUntil now Google Translate on your phone and listening to the same pronunciation this is really amazing technology don't brushes up\nGoogle Translate has added speech output local version English French Spanish been golly you can hear English results for example with a Spanish accent or with a French accent or an Indian accent or listen to French Canadian spit and really something\nAnd this next Google update is one that you might want to pass along to your family members and friends who say they've been working on a brand new product that lets Android users control their device using only their voice\nIt's been in beta a really long time two years but this past week ago started releasing the global aids called voice access allows you to write text\nTalk to the Google Assistant navigate using your voice oh so you can click buttons and other things just with your boys\nOne's voice access is activated you see numbers next to everything so if you want to issue a command you'd say like click seven for example\nYou can say go back home you can tell the device to turn on the wife fire Bluetooth suggests the ball you open the app basically what ever you would want to do on your Android device you can now do with only your voice you can download voice access through Google Play [noise]\nHaven't right up and just a few moments we have five route our security settings to turn on before it's too late and then later on\nThis hour the things that you should not be even thinking about buying as far as technology goes in the month of October but back to the phones me go with Nick and Oakville, Washington editor Nick\nHow are you I'm good what's going on [noise]\nUm I've been looking into some a money making ... um the ones where you can earn money watching movies and TV shows or share your online shopping received so\nI'm Wondering if these are legitimate abs or if they are or you may be inviting trouble phone new Dell and possibly viruses are now where\nAre you know it's all those are all really good question um how much money are you trying to make or would you like to make\nA living you know on a book extra months\nLiving here it's a it's not like you're like OK I Need to make a thousand dollars were you know two thousand dollars or anything like that you know some of the ap she mentioned like swag bucks is one that led to watch TV Shop kick is the one that you know let you cumulative points for shopping\nUh there's I poll this way it's something that allows you to take surveys a Google also has their opinion out that will pay you one dollar per survey\nYou know if you wanted to make like\nA couple of hundred bucks a month that may be the way I was in costs go a couple of weeks ago\nAnd I had a put TaskRabbit on my phone 'cause one of these apps right I'm brought up because I just figured you know as testing it out and then when I got to ... came up and says hey you know we have a task Korea and so I figured you know what\nMight as well I'm Wondering how stuff works right and so it asked me to go over and take a picture of the the downy fabrics oftener and ... and and how much is being sold for at that particular Costco\nSo I took a picture and send it off through the ... and then I made like seven bucks my foot that's not bad I mean I'm already here anyway right\nAnd so you know so the way that the absolute illegitimate apps is that you don't worry about malware and viruses but I always caution people that some of these they don't actually give you cash that they may give you like an Amazon dot com gift card\nOr a gift card to Starbucks um there's also other ones like once called folk\n... pie that you could take a picture of anything and then they submitted to the various um agencies and so you may get a couple of bucks that way\nThere's Moby and it wants you to go to a particular business and then take a survey about the business uh there's field agent which is just like TaskRabbit there's diet bet if you want to lose a couple of pounds right\nOr you can place a bet that you're gonna be and you participate in this you gotta weigh yourself and all that other stuff and but the average take home for a month is like sixty bucks\nTheir sweat coin okay for every thousand steps you can get a point nine five sweat coin that will be translated into like an apple gift card\nTheir surveys on the go there's just a whole bunch of 'em but\nUm they these are the ones that I mentioned are legitimate there's probably some some that are not legitimate\nBut what I can do is direct you to the list of legitimate money making apps over my website does that help you out\nTo cook or someone to confuse that's\nOh it does and then when you and like most people nobody reads the terms and conditions on any of this stuff so I posted a link to it over a commando dot com and speaking about making money coming up in the third our of this week show you don't want to miss it because I have even more ways that I didn't mention here\nWe all know we should back up our data but if you were ever caught in a data Las nightmare call the experts ... to get your data back right and we're no longer safe and backed up on a stable hard drive\n[noise] computers protein number seven hundred and fifty three\nHave you ever wonder how the bad guys only seem to find a way it is your

access\nTo your computer or hold your data for ransom the bad guys are exploiting zero day vulnerabilities to break into systems that are supposed to be half group these vulnerabilities are always newly discovered and the criminals have a brief time to exploit them before they get past\nThat virus and firewall do not prevent these attacks but you can minimize your computers exposure ... just as

far we've had a lot of great callers today which\nI don't know what's been going on the last few weeks we haven't had a lot of callers and I try to incentivize I tried to bribe people to call and we just don't get a lot of callers I guess so we go on and we do our thing but the colors of what makes the show anyone can listen to me all our long I'm no aftershock today I got some places I got to get to right after the show today so unfortunately guys know aftershock\nAnd of course the one time I don't have time for an aftershock\nI've got lots of funny stories from so I'm going to save him for next week you don't want to miss next week's after ... um I I've heard some terms that I've never heard before in my life positive things used to describe us All right so um you know what the Internet is right and you know what Google is and Facebook\nAnd on and Amazon all these companies they're tracking us around the Web using cookies they're collecting all of our personal data like Facebook and the social network all who are friends are on just a last week Facebook got busted again All right so Facebook wants you\nTo put two factor authentication on your account what that is is you have a ... you know what a password is right\nBut when you go to log into your account two factor authentication you type in your user name you type in your password you click logging and then it sends a code to your phone through a text message for example and then you ... and then there's the boxes under the code it from your phone and you type in the coach from your phone\nOf that is one example of two factor authentication so just having the passwords not enough you also have to have your cell phone in your hand to log in that stops the bad guys from logging into your account when you're not around\nWell Facebook has been taking the phone numbers that you provide you give them your cell phone number to send a text message to they'd been selling those phone numbers the robocall companies\nTo market products so there are ... and that's particularly underhanded because they're they're saying for your own security provide us with a phone number so we can make your account secure and then by the way we're going to sell it to everybody to [laughter]\nBut uh you know it just it that's the kind of stuff that leaves a bad taste in people's not that it's not just Facebook is doing the guys everybody does that kinda stuff Google doesn't um apple does it uh Amazon certainly doesn't you know all the Big East do it so wouldn't it be great\nIf all of your personal data was held in like getting close your let's think of it like a pot that holds all of your own personal information\nAnd you control it all and you can revoke access to it at any point in time to anyone so in other words you could provide a phone number for two factor authentication stored in your pod\nAnd then that information can be accessed in an encrypted way to send messages by Facebook without ever providing Facebook with your actual phone number all that would be doing is ... it's encrypted so Facebook doesn't even get to see just like with your secure update or account I said we can't see your password for security reasons\nWell this'll be like we can't see your name for security reasons we can't see your phone number we can't see your email address or all that stored in a nice little enclosed pod and you control it all that you can allow people to see it\nAnd monetize it of course if you and then you know because that's the thing if you put it on a pot article has to do is put out a new toy and say if you want access to our new toy and allow us to have access to your pod\nAnd half the people on the Internet would be like ...\nAnd they just click it and they give people access to it um but here's the difference if you have a ...\nYou can control how it's access you can revoke access you can see every time Google access is what they're accessing it for and you can charge Google to access it\nBecause it was making money off your data should you be getting a ...\nThat's what the founder of the Internet believes and his start up company they interrupt I of course it's

I picked up my power from the main checkup and I had trouble getting one in my\nCourse connected and it was almost closing time and he asked me where I Lived and I told him he said I'll south on my way home\nPaul well thank you so much for letting me know the ivory she that Brian's first complement guy over Omaha\n\nPresented by Vernon this election was\nTo America's going on in the\nAnd I hard radio station news radio ten forty W. H.\nWait Joe ... and I ... radio station and on your age the radio Katie RV\nOver time\nOf course was a number of the programs that are offered the traditional ...\nAge ... traditional four one K. programs good examples\nYou're investing off the top\nYou're investing the money that you earned off the top before taxes\nHave been taken out and that gives you maximum earnings value in your tax privilege to count all the way out\nIn many cases decades down the line to your retirement years so you accumulate your wealth really gradually no get rich quick ideas\nYou accumulate your wealth gradually you in other words you get rich slowly\nAnd over a period of time it works it's a wonderful way to\nPlan for the future now you can afford to put more than ten percent of your earnings aside this way that's wonderful\nBy all means do it but the idea of the ten percent goal isn't it is a a basic goal to shoot for of course if you want to put more that's fine\nAnd this is all in the context of something else we've talked about over the years on Monday talk which is known as quantum leap thinking of quantum leap thinking is important because it helps\nYou to develop a long term mindset\nAbout sure money\nA long term mindset about your financial goals and allows you to think depending on your age and allows you to think about where you want to be\nFinancially years down the road things that you can do\nTo make positive things happen for yourself and for the benefit of your family\nOvertime and this idea\nOf developing the proper mindset is really important because without this mindset\nYou may never be able to overcome the daily worries that are always\nIn the marketplace and usually serve as distractions you see them all the time the news slow the daily worries and you really have to overcome\nAnd a great way to overcome that is to develop the quantum leap thinking mindset about where you want to be years down the road the steps you can take to make that happen we just talked about a very important one pay yourself first\nIf you can afford it the first ten percent or even more of what you earn goes into your\nInvestment programs for the future taxed for tax privilege programs can be very positive in that regard as well we've talked about the four oh one case the four o three bees the four fifty seven plants at work\nWe've talked about using the IRA programs and the other tax privileged programs that help you to build wealth over your lifetime\nBecause the whole idea here is that when it's all said and done\nYou are in the land of critical mass and that means that you're going to enjoy life as you prefer to enjoy life\nYou're going to own your time that's the big deal here there is a big deal here that's it you're going to own your own time you're going to allocate your time the way you want to spend it\nAnd the way you're going to support all of this financially is by being as a land a critical mass\nAnd so aside from any income you may have earned in terms of deferred income in terms of a pension in terms of Social Security all of those things in addition to any of that you have a portfolio you have an investment portfolio\nWhich at the point here in the land a critical mass and you're a you're moving on your own time schedule you're not working anymore\nWell at that point\nYou should be able to put in a withdrawal regiment on your portfolio I suggest starting out with a four percent guideline for your initial year of withdrawal once you reach this point and you're going to find if you have a balanced portfolio\nOf equities and fixed income securities you're going to find that most of the money that you're going to withdraw on an annual basis is going to be self generating\nAs a result of the evidence paid in stocks in your portfolio and you know load funds for example\nThat are passed through through the funds and also the interest that you're earning\nOn the interest portion of your bums portfolio\nAnd so when you add up all the evidence that are paid from the equities and you add up all the interest is paid from the fixed income you're going to find that most of that four percent annual withdraw guideline it's going to come from dividends and interest\nThere will be some years where capital gains distributions from your equity funds will bring you to a point where you've exceeded four percent you certainly can reinvest that money if you would like to in your portfolio that's fine [noise]\nYou'll have some years where capital gains distributions will bring you basically around that four percent number combined with the evidence and interest there may be some years for sure\nWhere you'll have to liquidate a small a small amount of shares in order to bring yourself to four percent\nFor the whole idea behind the ... percent withdrawal is\nVery simple it's very clear and it's very basic here it is where do we come up with the idea\nThat we can withdraw four percent on a balanced portfolio no balanced portfolio purely a pure ballads portfolio would have half of the money and the stock market I prefer no load funds or exchange traded mutual funds for that\nAnd half of the money in fixed income securities where right now I prefer short duration because there's no reason there's no reason to take a long duration securities with rates at this level\nAnd so what happens is you have this balanced portfolio\nAnd you're collecting the data and there's an interest every year and\nThat's how you're getting to your four percent throwing in your capital gains distributions as I said some years you'll even have more than four percent and you can reinvest the access if you choose I think it's a good idea to do that kind of a rainy day

lenders we are rolling along on the flight of the starship Monday talk at one eight hundred nine reports on the two Twenty one let's get out the Schoenberg Illinois Mike welcome to the program\nHello Mike how are you are doing well what's up uh I have\nA quick question are we saw some property and they have about a a fifty thousand a cash to use a little tour and I want to get your views on this uh between uh putting it against the mortgage or our primary residence\nOr putting it into the market if so where I'm at I'm In my mid thirties save a lot of time ahead of me but I Want to make sure do I buy down the debt that I have and reduce my my mortgage about my interest or do I put it against the market is that a better use\nLet's talk about uh let's talk about this loan that you have on your principles residents so first of all how much is the residents work what some are marketed\nThat are probably about a 'bout to sixty and uh I have about a hundred and Seventy three left on it I Want to get it down with the fifty thousand I have to work with down to about one twenty three and I'm at right now it's at four sixty five\nThe rate of the field is for the call right now on the mortgage\nThe mortgage okay well that's pretty generous uh that's pretty generous four point six but I just see the thing about that is\nThat when you ... pay\nA four point six five percent mortgage you are you guarantee yourself\nThat you're going to make that because you're not paying it right\nSo it's like a guaranteed income four point six five and I would have to say that's pretty generous in today's world when you have to put it in context the ten year treasury and here's the context how many years remain on your mortgage\nUh probably about fourteen dogs Martin I'm Sorry about twenty four\nTwenty four well here's the thing I ten year treasury right now is yielding to ... percent okay that's that's one and three quarter percent less than the guaranteed\nReturn you receive one repaying a four point six five so I think that um I I think that might be very attractive but first I'd like to ask you what do you have in terms of an investment portfolio\nI'm pretty good I have my four one K. and we're actually both do we have our case and we have some other individual investments to so probably a a total value a hundred and fifty thousand\nYeah well I'll tell you what my my response my response to this question Mike is yeah definitely it's definitely a conservative response I think it would have to be classified as a conservative conservative response\nBut I Would also have I also have to say that I think there's something that the today's world right now at today's investment world right now I think there's something to be set\nFor having a conservative response from time to time and I think this is one of those times if I were you I Would prefer that four point six five\nOkay okay good uh that's kinda the way we're leaning 'cause the market is is you know relatively high now and I didn't know if there was enough return to really justify putting it in the marketplace and I know\nWell ... let me let me be clear about what I'm saying what I'm saying what I'm saying is you were looking at a guaranteed return no risk of four point six five percent\nAnd I'm saying in a world where the ten year is yielding to in seven days then where the thirty year where the thirty years' not yielding much more than that\nI'm going to take a guaranteed no risk four point six five percent and that is the basis for that view I Do appreciate it might thanks so much for calling\nOne eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one Charles is on the line in Gary Indiana Charles welcome the Monday\nTalk how you're doing Bob thank you\nUncle doing well thanks [noise]\nUh this is the second time I've had an opportunity to speak to you\nAh one was several years ago approximately Seventy years ago a joy lying and ... ...\nAh we had a lot of fun there in ah Chicago land or thanks for coming out I Do appreciate that what what is on your mind today\nI'm approximately seven to eight thirty or a mutual funds versus a ...\nI in fact have a very serious question because I've come across some information on insights in reference to are you on your opening speech you made a statement in regards to the\n... someone sixty seven years old ... involved if at this juncture when in fact the market just reaching all time high with they\nLet me let me ask you let me ask you a question uh now that you mentioned age are you thinking in terms of retirement at any time\nOh I'm retired been retired to you as you\nWell then let's start out by saying I Am way more comfortable way more comfortable at that point of having a a balanced portfolio which would start out basically with a fifty fifty allocation so you're allocation would be different than the allocation I Would choose in that situation\n\nEven though I'm at Seventy Seventy eight thirty to meet you in whatever\nYou're you're you said you were Seventy percent equities I think is that right", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Kim Komando Show", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "07"}
