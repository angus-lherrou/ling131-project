{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WHO", "content": "Love and work part time workers will make you know when I make a full time and they're just pushed off claiming Social Security so that's another thing to remember to dean if you're going to work a during retirement and claim Social Security there's some limitations their claim it early\nBefore your full retirement age and you can only make right now Seventeen thousand and forty dollars\nLaboring you know you have to work for that doesn't mean if you're getting money from dividends or interest at the bank or withdrawals from pensions or I or raise or anything like that just stuff that you labor for if you make more than that and you start to get back to your Social Security\nOne dollar for every two dollars a ... over that amount until you reach full retirement age which is sixty six or up to sixty seven depend on when you were born\nSo to make a long story lung cancer shorter I guess it really boils down to depends yeah you know what your plan has how much ... additional income that you need\nIf you're behind the eight ball those extra two years one is get a lot more money way towards your retirement also two years or delaying Social Security Social Security can be bigger ... bigger so it may make sense but without a plan I wouldn't know the exact answer but so really boils down to pass but if you want to complete answer then coming to meet with us\nWell and you know like you said I think that's a good point you run up to earlier era 'cause they're kinda like those are the store you shared about some clients before where they had more than they thought you know he may be in that situation if he doesn't have a plan he's not sure especially if he's kind of just kind of guessing at this and\nSo I think that's a great piece of advice just sit down have a conversation with a with your own advisor and if you don't have one or he likes to talk with Eric ...\nIt'd be more than happy to help you out and kind of you know really drilled us down five one five to six one five zero zero five one five to six Fifteen hundred thanks for the question dean certainly appreciate it we've got a question from Claire here in Johnson\nAnd she says Eric we recently got a letter promoting a program where we can split our mortgage payments in half and pay every two weeks instead of once a month\nSomehow this helps us paying off faster so is this something that we should look into doing\nWell clear what that stealing is lining up a kind of when you get paid a lot of companies went to buy weekly pay and so there's ten months where your little behind and then two months where your head because it'll be two months where you're going to get an extra check\nWhich is kind of nice because there's fifty two weeks and the here and not forty eight weeks in the year\nSo the same thing works in reverse when you're paying a mortgage\nSo there's going to be to pay every two weeks is going to be must you're getting a full extra payment in and so that helps reduce all things being equal paying the same amount of money but painted bi weekly your mortgage we paid off faster because you're making the extra payment in that a mutt when he got that extra check so that's what it really boils down to and then it helps usually from a cash flow standpoint\nAs opposed to once a month they got this large some you know every two weeks you have a smaller so I'm going out this more manageable I light up when you get your pay too so it is a good thing to take advantage of you can do the same thing just by making extra payments on a monthly basis if you want to but if you like things more systematically certainly is a great great to plan to take care of\nAnd another thing that I just want to ask because we're talking about mortgages is a lot of people feel that they have to pay off their mortgage prior to retirement\nAnd that's necessarily the case you don't want to put up or time it just because you have a mortgage because the mortgage if your interest rate is fixed you're not in the variable interest rate program where it may reset then that's a payment is not going to inflate for the life of that long\nSo as long as it's manageable and your income to support it it's okay to enter retirement with the mortgage is not you know absolute you tend not a lot of people just like to retire without any debt because more income for them but if it's manageable don't put off retirement just because you have a mortgage\nLook at a plan and see if it fits because that is one of the death is going to fall off eventually and there's also some other things that you can do down the road maybe once you got to reverse to pay it off or who knows but don't let just having a mortgage be that thing that keeps you from retiring is on your income will support is necessarily bad carrying debt into retirement\nWell thank you so much for the question clear we appreciate it and again if you'd like to talk with Eric one on one about five one five to six Fifteen hundred\nFive one five to six one five zero zero hopefully that helps you out a little bit and our final question this week is from bill and he's in his later and he says Eric I heard someone say that you should be saving Fifteen Percent of your income for retirement\nWe're only saving about ten percent and even that seems like a lot are we in trouble do you think\nWill bill your your fifty percent behind to think about it right because if you should be same Fifteen always saving Tantlinger fifty percent behind\nI don't know [laughter] I don't know if you if you're in trouble or not without seeing the plan but here's the thing about people telling you rules at them they're generalizations to start conversations yeah OK so without somebody knowing what other sources of income you have coming in retirement and how much you're going to spend in retirement\nI don't think you have the same spending as your neighbor you know and so a lot of people compare themselves ... but they're spending their money on so this is where I get kind of frustrated with our financial any role because they are having to make these decisions based on Rosa time without giving them concrete plans based on their situation\nYou know so if you're listening to you know some other people on the radio the talk about that you know you'd be saving as much as possible which yes I'll eat can't save too much\nAnd actually can from tax liability standpoint that [laughter] you know so the thing is that you really need a plan to say OK how much do I need to save to accomplish my goals maybe your plan works at ten percent maybe it works even less and so just because someone else says you need to be saying Fifteen you're saving ten you feel like you're\nYou're not doing what you should be doing totally bogus you need to get a plan to see what it is unique to to earn\nSo one of the things we take people through when they come and meet with us bill as we go through C. A. at capacity attitude and need to pass these built around risk ... can lose a for attitude which is what your attitude is torture brisk to make sure your portfolio lines of that but in this than eat how much you need to say what kind of return duty to make to make a plan work\nSo if you know those numbers sometimes points out yeah you're saving just fine a path that you're on will work\nIf it does and then he gets understand well maybe I Need to bumped is up to Fifteen Percent okay so generalizations just our conversation starter is you need to dive in will up your sleeves get a plan in place to say okay what do I need to do to accomplish what I Want to accomplish to retire and I want to retire\nSo for you or anyone else listening out there if you don't have a plan or if you do maybe it's an old plan and\nYou never really trusted from began with or you just want a second opinion to see if the one that you have is correct than coming in with us I mean it's a very low bar to get into us I get is pick up the phone just below Fifteen have at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars safe retirement that that you\nThen we take care of everything else you do have to you know gather some statements and fill out a couple of uh questionnaires those types of things to make best used at the time\nBut we are going to do when you come to meet with us we're going to discuss your goals discuss your dreams your values also what are your concerns about retirement we're going to Social Security now says to show you potentially the best way to claim part on your plan but also how long does it take before claim it early ... claim that Seventy homes take me to win that that\nMaybe it's more advantageous to claim early do know that yet that is one of the things that will look at for you were the attacks analysis see where your taxes are now how to reduce those but also in retirement what your taxes may look like we're also going to do a risk assessment how much risk you currently taking how much risk you need to take to make a plan work\nAnd does your risk of your portfolio match up with your risk profile and they're real good economic impact of losing the spouse what if something happens to one of you before retirement of what happens after retirement can you still retire can you still maintain the same standard of living\nSo all that answered in our retirement readiness review so that sounds good to you that pick up the phone give us a call at five one five to six Fifteen hundred you'll be very happy that she did so give us call five one five to six one five zero zero why\nAs we depart the program as they said it's a very easy process to get started they make it super simple for us to reach out and find out if you are indeed retirement ready with retirement readiness review five one five to six Fifteen hundred\nAt five one five to six one five zero zero arrogant team can do a lot of things for you but they can't do any of it and they don't get the chance to know you and that's where you come into retail five one five to six Fifteen hundred\nCome in for that complimentary consultation and see where you stand five one five to six

especially with today's video streaming and programs in games and everything else that they might be doing is still a six year old process or write\nA day and\nGood news is there is any good news is that the next week a on the thirtieth of October I mentioned briefly during the news segment at the beginning of this hour isn't it yeah is that apple set to release a Mac will care for okay they say under a thousand dollars\nYou know the price and then you know yes exactly like a ... yeah I Know I hate when people do that it's like under a thousand dollars to say yes it's nine hundred and\nNinety

people are buying the newer stuff they're going to be trading and the older stuff right\nOr selling the older stuff whatever it may be and so what I live with you by refer golfer apple is that it tells you like for example what what year was this ... book released\nAnd then if the screen has to be replaced they do that it also still comes with a one year guaranteeing warranty\nAnd so you still have that but it's still gonna be you know you're still looking for you know twelve fourteen hundred bucks\nOh she living it let me ask you questions I talked to a guy at will the apple store here a little while back and he was talking about putting a fish is ask Dr in or something\nWe'll try to keep it or not political at all and no non player characters or you know you know AAA ... veterans or anything like that so that it's completely boring\nCompletely non offensive Nebraska nice\nFacebook okay never asking are you guys have heard of the new uh Nebraska uh advertising campaign that's going on right now I'm it's hilarious because everybody who seems to be upset with it\nAre exactly not the people that are targeted by the advertising campaign you know if you are white water rafting down a river in a horse tub\nYou're the kind of person that's going to vacation potentially Nebraska\nIf you couldn't get up out of the horse tub ... ads not for you I mean and I'm On that border\nLine guys I'm like I've never written in a horse before that can be fun but then it's one of those things that you as you crash head first into the river and drowned under a horse tub could have been like this sounded like such a good idea at the time\nKind of like watching a fake moon it sounds like it sounded like such a good idea in Nineteen Ninety three when the Russians tried to do it that now China thinks that maybe you know best are better stronger China let's do a moon\nSo you might remember this back in the nineties Nineteen Ninety three um Russia is to was testing a space mirrors a giant night light for the earth\nThis is the this is the archives of New York times archives and it has that that New York times headline from the nineties like that fault they use Russians to test space mirrors giant night light for earth how catchy\nAlright Russian scientists are planning sued unfairly glistening sheet of plastic in space as a first step toward testing an intriguing notion about\nTurning night and today or at least twilight took to board a progress cargo space craft attached to the Mir space station which is now the orbited and burned to the ground\nI'm an experiment called something in Russian or translated to ban or like Bruce Banner\nAre you is this a good idea should we do this that will test the idea of using a mirror in space to reflect some light to the earth\nIf all goes as planned the banner payload will be deployed next month and unfairly sixty five foot disk of aluminum coded plastic film the experiment will test the feasibility of eliminating points of the earth with light equivalent to that of several moods Russian engineers say it should also teach them a lot about handling thin sheets of plastic in space\n[laughter] the snake space walking cause but not with Saran Wrap too hot oh no not that\nYou did you get the precedent feel or the actual Saran Wrap have you ever done that guys like your wife asked you to cover something and you get out the precedent seal instead of the Saran Wrap thinking it's the same thing right and then it's not sticking to nothing and then it sticks to everything and ah it can be your life can be rough so now here we are two thousand Eighteen\nChina is planning to launch its own artificial moods see this is a physics dot org so there are a little bit more it's not an intriguing interesting project banner it's\nAn artificial moon by twenty twenty to replace street lamps on at lower electricity costs in urban areas\nSo that that's the reason they're doing it so let me go back to the Nineteen Ninety three article\nNew York times writes if it can be done proponents say providing sunshine at night could save billions of dollars each year in electrical lighting cos extend twilight hours during planting and harvesting seasons to aid farmers\nAllow more working hours on large construction projects and helped rescue and recovery operations after natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes back to trying to store it\nThough the first launch will be experimental the twenty twenty two satellites will be the real deal with great civic and commercial potential the Chinese official said by reflecting the light of the sun the satellites could replace street lamps in urban areas saving an estimated one point two billion you on\nA year and electricity costs if the manmade moons eliminating area of fifty square kilometers the extraterrestrial source of light sounds like a UFO\nCould also help rescue efforts in disaster zones helped during blackouts yet it ah so I mean this is literally a rehash\nOf what the Russians attempted to do in Nineteen Ninety three didn't work\nUm but we have new materials now new ways of doing things uh that the article here on physics dot org does acknowledge China's not the first country to try beaming somebody back to earth in the nineties Russian scientists report it leaves giant mirrors to reflect light from space and an experiment called banner\nThe artificial moon was announced by ... at an innovation and entrepreneurship conference October tenth and they're going to do it around twenty twenty\nSo there's the thing that China wants to watch an artificial moon to reflect ... back to the earth I'm Around twenty twenty and of course there's all the detractors are like you know it's going to mess with people's circadian rhythms are imagine if you wanted to avoid war in another country you can just light I'm up all the time so they can never sleep\nYou know that could be but if a boost their productivity of reduced their cost I don't know if you'd want to do that so I'm six of one half a dozen of the other eight six six for nine six eight seven Seventy welcome to the program Mary how can I help you on computers today\nI'm almost afraid to ask my question about Facebook\nNo that's fine you know as long as you don't have a family you won't get banned\n[laughter] oh well I don't like or share anything on Facebook that I don't know where it originated in front of mine recently shared post with me that supposedly from what from Mark Zuckerberg which\nI ignored and now she's all concerned about\nUm the short version of the very long post was that you had to share it with your contacts or you have to pay for Facebook yeah I mean come on I ... in your opinion on what it is him trying to accomplish\nAll right well you've heard of the Darwin Awards right oh yeah yeah that this this is okay anything that you get in your inbox that says you must forward it you must forward\nIt's a scam if you get a if Mark Zuckerberg contacts you unless he's running for office I suppose that's a scam I'm I mean [laughter] so yeah you must for this or you have to\nFor Facebook you pay for Facebook every time you use it with your personal information so you've already paid for Facebook scam so yeah I mean you you did good and not sharing that when it's a total scam I'm basically the Facebook is never going to charge for Facebook\nBecause if they charged sweet little old ladies in your gram positive moms and dads and kids everywhere to put their stuff on Facebook no one would put their stuff on Facebook any more\nPeople would just go without in fact there is a huge um\nIs it I think we've covered the story while back but basically Facebook used to be cool and there was someone in the u._k. they were interviewing the asking why don't use Facebook anymore they said well Facebook used to be cool to my mom started using it\nAnd now she keeps tabs on me so I Can't post anything on Facebook that I don't want my mom to see so I don't use it anymore now use these other things and now there is a revolt even among millennials\nUm and it used to be or people would would would criticize millennials for being a I'm In in on capable of socially interacting with other human beings because their faces buried in their technology so much\nOf what you think you know I'd be all for it because you know if your face is buried in tech you're going to pay a lot of money to get that tech fix when it breaks um but that's not the case now millennials are even shutting social media proving that they just don't want to interact with humans at all\nYou know [laughter] come on I'm just joking millennials out that I Know there's some of you listening not many but some of you are so basically it it the social media thing is kind of gotten to the point where nobody really cares what you have for breakfast anymore\nUm nobody nobody you know there there there are those people on Facebook who are truly entertaining people watch things on Facebook that are controversial but more importantly what what the social media has taught us about\nUm human nature is that we tend to interact with people of like mind and when you're on social media and you interact with people who are only like minded\nIt tends to become a reinforce or so that you believe that everyone else out there has your same beliefs which is how these this is how a conservative Facebook page gets three point five million followers and none of them are liberal this is how conservative pages get banned
