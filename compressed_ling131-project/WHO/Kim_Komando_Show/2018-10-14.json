{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WHO", "content": "Get that to have retirement renting his review underway five one five to six Fifteen hundred hanging by one five to six Fifteen hundred and you are listening to retirement\nReading with air Peterson president and founder of ... years some financial group Iowa's retirement specialists serving us right here in central Iowa area reach out for that consultation five one five to six Fifteen hundred that is five\nOne five to choose they won five zero zero morning on the day on the program writer [noise]\n\n[noise] you get wish your way to financial peace of mind it takes determination and to help other trusted advisor to join us on our quest to make you retirement read\nBlur cruising down the home stretch here today on retirement ready with air Peterson of Peterson financial group serving you here in central Iowa he is Iowa was retirement special sport they are I should say I was retirement specialist\nOf the whole team there at the Peterson financial group give them a call and get yourself on the counter five one five to six Fifteen hundred at five one five to six Fifteen hundred\nAnd of course is one of our favorite parts of the program we get to take questions from you around the area here on the mail bag and if you'd like to ask you submit your own question to ask Eric Peterson dot com as ask Eric Peterson dot com art air so I got a question for you from William in Des Moines and he says investing for retirement it seems pretty simple to me\nWhy not just invest in dividend paying stocks live off the dividends and never dip into your principles Eric what's your thoughts\nWill ... that does sound simple and you know as I tell everyone everything works until it doesn't sound like gives all the time they look at me like it's annoying I was like I Know but it's through this trip so the thing is our dividends guaranteed the answer's no\nBecause the evidence or what their income that the businesses generating businesses are always going to have ebbs and flows to them now there are businesses which have had a history of always raising their dividends they're very more mature business think of like a Proctor and gamble\nGreat example right they've done a consistent job you're always going to use their products at least we hope you surprises lettuce soap and shampoo who seemed to pace and things like that things we hope people are using on a regular and consistent basis but let's look at a company that everyone thought was you know the blue list of the blue chips right\nAnd that would be company called General Electric now General Electric just got kicked out of the doubt\nIt was the only remaining component in the Dow Jones industrial average there was there and it was founded so now so longer in the ... which is you know a sad day\nBut if you look at this if you set up your income to be based just on the evidence that was paying\nIn two thousand fourteen you were getting twenty two cents a share that's great it's a thousand Fifteen they bumped it up to twenty three cents a share and it held that and then the last part of two thousand sixteen December they raised it twenty four cents a share\nSo you're getting a little bit of an increase in evidence which is helping you to what combat inflation increase your purchasing power right well then what happened in two thousand and Eighteen\nAt the end of Seventeen they announced that they were cutting their dividend by half wow\nSo there David and went down to twelve cents okay so now all of a sudden your income gets cut in half not only that the principal the value of the stock is now down over last year down by forty percent so also your portfolio or whatever you had in that stock went down by half as well see I have the income and half the value\nHow civil is retirement now okay so yes it sounds simple if you look at the history that the evidence just remember that\nYou know two thousand eight should've taught you and she just had everyone out there that things can change\nOutside of a company's control now granted you know we could go back in tie that to the toxic mortgages we could use it over leveraging but when you boil it down to the heart of it what really was causing a lot of issues was banks were not trusting other banks and lending was writing to halt\nIf Lenny whatever grind to a halt again most businesses will be able to operate as it keeps most businesses afloat is their ability to borrow money on short term basis as to fund operations\nSo structurally you have to think about can never happen again we hope not I never hope that we have to go through another two thousand eight nine but if we did how does your retirement and look those the questions you have to answer William\nAnd so there might be better smarter ways to do that simpler wages like you're saying there's sometimes a simple ways or not the ways that you've been taught you know sometimes we learn from our parents or grandparents or\nYou know the Gulf buddies or people around the water cooler ways that they've done it maybe there's a simpler better way those are things you need to find out those are things were going to show you when you come in and meet with us if you do decide to come in and meet with us\nWe'll show you all the ... all the ways to do it sometimes of stocks sometimes it's not so you need to find all the tools that can work and increase the odds of success rather than just relying on just dividends and growth of stocks so your interests and that give us a call five one five to six Fifteen hundred\nWell thank you for the question William was certainly appreciate again that number five one five two to six Fifteen hundred I if you'd like to talk with Eric Peterson yourself get yourself on the counter five one five to six Fifteen hundred and a final question this week for you on the program is from Victoria and she's in urban nail\nAnd says Eric I'm In my late forties and have fallen in love again thinking about getting married uh my concern is is that he is closer to sixty and I'm worried about what's going to happen if he's retired and I'm Still working for ten more years or so financially is this going to be a problem or can't at work\nOr it can work financially absolutely but the animosity that you might experience having to go into work when he can stay home especially for a get out for a decade but also those bad months and do\nYou think that was January and all of a sudden we had you know a foot of snow and everyone's going slow into work and you got to get up and getting going that cold and he gets to sit there in the paper and drink more coffee\nSo you have a conversation about that and we do have clients that do have a a large gap in ages and a lotta times through proper planning allows the younger spouse to actually leave earlier than what they thought\nSo yeah financially can work but there's some other issues that you won't address and made that surround lifestyle issues about\nHey you know if you're doing the forty hours a week there and you have all this time off that you maybe you can do some things around the house or you know we're not marriage counsellors here that I talked to a lot of retirees and\nThose are the things that especially if it's a younger ... wife and the husbands at how those things are getting their crop out you know hey you know I'm I'm the one hasn't been a battle all this stuff out here\nBut at the proper planning done actually a lot of times the other spouse is able to leave sooner than they anticipated which is really nice and they can enjoy that time together what things about retirement and she was you want to be able to do all the fun stuff when you guys have the vitality to do it\nAnd so waiting for the younger spouse to get to retirement age sometimes pushes the older spouse to age or maybe they started having some\nHopefully do but maybe some medical issues or something like that that they can't physically do the things that they want to do so you want to do this when you can so again just it's going through a process to see if you can't afford at the time that you watch you and if you don't then you know the answer that question which means you've got to either work longer or save more\nThat you learn when you're coming to meet with us and go through our retirement ready to strip view so\nFor you Victoria with us up there just give us a call five one five to six Fifteen hundred easy way to get started or then we ask that you're over fifty have at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars safe retirement that you yourself and your retirement your family a favor give us a call and coming at me with us five one five to six Fifteen hundred\nAnd again that number five one five two to six Fifteen hundred get yourself on the calendar get started today with Iowa was retirement specialist Eric Peterson and his team at Peterson financial group\nServing in Des Moines I

driving car but to use all of this technology be so bad that it can be a WMD\nThat didn't of mass destruction [noise] well research out this past week that autonomous vehicles are a giant security Redskin white hats need to get there before the black happened do in a closed door Q A session Ilan most said that a fleet wide attack was Tesla's nightmare scenario\nAnd announce it they were going to open source their security modules so that all the auto makers could work together for a safer self driving future All right I just hope that when they open source at all they do a better job at that than actually building the cars so governments are trying to get involved to putting controls around these self driving cars\nOr I the D O D can't even change the default password on a computer controlling warheads and as far as Tesla's go\nI'd be shocked if they were in business just a few years from now or I don't tell you there's a lot of self driving car news this past week and you may have heard of wave that is Google's self driving taxis right\nAnd it's rolling out across the United states but how they plan to use it is very interesting and I bet nobody has told you this yet about way mo because let's do the math together\nHow does Google make its money anybody yes you in the Ford truck they make a huge chunk of change\nOff of advertising right or companies buying advertising people seeing advertising so put us all together with the self driving taxi do you see the future yet do you envision how it's going to we're All right let's say you go to Google and you search for I

week it's self driving cars had ten million miles of experience on public roads\nI'd just glad there isn't a self driving car run by Microsoft because every day we hear about some crash crazy stuff [noise] and finally as of July twenty ninth team in certain parts of the world all electric cars will need to make a low speed noise by law\nYou see these electric cars are just too quiet right now people can't hear the cars and they're just too many accidents\nAnd from twenty twenty on they have to be retrofitted with sound generators if he was no engine sounded all road safety groups they're calling them silent killers and they said they put the lives of kids elderly blind the death\nHeadphone where's textures\nAre in jeopardy so we got a hold here I became coming from a brand new sound was going to be heard when a lecture car goes by now I Want you to hear it\nIt's going to be the sound and of a ticket or car it has a fancy name it's called the audible vehicle alert system now the sound can be heard and speeds up to twelve miles per hour\nThis before I play the north and tell you a little bit more about\nThe noise is four years in the making\nAnd it was designed specifically to be audible by ... organs but not heard by anybody inside the car\nAnd this is funny that first of the technicians developed has found that was like they say a size five space craft but they had to shelve it because people when the car was driving by they would look up in the sky rather than at the road so back to the labs they when they came up with a brand new sound\nAnd at the MIT it from a speaker located behind the front and grilled since we heard in every direction so let's take a listen to the sound that the brand new and let them make in your neighborhood [noise]\nOoh that's all\nSo as the electric cars going by that's the sound that that the that the researchers say that doesn't sound like a size five space craft or what do you think Andrea I'm ready for that\nWhy don't they just make it sound like a car like a V. eight [laughter]\n[laughter] I figured he was that one\nYeah yeah you know what you just can't beat the sound of a V. eight or bigger race color I mean here we

Europe next month and my husband and I both have gone to identity theft so I'm very careful about what I Do and I was reading that I probably should have a\n... an app but when I'm using up like ... and I'm Wondering how important is that I researched telling Larry\nEither [laughter] it was good his fat\nDifferently is any free ones out there what kind of like can you shed on me that that's\nAll right well let's start at the very basics okay is that when you're on the public why buy everything that you do is like traveling right through the airwaves okay\nSo if you are typing in your bank account and your password your Amazon dot com has whatever it may be is that anybody can just pluck that out of the year so and so the whole idea behind a VPN or what's called a virtual private network is that is going to use all this sophisticated in ...\nCorruption so it's going to scramble it all up to us is traveling in the airwaves you won't be able just pick it out okay and so the whole idea behind using the VP an app is that we're going to have this magical tunnel that you're going to use when you are scouting around in Europe where you guys going\nUm we're getting um London, France Amsterdam and Germany oh how fun yes Kelly I'm\nSo excited for yo know London you're going to make sure that you get this app it's put out by the London museum oh and so when you're ... this was like the coolest thing you're going to totally love this to buy when you are like standing in a say in front of Buckingham Palace or pickled daily square or whatever it may be\nIs that you hold up your phone and augmented reality\nSo you can see where you're standing what it looked like in say Eighteen sixty two oh my gosh oh it's so cool it's so cool and then the other thing are ... are you into like military stuff\nAh my husband is\nOkay there's a museum and I made the mistake and I didn't mean to go to this museum which means like a lot of people don't mean to go to the museum which means most most people don't go there and say is that is the imperial museum\nIs also in London and then of course in France make sure you take like a a cooking class for chocolate and ah it's just an old had us take like the right cause songs and you know if you could do a food toward any of the city has been great I went back to your VPN so when you're sitting there\nHaving your tea and Crumpet or your wine and the souffle or whatever it may be is that I Want to make sure that the hackers in the bad guys don't get you so uh so you're right there are all these different VPN those some of them I Can't say on the air 'cause it's like hide your\nWhatever uh then there's Nord VPN and then there's also freedom VPN which they were actually a sponsor of our show at the company by the name of as secure and it's a public company and this is the VPN that I use than it is free or like for example when I was in London last month\nAnd so it does slow things down\nA but if you want to be safe and secure and I'll put a link to this over I commanded a comment that show picks buttons you can find it\nIs that is truly the best way to do and of course before you go tell your credit cards that you're going I mean you ... you know all the drill and then there's a there's another app that you need to get its called mobile passport you heard me talk about that\nI'm no okay you need this app okay just if you don't do anything else cut that out okay All right so you leave the United states you're on your way back\nOkay there's four hundred and fifty people on the plane right right and they're all coming down this pipeline all go to go through homeland security and border patrol now if you have mobile passport on your phone\nWe all know we should back up our data but if you were

guys will come into confused if you're joining us if you're just coming with us and if you've been with us for the whole ride I Hope you've enjoyed so far we've had a lot of great callers today which I don't know what's been going on the last few\nWeeks we haven't had a lot of callers and I try to incentivize I tried to bribe people to call and we just don't get a lot of callers I guess so we go on and we do our thing but the colors of what makes the show anyone can listen to me all our long a no aftershock today I got some places I got to get to right after the show today so unfortunately guys know aftershock and of course the one time I don't have time for an aftershock\nI've got lots of funny stories from so I'm going to save him for next week you don't want to miss next week's after ... um I I've heard some terms that I've never heard before in my life positive things used to describe us All right so um you know what the Internet is right and you know what Google is and Facebook\nAnd on and Amazon all these companies they're tracking us around the Web using cookies they're collecting all of our personal data like Facebook and the social network all who are friends are on just a last week Facebook got busted again All right so Facebook wants you to put two factor authentication on your account what that is is you have a ... you know what a password is right\nBut when you go to log into your account two factor authentication you type in your user name you type in your password you click log in and then it sends a code to your phone through a text message for example and\nThen you ... and then there's the boxes under the code from your phone and you type in the coach from your phone of that's one example of two factor authentication so just having the passwords not enough you also have to have your cell phone in your hand to log in that stops the bad guys from logging into your account\nWhen you're not around well Facebook has been taking the phone numbers that you provide you give them your cell phone number to send a text message to they'd been selling those phone numbers the robocall companies\nTo market products to you so there are ... and that's particularly underhanded because they're they're saying for your own security provide us with a phone number so we can make your account secure and then by the way we're going to sell it to everybody to\nSeize but uh you know it just it that's the kind of stuff that leaves a bad taste in people's mouth and it's not just Facebook is doing the guys everybody does that kind of stuff Google doesn't um apple does it uh Amazon certainly doesn't you know all the Big East do it so wouldn't it be great\nIf all of your personal data was held in like getting close your let's think of it like a pot that holds all of your own personal information\nAnd you control it all and you can revoke access to it at any point in time to anyone so in other words you could provide a phone number for two factor authentication stored in your pod\nAnd then that information can be accessed in an encrypted way to send messages by Facebook without ever providing Facebook with your actual phone number\nAll that would be doing ... ... it's encrypted so Facebook doesn't even get to see just like with your secure update or account I said we can't see your password for security reasons\nWell this'll be like we can't see your name for security reasons we can't see your phone number we can't see your email address or all that stored in a nice little enclosed pod and you control it all the you can allow people to see it\nAnd monetize it of course if you and then you know because that's the thing if you put it all in a pot I'll Google has to do is put out a new toy\nIf you want access to our new toy and allow us to have access to your pod and half the people on the Internet would be like ... and they just click it and they give people access to it um but here's the difference if you have a
