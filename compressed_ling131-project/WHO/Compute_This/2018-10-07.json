I have a conspiracy theory about this\nAbout that story I I think there was more going on than anyone would was carrying to ah to release at the time so I'll I'll tell you what my conspiracy theories and we'll see it'll either be one of those things that has never talk about again [laughter]\nOr it'll be one of those moments where it's like I did well see the story three weeks from now that I didn't I called the guys this is that this is why you listen to the show you know you can hear all the stuff first um so we got a lot of great stuff to go on today so basically\nTerrorists are coming there are going to impact PC sales there's no end in sight in these terrorists right now these are Chinese tariffs so it's not a NAFTA tariff that you know the looks like there might be a NAFTA deal going on we might get some of those tariffs taken away or fixed up or whatever but uh this is the China a trade war thing so\nUm this is the downside of the terrorists and farmers especially farmers in Iowa have been had been feeling this but the soybeans and whatnot but you know\nNo matter how you look at it it is what it is we're gonna we're going to deal with it we're going to move forward and we're going to do what we always do we're going to build amazing computers for the holiday season this year and we're going to do it at an unbelievable price that nobody else can match\n'cause you know the same computer from Dallas if you ... and we're going to do this again but every year we spec it out against down on their website and every year it's like a three thousand dollar computer from Dallas\nAnd were selling it for fourteen and so if it's a hundred bucks more it's still a great deal but I'm just saying if you know you're going to buy one of these if this is something you've been waiting the whole year for and there are customers who have been waiting the whole year for it I Would recommend you do it\nSoon like very soon I'm I have no idea when we're going to start to see the price increase on the tariffs is going to impact all PC components south state drives memory mother boards cases um processors\nEverything uh unless you buy a completely assembled computer that was assembled overseas and shipped here which of course\nDoesn't that just smacked the small business why would you do that with the terrorists come on I mean he was beaten us off with a tariff now you know I get that if you're going to if you're gonna terrified terrified at all\nBecause how I mean seriously how many if you're going to it's a lobbyist thing I'm sure of it anyway I'm going to stay out of the politics eight six six for nine six eight seven seven to All right so also coming up on the program today um I mentioned the shock say okay we're going to talk about that but those have you been under a rock and don't know what that is a Facebook\nFifty million user accounts breached the data breach that's a that's a big you were going to talk about that um\nIt's a fun article from Fast Company we don't get too many articles from Fast Company would cover on the program but Tim uh what's his name burners the timber his hyphenated name Tim burners Lee\nTells us his radical new plant up and the world Wide Web okay so he's got a radical planned up and the Internet um before you left this guy off this guy is the grand pappy of the existing Internet\nYeah he's the guy that came up with the idea and he doesn't like what Google and Facebook and Amazon are using the Internet for and how they're exploiting your data and your information and monetize and get for their own game without giving new anything back\nHe has a plan to turn that around and in the process if his plan works it's going to blow up Google Amazon are all the existing business models on the Internet or the conglomerates are going to be completely blown up\nAnd it's gonna be it's going to literally be a digital revolution if this if this comes to pass so I thought it's important it's complicated we're not going to go into the weeds on it but it's important that at least say\nHey guys you know decade from now there could be a whole new Internet so you know back off the Google stock you know [laughter] oh yeah and there are consequences for hacking now have FBI sending people to prison\nI'm for stealing secrets so no more no more snow and clean get away is now that people are getting getting punished for that and then we have an update you remember the heck\nYou hack hack the hockey hack hack teenager that decided he was going to hack into apple and I\nGot into their their their servers and compromise their servers and saved all the the the data on his computer hard drive in a folder\nCalled ... well we have an update on his uh his legal situation [laughter] ... and then\nBecause you all wanted to know how much does it cost to charge a smartphone for a year exactly in dollars how much tens of dollars hundreds of dollars what is that smartphone costing you and your power bill and why should you charge it like at somebody else [laughter]\nAre I guess we've got a lot of fun stuff to do eight six six for nine six eight seven seven to ... the shock safe upgrade is a is a program um I mentioned\nThis when I came on the air here but uh basically in October Microsoft is going to be releasing a brand new version of windows this is not an update this is an upgrade this is a brand new version of windows ... very much like when you went from window seven\nWindows ten before this is going from windows ten one version of it to a new version of windows tent a new version of windows tend that will have its own set of problems its own in compatibility with different software for example the last version of windows ten made a quick books two thousand seven obsolete\nBefore that you could run cookbooks two thousand seven so some poor business owner out there who bought his you know five hundred dollar quick books program in two thousand seven and has been skating along you know for a decade plus now on it I woke up one morning to say is computer got rebuilt it for an important update and that was quick books won't run\nHoops I Hope you were planning on enforcing anybody today All right so here's the deal I'm I Believe last week on the program\nUm we had something like eight hundred of these available and I warn you that this was going to happen that we were going to see a dramatic drop in the available quantity of safe upgrade licenses were down to fifty six as of right now I'm In the control refreshing is to make sure it's actually not zero\nUm 'cause I looked at it yesterday yep no fifty six I'm so it's fifty six copies remaining so if you have not purchased a copy yet\nOr if you haven't bought enough copies you needed one copy for each computer that you use what struck safe upgrade does is it installs this huge Microsoft Update the exact same way we would do it on the bench in the service Centre it's going to download it's going to make sure your computer's hard drive is good first\nAnd then if your hard drive is good the next step is it's going to make sure your third party software is all up to date your job or your flash yeah we don't want your windows ten update to fail because you're running adobe acrobat to or something stupid like that they got automatically installed when he tried to install that windows x._p. game that you knew wasn't going to run anyway\nUm so we make sure all of your third party software his current so you don't have any road blocks their next step we check your anti virus software to make sure you're running good anti virus and then we'll warn you appropriately if there is something that needs to be addressed then we move forward into the update itself rather than downloading it from Microsoft Servers were the with the ... masses\nAre downloading it from we give you your own private special server it's kinda like when you go to the airport and there's like used to be there was like a whole lounge you could sit in right if you ... I've never flown first class of my life so I've seen the doors to these supposedly lounges there could be nothing behind that it could be like you open it up and you step off a cliff I don't know\nUm but if you pay a lot of money you're supposed to have this special lounge we just flew to Orlando the other day another special lounge was like a special section of seats off to the side and the terminal so you didn't have to like\nSit next to the people in coach I guess while you waited for the plane I don't know\nUm but anyway um I digress where you get your own special first class server to download this from in fact we have three servers this time because as you might remember last time a lot of people downloaded it all at once and it led to some on availability\nUh we knew we were trying to keep up with an immense we expanded the servers out to three this time to make sure we'd have plenty of bandwidth to get everybody downloaded now\nThe update will get downloaded to your computer and installed in this controlled environment if something goes wrong if the update fails to install\nIf the update a rebate your computer and your computer doesn't ... back up again\nW.

Bonnie how can I help you today on computers is\nOh okay are you there I Am here um my icon are came to me I no longer have icon on the lower right hand corner okay at all over my screen that one and another I've got a new job icons recently added this check for updates configure job law\nAbout job [noise] okay oh why did my ICANN\nThe positioning of my icons change\nOK so first of all the items that we are talking about I Want to make sure I understand that you're ... you're talking about the icons in the task bar that are down by the clock in the lower right hand corner\nRight but they are not there\nOr is there a little arrow that you can click on um like a ... they called the carrot and looking up words facing arrow that you can click on to show the hidden icons\nOh here's an icon are not hidden they're all over my screen I just have to go down\nThe hidden icons are on the desktop\nYes and you can screw them yes\nThat is super weird I I I we got to be having a communication not function between the two of us here or something 'cause that I've never ... the hidden icons in the system tray down there are ... are they they can't you can't drag them out to the desktop\nI did not it was Monday when I turned on the computer is like this\nOkay bunny or you were shocked subscriber\nNo I'm not\nOkay um have you had your computer into us in the last thirty days\nNot or am I thirty days that recently\nOkay and I'm just trying to think of how I can get how it can get an excuse to give you a free shocked that session to take a look at that 'cause I'm just curious to see it you know you might just I might just be curious to see it you know I'm the or the other thing to hear is I'm never fear because well it could be tomorrow or it could be next week you can get a whole new version of windows ten anyway\nBut that's not a thing that was kind of laying off\nOn and it's going to reset all of your stuff back to default so [laughter] you have to you know there was an edge is your fault browser again and oh yeah did you have to go back and tell it I don't want to use edge cause ... edges a piece of junk I don't like it I Want to use a of Firefox or chrome instead and things like that on the job\nThat the new job ... oh\nOkay are you a secure update er subscriber yeah Hi I'm\nOK secure update or shouldn't be taking care of your job before you um so I Would double check that you're secure up later as open and run another way to do that ironically is to write click on the icon in the task bar in the lower right hand corner of first secure theater to shield with a letter you want it\nUm there's also when you install secure update or a desktop icon it right clicking on that I Will not do anything and double clicking on that I Will not do anything for you um it's the ... right click on the icon in the task\nBar and the reason we did that is the task bar never changes\nNever changes and so we're like the one place we could put the icon that it'll always be there is if it's your gators running it's in the passport so right now let's see if the singers those job update let's go ahead an open secure updated find any secure later I kinda anywhere in double click on it\nYes the care update or right here and he had an amateur secure ...\nIt says ad patch or there's something about a patch or I don't know what that one that's that's not want to allow that to make changes to your computer ... go ahead and click no on that one that's not our like it's quick yeah\nThat's that's not ours there that it might be actually there there was a like years ago there was a patch we had to deploy to everybody or for the older version of scripted or called patch or\nUm but uh but that's been like two thousand says Ben ... innovation\nOkay so that's our pasture but that's that's that's for the old old old version to secure a better so now I mean I Know what we can do or what do I do it now\nWhen we open up today at noon or you know if you listen to the show
