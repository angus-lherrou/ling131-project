news or a ... tough local story there's good news if you don't like the cold the new winter forecasters out from the national climate Prediction Center\nAbove average temperatures and actually they are anticipating at least a week El Nino this winter we do have I mean you were typically on the warm side of normal and on the less snowy side\nOver that period overnight about half the people who tried to run safe upgrade were not able to complete the update\nA and that led to a lot of people getting upset because they're like hey I bought safe upgrade why is it not working the answer is it was working beautifully it stopped the update that was going to delete your data because it was going to delete your data and we detected that\nThat's what's safe upgrade as it's not sure upgrade it's safe upgrade all we can do you guys is get the update the Microsoft gives us and then we push it out to computers and make sure that it installs properly so we can't control the update we can't rewrite the software code of the update but we can make sure that if we see like massive\nThe legion of files um we can say no no no no and we can blow it up Microsoft detects the update blew up rolls the computer back to the previous version and all of your stuff is still there and then you you know people tried multiple times and they said it keeps it keeps failing on first ... well yeah it's failing on first rebuild 'cause it would if it would have reported it would have to lead your data\nAnd so that was why it failed so safe upgrade did its job and saved\nI I Can't even imagine what would have happened\nIf you know I mean and the people who buy safe upgrade they are the core of shock customers the these are the people that that that have all all the shock stuff\nThey've got sick you're up there they've got Dr advisor they've got and point and they're like you know what I Need to make sure this is done right I'm going to make sure it's done right they come in for preventative maintenance every six months with a prepaid certificate that these are these are the ... customers\nAnd when they get this and they're saying hey this isn't working this isn't like a shock product you know what why isn't working and then they find out that they would have been hit by this\nI Can't imagine or you know half of our core customers getting hit with the data deletion bug that is a huge ... um so basically they put out a patch\nSo they pulled the update then after that we knew what the problem was so we first of all we allowed safe upgrade to continue pushing the update because we knew that people who would have the problem\nIt wouldn't and salt and people who weren't going to have the problem will get the update and everything would be right as rain and they'd be fine the people that it didn't install for we had them come into the service Centre or we tried to do it over the shock that\nWe were able to do it over the shock this for quite a while to Microsoft pulled the update once they pulled the update we didn't have any alternative ways to get that that the files that we needed from your from your from your house\nTo transfer a file afford goodbye file over the shock this takes way too long I'm so at that point we had to start having people come in for updates then as people came in for updates they said you know wallets in here some people had prepaid maintenance certificates they wanted us to use because\nIt said you know for I just noticed over the last six months this thing has gotten ridiculously slow\nAnd when I say ridiculously slow I hadn't been known to be a slightly impatient person that time so when I'm using my computer if I hit the start menu and it takes you know four seconds for the start menu to open\nThat's kind of infuriating for me when I push the button I Want it to do something like now okay maybe I'm spoiled okay I'm sure a lot of you have computers at home when you push the button something now doesn't happen you know you have your patients it's a virtue virtue of which I don't have a ton of so\nThere's there's patience is a virtue and then there's the patients have Joe I had a computer in the Lincoln Service in and when we went to turn it on and and of course she wanted to show me the problem on the front desk right and there's a line of people so we went to turn the computer on\nNo I'm not even exaggerating four and a half minutes later the thing was booted up and ready ready to use\nA ... one point I restarted the darn thing 'cause I thought it locked up though it was just that slow as you go see this is what I mean I mean you never used to be this slow and uh so we started looking into it and sure enough just like a lot of other computers out there all these patches that have come down to patch\nAll these security vulnerability how many shows that we have we talked about this vector or vulnerability or the or the meltdown vulnerability respect her to respect for three years packed before and there were all these branch off that kept getting patched patched impact and these were hardware problems\nSo in the middle of safe upgrade coming out that we had some people complain that safe upgrade took forever to install much longer than it did last time um and there was some confusion as to why that would be it's because all these taxes that came down slowed your computer down up to forty percent in some cases\nTo but it made it secure right there there was a hardware vulnerability and they released a bunch of software patch has to fixing the only way software okay if you have\nA car and inside your car there is an engine and use throw a rod to the side of your engine\nYou're not going to fix that with an update to the cars computer unless possibly\nYou tell the engine to work in such a way that it doesn't use that routers someone or you disable that piece of the engine and then the rest of the engine continues to work now guys I'm not a mechanic okay maybe that's possible maybe that's not your heads out there are probably freaking out right now but\nThat's your transmission doesn't work so the computer says what is going to drive backwards put it in reverse okay maybe that's better I don't know\nBottom line is the only way software can fix a hardware problem is by turning something off and that's what they did they turned off\nThe stuff that makes your computers processor fast with a hard drive\nSo as a result anybody out there that has a mechanical hard drive has experience to slow down on their computer of up to forty percent now what is a mechanical her drive long story short unless you have a holiday special or shocked build that you've purchased in the last two years or you just had me put a solid said in your computer\nYou have a mechanical harder mechanical her desert spinning hard drives of moving parts solid state hard drives have no moving parts and we're upgrading ... there's like four and a half\nMinute customer had me transitioned her hard drive out for a solid say some of the south states are they're so inexpensive nine hundred and fifty bucks a compared to you know five hundred dollars last year I'm Jeremy ... solid state and her computer and the four and a half minute ... time I I Know this is not an exaggeration or joke went down to Thirteen seconds\nThirteen seconds it was faster than the day she bought the computer she was absolutely thrilled with that\nIn the computer was usable again there in some cases the customers who came in who's computers are in that group that's been hit by forty percent they want a maintenance checkup done\nWe tell them we call them first and and offer them the solid say upgrade first because otherwise the maintenance check is going to take two days to scan everything but if we have great due to a solid state we can have it done today and then we get it done in the customers get their computers harming it allows them to put off buying a new computer for another few years\nBecause a lot of people you might be in the same boat are using the computer right now and saying this thing is just low I mean it is wicked slow I now maybe I just need a new computer your thoughts on the radio saying that last Eighteen months now maybe my Eighteen month is over and I need a new computer\nIn some cases that's true in most cases all you need is a solid state hard drive and then you could look another couple of years out of that computer that you have whether it's a shock builder not now here's the thing I said the computers that HP in Dallas and everybody makes are designed to last about Eighteen months\nNot when we get our hands on because we know what components to replace to make those computers last longer and one of the biggest ones you can get replaces the solid state hard\nSome laptops have solid state hard drives already especially the newer ones but no desktops do so if you have a desktop for an all in one on unless it's a Mac you bought this year um it's not going to have a solid state drive and we can dramatically improve the performance so in the middle of this huge explosion of update stuff\nWe're also improving people's performance on their computer so it's been a hectic week but at this point it looks like the the update is okay if ... according to Microsoft in pushing the update on anybody anymore they released it\nBut we're seeing it coming through and people's computers again automatically so once again your computer will automatically get the upgrade the updates and now the data deletion bug has been fixed and you have an HP there's a little bit of a problem here but hopefully they're going to patch that soon to\nAll in all should be a pretty smooth sailing update which has led full circle back to is it really necessary for when from Microsoft to update windows twice a year\nFull of new features that nobody really wants\nAnd when I say nobody I'm not saying the features aren't cool it it's not that I'm not saying it's that it's bad that your computer interface with most three D printers and create really amazing that the Afghan updated Microsoft paints concrete three D. three dimension designs and print them on a physical print or that prince plastic to make something that's pretty cool\nBut I can also tell you for the same reason we don't put gaming graphics cards and all of our computers yeah they're pretty cool but my customers don't do that so why would I make my customers pay for something they're never going to use\nAnd that's one of the biggest concerns right now with the update every ... every six months of the stuff that like we got today or this week last week is going to happen again in April every six months\nAnd some people some customers express some frustration to me it's a thought this is just\nThis is ridiculous that I have to have this every six months some people ask me for a subscription service to save up great\nAnd I'm just like we we take each update as a as an individual thing Microsoft could change their update scheduled next year and then you have a subscription to something that that you don't need that doesn't make any sense of we do it at one time thing so for those of you who purchased you're safe operate if you're hearing my voice for the first time\nMake sure you run your safe upgrade now if you're not sure whether or not you're safe upgrade completed successfully you can write click on the start menu so go down to the lower left hand corner of your screen and right click left click\nWants to have these conversations then when we engage about things they want us to talk about I raised the minute that happened to shut\nDown all your racist or a bigger or whatever we want to enter looking like actual drug use radio

will report back to us for our records what your computer specifications or your statistics so if people like Barbara call us and say how large of a solid state hard drive do I need or if you've been

your hard drive failure early\nBefore it becomes a huge problem does detect every hard drive failure no it does not\nIt only detects the slow rolling failures that happens slowly over time which is
