I have a conspiracy theory about this\nAbout that story I think there was more going on than anyone would was carrying to ah to release at the time\nSo I'll I'll tell you what my conspiracy theories and we'll see it'll either be one of those things that has never talk about again [laughter]\nOr it'll be one of those moments where it's like I\nDid well see the story three weeks from now ... did I called the guys this is that this is why you listen to the show you know\nYou can hear all the stuff first um so we we got a lot of great stuff to go on today so basically terrorists are coming they are going to impact PC sales there's no end in sight in these terrorists right now these are Chinese tariffs so it's not a NAFTA tear up that you know the looks like there might be a NAFTA deal going on we might get some of those tariffs taken away or fixed up or whatever\nBut uh this is the China trade war thing so\nUm this is the downside of the terrorists and farmers especially farmers in Iowa have been had been feeling this but the soybeans and whatnot but you know\nNo matter how you look at it it is what it is we're gonna we're going to deal with that we're going to move forward and we're going to do it we always do we're going to build amazing computers for the holiday season this year and we're going to do it at an unbelievable price that nobody else can match 'cause you know the same computer from del if you were going to do this again but every year we spec it out against Ellen their website\nAnd every year it's like a three thousand dollar computer from do\nAnd we're selling it for fourteen and so if it's a hundred bucks more it's still a great deal but I'm just saying if you know you're going to buy one of these if this is something you've been waiting the whole year for and there are customers who have been waiting the whole year for it\nI Would recommend you do it\nSoon like very soon I'm I have no idea when we're going to start to see the price increase on the tariffs it's going to impact all PC components south state drives memory mother boards cases um processors\nEverything uh unless you buy a completely assembled computer that was assembled overseas and shift here which of course\nIt doesn't that just smack the small business what would you do that with the terrorists come on I mean he was beaten us up with a tariff now you know I get that if you're gonna if you're gonna tear if a tear if at all\nBecause I I mean seriously how many if you're going to it's a lobbyist thing I'm sure of it anyway\nI'm going to stay out of the politics eight six six for nine six eight seven seven to alright so also coming up on the program today um I mentioned the shock say okay we're going to talk about that but those have you been under a rock and don't know what that is a Facebook Fifteen million user accounts breached the data breach that's a that's a big you were going to talk about that um\n... or ... article from Fast Company we don't get too many articles from Fast Company would cover on the program but Tim uh what's his name burners the timber his hyphenated name Tim burners Lee\nTells us his radical new plant up and the world Wide Web okay so he's got a radical planned to upend the Internet um before you left this guy off this guy is the grand pappy of the existing Internet\nYeah he's the guy that came up with the idea and he doesn't like what Google and Facebook and Amazon are using the Internet for and how they're exploiting your data and your information and monetize and get for their own game without giving you anything back\nHe has a plan to turn that around and in the process if his plan works it's going to blow up Google Amazon are all the existing business models on the Internet or the conglomerates are going to be completely blown up\nAnd it's gonna be it's going to literally be a digital revolution if this if this comes to pass so I thought it's important it's complicated we're not going to go into the weeds on it but it's important that at least say\nHey guys you know decade from now there could be a whole new Internet so you know back off the Google stock you know [laughter] oh yeah and there are consequences for hacking now have FBI sending people to prison\nI'm for stealing secrets so no more no more Snowden clean get away is now that people are getting getting punished for that and then we have an update you remember the heck\nYou hack hack the hockey hack hack teenager that decided he was going to hack into apple and I got into their their their servers and compromise their servers and saved all the the the data on his computer hard drive in a folder called ... but we have an update on his uh his legal situation [laughter]\nBecky hacker and then because you all wanted to know\nMuch does it cost to charge a smartphone for a year exactly in dollars how much tens of dollars hundreds of dollars what is that smartphones costing you and your power bill and why should you charge it like at somebody else [laughter]\nOr I guess we got a lot of fun stuff to do eight six six for nine six eight seven seven to ... the shock safe upgrade\nIs a is a program um I mentioned this when they came on the air here but uh basically in October Microsoft is going to be releasing a brand new version of windows this is not an update this isn't a grade this is a brand new version of windows ... very much like when you went from window seven two windows ten before\nThis is going from windows ten one version of it to a new version of windows ten a new version of windows ten that will have its own set of problems its own in compatibility with different software for example the last version of windows ten made a quick books two thousand seven obsolete\nBefore that you could run quick books two thousand seven so some poor business owner out there who bought his you know five hundred dollar quick books program in two thousand seven and has been skating along you know for a decade plus now on it I woke up one morning to say is computer got re booted for an important update and that was quick books won't run\nHoops hope you were planning on enforcing anybody today All right so here's the deal I'm I Believe last week on the program\nUm we had something like eight hundred of these available and I warned you that this was going to happen that we were going to see a dramatic drop in the available quantity of safe upgrade licenses were down to fifty six as of right now I'm In the control refresh this to make sure it's actually not zero\nUm 'cause I looked at it yesterday you have no fifty six I'm so it's fifty six copies remaining so if you have not purchased a copy yet\nOr if you haven't bought enough copies you needed one copy for each computer that you use what struck safe upgrade does is it installs this huge Microsoft Update the exact same way we would do it on the bench in the service Centre it's going to download it's going to make sure your computer's hard drive is good first\nAnd then if your hard drive is good and the next step is going to make sure your third party software is all up to date your job or your flash yeah we don't want your windows ten update to fail because you're running adobe acrobat to or something stupid like that they got automatically installed when he tried to install that windows x._p. game that you knew wasn't going to run anyway\nUm so we make sure all of your third party software is current so you don't have any road blocks their next that we check your anti virus software to make sure you're running good anti virus and then we have warned you appropriately if there's something that needs to be addressed then we move forward into the update itself rather than downloading it from Microsoft Servers where the where the the ... masses\nAre downloading it from we give you your own private special server it's kinda like when you go to the airport and there's like used to be there was like a whole lounge you could sit and right if you I've never flown first class in my life so I've seen the doors to these supposedly lounges there could be nothing behind that it could be like you open it up and you step off a cliff I don't know\nUm but if you pay a lot of money you're supposed to have the special lounge we just flew to Orlando the other day and other special lounge was like\nA special section of seats off to the side and the terminal so you didn't have to like\nSit next to the people in coach I guess while you waited for the plane I don't know\nUm but anyway um I digress when you get your own special first class server to download this from in fact we have three servers this time because as you might remember last time a lot of people downloaded it all at once and it led to some on availability\nUh we knew we were trying to keep up with an immense we expanded the servers out to three this time to make sure we'd have plenty of bandwidth to get everybody download it now\nThe update will get downloaded to your computer and installed in this controlled environment if something goes wrong if the update fails to install\n[noise] would've Randy in your hand in it I just want to thousands dollars [noise] I Am standing it's nine thousand dollar every hour all day will have the words and another shot at a grass [noise]\nFox News on the other hand like Florida Senator Marco Rubio says us Saudi relations and they need to be completely revised if an investigation finds the government responsible for the murder of Washington Post contributor her mom ...\nThat
