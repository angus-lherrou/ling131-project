today's top stories from Des Moines is news traffic and severe weather station news radio ten forty W\nW wait till radio news or am I ... going to be a windy Sunday folks with\nSo are all in all guys if you have not yet installed version Eighteen oh nine on your windows ten computer the time to do it is now the time to the way to do it is with safe upgrade I think we had like twenty five copies or so on the website you can buy that are still remaining and\nWe can sell more now that we've gotten through that the initial rush we just haven't you know restock it basically I went through a couple of hundred up and let it let it go with that\nUm but if you are if you want to purchase that online you can go to shock innovations dot com you get a copy of safe upgrade so you can safely install the patch on your computer and then you can go forward from there if you want to take your chances a twenty percent of the time things go wrong eighty percent of the time things go right so odd things are going to go right\nBut if things go wrong the repair costs can be like two hundred bucks so safe upgrades fifty dollars and you get a warranty so if it does screw something up like that one customer who had a problem that had to have us you know basically do four hours of labor to fix everything for them install the software to Microsoft account linked backup\nOr try to get all their old garbage software that used to work on previous versions of windows ... is no longer compatible with windows than working again yeah that was fun let's installed the anniversary update install all the junk software like you know the hallmark card studio two thousand twelve and then\nThen we can upgrade upgrade upgrade upgrade all the way up to the current updates and hope it doesn't blow up again that was a fun one but that but nevertheless that's what the warranty is for that that is your level of protection so that you don't get hit by something that you are\nThat you're not aware of what other quick thing I'm going to point out users of secure update or or have reported\nThat they're getting a pop up for a do be a ... reader program\nUm that is a legitimate pop up you do want to go ahead and quick update on that because it will bottleneck your other updates until you do that\nUh the reason that you're getting this normally secure up data updates everything's silently and the way that we do that is we use the network administrator or installation switches I'm Still a lot of times when you run it if you you know type the command line to run a program install it there'll be reader dot E. actually and you can put like a space forward slash asked for silent\nOr capital as or cue or for quieter cue and for quiet network mode er and basically it'll install it quietly as if a network administrator was deploying it on I was in thousands of computers because in essence that is what we're doing\nAdobe changed that flag however and so you guys over a truck interactive are working on getting that fixed up I'm so go ahead and quick update on that um that\nThat single pop up that comes up a and then finish when it's done and then I'll get you through that update and then the rest of Europe it's will go through successfully just a little footnote therefore secure updated eight\nSix six for nine six eight seven seven to All right so let's jump into some of the stuff you're a we talked about windows and I we got the updates going there um the fake moon oh my gosh that they can stories that are before going to jump in\nThose calls ed welcome to the program how can I help you today on computers\nWell a truck a vice secure up they're gone wacko okay what's going on it that that are done an update the adobe flash player okay and when it gets all done it get pops up a screen and that the\nInstalling of hat for a reader right and that's been gone for maybe five days that I'm getting tired to install on this thing oh\nGotcha well should only installed once when you're just to button clicks you have to you that's the patch I was just talking about um so when you click update it goes through and does the update and you have to click finished it to complete the update otherwise you're out there to keep launching it over and over and over until you actually get it done\nYeah I ...\nAnd stuff and I was in the store yesterday okay and I took a picture of the whole thing on my phone and I gave it to Ryan okay from the very very start but then if you go to a secure update or\nIt may it in a stall adobe or a flash player it all thing or another that will be read\nRight because it didn't install it because it didn't complete\nWell is there and then it they don't want to get all done at the the gear up that are that are installed the with no errors so so you know I go\nTo be read and write a right click on it and then the administrators on there\nWell you won't do any good 'cause that's not an installation fall that's just the program itself\nI'm so that normally if there was an inflation problem they go to the thing that we would do on the shocked us 'cause we would and installed the there'll be rear from your computer and\nThen read the computer and allow secure updated to re installed the Dolby reader again nine times out of time when there's an installation snafu like that that solves the problem is there's there's something corrupted with the initial installation that they're already insecure update or can't deal with that it only deals with software that's working properly\nI'm On the flip side though\nThe screens that you're seeing are not unique every secure update or user and got those screens this week um and you're the first one I've heard of this had any problems getting it to install after you click that install button and then the finished button when it's done\nYeah so like ... it's a hospital for me to an installer there'll be reader and then uh Oh absolutely yeah you're you're going to the computer now\nWell founded I if I Move around if I Move around you're going to make it a my reception lot very\nGood to keep that left arm up in the air I get it uh yeah [laughter]\nNo that's all right now basically to understand that it's pretty straightforward um you could start menu down in the lower left corner and then there's a gear that you can click on for settings ... yeah yeah yeah click on settings click on apps ... there'll be reader restart the computer that's the step everybody skips make sure your ... your computer\nAnd insecure updated will load up and take care of the install it'll pop that pop up again but then go ahead and click installing go through that\nAnd it should get it taken care of where we're going to try to get that pop up taking care of for you here guys that are by Monday afternoon\nUm it's a it's been a little bit of a task because for whatever reason that there'll be um\nHas taken away all the flags that normally work so either they removed the flag entirely which means we're going to have to create some special sauce to ah to install this program without being loud and obnoxious or um they just uh\nThey're ... it's probably they're charging a premium service for the network administrator mode and we're just gonna have to pony up by it um so that's a that's the other side of it as well so one way or the other will get right result for you here this week I got\nI got one more I got one more question um I I just bought a new iPhone ... and I went from a blip on to the new Apple iPhone and it it does that require any kind of a virus protection or is it\nRequire would be a strong word I mean it's always a good idea to have something watching your back on the Internet um but there are at this time no prevalent infections that are plaguing iPhones or Android phones for that matter so I'm a good one good free money you can get is called look out\nOn the other day it's available for Android and Apple's are look out of course has paid version as well they have some nice features to it um\nWell I've talked to about ... or ... uh I like\nA employed I got you know I got a lot on my computer and I just uh when I was in a store yesterday I Know a a\nI add it up in my head and point with the firing of the smoke them time so I just say take where but the only thing I don't like about him point you can't go on there and find out one at ... that's the only thing I don't like about it\nGotcha yeah yeah that that's because it's managed to shock and one of the things that we're doing with the new uh the new work for management system that we are building if we're going to have the place next year is we're unifying you you might have heard on the radio for the last year we've been pushing everyone to create a shock account\nWhen you buy a safe upgrade British rock account when we call you to renew your in point we ask you do you want to do an automatic renewal every year or do you want us to call you every year\nUh basically we're we're moving everything toward a shock account where you have one place on our website where you can log in and\nSee you're secure up their expiration date see your point expiration date um see any purchase history for safe upgrade or any other online products you've purchased a and eventually you'll be able to see all of your your invoice history ... every maintenance checkup every everything there in your shocking account we're moving toward that it's so slow or progression than I Would like for sure but\nWe're we're moving there as quickly as we can so hopefully

All right so before we get to the Chinese moons story and Richard's call here\nUm\nThere's this non player character thing going around it's a mean going around on Twitter I'm I'm going to see if I can I'm gonna try to bring up a picture\nA PC mean I'm I'm gonna try to bring up a picture of it for um for people to see on a on Facebook here I'm Sorry oh here's a story\nWhat is it that's this is the story from the New York times what is and PC the pro Trump Internet's favorite new insult\nOkay so basically end PC as an acronym it stands for non player character\nA non player character in the video game is a computer generated character in the game who has a very limited set of lines so imagine you're playing a game where you are the main character and you walk into the bar and the bartender has three pre programmed greetings like whether you have today or you know what are you drinking\nGood day outside isn't it you know those three things and that's all the guy can say you could you could ask every question of you could say why does China tried to launch a fake moon and he'd be like what you're drinking you know he just does he says the same thing he parrots back\nThe same thing whatever his programmers have told him to parrot back regardless of if it makes sense or not regardless of if it's true or not they just keep parroting the same thing back if you've ever watched cable news shows you get a quick lesson in ended ... both sides to do it\nAnd if you say it often enough\nPeople will start to believe it and you hear these people doing this all the time\nWell that's what an MTC a non player character so this mean God created non player character and they have a generic little space logo that you can put on them so you get this guy and basically someone said you're a non player character in other words\nYou're just some mouthpiece spouting off whatever your your your political programmers have told you to say you can't sing for yourself um and ... you should you should basically not even be listened to\nWell of course people on the right grab this and started running with it for people on the left people on the left started complaining that this was dehumanizing and the reason they use that specific words ... humanizing was very specific um because Twitter has a policy against any dehumanizing\nAnd so basically if you tweet that somebody is an end PC\nYou get banned from Twitter so if you want to see if you can get banned from Twitter grab one of these non player character means and re tweeted retweeted off your account and you'll have so many people it's crowd basically everybody from one side of the political spectrum will come\nAnd label your account as offensive at once enough people do that the rubber band hits and then you get banned from Twitter so it's it's pretty cool stuff so if you want to get yourself banned from Twitter maybe you want to\nOpen a Twitter account just to see if you can get banned on Twitter you know this would be the way to do it eight six six for nine six eight seven Seventy Richard thanks for hanging on the line how can I help you today on computers is\nYes I'm here with you OK
