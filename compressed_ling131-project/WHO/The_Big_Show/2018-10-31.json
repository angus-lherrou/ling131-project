rootworm and in this case ah I Believe the first documented or area of resistance to the courts have a herculean trade hey market you out in the combine today\nYes I Am as a matter of fact what's it look like out there up in what the ... area\nYes I'm In the northeast Iowa western part of rerun county which isn't the best ground in the county but ah honestly we've got the best deals we've ever had before so ah probably\nTen percent that is in our previous record which was last year congratulations that you we've had\nFour years in a row or successive years in a row where you just get a

is\nThis is a protein in the plant that I'm resist ... damage\nYeah I Can't tell you exactly how it works um but I Would say the the United States leaves the world and the production of crafty lawyers and if after twenty plus years they haven't been able to find a way to ah bring a successful lawsuit against biotechnology um\nThen maybe there just isn't anything wrong with it because you know there's enough people looking for something wrong with it it's ah all these trades all biotechnology who's been tested repeatedly and yet except for one recent jury decision in California\nUh there has not been anything wrong and I think that ... California will be probably overturned on because of ...\nYeah you're talking about the roundup case up there right\nYeah yeah like I said lots and lots of people have been looking for years to find something wrong with biotechnology and if we can't find that with all the lawsuit seeking lawyers in this country is it ever going to have\nYour basic basically did proteins in the plant naturally occurring proteins or a normal part of the plant that allow or disallow for different features and this involves turning on and off different proteins to ah create different in this case resistant varieties but\nUm you were talking about going back to insecticides what's the recommendation here because we don't want to wind up like the weed resistance to herbicides now right so you're talking about rotations and an insecticide and that type of thing\nYeah we can't do the exact same thing year after year\nAnd I know that's something that's ... ... ah yeah one round up soybeans yeah pretty much everybody pointed roundup soybeans and nothing else within a couple of years or we have to uh we have to bite the bullet and do the hard thing which means planting different ah products try different crops\nDifferent rotations or don't just by court after court after on and use the exact same few genetic tools that are supposed to or we don't have many how many weapons in our arsenal and we've just lost another one so we need the carefully take care of the ones we have left us\nBut come on mark the number one reason to do it that way if that's the way we've always done it right\nI Know I Know I uh well along those lines I Am a no till farmer and I think that I'm getting as good yields as my neighbors and spending\nLess money doing it nobody's beating the past my door to copy me on to write a because in large part the way it's always been done is you know but still it's how people are raised a I have a discussion with my father took years to get into agree to know too but um\nTwelve thirty I'm Wendy Wild W.
