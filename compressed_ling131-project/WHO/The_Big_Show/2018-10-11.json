the hour winds here Doug Cooper was markets Andy Peterson as well and we are talking numbers right now USDA report out\nAbout a thirty five minutes ago already Don rose and the telephone line with us us commodities in West Des Moines Don I'm a reading my uh Crayola scratching here that I was making on these numbers\nAnd a corn crop down\nA little bit was the first surprise I saw what do you think\nYeah you know most definitely Bob you know good morning but I think when you look at the report I think you can say it was really just kind of a relief for the people that were thinking big crops get bigger because\nIn this report the bottom line the yield went down six tenths of a Bush will break or that was a surprise in the report\nHistorically we have had a tendency to go up but not down so when you look at it from the demand side on the core it take export up Seventy five million did not make an adjustment for they do change and they eat Fifteen hopefully for the summer\nBut the bottom line is took ending sucked on corn only up thirty nine\nAnd two are still just over one point eight billion so that was a\nA bit of a surprise the beans I think it's more just a still a negative uh overall ending stocks but not as negative as the trade had feared and so we're getting a positive reaction took a harvested acres down six hundred thousand and the yield only up six tenths of a bushel so\nAh they left all of the demand side of it and change so uh that's where we're at in a production down just three million bushels\nYeah it's kinda crazy done that that would be record record soybean crop in terms of overall production but ah but yet somehow that's seen positively pie the market\nOut you know and I think it just tells us that Andy how are the futures market really works as we've had so much of this negative news already dialed and has been the pile on effect and you know it's that time of year where we've got that dialed in our midst as you know is going slow quality issues are out here\nAnd so the trade ... even though we're close to nine hundred million carry out which is just monstrous sounds like a core and carry out\nThe market does not want to press the downside particularly with the Chinese still actively buying soybeans in the world\nHey Don six hundred million drop in harvested acres in soybeans were were those acres go\nYeah good question most of those acres came from Kansas down or a hundred\nMillion I actually uh Iowa I think went up just a little bit but you know I think another surprise that they took I was yield uh from sixty to sixty one bushels an acre and we've got issues out here we are still harvesting the crop as you know\nStill harvesting you were to start\nDarted yet in the last report what Fifteen Percent Iowa harvest it so you know that's very much uncertain here when you hear some of the quality issues out here\nA Kansas I I think they're expecting some freezing weather here to the next day or two as far
