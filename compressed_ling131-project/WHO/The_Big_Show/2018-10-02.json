trade agreement that is not um place yet but the is headed that direction a probably sixty days away it looks like a right now at least up far anyway\nUm and uh we we've heard about the soybeans from Taiwan we've heard about uh the uh South Korea\nAh agreement that we've been working on n Japan as well I it's not the Trans Pacific partnership\nIt's a a bilateral agreement that will afford or the U.S uh all of the parts of the Trans Pacific partnership with Japan so a lot of trade announcements ah been impacting this market Don I guess we're still waiting for the big window to come in is not by far biggest trader because Canada\nIs our biggest trading but the waiting for the big ones come out of China right\nYeah you know a good morning I think that's exactly right what we're doing is at risk premium to the market for you know as we're talking about trade or continue to move in that direction that is more positive than negative\nOf course China the odd out here so far but I think that was the plan is eventually it kind of squeezed and eventually they come into some kind of a trade alliance but\nYou know let's just look at the month is the Tambor China's a imports of soybeans of all soybeans six point eight million metric tons versus a year ago six point four million metric tons so they really haven't slowed down they're buying pace from around the world is just been a dislocated and other traders of picked up ...\nYeah and other traders are picking up our beans too I think um at least we've talked about that right\nYeah oh most definitely I mean that's what's happened is a a a Brazil and Argentina both\nHave banned by being from the U.S and you know so far this week of course China's on holiday\nBut Brazil has two car goes offered for sale to China in Argentina's deep role so if you look at it usually about this time of year they're kind of sold out that China's coming to us to buy soybeans so I kind of in a little bit of a vice grip I think China is if they're going to continue their buying ways which\nUm you know you don't change diet that fast so you know I think it's the trade but I think it's also the weather and it's also the fact that the funds want to own a grain market here I think a bit like the livestock market and the seas now these the end of the week term positive on soybeans ...\nYeah and and I wanted to ask you about then maybe we'll

I. L. L. as to two hundred two hundred\nHours\nWell this is the big show coming up on the twelve Thirteen and we've been talking trade today\nAre caught up earlier this morning with our secretary of agriculture Sonny Perdue he's joining us right now on the big show joining us today we're talking trade secretary of agriculture Sonny Perdue is with us send a Mr Secretary welcome back to the big show number one\nNumber two we had been talking trade here over the last week and\nA lot of trade deals to talk about big one just yesterday we're all watching in as we heard about the U.S Mexico Canada free trade agreement bring us up to speed on that what it means for agriculture and how it might differ from the old NAFTA agreement\nOil went on to the wire the U.S embassy a new agreement is a great addition for us producers at a certainly from may restores a relationship with Mexico and even in ashes ocean for biotechnology in a sanitary sanitary purpose but\nIt better than that it gives us better access to the uh the Canadian market all and dairy and a poultry eggs and soil as our grading issue on the northern plains border so\nThis is good news it ah ah we're happy to have that put back together of the show NAFTA for agriculture and been a\nA view very favorably over the over the years except maybe in the\nSouth Florida and Georgia produce section but nonetheless people see it go away but I think this validates President Trump's uh ability to get a better deal that's exactly what he's done here and uh we're excited that it back together\nWell Mr Secretary and we're a corn beans catalogs strength so we understand about that now we we understand that there were some hang up the dairy so what changed on on the dairy front\nWell as you probably know and I've heard about the class seven mill Canada has a supply management system which are\nKind of on a quota almost like a peanut system used to be where uh the damn manner I have a limitation they get very high prices for a class of milk in fact their consumers by over six dollars a gallon for for fluent milk\nSo that consumers are supporting the daring men at a at a big a big pay\nIn Canada but what happened is they created a two tiered pricing system called class seven where they also allow their producers to produce for the world market which they dumped on the world market and depressed prices for our people so\nWe knew that had to go if they want to have a supply management system manages supply for Canadian consumers\nAnd don't affect what happens to us on international market that went away we get a better access on some of the cheeses and butters and other dairy products that way so it's an improvement I think again uh\nUh it restores many of the things that we had an improved dairy poultry access\nAnd gives us equivalency on grading on we are in the northern plains\nNot talk about a police for just a moment the time schedule now we understand there's a sixty day period there were going to be going through here before this actually takes effect\nThere will be it will be a it has to be announced the Congress signed and then announced the Congress the Congress obviously has to approve a the agreement and I'm I'm optimistic I was surprised there was that much concern about Congress approving approving\nA can't imagine anyone in farm country not approving this agreement it's better than will add in the original NAFTA is President Trump promised the only reason I can think that anyone wouldn't vote for this from an egg perspective is that uh\nThey just to make a political decision they don't want to sport and then President Trump does\nNow President Trump in his remarks when he was talking about this yesterday I talked about senator Joni Ernst and the crowd and said he was coming to Iowa was that he had a big announcement to make every one of the state thinks he's going to be talking to body Fifteen you got any insight on that\nWell I sure hope so we're going to be pulling for that and uh we've been talking to the president about the need for a year already Fifteen for months now and I think others have been talking to him so\nI'm hoping we don't want to presume that but uh because we've had so many fits and starts about that but I'm I'm hoping that we can expect an announcement very soon about eight Fifteen\nHounded announcement suit about a trade with China what what can you tell us\nWell again I think China is up to China what the president has done is called out China for their own unfair trade practices and agriculture from a protectionist standpoint\nBut also cheating on the world stage regarding intellectual property theft forced transfer and those kind of makes China's status strategy is do we take the United states economically and these growth high tech industries are the future including agriculture\nAnd a President Trump has been the first one to call them out on that the great thing is is that farmers understand that China had been playing fair that China has a a kept our products out in many places and ... other barriers to a non ... type of barriers to\nOur products over biotech products and other things like that and we would simply ask Janet the play fair\nAnd uh we could stop all these terrorists that China just agreed to play fair and to end up by by WTO and worldwide a a free trade agreements and that's the issue so\nI don't know we we're going to do the domino effect we've ... great chorus renewal that was good for American agriculture where you've got now the U.S MCA or a new NAFTA\nAnd we're having ... positive productive discussions with Japan\nAnd we're hopeful we can begin to discussion ... which also has some non tear trade barriers that we need to take away from a reduction of protectionist standpoint so and then hopefully China can come along and realize that President Trump is serious about protecting American Jobs protecting American farmers\nMr Secretary
