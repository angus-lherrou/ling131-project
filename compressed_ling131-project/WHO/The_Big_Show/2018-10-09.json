soybeans a Boston a few cents lower corn pretty quiet\nA what's so what's a moving or not moving market I guess right now\nWell you know I think the dominant issue or good morning first of all but I think the dominant issue has been this week it's been the weather\nAnd it's just been a a wet forecast well it looks like the end of the week here as we get closer to the weekend we have a cooler dryer for cats so it gives us the chance to get back in the field over a good portion of the corn belt so I think that is it and then also positioning for the crop report on Thursday\nExpected that to be applied area so that is also laying on the market so I think it's the one two punch here at the present time and it's harvest time\nYeah well yeah and we'd like to be participating more here in the state of Iowa in in that harbor so no no real concerns and they were getting a little late huh\n[noise] no I think there are a concern particularly when you get into a Iowa Minnesota\nUh some of those western corn belt um you know the Dakotas they're trying to harvest and they're talking about even four inches of snow here coming at us in short order so\nIt is a concern and I think it does bring up even when we get a you know the yield report coming out here in in the Thursday or is that going to be a solid reporter it'd be has some losses but afternoon expect corn and soybean harvest\nTo be somewhere around that thirty to thirty three percent done so you know we are marked in a long towards harvest than it does come out quick to get at it\nYou know done we're going to have a Charlie Herbert gone uh Iowa State professor in charge of the green quality in a city and he sent me a a report or our email here a week ago been trying to get him on we're going to have him on about an hour from now and he says that\nWe could have a mess out there if we don't start getting better weather\nWarning Doug yeah and I think that's right I Will be interesting to see once what he says because there's no doubt\nThat we have a lot of being in the field and that's a real issue is a absorbs moisture but then we have a an issue with the quality of the stock out here we'd happened it gets when\nI'm you know and it's just it's not a an ideal harvest situation so far so you know every year like we say you don't have it in the ... and then\nAnd in your mind you folks were being brought

for the producer when you have that you're now you're a big portion of the crop spill in the field and you know you're struggling so there's a lot of nervousness out here you know trust me no doubt about it but\nUm you know we'll get it out you know there's a it's just a matter of how timely but it you know I think it's more important when we look at this report on Thursday our weekend her we act to the report whether it's negative or positive betrayed definitely anticipating a negative report expecting bigger deal to half a Bush will hire are expecting\nProduction to go up you know around fifty million on corn and soybeans expecting to stock remember the uh the September one stocks were larger on both corn and being so this will be carried over in this report so\nExpect a supply

day\nHanging out on the get by with faith today and my goal is the guy that puts all this together biggest one Mike a lot of people here it looks pretty impressive\nYeah it's been a great turnout um we have two hundred Seventy seven companies here which is are actually ties are larger than ever and he had a fake in this economy and and such that that's just the credits are students have programs here but yeah we're beyond grilled outside of the weather we're beyond thrilled to have 'em all these companies here\nHopefully didn't deter the these students and it's too much but last year we had about twenty five twenty six hundred students from a lot of different schools here so knock on wood the next five hours do pretty well for us well that's what I was\nGoing to say is with us together and the value of life sciences but it really extends campus wide which is the\nIt did extend kept quiet I think\nCal says about twenty five or forty six majors and last year we had Seventy two majors go through it from Iowa State alone but we had students from\nEighteen other schools here and I actually had a girl to call me from\nMississippi State about three weeks ago can I come to the event or like absolutely it's open the public but it's always interesting\nTo see where these kids are coming from in terms of other schools out there which again\nTo be vying for the event\nNow what are you hearing in terms of a challenge of employment wise from the people here you know um I\nHaven't heard a lot which is which is surprising I think the bottom line is is that good talented people especially in the egg industry will always be in high demand um what's interesting here today is that we've got\nProbably thirty five brand new companies that are here for the first time and so\nThat's still you know extending when I mentioned before in terms of the demand for talent out there so\nDespite the economy despite the tariffs implications fighter planes going on out there\nIt's a good success story yeah\nSuccess story and I'm just like the tough times that they mentioned although you know we keep hearing about large fields prices maybe down the Bush will make up for it this industry continues to get better at a at what they do\nWhich is amazing considering\nThey've always been the best anyway we ... a leader in the world to start with\nYeah it's not surprising that people are just driven that way you know we want to take it from good degrade really really quickly there but bottom line is is um\nHaggis pretty top heavy and boomers right then and it's just a great area for young people to be in and so they're they're always going to be a high demand\nSo we've been talking about that for a while would be an aging population via the any shift in that or is the continuing to get older here and\nYou know some young people get in and then the other direction for one way shape or one reason one way shape or\nForm right that's a good question and he and he and we've been talking about it for a decade now and you know maybe it only when everything came in and it it had a ... retirement strategy there but we're starting to see more of it will see a lot of companies that are here\nWe may not have an open physician what we want to get ... and when it does happen [noise]\nOff those students go\n... years out there so um I think\nWith the strongest economy in the last five years\nWe're going to start to see these people\nDefinitely access the workforce there you know and and the other challenge to people are working longer living longer than working longer what am I going to do in retirement\nThere's been a little bit of a bottleneck there but I think as I mentioned before with the economy picking up\nI Would hope to start to see that exit of a lot of boomers out of there\nI don't share that you need to be industry by the way it might be more common in this industry but boy I don't know you guys have got an ... year Mike ... are you going to get any bigger it looks like your butt on his face\nEvery year the thinking of how you get the last year number we got room to grow here um [noise] but see I'm not be totally I mean to get the two

the market's coming up Andy is back on the road he's a headed over to the um [noise]\nRally and an announcement we're going to be a we're thinking about any where we're going to be hearing from the president a little bit later on today well on the telephone line right now with us is dawn Carlson and a dawn is um with the president and CEO petroleum marketers and convenience stores the bio where she's been on the big show with us\nBefore dawn I I think the last time we talked we were talking\nAbout a Fifteen and how the uh folks you represent would like to see a Fifteen year round looks like a today is is gonna be the day it\nThat way by but this is a pretty exciting news for us I'm no can't say I can and the president for you know following through on his promises and we believe that if that came as a promising fuel for the future and his announcement should\nTake away one of the barriers\nUm to the growth of the Fifteen there's really three three hurdles out there for us to grow the fifteenth sales and certainly taking away them yeah waiver requirement I Would be a help in that manner\nOkay let me ask you know you're going to be down this road ah there's three barriers so one one of them is proving it a year round what's the what's the other two barriers\nWell the um the most important launch our membership and that is um the retailers and the state of Iowa\nIs having the um required infrastructure and equipment in place that compatible the Fifteen today only Fifteen Percent of the equipment statewide is actually I'm certified as compatible safely board\nAnd then he Fifteen and higher when I Apologize for the background noise here [laughter]\nNo you're you're doing fine you you you caught my interest here a Fifteen Percent you say of the equipment out there is qualified that that seems like a a low number to me and my ...\nIt's a terribly low number and so that's why programs like the Iowa renewable fuels infrastructure program that helps to\nInvest in this aging infrastructure and make sure that we have grants available to help people upgrade their equipment is just so critical to the growth of the Fifteen I'm leaving that a lot and helping a retailers and station upgrade their equipment for this new fuel um\nIt requires a different type of um compatibility different from each ten so we have to make sure that\nPiping the tanks the dispensers\nRight down to them the steals the gas because everything has to you all certified or the higher blends of ethanol and\nIf we don't do that and there was a big chance that you know we could have an equipment failure and they could be you know and it's a decision of contaminated environment which none of us one where we're all for environmental protection which are about consumer protection so making sure that we have the right infrastructure and placed the ... a chain is very very important\n... how can we move forward\nWell it it is going to check investment um you know most of the location that deli that chain today are new a location new equipment new installation so we have a lot of independently owned businesses out there in\nA rural areas and even in the cities that are going to need some assistance in order to be able to upgrade their equipment and be up for this with deal\nSo that helped me out here a door and by the way we're talking with dawn Carlson dawn as president and a CEO and she's with the petroleum marketers and convenience stores are violent other words or your the people that are dispense a fuel\nUm help me out here with a with the ... the uh the announcement deny it itself or is it ah what what kind of mark is going to open up I mean is it a big deal ah or do we need to other things first\nWell if it is a big deal because I'm allowing each Fifteen to be sold year round legally is one of the three critical you know coming right now\nWe're only selling about twenty seven million gallons and eat the teen a year that's out of about what an ... billion gallons of gasoline and we have a long ways to go and there's a great opportunity to stop Maurice Fifteen and and certainly being able to sell it in the summertime will be helpful but I'm\nHonestly that's not going to move the needle until we get all of this equipment and dispensers upgraded so that you know we can actually dispensed that legally\nNow what what what was the third leg of the stool here that we need to fix up here the\nWell we used to leave 'em consumer protection must be a priority in offering any fuel including the Fifteen and I'm oddly enough eat Fifteen is the only field product out there that is required to have a warning label on it um there's an EPA warning labels that is required\nOn every dispenser that offering me Fifteen and it's it's a learning to consumers that they need to be evaluating their vehicle um you Fifteen to only be used ... thousand and one\nAnd they were um passenger V. O. worked like a vehicle so not every vehicle is compatible with it at some point you know when all the older the vehicles are off the road I'm sure the warning labels probably go away but um you know consumers need to know what they're filling up\nA and having a Fifteen ... they know what the product is and whether or not it's compatible with their equipment is really important so you know our organization really value is your choice we want them to have options\nWe value the quality of fair competition rumor and environmental protection and innovation and certainly consumer protection the labeling aspect\nIs very important um environmental protection and having the right equipment available to spend the Fifteen it's critical so you know those three elements I'm I think we're on the right path to get you know expanded sales of e Fifteen and it\nWon't dog you hang on because I got another question or two for you but right now we need to stop what we're doing and give some folks the chance to put a grand in their hand above [noise]\n\nTwo hundred two hundred is the number text bank be eight in pay\nOur confirmation or messages\nAbout that or we love the brand in your hand up there on Carlson is with us here we're moving along with the big show we expect an announcement in fact we've been kinda tipped off to the ... going to happen a little bit later about an hour and a half right now\nThat we're going to get to the president's going to announce it or he is asking\nThe EPA to approve year round sales of e Fifteen and dogs are kind of our uh contact we use a was the folks that are out there every day selling this uh this stuff for the convenience stores across state of Iowa\nThey Don this is Doug um are there any financial incentives for all employees that are can be used to love Rudy infrastructure\nYes actually there is a infrastructure grant program with the state of Iowa that retailers can apply for cost sharing brand up to as much as fifty thousand dollars per facility and it's in some cases you know it's going to cost two or three times is to upgrade all of the dispensers and and equipment but every bit helped\nUm so that's money that comes up for renewal or consideration by the legislature every year and it's part of a program that we've been supportive of troops for many years\nIt's twelve thirty I'm ...\nW.

initiative at Iowa State university and Charlie you sent me an email message that if the weather like this continues we could be in a real mess or were you in a real mess\nWell we're headed that way I'm afraid because with all this rain a corn corn and beans both are drawing down but they're probably getting wetter\nAnd the chances go up deadly of having moles feel law along with that which will make storage into the winter next summer\nMore complicated are really concerned about stock or are you hearing a lot of uh instances of that\nVery many uh as as the as the wet weather drags on a more and more stocks fall down because of the poor stock health so yeah definitely\nWhat about the mold or ... or anything you can do\nNot a whole lot specially if you can harvest\nA not a whole lot but once we get back in the field one it will be important or farmers to to look at some ears and and take a look at what kind of mold is out there if any uh to determine if there may be a toxin issue or not\nUh once you get back in the field we don't want to be holding the sweat corn law or in wet holding bans are on wagons or whatever it will spoil much more rapidly\nThan we would then we would normally experience we want to be drying it as quickly as possible if we can't dry it such as an air dry been which is probably not going to do too well in this kind of weather\nAre the key will be getting a cold and and I think we'll have a chance or for that we're supposed to get to freezing on Wednesday and Thursday and friday of every fan in Iowa should be on a during that period of time to get as much of the screen cold as cold cash as possible\nWhat's the what what it would be the ideal temperature\nWe'd like to get below forty or I don't know that will do that when might depending on the two points we might we'd like to get it yeah at least in the forties at least in the forties uh it's been warm and wet reasonably warm for this type time of year\nAnd those were the conditions that generally reduce the old mold and the toxin issue\nHey Charlie this Bob um we we hear these guys are when they're looking at this stuff ah they're putting the black light on there what what are they ah what what did they ... what do they see and when they put that trend that black ...\nWell a a a blue green glow under a black light is somewhat correlated with F. we'll talk personally I don't think we'll have very many Affleck box and problems this year so I don't think the black light is going to show us much\nUh but but there is some correlation between the glow under the black light\nAnd the presence of Africa and it's not that high but at least it gives you an idea of whether or not the riskiest there for ... which is what I think we'll have the most problem with the black light doesn't do any\nSo how do you determine that\nThe only way it can be done is with a sample and with a strip test a which I'm fairly certain feed males an ethanol plant if they aren't already we'll be doing at least on a composite sample half a day basis or something like that\nTo determine if the corn in their area\nMight have a bomb a toxin problem there is no rapid way to tell if you use the mole that looks like kind of a white cheat on top of the car from the tip on down\nThat that ... that can produce bottom I talk to them and so that's kind of a tipoff that maybe maybe it ought
