is our time you'll want to go to the van and body Facebook page today to find out why Bonnie came in while I was conducting an interview of the guests demanded a take off my shoe in my pocket and she take a picture of my barefoot that actually did happen\nWithin the last two hours and you will find out why if you go to the antibody Facebook page also and Danny Bonnie this morning they got the chance to talk to Newt Gingrich and that is in advance of his appearance\nHere in Des Moines October Fifteen to be exact\nAn evening with Newt Gingrich it is being brought to you by our friends are burned Alvin WHM radio your co hosts will be Simon Conway\nAs well as Lee Habib a Newt Gingrich will be there he will be speaking on politics and patriotism and then and Bonnie this morning took advantage of the opportunity to speak to Newt Gingrich to ask him about his thoughts on what I call the Kavanaugh chaos here\nIs what former Speaker Gingrich had to say to van and Bonnie\nSenator Grassley has been\nJust a tower of string heaters applied everything you learned over the years you brought tremendous experience to this a very challenging moments\nAnd I think he he did it with dignity and he did it no way that are really sort of help preserve the system so I Know my hat's off to a truck grossly for quite a remarkable job with it well I\nI I don't I don't think we know yet ah I just did a Facebook why that is that over a million two hundred thousand views on on destroying Kevin on destroying America\nAnd and I made the case they're under my Facebook love that uh would which people can access with Facebook\nThat um the level to which are the Democrats want him to things like a smearing him making things up several hours or days where they went from very concerned about accusations of\nSexual behavior when it began to be obvious with the FBI would not corroborate that they switched over to his drinking habits and when that was a working as switched over to his temperament and that was just this this endless\nYou know I really I guess I've never seen maybe it was judge for many years ago and I don't remember ever seeing the level of viciousness\nImagine all for all of our listeners imagine yeah two young daughters\nThey really look up to you you have a nice family of presidents they ask you if you want to do something to serve country\nAnd then you get this kind of a really mean spirited dishonest personal attack\nI think that's going to last a good well as I've talked to Senator Lindsey Graham about it he thinks is\nTo take years for the Senate to recover from some of the scars to prove that this is going to produce and speaking to that point some of the scars this is going to produce we see evidence of this even as I speak so this morning\nThe Senate took a cloture vote that means we want to move a closed debate on judge Kavanaugh's nomination moved to the actual nomination vote which will take place we understand tomorrow [noise]\nA Jeff Flake voted yes and now there is a protest at his office of the capital in which the police are involved now think about that why is that happening it is because last week\nJeff Flake announced that he was going to vote for judge Kavanaugh to get him out of the Senate Judiciary committee he was confronted by two women at an elevator we now know that those women are part of a George Soros funded liberal group and they yelled at him\nAnd then he said okay I'm going to vote to advance judge Kavanaugh out of the Judiciary Committee but I Want a week's delay while the FBI investigates these allegations and there were some that believe that the reason he did that was he was so shook up\nBy the two women yelling at him at the elevator I don't think so I said on Monday on this program he wants to run for president\nBut because that impression was given now he voted yes on culture and I believe the yes on the nomination tomorrow people believe that if they get violent in his office that maybe they can shake him up one more time and he'll vote no tomorrow that's what Newt Gingrich I think is saying\nWhen he talks about some of the scars this is going to produce you have every right in this country\nWhere we have free speech and we do not get penalized for free speech to protests and speak uh your your your are your views\nBut if if bullying and intimidation and borderline violent action\nIs rewarded if people think it's gonna work then yeah there there's a there's a tradition that's been set now there is a precedent set and you get mob rule and so I think this is one of the things that\nThe Republicans have to contemplate carefully\nWhich is if you were able to get judge Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court\nAnd there was indeed a backlash against the Democrats this fall and the election that is there would be no blue wave in in fact the Democrats don't claim the majority in the U.S house I don't think they have a chance in the U.S said it they think they have a chance to the U.S house\nBut if they didn't get it wouldn't that send a message that there is a a bridge too far for our activism and I say this both on Republicans and Democrats\nAre in regard new uh exercising a right to free speech I don't believe in showing up outside somebody's house I don't care if they're Republican or Democrat\nAnd yelling at them I don't believe in chasing people from restaurants I don't think we should do that I don't believe\nThat we should be screaming in people's faces trying to intimidate them and that's what it is it isn't like let's have a discussion where I tried to persuade you to both my way this is intimidation this is bowling does this harassment\nAnd we can't reward that\nThat's ultimately where I think that the ... the Republicans at least to contemplate this is the vote tomorrow and the vote for judge Kavanaugh is not set Susan Collins\nIs going to announce her final decision this afternoon if she says she's no\nThen that puts joke Democrat Joe Manchin as the fiftieth vote and what Democrat wants to be the fiftieth vote if he says oh well there are no to you don't have a justice Brett Kavanaugh\nPicture is going to become much more clear at two o'clock Iowa time this afternoon when Senator Collins announces their decision I'm Jeff St Angelo that's what you need to know\n[noise] the only way to do go on and I arch radio

and it was just starting to get cloudy it was a cool day day before that was really hot so I guess we're trying to wedge things in when we can so how's this ... of corn coming out of the field here\nWell absolutely it's coming out dry as as can be the currents coming out on the average is sixteen five and they were talking about a hundred and twelve decor and so we're really pleased about the moisture probably should have been coming out awhile ago with the weather just wouldn't let us\nYeah that that's kind of over here and to ... it'd be noticed even kicking around some here and see if you had any stock ride or any problems like that\nYeah you walk through the ... the plots can kind of tell which ones have got a little issue a lucky for most everybody that the winds have kept away and and there I was afraid about the rain and wind last night but there are things stand up pretty well we're not missing anything\nRag up some of this uh whistles a stand ability though because uh I drove a between aims then I took dirt roads all the way over to the ... by north of ... and there are some corn looked pretty paltry out there this ... looks like a standing pretty
