I'm In such a big hurry and you to talk to Charlie I thought it was time to talk to Charlie a diagnosis here right now I'm going to have to be embarrassed and say gee done\n[laughter] I don't know is that a compliment down it's probably from it and I'm trying to find a way to get out of it make it sound like it was Tom [noise] good good to talk to you Don I Know you're going to be just awful busy in their\nMid life going on in fact this is of interest to you I'm sure when we visit with Charlie little later on how much impact of all this harvest the problems uh is uh in the market right now\nWhere you know I think that's what it was all about yesterday I think the kind of hits the concern panic button after the shorts and I think it's a fun shorts yesterday or the funds just got caught leaning the wrong way with that\nToo much of the crop in in the field that fund fought Eighteen thousand contracts and soybeans\nYesterday and they're still short Fifteen thousand you know supply side of the market just flat parish\nAh we have quality in a yield issues out here in the service is the uh since Nineteen eighty seven we only had one other year with us for harvest and that was two thousand nine and I only at night ... percent harvest the smallest on record on soybeans so\nThat's really it that's right what gave us depressed the upside\nYeah I remember two thousand nine pretty well done and that it was in the December before we got during that year that was just because of a slow maturing crop of cooler year this year has been just the opposite faster maturing crops followed by the slowest like harvest ever it's just been nuts\nNo it really has been and I think the market when you had a you know the phones pressed than this\nIt's just another great example of a of a one of our our latest you're good good for him to reward recipients and folks that are doing the right so you're the show today so I'll tell\nYou still give me a ... about thirty seconds on the importance of pork production talking pork roosters\nWell absolutely I mean my goodness I was number one and pork production by far and and uh\nYou know we talk a lot about hey where's Iowa was placed in the world in terms of agriculture all about value added agriculture right so we're ... we lead the nation and corn and soybean production but it's what we do with that corn and soy that makes us different right we feed that into something that adds value\nEither an ethanol plant or about diesel plant or feed it to livestock and make protein and here's a great example were very efficient at it very very good at it and we get a chance to export that pork around the world as well so critically important to our economy\nYeah we're sitting here Mike in a country where there is an ethanol plant down Eddie vale which is probably what thirty miles away or last year and there was a A R had require you turned by there's a few grinding right so there there used to in in ... so we're we're just eaten up everything we grow out\nThat's right and I thought of that very thing when we came by that feed that female I'd been down for the grand opening of that several years ago and just again think about the the corn that gets pulled into that that facility and we're taking that commodity agriculture\nTurning into something with higher value added jobs back to our economy value back to our economy and then we use that domestically we exported around the world\nNow you farm up in the cylinder saying stay up north north of the cylinder saying or is it the cylinder saying we're talking about an area and so under the drains fairly well uh have you been in the field\nHigh water table to uh we have them but it's been it's been a slow go and uh you know like much of the state but we've been what we were what the beginning we're right in the middle and we're ... we got the snow over the past week in six months prior to that we'd had a blizzard up and and uh the springs cylinder area of the middle of April it's been a real challenge so\nWe've not turned a wheel on soybeans yet and we're about ten percent done on corn so we've got a lot of work yet to do I think I think we're I think we're trying to roll today\nYou know normally this time of year we're sitting at a at least according to your office yes fifty percent of the soybeans are out of the ground\nThat's right and we ... we had a a you know it was challenging week right so I think we only ended up moving about one percent on soybeans last week Nineteen percent were eleven days behind the average corn we harvest it two percent of the crop up to I think Seventeen percent or something there about\nA now and so obviously behind now for days behind the average uh so again as folks get out there is a great to see the sun today over much of the state\nGot to get some temperatures especially drive those beans down I Know I'm here in quite a bit about that and concerns about high moisture beans and the challenge there but ah hopefully this week we're going to get around here to to get back in the field\nWell we uh I had a a lesson here on uh the basics of it's only by a reactor yes from Jim yeah and and that's that's a that's way cool stuff to see that going on here in the state of Iowa these guys are taking a that to clean water initiative a kind of [noise]\nRight right they're run by the horns and putting it in practice on his part\nThey are and this is a great example of you know\nWe've been doing conservation work in the state of Iowa for decades but this fire after concept that you just talked about this was something that was developed just in the last couple of years\nAnd it was developed right here in Iowa and so we also ... every time I think by reactor or or saturated buffer I'm reminded of the fact that we haven't learned the last thing that we're ever going to learn about water quality in the state\nAnd that we're leading the way in innovation right here in Iowa so critically important to have research done at Iowa State university and then to be able to get that practice on the ground out here like Jim did last year and be able to learn more from that process\nYeah it's it is it's it's rewarding and we're in an area that is one of the leaders in a cover crop yeah as where am I going to take a break here for news copy our when we come back to visit more with our working good foreign neighbor award winners we're headed for a guy with ...

Iowa today one hundred and forty first presentation of the working farm neighbor award we're gonna talk coming up a little bit about what's going on and what's not happening\nI guess and I was soybean fields in particular about Fifteen minutes your dogs going to take a look also and what's going on with the markets right now by putting here on the big show\nRight Bob thank you very much and let's do just that markets of course brought to us\nBy champions seed to seed company for\nEveryday champions and want to run down some livestock market information right now\nThe prior day hog report all the information was compiled and released this morning on yesterday's parade Seventy two hundred and eighty negotiated purchase barrels and guilt son the carcass basis\nRanging fifty four to sixty one weighted average fifty nine Ninety eight fifty six cents down\nLives sales yesterday total only four hundred and forty three headed price range forty three and a half to forty eight and a half\nFor the weighted average forty six Thirteen\nTwo dollars and thirty cents down\nThis morning's number two thousand and eighty five price range fifty four to sixty one weighted average carcass bases sixty fourteen sixteens and fire\nLives sales this morning four hundred and Eighteen but not enough backers were involved there to report prices\nPork ... cut out on a Tuesday eighty one dollars Ninety five cents forty five cents higher on the two hundred and five ... carcass fifty three fifty four percent lean\nBox beep choice to all five thirty to a dollar\nMake that two oh five thirty to fifty two cents higher select one Ninety two eighty four Ninety five cents higher the spread between those two twelve dollars and forty eight cents\nNow let's take a picture of what we have going on in cattle country a fairly quiet in let's say a\nMid day just a few scattered bids were noted in parts of Nebraska asking prices are not established but Packer inquiry they thought should start to improve over the next day or so having said that\nSignificant trades I Am probably delayed until the second half of the week\nBe cut out so I'm giving you that information light to moderate box movement noted to de twelve Nineteen almost twelve twenty on the big show clock that she'll look good markets markets of course are brought to you by champions see\nStrong harvest happened long before the combines role don't just raise corn raise the bar playing champion fitness stronger\nLet's look at some more world whether information recent precipitation activity has delayed the harvest for canola in the Canadian breweries a drier cold weather pattern at this time may help improve ...\n... letting open and falling on the ground so the longer we go the more the field deterioration will occur\nYou know we haven't talked much about soybean problems with mold in the past or can they developed toxins like corn\nNot generally uh the fungi is is that an attack\nOr soy beans in the field don't produce toxins and normally we don't have this problem at all most of the time we're talking about soybeans being too dry that is splitting and the and combine and shattering in the field and so forth this is the first year in quite a\nWhile that we've had wet soybeans in the field to have a whole different set a shoo\n[noise] hey Charlie Sandy the crop report this week mentioned slowest harvest uh since they've been keeping records ... how long they've been doing that\nI don't I heard the same report you did a but I don't know how long that is but it's obviously longer than I've been here and at at Iowa State and I'm not going to tell you how long [laughter]\nI Know [laughter] yeah I Do\nWell you Doug said the same thing and I said so it started in the days of the stone tablets and the two of those I guess we've got that wrote down a little bit um wet soybeans out there well\nWhere did you don't need to dry amateur needed to get here running through money a harvest what do you have to do\nWell the best way of course this air typical air and October\nWill dry corn or soybeans down to twelve to Thirteen percent equilibrium about that\nAnd if we get basically typical air from here on out then air dry then we'll take it down effectively that's the best way I noticed that today for example were fifty degrees and the two point is thirty six that's pretty good\nAh that's pretty decent drying air condition or that's the best oh we can use high temperature dry or have to limit the air temperatures to about a hundred and twenty or a hundred and thirty they tend to split\nAnd health come off and furthermore a with gas flames and burners are we always have the fire hazard with so I'll be there in oil seed and dryer fires are a lot more common with soy\nMhm so are you seeing some of the sprouting in India so you recommend going out and harvesting here or what the forecast sounding dry maybe a letting Mother Nature help you out some\nI I wouldn't leave him in the field and how we're losing a beans to the ground right along the swelling and shrinking of of being wet and add a little bit drier and and then the swelling of sprout I I wouldn't leave them in the field at all",
