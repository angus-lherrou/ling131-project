and uh we're in line before eight am yesterday the rally started at six thirty PM do we make sure they got into the arena I talked to some other folks who yeah who had been in line for a couple of hours I had probably a couple of hours more to go and we're\nPretty convinced at that point they probably wouldn't even get into the arena given the number of seats and how long the line was in mid

couple of folks that were peddling some trunk Trump merchandise\nBefore we got in the arena and it's like a rock concert but it in a way or in several ways it was now the doors opened at three thirty times you'd when I went in a while I went in and the secret door to I went in about that same time and then came back out to check on the line and talked to some of those folks\nAnd then went back in

would attach more evenly I guess to distribute the uh the force of of pulling on rather than just the actual out yeah um\nSo that's got a United says something about what you were talking to the tires earlier this morning right and a lot of switching going\nOn yeah big floaters or talk to my buddy Scott Sloan who was an engineer with the gang from tightened and he said yeah he said they're having a lot of inquiry on their uh their floaters right and why wouldn't you I mean look after you had a piece of ... of pictures you show me yesterday of them combined go into the field pushing waves up\nYeah and the and the tractor and that\nThat may have been for a fact but at what point is is that it's been real wet out there hey we'll talk more about that coming up we've got Tom pits Myron telephone line with us right now ah and ah Tom as our market analyst with the gang narrative someone commodity brokerage and Tom pills my mailbox up every morning with his newsletter and I was reading this morning\nAnd a time one of the things you were a a talk a little bit about was the percentage of crop harvested not only here in the state of Iowa but all across the Midwest so in the back of your mind Tommy or are you worried about how our getting this crap out of the field\nBut if you're a farmer\nAnd get his crop artist I think there's a lot of reason to be on her yeah yeah in terms of market I mean I have ever had a year when the crop doesn't get harvesting well at a point that doesn't have that much effect on the big picture\nEspecially especially in Maine where we've got such a huge carry out anyway I and I understand if it's your farm and their shattering and all the other stuff that goes goes along with this ... whether it is a problem but I'm not sure and the big picture it's that big a deal that gas\nWell now here here's a question of the day our soybeans are taken a hit right now what's pushing this market so so much lower\nWell I think there's a perception that Mars report is gonna is gonna show on ... number one you're going to have a job because of that the stocks record at the end of the month you're going to jump carry out and number two I think the perception is going to bomb the ills of Bush will there too so\nYou're you're potentially looking at a carry out in the nine hundred million bushels area was so I don't know it's kinda hard to get excited about the market especially since we've rallied a quite a bit I edited report here so\nI I guess I'm not at all surprised to see a little profit they can even end up at the Morrow\nAnd I think his corn crops going to get a little more a how shall we say robust in the report tomorrow is well\nNow that's the perception I just I'm not so sure about that I ... up to this point the people that have harvest it being almost every one of them goes holy smokes\nThose are great I've got great ... they don't hear that so much from from guys harvest in car and it's a little more variable and some good not so good and so I guess I'm not sure you know there's a tendency historically one increase ill from August South Park that increase again from set in October\nI so I think that's what a lot of people are going on I guess I'm not convinced that it's going to happen that are like\nI'll tell you what I'm going to wrap up with you here and talk to you about an hour and ten minutes to get some

[noise]\nHey coming up and eleven fifty two here on the big show well are are friends with a titan tired do a a fabulous event to raise awareness and some funds for a cancer research is called the ride for the cure it's held in Des Moines been doing it for a couple three years now\nAnd uh the event is going to be held this weekend however the headline is the events going to be moved it's usually over water works park and Casey Powell who heads up that have been with uh tightened the ride for the cure coordinators and the telephone line with me\nRight now so a case of rap to move the event where where are we going to move to win and then we'll talk a little bit more about the event but where's the the new location\nLocation is going to be your your iron our parking lot which is a twenty three forty five ... street here in Des Moines\nOkay and for folks to a maybe a unfamiliar with how to get down a down there a that a new MLK extension that goes from downtown out to the fairgrounds you can take a turn off of that and you're almost right on top of titan\nThat's exactly right you have east on him up and then north on ... street and then back west on market you'll be right\nYeah that'll save me from rattle rambling your teeth over a lot of those railroad tracks do exactly right then and there yeah so and that that's the way to go in fact I if I Need to sneak out to the fairgrounds of course I'm a kill everybody my secrets now\nAnd I won't be able to do that anymore but if I had to study from here at the fairgrounds quick I take that a MLK route 'cause it dumped me off or get a T sections up there on thirtieth\nYou see on each thirtieth and you just take a left that he's thirty thing go right up over the bridge into the back door the fairgrounds so\nI'm a ... back to what we're talking about here Casey we're talking about this ride for the cure event so what what what are the times a day\nOr for for the event will be eleven three and that is that Saturday Saturday okay\nSo Saturday eleven to three uh folks were planning on doing that and I I'd say it's a lot of fun to bring kids out there we had uh what's his face painting and you had some pumpkins they're used decorating ... as I remember last year and a car shows car show going to make a do over there you think\nI sure hope so we're planning on\nGood good deal is that so that's fun stuff look at a and a ... even had day a in a couple of old tractors pulling people around all Iraq rides\nIt was a lot of fun for for everybody and we sure appreciate you doing that and hope to send a lot of folks over in the gang from tightened so again or you're going to be set up their lead them to three on Saturday and it's going to be right in the parking lot there tighten tire\nYes sir alright well hey Casey thanks talked a little bit today thank you very much you bet that's Casey pow Casey a heads up\nThe ride for the cure he is the coordinator with the a ferocious tightened tire so yeah uh normally this time of year we don't talk a lot about flooding and I know it can happen any time I understand that but we don't talk about and that's usually springtime event there and water works but a high water\nHas a move that around over there well they mentioned the Andy is in the house with us today and we are enjoying his company if he just ah maybe would have brought doughnuts it would've been a big day here in the fire department but he uh\nHe failed Jake chime in and he failed to do that so we we may not have him here with us a whole lot of time and the main studio but I'm Andy is back from a big time event yesterday\nOr out to a Council Bluffs them in American Center and the big ag announcement with the effort to now underway in order to allow you Fifteen sales across all fifty states\nA year round which you know what's gonna happen Bob is is this going to mean once it's all said and done in were five years down the road will just mean that each ten will basically become a thing of the past maybe\nPossibly ever thought about that I guess um maybe maybe blender pumps or we'll see but that's nice\nPlaces don't have to carry Fifteen just because it's mandated right oh they don't but it is cheaper there'll\nBe an economic incentive to do it and of course we do know that most consumers by on price first and foremost at all but most do um so anyway it's a long process but what are the things that I noticed on the way over the council bluffs and this would have been\nPicture perfect had I been able to take one and I remember yesterday raining and there was a half combined feel the corn\nThere was a time next to the standing corn and there were ducks out there swimming on the ... yeah in the field of cordon that had yet to be combine that that is just the perfect description as a matter of how this has gone\nI don't know if there are any or herbicides or you can put in corn and beans cleared for little iPads I don't know uh we we may have to duck we'd [laughter]\nI've I have my I I Will say at the duck wages in one side of my pond is so sick he can probably walk across it and so ah but yeah I'm a good point there there's a lot of water\nRight now I also like I Can't imagine that we need to stress safety as part of this and uh you know once the conditions get back to being fit\nUh there's going to be a lot of activity and there maybe some of it's it's a little unconventional loading of semis on the road with the wet conditions we talked about the four wheel drive tractor hooked on to the semi early early they may just not be able to get into the field so it may mean some more obstacles for vehicles\nWouldn't be the way that the producers would like to do it but it may be the only option giving me the tough conditions
