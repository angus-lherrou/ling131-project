H. already news Taiwan buying more soybeans\nA new better deal that replaces NAFTA\nThat is really that has huge implications for the message that the Republicans can bring to an agricultural state like Iowa and that's trouble for the Democrats you know that the Democrats going to do very well this fall in the concentrated urban areas where there's a lot of liberalism\nIn the college towns you know that they're not going to do very well in the rural areas and that gap is going to grow because of this economic new so we're Democrats want to make up the rural gap is in the traditionally Republican suburbs they hope to make inroads\nIn the suburbs of Des Moines and other urban areas\nTo try to make up for how badly they are starting to lose in the rural area\nBut I'm telling you one of the big issues of the fall is is that going to be enough you would expect your statewide candidate your state wide democratic candidate to win in the urban areas in the college towns\nAnd their ... and there are on the verge of losing big time in the rural areas particularly as the economic news gets better\nSo in the suburbs yes maybe they are making inroads but enough to make up for the huge gap\nIn the rural areas I don't know I don't know this this uh this economic new with all the talk about judge Kavanaugh that's justifiable\nThat that affects the ideology of the U.S Supreme Court for years this economic news is also gigantic it has huge implications for the fall election as Republicans can now go to the farmers in the rural areas and go look it's working we are winning again are

probably back that off another ten to Fifteen Percent and uh you know that sixty ... all these probably going to be in that Patrick grounded enough to completely different way to price ground but

Rosen a telephone line with us national pork producers council\nJim a big news in the marketplace or found out about I guess late last night\nIs that the um the U.S Canada and Mexico apparently have come to an agreement on is no longer called NAFTA no longer called the north American free trade agreement to a but it is a trade deal between the three countries and pork producers in particular are kinda celebrating today right\n[noise] absolutely it's a it's a good timing for national pork month I don't know if you knew that Bob but October is national pork months so we\nWe've started off with a bang this agreement and we're really happy about that um there's obviously been a lot of uncertainty around trade with our North American trading partners and I think\nWith this agreement we've obviously eliminated a lot of that uncertainty\nNow you mentioned in a um a notes you sent me that uh uh we now have zero tariffs access to three of the top five markets for us pork I I mean that I I guess alone is pretty big headline\n[noise] yeah that and that refers to are the formal signing last week of a modernized free to rent free trade agreement with South Korea\nUh and that preserves zero tariffs access to that market which is are based on numbers last year it was our fifth largest market [noise]\nAnd then with Mexico and Canada a number one and number four on that list of export markets um but we don't we you know we we we still have a little ways to go before it's implemented the the the new pact that is the framework for the new pact that has been put in place does\nA includes zero tariffs access and it sure is that for the long term for us so that's great news\nNow the uh as far as the timeline goes here that the reason we're talking about it today and you say there's there's time\nIs that a Congress I Believe has to ratify the new U.S MCA is what is called I'm going to say that NAFTA was kind of float off your tongue a little bit I guess we can\nUse YMCA um [laughter] it was referred to it now yeah not not the it is and you you're right not real catch you with us or MCA soldiers a what a sixty day waiting period then is that that is that the deal a jak\n[laughter] yeah I ... I I I think it's hard to to to know exactly what it will be implemented I I Would imagine I'm if I had to guess who you know it will be sometime next year I don't I don't think it will be um take it up any sooner than the next Congress a but we'll be watching closely we we plan on\nUm [noise] you know handling this as a as a key vote for our members meaning we're going to be watching\n'em you know how what kind of support we see from members of Congress on this deal and making sure that our members have clear line of sight in an an yes or no votes we uh we think it makes sense for pork and all of agriculture so were were urging Congress to ratify as soon as they can\nYeah I got a note here from US Senator Joni Ernst ... office or out of Iowa and uh she's talking about this and said uh\nUh one one of the highlights she says that Canada will eliminate its class seven program for ... I Know that's not your you know your your sweet spot there but that that was kind of a big deal\n[noise] yeah I mean I think the the dairy provisions were one of the sticking points with\nUm you know making this a three way past that includes Canada and so obviously good news that that was resolved and that you know we we certainly were we we were very happy when the Mexico deal was put in place but our preference was a three way pact that's what we have and um [noise] uh we're very happy that it's in place\nNow you you say that that covers three of our top five markets who who were the other two markets were concerned with\n[noise] well China a and I think you know resolution to current trade disputes I think that's going to be a slower burn\nOr as you know the Trump Administration is working through a major realignment of us global trade strategy and policy [noise]\nUh I think you know they're weighing many many different interests across different industries in terms of our trading relationship with China we sent a over a billion dollars of\nOf pork to China last year it's the largest port consuming nation in the world obviously very important market for us and we hope to you know see a\nA return to more favorable access as soon as possible but I\nI'm a I I don't know that that's on the immediate horizon but certainly the the the news with Mexico and Canada is great news the the Korean finals they showed the Korean agreement is great we also had more good news last week in that the U.S and Japan have announced plans to start\nNegotiations on a on a bilateral free trade agreement and that as far as offensive measures that has been that I'm On the top of our list yeah um you know most of our time is over the last year has been spent\nDefending a existing free trade agreements and are on the on the you know in terms of going off and\nI'm having a bilateral Japan is at the top of our list and and so that's that's good momentum to and I'm as you probably know Japan\nA is part of the new TPP agreement which we expect to be in place or next year and Japan is also formed a free trade agreement with the European Union that's looking to be finalized next year so\nUh it's good news that we are going to start free trade negotiations with Japan because without that we would be at serious risk of losing pork market share in uh another very large poor consuming nation\nWell Jim ...
