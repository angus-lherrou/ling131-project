here as Farm Bureau has released the latest version of their grocery shoppers survey and we'll talk to them about what our customers are interested to hear today on the show Hi Lori how's it going\nIt's great Andy how are you guys doing\nWell it's always good to visit with you of course and\nLearn what it is that we ought to be providing in order to uh fulfill the needs and desires of those who are going to um consume our products it's the Iowa Farm Bureau food and farm index and are quite a few headlines that looks like coming out of this latest survey\nThat's absolutely right and you know this is the fifth year that we've had the Iowa Farm Bureau food and farm index\nAnd you know it reaffirms what I think you and I would say all along Iowans are common sense\nFolks and they like to keep it real [laughter] if civically out some of the things that we asked in this particular survey this year had to do with them labeled now we do know and this is what we've seen over the last five years\nThat about eight and ten I wouldn't say they do pay attention to label this survey was done by Harris Harris Poll and it was an online survey among five hundred and eight Iowans\nAge twenty to sixty who say they're the ones who do the primary grocery shop bringing food preparation for their families for their homes so we wanted to find out what's driving their decisions at the grocery store what issues are top of mind for those folks that are shopping for food what did they like what did they not like when it comes to label and what really matters the most of them\nAnd we found out that once again\nPrice it's what's driving their choice more than anything else that's fancy on the label price sixty six percent that's their number one thing driving the choices on the label\nThen they like freshness that sixty three percent and tastes came out at sixty one percent we had some really interesting things come up with that whole ah what do you think about those labels with steak milk fake meat you know what do you think about some of that stuff and I know that certainly making the news for you guys have been talking about it too\nYeah we have in a generally was on what this yesterday big convention going on in in ah DC trying to figure out how that's going to shake out it it's interesting though Laurie should we be concerned that the price is the main driver over these things like fresh innocent quality or is that distinction a minor when\nWhen that distinction is I think what it means though so many times is that you know when they talk about where it was a ground how was the grown what's on the label I mean these are all things that do matter to Iowans Iowa grocery shoppers\nBut they are looking for a bargain they're looking for they have budget to stay within\nUm and they do pay attention to labels but they want to make sure that they're getting the best deal about what they're buying whether it's\nA cut of meat or milk or now milk for that one it was freshness was number one they look at the date before they put that carton of milk and they're in their cart so I think that's a good thing too\nBut it it shows too that was that was interesting was that of the folks that are paying attention to labels seven and ten it's about sixty nine percent don't agree that plant based and lab grown meat substitutes should be allowed\nTo use meat on their labels or milk on their labels\nAnd only three and ten would be likely to buy that imitation meat even if it was sitting right next to a to regular pork chops on the shelf\nAnd then a six and ten don't agree that plant based those no substitute should be allowed to use milk on their labels and less than half would even by that you know the milk substitutes are other theories substitute so they like their\nTheir meat milk eggs and cheese and they eat a lot of it\nAnd then quickly here Laurie I'm I was like this number two confidence in farmers remains very very high despite what others at times would like us to believe\nRight and that's great and that's where it's always nice to remind farmers to about perspective\nBecause it seems like Everytime you pick up the you see some headlines something might be negative and you have to remember that there's an overwhelming majority of Iowans out there who do support would are farmers are working so hard to do day in and day out and we found out in this survey as in the past\nMore than nine and ten they place trust and farmers\nNine and ten nine and ten say they're confident farmers are caring for their animals responsibly and that hasn't changed for since last year and the same thing and nearly three and four states they feel that farmers are caring for the environment responsibly and are taking on the challenge of\nImproving water quality yeah that one right that sixty six percent so you know when they like to see they like to hear more about what farmers are doing they like to meet farmers\nAnd hear their stories and that's one of those things that I certainly keep working really hard at we all do\nAnd encouraging folks to do just that\nWell a glory whereas appreciate the numbers are fascinating and the banks are making a few moments for us to share them with us\nWell thanks for the call always happy where did you guys\nYou to Iowa Farm Bureau has got some of the specific numbers
