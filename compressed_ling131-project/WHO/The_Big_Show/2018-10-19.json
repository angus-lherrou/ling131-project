H. O. D. I. arch radio overcast divisions fifty degrees ten fifty one he's done news radio forty W. H. Joe here's one of those we very aggressive story\nThe ratio was this from the wall Street Journal\nAfter increasing for decades the real cost of attending both public and private college is flat and in some cases even declined to this year now I've got two in college one at Iowa State won in Iowa that was a headline that just maybe go\n[laughter] that that\nIs not really true well there's a person I go to to talk about these topics education expert David Dillard is on the ... news maker line David welcome back to W. H. Joe good morning to you\nLaura you're more so David I there are a lot of parents like me with kids in college who thought wow flat or even declining do you believe that to be true what are you thinking here\nWell when they say ... or declining they didn't say was inexpensive\n[laughter] [laughter] okay [laughter]\nThey just they just said it is not moving up your right or the the reality is a there's the disruptions going on in higher education right now we've seen it in retail marketing and advertising it in media with newspapers and television\nOr what you have is a changing dynamic uh in in in the options that are available and uh the traditional providers are having to go back and become creative and attracting\nA their customers it's happening in in the higher education world as well it's it's really basic economics we had a week\nIn the number of of a college student in two thousand ten and and we've had this disruption in and her\nProviding of our education with with online colleges and yeah for profit colleges and and and in public and private universities that have a lot of brick and mortar trying to scramble to to continue to attract people\nAnd so what you're seeing is the traditional approach that you would see many retail environment what happens if you're trying to attract customers will\nYou incentivized you you you have to you have to change the value proposition in order to get their attention\nAnd the way that they are doing it just by offering more a funding for grant money more merit scholarship money to attract quality candidates or from\nOther choice [noise] we've seen that we've seen it in with public institutions mhm for years uh compared to private it's their prerogative are going to be more expensive\nAnd so the first round of grant money or or ... scholarship money that they offer is to try to make up the difference between their cost and the cost of a of a public institution\nSo that so that a candidate can make an apples to apples or this\nYou know whether they want to go to that institution or not ah but they dig deeper when they have quality candidates that are trying to attract and that's where you get into the ... the you know the full ... for a scholarship sports or the the super stars\nRight so David that is fascinating perspective I appreciate that because I've always wondered we keep hearing oh it's going up is going up is going up it makes sense that at some point you get past a price point where parents could say\nYou know you get past that price point parents going to go I'm Sorry I just can't afford that it looks like that's where we're at\nWith college education in this country now\n[noise] well [noise] it's always been there a depends on on how deep it have been yeah my my family experienced the same thing\nUh when I went to college in the ... and and I had to make a decision between public and private and had to look at the real value\nOr alternative and in reality there is not uh they're not a hundred good colleges in the country there there are thousands\n... uh and so a student needs to look very carefully at the things that are going to make a difference in their being successful\nIn their ah being able to learn and and they're being happy and in their college experience and it it it's not um you know it's not\nSeeing a you know it's not being able to brag about uh\nWhere are you the shows up on the U.S news and World Report\nYeah yeah the other thing that comes to my mind David given your answer is this is really really the time when parents and kids need to be looking for that scholarship money because it's got to be out there since that's what schools are doing to try to attract students right\nWell that's exactly right as as college counselors working with students so across country um the colleges are still trying to track the high quality and mhm and so a student needs to do everything that they can do\nTo equip themselves to be the best they can be both academically and with their time outside of the class if if they're paying attention to those things then they're gonna have choices and and the current environment is they're going to have some people they'll throw money at\nWell this isn't a trend that's going way David I'm thinking of even the falling birthrates that we're seeing so do you think this is a long lasting trend of at least you like you said it's expensive but it is flattening out or in some cases declining a bit\n[noise] no the the the projections are that that this trend will continue for some are so so uh uh the public is becoming smarter than the maximum that they are willing to go into that\nOr or or in and physically I'm a handle\nAnd so are the alternatives have to align themselves so that they can and meet the needs of the population and and that's not a bad thing\nAbsolutely education expert David Dillard is with Katie college prep David great insight thank you for joining me have a great

something got in the state we didn't we didn't want so what what what's the state of Iowa do I mean what are you guys are looking at\nRight so I've slowly we well we think often of that that a high path avian influenza outbreak largest animal disease outbreak in us history\nBack in twenty Fifteen about sixty million birds were impacted a nationwide about half of those were in Iowa so we were ground zero in a lot of ways and so you know experience that frankly I Wish I didn't have that experience our team wishes we didn't have in the industry certainly and wishes that they hadn't had to go through it but we did and uh so many lessons learned\nA you know pat talks about biosecurity right you think you're you know you think you're doing a good job and biosecurity and then you really look at it more closely and you realize gosh there's some things we could be doing to enhance and so that's one of the things that the job is never done on that front we learn that loud and clear\nIn terms of what the state needs to do what we're working on is we just need to to generally ... increase our capacity to respond a well actually let's do two things we need to increase our capacity to prepare and\nTo work with industry on the front end the best thing that we can do to prevent this disease from ever coming to our shores God Forbid it does then we've got to mount an effective response and so we need to build that capacity over the last couple of years\nWe've requested at the department of egg some additional funding from the legislature to fun to couple up a new positions while the new
