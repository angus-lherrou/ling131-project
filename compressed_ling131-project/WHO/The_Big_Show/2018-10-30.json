I'm sending up the military this is the military and they're standing there and one thing that will ... captured we don't let 'em out what has been happening and we're not as of pretty recently

discussion from last night then today it comes out that President Trump is considering signing an executive order which would end up birthright citizenship on us soil baby born on us soil even born to an illegal alien is a U.S citizen and we've been debating\nThis morning is multiple angles on this particular issue whether or not it's a good thing whether that's a bad thing whether ... constitutional whether or not is unconstitutional birthright citizenship one more angle on this issue it's raised by Jim guarantee of National Review as you're thinking about it today\nBirthright citizenship is a policy that's basically been in place due to court interpretation of the fourteenth amendment since Eighteen the Eighteen sixties\nSo over a hundred years of this being the policy in this country based on a court interpretation of the fourteenth amendment and what Jim guarantee raises is All right even if you've got a conservative Supreme Court\nWould they allow the president to overturn this concept by executive order\nOr would require legislation by Congress or wouldn't require amending the constitution by executive order now there is an argument that the Supreme Court could find in favor\nOf Trump's power to do this because the U.S Supreme Court has over and over held that the president and the executive branch has wide latitude\nIn regulating immigration in this country so under a wide latitude interpretation to the executive branch you could argue that he has that power the executive order after all deferred action for the for children DACA\nWas also

were talking about it into the Dakotas and being mentioned that they're doing it again up there or\nMaybe they are he's right here pretty sophisticated areas of the ground where they don't they have

was\nSome things that are they haven't gone up too so it'll be interesting to keep an eye on how that process goes we've certainly seen\nPictures on the text line and if you have when we'd love to see five one five nine nine nine fifty four Ninety One need pioneering seriously being text line of some of these big piles of golden grain as far as the begins to wrap up\nI misspoke there but I was talking with a farmer over the weekend and they had a problem with his being pottery shattered out in the field with the wind is so that was weird\nWe are being pod shattering with the wind or when the real hit some are due to the in a lot of cases the um wet and dry cycle too many times the week after they've been out there for a while\nSo we're going to talk more you're a little bit later on too with a Joe ... and ah continue this what financial planning conversation for next year yeah\nJust does need to be doing some sure I can just see if ah everything is going to be working at this in

master service reports for bringing us all a season along Don rose now us commodities in West Des Moines our Tuesday marketing analyst\nAnd are done or pretty quiet and here again is leaking a little bit lower I guess corn and soybeans but a\nWhole lot of news I guess to to drive the market it looks like\nA good morning guy well you know this is the time of year where the the malady and less ... or ... corn for example yesterday was a solidly on and uh we drop going into basically Thanksgiving\nNinety three percent of the time about thirty and then on the road you're supposed to be dropped going into thing uh eighty percent of the time about seven and a half so you know I guess the point is that time frame or were trying to crop away\nUsually struggle and we usually just leak lower so we'll see if this is the opposite side this year as the November a proper report all ... up to say about\nThat you know one of the things I've always enjoyed trying not enjoyed but tried to figure out with the markets is how much is in the markets with the bad news how much is in the market with the anticipated good news and how much of the market right now is just waiting for something to happen where are we\nWell you know and the thing is Doug that the the good point because often we don't really know until we get the\nNews that is kind of shocking news and then the market goes the other way and then then you know it's already dialed in you know where we're at right now is I think we have for the most part a big crop dialed in Seoul eh if we get ill ah go on for over that is left and the market uh can't\nMove up then you'll say it's not really dial them but I think we're at a point where probably realistically that the crops getting a little bit smaller on corn and soybeans and that means that the market should buy some stability here and\nTry and work for these like higher so we'll see what did you have a big drop but his poor quality well you know and I think that's partly what we have on I think so yeah\nSo that an issue here too but I think usually what happens I knew that uh is the crop gets tucked away in the band the guys try to blend it off and its logo in selling into the market so that's usually a little bit supporter\nYou know Bob here done so I guess I have to write these things down and pass them along when he gets back what did you say sell corn I thought we went trick or treating on Halloween we're supposed to sell corn first and then it goes down eighty seven percent of the time about Seventeen and a half fence\nYeah that's a scary situation [laughter] but\nYou're right though some are all a Halloween a core barks corps in\nEighty seven percent of the time going into November twenty four ah basically Thanksgiving we drop Seventeen and a half that now that uh the years that we don't drop the course of the years that the crops getting a little bit smaller that's going to be the real question are because then you're ... like ...\nWell that's what I was going to say is usually big crops get bigger and nobody ever talks about in this started out as a big drop\nWell and you know and we are getting smaller Ellen corn remember we went down from the September the ... report and I think that'll be\nThe again do we go down yet you know that's going to be the question mark and that's what a Doug was bringing up okay reacting to it you know mhm\nThat both corn and soybeans you'd think gun going getting smaller here\nThe more clouds round the mid west sky today with rain possible later this afternoon and evening and southeast Iowa northeastern

nationwide contest\nLet's get right to it here Doug with Charlie Herbert well\nWe'll bring him to the microphone Charlie we read a statement you sent me a last week about some of your concerns with soybean I thought it'd be a good idea if we can get an update from us to where we stand right now\n[laughter] well dug up you know it's a little bit better now that is what we had last week\nAs a result of of being sitting in in water and heavy rain for so long that didn't get any better but at least didn't get any worse we've had a a beautiful week for or feel dried out much more so\nThan we would normally expect we had far more dried out and in the late October and now and probably into early November then you might expect so\nAh the damage problem are still there and I still hope the books are driving around the low places than other places that have the have the damage beams issue so we don't mix the men\nBut at least we've taken some of the moisture out in the field and and and so probably isn't going to get any worse\nWell it has been a frustrating a growing season in many ways and it's just kind of adds to it ah best advice at this point what her elevators June what are they seen one stuff comes in there what are you hearing\nOh well the best advice for the producer is to to isolate the the beans that have those various damages them as much as possible\nError rate them for a while they probably will look a little bit better on the commercial side at after a couple of weeks on the commercial side or we're now getting into the impact of the hurricane as well as what happened here in the the the marketing system the marketing\nChain it's pretty well saturated a with damage I read a piece yesterday from from us be about southern soybeans and and and the impact of the hurricanes and the need to set damage beans aside I Would I Would make that same statement here\nUh don't mix them in with good beans because the marketing system doesn't have a lot of slack in it can make the three percent that would be required to export\nAs you're going through the field and combine Charlie it's tough to tell I guess in some cases so how do you try and sort all this stuff out between good beans and damage beans and what makes it may be safe parts of the field and what may not be\n... you don't have a crystal ball and you don't have a perfect way of doing that\nA typically the beans that were affected are are in the lower places replant later maturing varieties maybe\nA a a a a a pre harvest scouting will help oh that is just wholesome some beans a shelf some pods and find out if we've got areas in the field or if there's\nA general issue of damage soybean if it areas drive around them and leave them or if it though if it's an entire variety than tires
