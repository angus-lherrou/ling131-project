town car dealerships who are nervous Ron How schools and churches are going to see fewer people\nAre in the bleachers on friday night and fewer people in the pews on Sunday mornings\nAnd that's not what I Want to see so we've got to think make sure that Washington DC understands what the waivers they've been handing out to oil refiners in biofuels policy or it's been keeping prices for corn and beans down and with what's going on and trade I don't think we've had a a coherent strategy to really take on\nThe bad actions of China you know if we had rallied our allies are the Europeans are Japanese Canadians Mexicans other folks who are of like mind in terms of uh China's\nA problems are now I think we would have had a lot more success you know it's it's really concerning because we've seen obviously low prices\nDue to what's going on and trade but what concerns me even more is the fact that we might lose those markets are our you know spent those eight years USDA lotta crop briefing\nAnd that time about how weather in the southern hemisphere impacts prices and demand and supply in the northern hemisphere never wants to hear the words Russia and soybeans using the same sentence but in June after they put\nTariffs on our beans or one of the headlines ... out there was China the source record supply of beans from Russia\nOr those export markets are important but we've also then got to make sure we're figuring out what are those next generation uses of what we growing raise so we can continue to add value and create new jobs and industries in rural Iowa\nThank you Jim Jim Gannon by the way I Would be remiss if I did not a big say a big thank you to the folks from Iowa corn Iowa corner sponsor a during the ... the presentation today my next secretary of agriculture a Republican candidate might\nBomb and Indian Doug good to be with you are always fun to be on the big show and and uh you couldn't think of a better place to do this uh this was the last four I'm here before the election and then on the big show and so thank you thanks to those of you here today and\nAnd for all of you listening out across the state of Iowa today as well we know a lot of folks and ... and tractors and trucks that are out there working hard you know we we got a a saw some tremendous progress here last week the weather finally turned and held a thirty seven percent soybean harvest which is still twelve days behind the average\nUh twenty nine percent of the corn harvest it which is about four days behind the average so uh you know we're still running behind but uh I Know that folks are working awfully hard had a chance to travel up through\nNorth central Iowa in western Iowa yesterday I saw a heck of a lot of beans coming out so uh uh we know that are over the next few days we'll we'll we'll continue to see quite a bit of progress\nWell it's a it's just a than an absolute a tremendous honor to have had the opportunity the last seven months to serve as the secretary of agriculture the state in the I think first and foremost would I Would want folks to know\nAnd all of you listening out there all of you involved in in agriculture and that's that's what I've done every day is get up go to work on your behalf\nTrying to fight for this agriculture trying to promote this agriculture and and you know we know that there are\nSome challenges out there some issues right now that need to be addressed and we need to see progress on trade and talk about that here in a little bit and and we need to make progress on water quality and soil health and talk about that too um but I think we're moving in the right direction but again it's a it's a tremendous honor to be able to serve so\nI grew up in northwest Iowa a we have a century farm my great grandfather bought that farm in Nineteen oh too I was just up by this past weekend helping finally with some of that so I mean harvest that we were anxious to get done\nAnd I'm you know I'm raising my wife and I are raising the fifth generation of our family to be involved in that operation in fact I was taking my youngest to daycare this morning and he asked if we were going to the farm today so unfortunately I broke his little heart said no we're\nWe're having to stay here but uh but uh you know they enjoy being up there and involved in that in that operation as well\nI tell you that you know uh I like to say this God made Iowa for agriculture and you know you don't have to look very far across our great state to see how incredibly productive we are look at our statistics look at where Iowa\nRanks in terms of our our production in uh in corn and soybean and pork and eggs and bio diesel and ethanol in this country and we're known globally for that production and the quality of our our products are but we can't take that for granted you know it does matter\nA who we send to represent us who who we send to work on our behalf\nUh we've got to ensure that we have policies that allow for the conditions for success and agriculture we've got to ensure that we have a regulatory environment that allows her farmers in our businesses to grow and thrive\nAnd so it doesn't matter who you send to work on your half the things that I'm I'm thinking about and I hear a lot about as I travel the state and again I Know we'll we'll dig into these things deeper throughout the day here but I'm I'm markets for our products both international and domestic you know making sure that we can export our products are holding our trading partners accountable\nTo that we've got domestic of domestic markets like livestock and renewable fuels are things that we can take our commodity agriculture and turn that into something of higher value\nWe've got to make sure that when our economy is based on agriculture and our agriculture is built on our natural resources that were doing the right things from soil health and water quality standpoint\nAnd the final piece is is all about workforce here this top of mind for folks when I traveled to state\nMaking sure we've got the talent pipeline to supply the workforce of today and also the workforce that we know that we all need tomorrow so\nAnd these are the things that I'm I'm working on every day and the things that we will work on and I find that have a chance to serve a full term here as secretary of agriculture so again thank you uh for hosting this uh this forum today and I look forward to a great discussion\nOr Mike Mike nag thank you so much again a big thank you are going out to Iowa corn for helping us hosted a presentation today my name is Bob with Andy Peterson to the big show dogs going to be coming up here a little bit with a markets and whether as well for those you joined again this is our secretary of agriculture forum today\nAnd the guys on the give you about a minute and a half year old man and a half Andy we'll talk a little bit\nUh ... throughout a question for a bird or about a Ninety seconds or so what would you say the number one issue is facing a that you would face a secretary of agriculture\nI think number one issue is profitability we've had declining farm income for five in the last six years\nUSDA a predicted it was going to fall again this year back in February before we started the uh trade disputes with multiple\nTrading partners so I I think the the number one issue is short term getting Washington DC to fix what has been a bad biofuels and bad trade policy for Iowa farmers are and then longer term we've got to invest in the kind of research\nThat will pay off in future or uses in commercial opportunities for a while we're on race you know I Will stay researchers just a couple of weeks ago announced they're applying for patents for us soy based\nA replacement for a paraffin wax all those Amazon boxes all across the world that get shipped with a paraffin wax waterproof from\nYou know we could and hopefully in a couple of years be making those are here in Iowa using something made out of soybeans so we'll add value to what we've grown raise but then also jobs all across rural Iowa\nTim Gannon thank you so much my nagging throwing the ball over to you now what do you think the number one or a sitting facing a agriculture is right now\nToday I you know I've been saying we had a lot of issues mostly but folks are more worried about is getting into the field most recently but uh that would be the top of mind issue I Would say as I as I traveled to state there's there's no doubt that the the near term top of mind issue for folks is is very much focused on on trade\nAnd and markets and make and the impact that that's a disruptions that we're seeing the trade war that we're seeing especially with China is having on our on our markets okay and that that hits to profitability that hits to sustainability and I think it's just that it'd be the number one issue\nOr that that I'm hearing as I as I traveled to stay so Ben encouraged to see some momentum here uh I'm In recent weeks you know starting with\nThe conclusion of NAFTA negotiating after two point or us MCA\nUh the the uh indication that we're moving towards a negotiations with Japan than to you and and the u._k. this is all this is all good news we need to carry this momentum into resolving our situation with China and uh so yeah I I think that's the that's the number one issue that I'm hearing about when I'm\nWhen I'm traveling to state or in my neck and Tim Gannon or yesterday during the big show we're going to take a a break right now to a group is gonna bring us up to what's going on in the marketplace we're also going to be looking at whether and\nUh we're celebrating a Andy today another a nice day out in the fields at least it's not ... anywhere in the state of Iowa so well we're going to talk a little bit about whether a as well now I mentioned during the next half hour we're going to talk a little bit about water quality and we're gonna talk to our candidates about\nA water quality issues how we're doing so far maybe got to give us a report card\nOr at least in their opinion and their mind how we're doing a so far with ... water quality issues the state has allocated some money to move forward with some more water quality initiatives and a\nKind of want to find out if that's enough or if we need to put more in there or are we are going to call them out of a couple of things too I mean if they have some ideas you know maybe what kind of ideas they may have for funding some of these issues as well I mean it's one thing to be able to talk about a lot of these things but\nI think both ... both of these guys are realist as well and they realize that uh we have to have some way of funding or some of these things and also ah getting\nThis

Kentucky being brought to impart today or the gang from hurts far management of the course of big bank you're going out\nTo Iowa corn as well well uh fellows uh we're talking with a nagging Tim ... from the start this around off and read about four minutes your guys are going to talk about water quality so we want to talk about the water quality and how we're doing so far with water quality initiative here in the state of Iowa\nAnd talk a little bit about a funding and some of the programs in place and uh maybe give us a report card and how to improve on that so uh my dad got about four minutes of airtime here\nExcellent thank you you know we have made tremendous progress on our efforts to improve water quality in the in the state of Iowa so we look back into the end of may we celebrated the fifth anniversary of Iowa's nutrient reduction strategy so\nNow we've got decades of experience working on on soil conservation soil erosion prevention and the state but really it took its it's taken a renewed effort a new look at\nA ... addressing water quality and nitrates in particular and so we\nDeveloped the nutrient reduction strategy and and really lays out the framework for how to move ahead on improving that that water quality was a big part of why I joined the department of egg is the deputy back in twenty Thirteen was to come in and implement the strategy\nAnd so very proud of of the work that's been done both in the urban and in the rural landscape and you think you mentioned that Bob before about how we're there there is work being done in both areas that you know it's one of those core principles of the strategy right one is that it's built on a scientific basis so we did a first of its kind science assessment at Iowa\nThe state university that says when you do X practice it has actually impact on the water or we don't spend dollars on practices that are proven through science to have an impact\nAnd the second piece is that uh we need to work both in the urban and the rural landscape the days of pointing fingers at each other and saying it's your fault it's your fault have to be over we need to do with renewed effort of work in a all landscapes across the state of Iowa and the third piece being that we have\nA great framework in terms of soil conservation or near the historical work Iowa was first in the nation to devote state dollars to soil conservation cost share back in the seventies right we'd been a leader\nAnd as we have that framework\nThat works you build a culture of conservation not a culture of regulation and uh and that's what we're trying to do it through the strategy so I'm a again we we spent the first couple of years really working on demonstrating some practices that folks didn't have a lot of experience with you know cover crops more widespread across the state\nUh weapons by reactors saturated buffers the new types of practices right that we needed to show demonstrate and have folks\nAgain and understanding of and now we have an opportunity to really scale up our efforts to really move from that demonstration phase\nTo an implementation phase and scale of work and so some of the things that we're doing right now and you know I think we'll talk funding here but the Senate file five twelve or something that we secured this past legislative session the first time that we've had long term dedicated funding for water quality\nUh in the state to uh to to specific to implement the nutrient reduction strategy or doing is ... is a targeting those dollars in some in some watersheds across the state north raccoons middle seat or\nThe south skunk putting boots on the ground to go work with landowners and farmers to to get work done um you know I think the other piece that I Want to highlight is that I really as a leader in this effort so I co chair of the Gulf hypoxia task force which is the uh states represented throughout the Mississippi\nRiver basin together I co chair with a representative from EPA office of water\nAnd uh this is a place where the states get together work together share ideas\nAnd uh and work with throughout the region to have an impact on the Gulf of Mexico ultimately so\nThat we have that co chair position because we are recognized as being a leader on this issue in in the in the region and so I'm very proud of that and we're gonna continue to do that no Iowa was nutrient reduction strategy as a model for other states across the region and uh and with good reason because it's the right to the right direction to go so\nTwo and three quarters

C. understand the damage in danger to Iowa to calm me if they keep pursuing a incoherent and not quite a understanding the the impact than a half year\nOn Iowa was calming\nTim talk a little bit about the animal agriculture we're going to have a follow up question here but Mike let's talk a little bit about animal agriculture a growth and a plan for a continued\nGrowth in your bed so you know animal agriculture is the I like to say the ultimate value added agriculture\nI you know again we we feed look at it pork production number one and pork production and we feed about twenty five percent of our corn and soybeans to that pork industry\nAnd uh again create value than we process pork here we extract more value and then you know we can\nSell that domestically or export that around the world so there's just a tremendous a generator of of value to the economy in in this process and I think uh we do have a tremendous opportunity in the state one world leader and to we've got opportunity for more growth\nLook at the global demand zoom out look at the big picture one point or well this not talk China let's go a bigger a a nine and a half billion ... billion people by twenty fifty in this country in this world a you've got rising incomes and\nImproving standards of living around the world would have folks want when that happens they want more protein in their diet\nIowa was tremendous position to take advantage of that marketplace and Debbie that protein supplier to the world you know think of Iowa and protein production like you would think of Texas in oil production or silicone valley in technology right this is something that we can absolutely\nOwned this space and and really drive value and also you mentioned our leadership position and pork\nAnd beef and eggs or you know strong and dairy and and turkey as well\nI think we've got an opportunity to expand some poultry production in western Iowa we're looking at ... culture\nAs a you'd be able to scale up and and really produce at a significant level we're at the crossroads of the country or we can easily export and move up you know fish around the aquaculture products around the country and I think that's a tremendous opportunity for us\nUh don't forget this lifestyle continues to be one of those great opportunities for our young people to get into agriculture for them to get back into their from a family farm operation to generate some cash to build some equity and so uh it's it's important that we\nContinue to have a a thriving growing animal agriculture sector in the state with that we need to make sure that we're uh we're supporting that industry one of the things I I focus on a lot of secretary our efforts around animal disease response preparedness applying the lessons learned from a twenty Fifteen\nA high fat avian influenza outbreak\nExperience we all wish we didn't have especially our producers but we do\nAnd so we apply those lessons and were scaling up and building our capacity at the department\nOr to to work with our industries on\nPreventing disease outbreaks but also looking at the capacity to respond God Forbid we ever would need to again so and that's something that's being incredibly important part of the job of secretary has to be leading and to have that kind of experience and be able to respond they won in that situation\nWell fellows will have another three minute question here uh let's talk about uh doing some research for a animal agriculture gym I'll throw it over to you for a question uh talk a little bit about the research and funded research or are we doing enough to fund research or when it comes to a animal agriculture what do you think\nI I don't think we're doing enough when it comes to funding research or at any level of\nThe the the\nCut off organizations play an important role in this but the state of Iowa has had a flat line budget for the I experiment station at Iowa State for the last five years\nAnd it's not it's about eighty percent of what our high watermark was Fifteen sixteen years ago and so that's why I said that the next legislature in the next governor should over the next four years increase the state investment in the experiment station\nA little over a million dollars a year to get us up to thirty five million dollars a talking with a copy will techie who used to be the dean after and then was the under secretary for research at USDA when I was there she said you know that's the kind of pragmatic but doable uh\nInvestment over a couple of years' time it will send a strong message that the state of Iowa in Iowa State university wants to continue to be at the forefront of that important research\nAnd I am on the animal's side we've got to get the a veterinary diagnostic laboratory built a if we lost that accreditation that it has it would be a tremendous a negative to our state we're very we're very fortunate to have the Iowa State University in the same location as the as USDA built a national animal Disease Center\nAnd so there's a lot of synergy is that we can work through their um but I think we've got to get that investment uh\n'cause we've got to continue being more productive we've got to continue doing it while uh be more productive while we take better care of the soil and water and we've got to figure out what are those commercial opportunities that we can take out of research like the\nThe soy wax or that can replace paraffin I referenced earlier I mean these are things that will have a multiple benefits to our entire state's economy\nMy neck a talk a little bit about a research for animal agriculture what direction should we take\nOh you bet ah well again what an important part of our our economy right to\nLook at again Iowa's leadership leadership position in livestock word number two in the country in terms of the value of the animal products that we sell the the value of that back to our Iowa\nOur top local story the owners of Myrtle hey mall are getting a two and a half million dollar loan from Polk County to help keep that model alive\nI think when you have added a whole nother channel of distribution with people who cannot purchase\nAnything that they can find on the Internet you're either going to be a destination for entertainment for food and beverage for shopping or you're going to be convenient you're going to be between ... point B and somebody's going to be able to drive by quickly go inside and get what they need and keep going\nMyrtle hey CEO Liz Hollen tells W.
