All right all the way a good thing you didn't tell her that beforehand [laughter] well\nI Know you've been in some conversations that uh that we've been having with the Charlie Herbert received Johnson another Iowa State folks about these uh damaged soybeans you kind of seen a crop production this season from a couple of different angles as we mentioned so uh what are your audio wrap this all up her summarize it so far\nA variability seems to me the name of the game I mean it it's like that every season but this year especially with the Harvard\nThe way that it it's gone it's just incredible all I've been doing a lot of stuff and at different co op around my new area at the top and introduced myself and\nYou know it provides a great opportunity to say how have the grain was coming in and you know every everybody's got a different answer [laughter]\nUh yeah what you'll swings in some cases in in court of what forty to fifty bushel and soybeans ten to Fifteen or just incredibly high numbers\nYou know for the most part I'm here only beans are doing it you know as well or maybe even better as previous years kind of across the board now that you know we're finally getting back to harvest quality\nNavy at CERN I'm more than the yield itself or a you know keeping keeping that grains dry and making sure that\nUh it doesn't have too many split search you much mold or anything in it they're when they're taking it market that's a a bigger concern but yet but we'll be all over the place\nAre you hearing anything a significant change you know the quality issues that you folks have been talking about with Charlie and so forth and I know you\nYeah you guys have talked to to Charlie and the seas and I think soybeans or a bigger concern in general from what I've seen so far a corn at this point\nUh and I don't know what exactly the factors are that are controlling it whether it's stuff that was just you know mostly in the church early whether it's stuff that was in the low\nLying ground that would have had a little more moisture little more humidity here uh when they were getting wet um but the the being quality is all over the board and so I'm hearing damage as high as maybe even twelve\nPercent in some cases coming out of certain loads or certain fields and then I I'm hearing a lot of cases where people aren't you worried about it though so\n... we'll talk with us earlier this morning ... he was saying some of the early soybeans early being the last week or so were coming out kind of wet but now they're after the dry weather up there they're they're almost too dry or you seen something similar in central Iowa\nI Am they were hanging up and that like sixteen to Eighteen percent moisture and now we've had some real nice and dishes and things that got down to kind of Thirteen or so by that\nYou know mid to late afternoon on friday and I can't imagine that they've they've either stay consistent are only got and dryer from their year after and I'm over the past few days\nWhat are they what are they doing with those damage soybeans the collapse taken 'em or rejected them or would it be seen\nI have not heard of any body rejecting anything yet it's just a matter of uh what kind of stock edge there might be on a some of the higher damage and I my understanding is that has to be\nGraded by kind of an official us see a greater because typically the\nVisual assessment even when you just look at the grain you know you think it looks a lot worse than it is which is good news um as long as he ended up maybe down in the\nOne to four percent damage or something like that you know when we get up to high I heard a twelve and a half percent somewhere and I don't know if that was an official grading or that was just some visual estimate a but but that's pretty high\nYeah that's not what you wanted to think about it especially after a while we were bracing for thinking about might be record yields in some cases compared to last year Meg in what are your what are you hearing\nUh I I think being killed or not too far off last year but definitely anything that was mature and was left in the field throughout the spring and fall on your show up to a field\nAnd you you can see soybeans sticking out of pods are needed beans and and molding being you know you know you're leaving more out there ah than you could of if you would have been out there you know two maybe three weeks earlier so\nKind of an unfortunate situation with all that rain fall and I knew it was going to happen I kept saying you know we keep hoping for rain fall and then of course it's going to come right in the middle of harvest don't we don't eat it and figures that that's the way it happens\nYou know it's not one thing it's another well good
