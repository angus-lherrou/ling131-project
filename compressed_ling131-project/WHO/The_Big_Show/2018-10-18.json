back to ... talk to you know while this soybean market looks like it's taken a hit again today we uh what got some harvest pressure may be coming into the marketplace\nWell if you could blame it on a harvest pressure but I think the bigger deal was the poor exports sales reports this morning trade was looking for six hundred thousand times up on on exports sales\nAre we at cancellations were bigger than that although most of those were actually switches to from unknown destination is to know destinations bottom line is nobody was buying beans last week as they were\nComing up rallying up into that USDA report\nSo we we kinda have a an idea what the supplies are are now coming into harbors really getting a little bit late to animals are we going to start a may maybe see in this market to find a bottom here pretty soon\n[noise] well I don't think the markets thinks it has a bottom but got tested and that's what we're doing\nAnd right now are so far we're okay and that uh we're just pulling away from the upper bowl and your band back to the Boulder mid line that's that's something the market does routinely every few weeks\nOr you know I'm watching the product values to meal got six forty cheaper today being oils down a little bit in general commodities or just selling off after the money was flowing Indyk Bobby's back on Monday\nI like that the market thinks that may have found a bottom well but let's hope we have all let's hope we've already plumbed the or the the the er the bottom out on this so what's going to have to happen here I don't want to move this market a little bit higher maybe what what what do you think's going to have to happen here in the next few weeks\nWell again I think are the harvest story it gets played out if if we can from ill losses are and we definitely have some there's plenty of horror stories out there about shatter laws and\nMulti beans and ... and what have you that you should see some yield loss outta that USDA won't be able to confirm that 'til the November crop report but\nThat's one piece of the equation\nOr the difficulty there is if you have a a one Bush will break or national he'll drop that still only eighty million bushels out of a a nine hundred million Bush will carry out but but it would help\nAnd effect sports also start to pick up that it help or on a corn side I think uh you know world stocks are tight exports should be straw all the way out into December and January ah so that's what makes this week's low number kind of a stick out and make make the markets have second thoughts but I think\nA confirmation next week to the export business is still pretty good will help us here a fate used as good as we'd like to see the ethanol used pick up a little bit it's been dropping for several weeks here margins aren't very good\nThat would also helps yeah a final questionnaire alum and we're gonna talk to you again towards the end of the program but uh we're hearing that there are new trade talks being a a open here is is that gonna do you think impact this market a little bit here\nI think it's positive but it's long term okay we're we're we're going to reopen talks we've given formal noticed a Congress that we're going to reopen talks with with the Japan Andy you\nAre but those that that formal notice says that within thirty days we have to tell Congress what the objectives of

coming up next couple of days talking to all things pork tomorrow and then uh also on Tuesday we have the\nBig secretary of agriculture foreign being brought to buy a Iowa corn back out in the field now with Andy\nAnd we're harvest reporting today Roger you by her friends have poets and Iowa steel masters jumped into the combine here with my dad as we do the field um water quality data today but just in general impressions of harvest season so far have you been impressed surprised or what do you make of it yes I'm\nSurprised at the yields that we're getting and corn and soybeans both I was very worried with all the rain that we had in August and September there we would not get enough sunshine uh to to put all that water to good use that\nYields are even better than last year um\nAnd of course it's more variable from field to field depend on how well drained they are [noise]\nThink back to different falls a wet falls nothing new but the amount of rainfall that we have had in the past month is near record at least as it's long been more challenging from that perspective um so where we'd been before what do you make of that or I have no memory\nOf any fall prior uh where we've had rain of biblical home port proportions like we've had this year\nI think we've had about twenty inches of rain in the last two months um and it it certainly making for some challenges out here are very the combine a couple of days ago I had to get a cat out to pull it out [noise]\nUh so yeah you kinda gotta pick and choose and there is some spots that are going to get left and hopefully it says like this for another month and metal dry out and we can go back and get those spots before it freezes up\nInto Justin they're putting in our request right now for a um harvest the weather for the next month or so if it doesn't\nUh dry up then what do you have to wait until it freezes is that the deal\nI I think that's about you know whoa whoa whoa wait until the end of the\nHarvest season um then then we'll go back and maybe you know try to get as much as we can of those spots that we left\nUm but yeah probably gonna have to wait until what a first ... mid December who knows what the weather's going to do but we'll have to wait until the ground freezes up to get the rest of those spots\nWhich could be a while maybe not depending on again what weather nation decides to throw at it so then what do you do it from a compassion standpoint you address that are just hope for a cold winter and with all this water for reasons off you times and and let Mother Nature take care of it [noise]\nWell yeah since since we're no till I'm In a no till system um you know the complexion we created a cornfield I'm certainly something that we don't like to see it all uh we do have ways to address that we do have a\nAn in line deep river ah that we could go out and do some ripping on probably will go out and do some ripping especially on some high traffic area of\nThen so on but the ground is is what is it is I don't know how much good that's actually going to do is so a meal [noise] thirty days from now I'll probably have a lot better handle on what we may want to do [noise]\nAnd then are a little water quality test year with the folks from ... with the um nitrogen stabilize or\nThe numbers that Andrew ... from earlier in this very well run right around July showed more nitrogen there in the soil which means less runoff and in the form is usable of the plant so that this was another one of these initiatives that farmers have engaged in to try and take care of the environment\nAbsolutely um you know if we can uh if we can put on less nitrogen produce the same amount of corn\nUm and uh you know have that nitrogen available longer for the crop to utilize it in the form that it needs to be in\n'em and and you know improve water quality\nUm get the same crop with less nitrogen or maybe even more crop with the same amount of nitrogen um that that's a win win for everybody because uh you know water water quality is a big issue I don't care if you're a farmer or if you're if you live in town or in the big city water quality is a big issue for everybody\nI was looking at the numbers a little earlier as we put all this data together and the\nYoungest of nitrogen for Bush will with these hills on this field is about point six which is

we hop on the field and he's been out there all day he is the middle of a sound like a pretty a good form prop going on in uh east central Iowa\nThis morning for doing so called lining today southeastern Jones county on the floor home farm and this was the site when we gathered back in early may so June July August September October five five and a half months or so ago to ah to begin this process and\nIt doesn't end today it's just the next step the data analysis of course we're all done\nBut it's a little water quality testing it say nitrogen stabilize or effectiveness test as it was applied in strips the ... from ... in\nA one plant or pass so sometimes you just put on what the plant or a had a a stable either end up at ... at\nThe next one did not so it's a true side by side it's the same I've read and seen growing conditions same exact field and that will get some numbers several scale ticket numbers in the old monitor data Kevin vote centers year mark cyclists years well with for DC in life sciences and uh\nThis is kind of what it's all about isn't it mark are reaping the benefits of what we've shown\nAbsolutely this of the time all farmers look forward to and to see what they have ah reap the harvest you know get the get the benefit\nNow here a little further south what's a give us a harvest progress up I guess in your area\nOh actually I went over to uh Bloomington, Illinois for a meeting or earlier this week and I would say Ninety percent of the harvest says than in central Illinois western Illinois ah we I'd say we're probably sixty percent then and the further north they came today the less I saw harvest it so\nThat Kevin voting centers got the northern territory and they were telling me what your dad's just barely getting going up there north of highly twenty\nYeah here just last week guys are really just kind of getting out and get going they're still having to pick out the spots to stay away from us I don't get stuck but really on Monday was the first day here in a long time that combines them been able to roll and saw one guy out doing some beans yesterday\nYeah there were some switch over ... taking place yesterday I've been hearing about some pretty what means but ah anyway as far as this trial goes we're looking at a what the new sphere and Kevin and how much more effective that makes the nitrogen purchase in terms of field and\nSo now she was probably one of them said from the sea ... one of your biggest investments in your ... and went to new just fear products were protecting the from Los ... three from three forms a loss for protection from volcanoes Asian or that convergence ammonia\nWere protection from night to vacation or conversion tonight trade and also the conversion are the dean ... to nitrogen oxide were gases off there are so above below ground protection first try and protect on investments and to put it into the plants and out instead of water ...\nYeah we were out here I'm In August and mark after a Andrew ... took some soil samples and it showed that there was more nitrogen that was in the usable form available on the strips that had neutral sphere that didn't now I guess we're looking for yield\nAnd that's typically what we see is more of the in age for the ammonium and that's what the nutrition or does is keep that applied nitrogen in the ammonium form all the way through Greenville and that's real important to help or the plant to utilize that nitrogen when it's a filling the are\nFilling the ear filling the colonel make it a deeper heavier colonel a more higher test weights\nTypically a and a and a good deal of surely we see\nYou you were talking about a a deeper colonel and a heavier colonel it's incredible to do the uh the ear accounts in terms of size and links and throw it into a traditional calculator and they're coming out way low\nUh as far as the the predictions are much less been weren't the actual yield that we're seeing like yeah it's hard to take your gas when you're out there pulling\nA year a year to you know randomly through the field but the real test as the Columbine and the way in the wagons making sure we get the healed out there that we expect\nField has been so far phenomenal in this part of the state you a little bit further south uh and they were\nA little bit on the drier side and get a little bit further north than in quite a bit of rain but so far it's it'll be hard to draw any conclusions here to day you're looking anecdotally up at the monitor from time to time we'll gather the data but so far to Seventy two Seventy five which is amazing\nThat is amazing or even down in southeast Iowa where it was dry those guys you're surprised that the that they are blown off with no more rain and they got down there\nAny yield increases been substantial over the past three or four years of that curve I guess and and you talk about what ... that's got to do with some of these supplant health technologies that you're developing\nRight and those are the takeoff technology the a veil nutritious fear of being able to utilize the nutrients that we put out there [noise] get more efficient we just got to get a little better doing what we're doing and protecting the nitrogen from all three fourths of the last like Kevin said\nKeeping the phosphorus from getting tied up in the soil keeping that more plant available so we put out there more that gets in the plant\nAnd then utilizing the takeoff technology to work in the plant to get more of all nutrients especially in nitrogen back in the plant and utilize it more efficiently\nAll of these are quote unquote management decisions that take time Kevin maybe start a little bit earlier like now thinking about next year but are are hard to argue with the results that they're they're not worth it\nOr see some incredible results on an exciting term bought this year with all the work that we do do and how's that going to pay off your coming out in
