I don't know I go out and pick random like ten random spots or some such thing so you got for beans and a square foot was not very much a that's a bushel breaker last well I'll tell you what I Need to invent one of them vacuums it a pick up a stray Venus and we tried to do that back in the early eighties and are now\nIn work better technology maybe technology is an editor now but he didn't you get more than just the beans yeah you do you get the\nThe stems than any other trash that may be down there\nWell I'm I'm looking at this ten bushels though fellows in even at ... at the poorest marketing which broke believe me I have been known to sell at the bottom of a thing as a you know you're talking about er eighty bucks an acre you're you're dead that's quite a swing\nThat was out there Bob was pre and post and now we've been unable to gather it wow in knowing that\nYou're on your hands and knees pick him up one ... by ... well\nYou know we used to go out one of the projects we did was go out and clean in a cornfield yeah big white and green fields I ended up pickup corner not soybean might be a little bit of a silly but uh I Am saying that that ... was a possibility so\nThat's soybeans last which is an element to this conversation the other element to the conversation at one of them at least is for these beans that have sprouted what is that going to look like it when they're able to be captured in a load and also in yeah in the bed and will they keep\nOver winter and maybe that's as long as you know by February they better be gone because once it starts to warm back up\nA ... or are you going to audit problems were there when you could feed those dairy cattle or something in a lot of cases I Would imagine the harvesting process would knock the sprout off\nBut and you know you're going to have lower quality soybean because some of the nutrition had to be used to create the sprout dry those and grind them I don't know they it's it's an open question which is what led me to ask a little bit earlier have we ever seen this set of conditions where the crop was right this early\nFollowed by basically three weeks of rain\nTo to create what we're seeing here on it sounds like a pretty wide scale basis across the state now yeah no kidding me oh by field and variety by variety maybe we'll make a difference maybe we'll be able to learn some about if a if treatments were any better\nAny of them have to do with a strengthening pods but generally want to pipe it opens up pretty easily so the harvesting process go smoothly and\nYet or not in the kinds of conditions we've seen recently\nWell twelve Nineteen here will continue talking about this I'm sure throughout the week here we'd take a look at markets are being brought you buy champion seed seed company a duck for everyday champions\nHand this is a segment where I take a look at some of our lives stock markets and I'm going to\nBegin with a cold facts sheep and goats auction held Saturday morning at\nTen o'clock they had five hundred and thirty five hit fifty to sixty pounders brought a dollar sixty six per hundred way sixty Seventy pounds one fifty seven fifty Seventy to eighty one fifty two eighty to Ninety One forty\nIt's twelve thirty I'm Christian ...
