grand in your hand here's how you do it you text to two hundred two hundred the word cash text cash to two hundred two hundred\n[laughter]\nMoving all the big show now we have a special in Studio guest today and Tim ... is with us Jim is running for secretary of agriculture he is a a Democrat on the Democratic ticket Tim how're you doing\n[noise] from being in the field but\nYeah otherwise doing great going to ask you about that uh you're you're over there ah near Kovacs or did you have a chance to get anything done for this rain came through\nUh we got some beans cut a little over ... years ago and then the rain started and we have not been back in the field since then the first\nShot out of the gun I figured we'd be talking about a a sitting there were a little north arms in November with nothing to do because everything's already out of the field or do think that's going to happen what happens when you figure [laughter]\nI Know I think the Jake's everything I told him I said it is the first day we've had sunshine such a long time if he brings son with him we are going to have him back as an Everytime I step on a farm this year it's been raining\nA so hey Jim let's let's move into some uh areas do we want to discuss with you and he's going to spend some time with this year between now and the bottom of the hour\nBut we've been talking about a lot of these trade deals that are getting hammered out we've talked about this Taiwan soybean I'm a sale and we've talked about that new south American a trade deal course\nTrade deal and now this latest one that I Can't remember all the letters for but basically replaces a NAFTA uh what do you think about that ... are we doing going for\nWell it's nice to have some positive news on trade a because we've had good run of a negative news that's hurt prices and and a lead to some concerns about losing markets\nAnd so I think ah obviously someone more soybeans to Taiwan is positive it's not going to completely replace the market we're not in right now in China\nAnd so I think you know we need to continue to see progress uh I think the the good thing about the uh the new NAFTA does get a little bit better deal for dairy and Canada\nBut until we get the terrorists that are on right now we're not going to see a we're not going to get back into those markets especially China herbs especially Mexico with dairy and pork right now uh be my two big concerns\nYou know we have a long time [laughter] I I say that and in ... in a long time we have sixty days I think for this thing takes effect right\n[noise] uh I think I think they've got to get it signed in sixty days and then when it's obviously got to go to Congress for approval\nSo it could take even longer than that that\nSo we we could be looking at the first year for we start seeing this this uh this situation changed with Canada and Mexico yeah yeah yeah\nI'm ... ... the other thing we talk a lot about sea Fifteen here in in the state of Iowa and I think three or four times you've had Jim we've asked the same thing because nothing's really change we hear a lot about a change and don't get me wrong here a lot about changing but we're still waiting for the Z Fifteen summertime sales yeah ...\nStarting back in the spring there's been a lot of hinting at it and I think that that led to some hope that maybe even a this summer we would have seen some relief and and uh the ability to sell that uh because we need that we need that certainty so that a\nPetroleum marketers and gas stations and convenience stores will take a step of investing in the pumps that will allow to be sold in more places\nA until until we get that kind of market certainly I don't think we're going to see the investment in the infrastructure that's needed to for folks actually the uh most places have that ability to buy the higher blend Beth and all the other thing we've got to make sure ah\nIs that the refiners are the waivers at the oil refineries have been getting that have led to the destruction of over two million gallons of demand a\nAnd dust ah impact in the corn market pretty severely we've got to make sure that they shut those off\nA don't hand them out like candy Halloween the way they have been the last two years because a Fifteen year round sales that you Fifteen a is great that we can buy a higher blend but if we're still hanging out those are exemptions to refiners are we won't be actually Blendon the amount of ethanol we want to see in the overall market\nTalking with Jim Gannon here he is a a candidate for secretary of agriculture in the state of Iowa Democratic candidate Tim and got to ask you a ... you have all the while these meetings and going and going on around the countryside people come out and tell you you know what's on their mind what what are you here in the country so what what's important to Iowa agriculture well\nI hear a lot of concern about trade obviously um\nFarm income has been down five of the last six years and so the ability to sell that product overseas a is an important aspect to ah getting farming come back up there and with what's gone on\nProducers bankers a lot of other folks have expressed concern that uh there may be a chunk of folks who don't get through the next year or I've even heard you know talk\nState fair a couple of stop me and said we've got to get profitability back into our culture we've already had to sell one farm to make the bankers happy or we don't want to have to keep doing that and lose everything\nSo we've got to get the trade situation figured out worked out and the biofuels a UPA knowing what they've done to a demand for our our products but we've also got to make that investment in research especially at Iowa State so we can be figure out what are the things we can do with what we grow and race so well here\nAre that will continue to add and build demand so we can get a a good amount of profitability back into our culture so we can convince young people that hey there's a future out here it's not just a really thin margin that you're trying to to fight all the time\nYou know I I've asked this many times of folks are what is the next ... moment for agriculture maybe even I've talked about this as well but\nI I remember in ... remembers is we used to talk about a corn sweeteners was kind of an a ha moment for for corn and then of course ethanol was an aha moment for for corn as well bio diesel might've been the an a ha moment for so I mean what do you think that next aha moments going to be for agriculture\nYou know it's hard to say I one of the one of the things that's frustrating about the state having flat lined a investment in research at the experiment station at Iowa State for the last five years is that we've heard our ability to figure out some of what the next ... might be\nA when I worked at ... and was on the road with Secretary Vilsack we went to a a plant in just outside Madison, Wisconsin where they were making the uh the green top a defining water bottles of plant based bottles\nThose were thirty percent made with plant at that point in time or you know they're trying to figure out how do we get a hundred percent plant based plastic bottle made but the feedstock that they were using the day we were there were corn cobs\nAnd so if we could figure out okay there's a market for some number of corn cobs you're in and year out to turn into plastic I think that would be something that would be positive for Iowa farmers\nI'll tell you what if you could come up with the way to make plastic disappear after it's used yeah I think you'd be a\nTop of everybody's list because that's that's one of the things we struggle with and that's not inside agriculture by outside agriculture but do we talk a lot about that or what what we're filling up our land and I I Know we're getting off in the weeds here but to ... and she brought up and what we're Filner landfills up with\nIf we had we had a a plant based plastic biodegradable and it was something we could grow and raised here uh in Iowa a that'd be something pretty positive for the future profitability of agriculture I Would think do you think alternative crops\nTwelve thirty I'm Wendy Wild W.

session for a big show a Andy standing by going to talk news coming up markets as well but ah right now some inside with our gang from Wiffle joining us today on the big joke Charlie lands\nAnd Charlie is the district sales manager for our friends from ... hybrids and I dare Madison and union county so he's a right here in South central Iowa\nCharlie let's talk a little bit about what's happening or maybe what hasn't been happening in the ... corn and bean fields around where you are now you you were telling me before we got started early on uh you maybe got kind of a jump on the harvest season so to talk about some of that early harbors what were you seeing\nYeah we've been here a few weeks ago I mean the being stored white radio guy it's going to notice a corner a drought next but it and there's a fair amount of corn out you know south of Earl I'm ... numbers were planted a fair enough money makers route and now we're just gonna sit and wait for the ground gr out again and hope we get back and\nYeah we did have some really hot weather there and I'll tell you what be busted out of the shooting I thought were going to be done with harvest by November first we're going to be packing\nThings up and then the rains came and that's kind of is typical of what happened during the summer or to Charlie we were sitting on what I Would have thought would have been maybe the best crop that I'd seen a long time\nIn South central Iowa that up until July first the faucet turned off talk a little bit about your experience with that as well\nYeah there you know middle of June we're sitting here thinking we're setting\nProbably our largest crop ever just started to pollinate and then we got you know the full brunt of the ... that came through there the last week and then a lot of green snap across the board and a lot of damage the trees it really just kind of to get you off and then after that we went through forty four forty five days of no rain at all and excessive heat\nYou know I Want to give you credit for a new term that I'm going to be thrown around here a lot on the big show and that is called managing these micro climates or that because it's like you say it seems like on one side of the road you get four inches of rain the other side of the road you get nothing\nThat's correct you know it's getting more widespread of these little environment you know you can have a farm work your way from get four inches of rain and four miles south getting nothing and it's just kind of the norm anymore\nManaging micro environment issues about that hey let's get back to business here so ah as far as stock strength stock stand to build ... ... what are you seeing out there what are you concerned about\nYou know pretty much all the score is at risk now on when we've had a perfect system machine to get these stock or fired\nUp we went through excessive rain early a lot of drought and now of rain again it's just been a host of different patterns of stock her off coming in I definitely encourage everyone to a manager stocks Walker you know we used to have six inches above the ground there's not a whole lot of his let them have stocks and we start catch a lot more when we could have a lot of problems\nYeah is a good idea to check that and I guess a Charlie going forward is going to be timely harvest stand you know I I don't want to put the brakes on everything altogether because as I told you before on the type of guy that might drive into a river to harvest corner if it says so on the calendar but ah it it's best to stay out of this uh these sloppy wet feels\nIt is you know I mean we can do a lot of damage this time of year you know affecting next year's crop now with compassion and really smearing that\nTop three or four inches is not a good long term benefit the good soil and you know I think will dry up good here today we only had four or five tens of rain to friday's has been drizzly and what I think one of the day tomorrow guys can they get back in and not be a whole lot of damage\nAs long as we keep holding that followed blanket off the top of us we're going to be a lot better off hey Charlie thanks so much for joining us
