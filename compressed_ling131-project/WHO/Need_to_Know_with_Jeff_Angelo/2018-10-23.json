H. O. radio news sunshine till thirty six\nDegrees were really working hard to get above that this morning he goes on the weather forecast from Jerry in return coming up\nOur top local story this summer plans to complete the Des Moines cross town are just voted for moving forward but the ones that accounts I Will take about Monday Night on finishing the MLK extension all the way to highway sixty five in Pleasant Hill right now a dead end just passed the fairgrounds area\nI don't claim to have all the answers ladies and gentlemen but we will try to get to the answers of all the issues that affect us as a nation you know it was also not getting to a an answer on the immigration issue Republicans what is going on with them your latest update\nOn the migrant caravan is it now Seventy two hundred people strong and it is one thousand miles to the south of a town in Texas that the ... has apparently heading to even as we speak\nAnd um earlier this month Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said to the Associated Press I Am committed to helping the president get wall funding the very next day he told the Washington Examiner well try really hard\nAnd now silence\nVisitors what I find intriguing about this issue now you know you're hearing the ads in regard to Democrats an immigration they want to abolish ice they want to open borders blah blah blah okay but here's the problem I think for the Republicans which is\nUm if you vote for us we'll get something done on immigration so far [laughter]\nBut I mean seriously were serious this time we will we will get something done I think that's I I think that's an actual issue in the elections like yes I understand what you're saying about the Democrats but ah why all the Republicans get something done and here's what's amazing to me\nWhich is that I think funding for a border wall and the immigration reform that you hear President Trump talking about is highly popular with people the border wall ending chain migration ending the visa lottery yet the Republicans can't get it done\nAnd you've got a president for which immigration was a major issue that got him elected you need evidence of that last night in Texas President Trump having a rally guess what he's talking about in Texas as a migrant caravan heads for Texas immigration here's President Trump in Texas\nIs openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break laws\nOur borders and overwhelm our nation that sort of [noise] the Democrats have launched an assault on the sovereignty\nOf our country already of our nation and the safety of every single American\n\nSo that is a major issue that you would expect President Trump to be talking about particularly in Texas by the way he's also going to be rallying in Arizona immigration is an issue there\nI Would not be surprised if it's announced he's going to rally in California at some point as this issue becomes an issue that we're talking about in this election\nIf I were to say hey what are the big issues of the election well health care is a big big issue the economy and jobs and wages big big issue I lump those altogether immigration a big big issue and if I talk to each of you individually you may have a different number one priority but there is no doubt\nThat immigration is once again become a big issue in this election and that is interesting for me you can say the Democrats listen to Democrats that but the Republicans are like yeah we'll try and we just can't get it done\nBut doesn't that hurt them on this particular issue I Know what the alternative is but why can't they get it done if you've if these issues are in fact popular that's what surreal to me I've already presented to you staff within the last week\nThat the American people and now I'm not even dividing up into Republicans are independents are Democrats the American people in general with like a further limit on legal immigration that is that that that a pool in the polls well legal immigration and the American people certainly are in favor of ending chain migration\nEnding the visa lottery all these proposals folks are in favor and they're in favor of because\nYou've got to have sovereignty you've got to have borders in this country you got to have a government that is committed to your safety to protecting social safety nets to protecting the wages of Americans those are all legitimate issues yet Republican somehow cannot get it done and by the campaign on it and I think that's a real conundrum\nFor the voters who really really put a priority on this issue\nThis fall I'm going to be chatting with Rachel boulevard next hour she's my a conservative Institute friend that also has worked with Congress I always go to her because she's in favor of conservative policy she is frustrated over the\nLack of action on immigration policy and I want to get her viewpoint on why this is occurring since this is a popular agenda we'll talk about that\nRight after the ten o'clock news today by the way ten Fifteen our time today is also national prescription drug take back day\nNational ... or it's not today I'm Sorry it's the twenty seventh Tuesday the twenty seventh\nOr is the take back day the reason that that gets emphasized is because of the opioid crisis we have in this country and doctors want to encourage you to to uh to get rid of those old prescription drugs that are in your cabinet\nThe Mayo Clinic every year\nUh surveys the public about their attitudes\nOn opioids and you wonder if the publicity over this crisis is having an impact on American attitude let's check in with the doctor right now with the Mayo Clinic Dr ... is with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota Dr ... welcome to the program good morning\nMorning ... thank you for having me what a wonderful introduction to the topic\nWell this is the Mayo Clinic I Know stays on on top of Americans added to it to toward opioid doctor so give me some findings of your latest survey as to how this crisis is changing our attitude toward opioids\n[noise] yeah well thanks stuff we have a Mayo Clinic national health checkup\nI nearly at the witness tapped out of sorts it provides a path on what um Americans are perceiving and practicing regarding our health and weight focused on okay I guess because it's such an important topic at the time\nI think most Americans are aware that they okay like quite a major national concern it'd be hard to turn the TV or radio on and not know that yeah\nBut um our survey indicates that conversations are not happening often enough between patients and their providers regarding okay idea\nYeah isn't that interesting Dr because it seems like Americans aware of the problem but they don't talk to their doctor about it or alternatives is that right\n[noise] yeah I think that is that is true and I do think that the owner for stomach out on the provider as well yeah that's what we need to provide impatient\nI'll turn it is our survey so Ninety four percent that America so that's almost every American what like an alternative to that they want\n[noise] do you believe that to be true doctor given your experience because I Know people come to you in pain and opioids are the easy answer our people in fact more open in your office when you're talking to you about alternatives\n[noise]\nYeah I think that that that that that is true I I couldn't get him numbers from my practice but I can tell you I practice pain medicine and palliative medicine I see a lot of patience with both ... and chronic pain\nAnd um most patients\nI Would say there's something else I can be anything and I'm only on the medication is because I provider eighth and to me and told me that that's what I should be taken so we don't take the time to have difficult conversations with our patients\nRegarding their pain management and their benefits and alternatives of their options than cats expect them to make other choices\nDoctor you're you're here on W. H. O. because we are prescription take back day coming up on the twenty seventh really encouraging people to dispose of these opioids they're not using any more as part of the effort against this crisis of how do I properly disposed of the ... opioids that are in my house\n[noise] yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought it up yeah we are in\nFact they hear 'em twice they air that day I had to take back day where people can bring their opioid and any other medication\nUm there are other ways just for an okay wait and the FDA website and what they are a great place to look at it that people want to know that the take back in their area they look at our website\nAt Mayo Clinic dot org and we have a link there that they look at for the Boston area\nGreat I really appreciate that and Dr I Want to go back into your research I'm fascinated by this\nMayo Clinic of course is is constantly looking at guidelines for prescribing ... opioids and also a dentist find patience who may not need them can you give me an idea of what kind of guidelines Mayo is coming up with these days\nI think right questions that we have worked hard to examine what our writers provide and what are patients\nThe Dow ... average it was just a couple of minutes ago down more than five hundred points right now it's down to four hundred Seventy six points that a little under two percent was at one point eight percent almost one point nine percent yes and the five hundred down more than two percent fifty six points lower than as that composite down almost two and a half percent two point four percent\nOne hundred and Seventy nine points lower at the White House national economic council director Larry Kudlow says what's happening in the market today is nothing new\nSo called direction and I've said before it's you know these things come and go\nThat direction has to overcome the uncertainty about this election or top\nLocal story plans to complete a major cross town road are closer to approval the next step pending that in my city council going to take a vote Monday Night on the southeast connector also called the ... extension they want to move ahead with planning and design work when completed and okay we'll run\nFrom South of downtown Des Moines from flu drive all the way to highway sixty five in Pleasant Hill right now a dead end just passed the state fairgrounds Harry on thirtieth street W.

[noise]\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news traffic and severe weather station news radio ten forty\nOh we're the party the trust to battle immigration now we can't get anything done but we're the party we trust I mean there aren't really in my mind that actually is an issue in the upcoming election with immigration being at the top of voters' minds do do you see it that way\nI Do think integration is a significant focused in July ...\nIraq because all looked at ... ... ... and it was ... and it was in a Christian by a large percentage but it was the biggest one they ... at the this is the people are paying attention I think for I work in the ... and if they weren't as many as they are now putting the issue at the center for the midterm\nUh is it going to make a lot of voters they could ... your ... open borders Democrats or Republicans at minimum wage to build a wall but it was like drunk I think that's going to be a driving issue\nRight I I you know I Do put the conundrum that I think the voters in his ... at the top of their mind but I suppose what you've got Rachel is a comparison between the parties is\nSomebody that's uh talking about it and says yes I Want security and somebody that says you know this isn't really a big issue or what we're doing now Rachel is on the left\nThey're framing it as a humanitarian issue I don't\nI I mean we're all humanitarians but I think the difference here is the sheer number of people saying we're going to bring so many people that you're bored or we're going to overwhelm you that seems to pun intended Trump our feelings of humanitarian ism in this issue Rachel you looked at it what do you think\nNo I think absolutely right and I think there's a a little bit that you're not just for sheer numbers that we don't know who's in this group yeah that's the whole point of having a vetting process on our legal immigration and we don't know I\nI Am in you know the child care of and also create incredible practically\nAnybody who in order constantly dealing with sex trafficking ring trafficking and operate very near the border and all these people were coming here legally or step back to that\nKind of act with each other not just eating other your concern tell me what the patient is not necessarily jak about protection for protection for incoming a grant says well yeah\nYeah no that's putting a caravan of ... I there's no wait and\nSee that's a great point Rachel when you talk about protection for incoming immigrants because you and I in our previous conversations we sometimes broken down the political challenge for Republicans that the Republicans\nThat I'm a represent house districts that have a heavy Hispanic population but it's kind of assumed that they are they're really upset\nBy the rhetoric over the border wall but if you got here legally or is that just a stereotype good somehow you're not as concerned about illegal immigration is somebody it's been here a long time\nI apparently at so I think that never got any credible doc late in the clinical extend it with your ear infections that if you oppose illegal immigration you hate oh yeah I Am not check\nAt ... at a false device and it's completely false to begin with and I think Republicans don't you serve it to themselves when they used to call them the crap out of that\nThere are plenty of Republicans for legal immigration is actually built on it what we support 'em up you know fighting the border and and I are the country not being able to find are concerned who who kinda here I mean that's the basic issue sovereignty that countries have borders if they don't have borders their\nCountry at you know I think a lot of Republicans weren't resources at the border to deal with this issue and there's a lot well they're saying they're coming here for economic hardship graphic legal process current if those are ah were getting it right or not your typical process but even if they don't currently have the resources to accommodate haven't thousand people at one time\nRight exactly so Rachel I open up the segment by talking about Mitch McConnell going hey I'm going to really help out with this border wall funding and then start new real that back in use the pragmatic problem that he just can't get to the votes that he needs on the U.S Senate side for full funding for a border wall\nYou know I think I think like all the frustrating for the president for a lot of people that support the law is a kind of had that ... ... not ... he had that Democrat on the court it or not and you know there are ways that it can make the application\nMore painful right away or going to crack down on the ... ... ... he's\nA you know a president or ... or ... or how I think that would that would end up on the spot that Trump said look I'm not signing a think they'll at my at my corner on but we have yet to see that as well\nExactly right that is the conservative partnership senior policy director name's Rachel boulevard Rachel always the joy to talk to you about this issue let's talk again about into something gets done All right\nMy pleasure [laughter]\nWow where people down ridge Illinois right here on WHAT radio ten Fifteen times so the president went to a Texas last night to do or rallies going to these critical states\nAs the Republicans attempt to expand their majority in the U.S Senate hold onto their majority in the U.S house and of course he was down there in Texas and let's not discount here's the impact on this election\nBecause it's my understanding is I looked over this rally\nThat it was held in a building that whole Seventeen thousand people that a hundred thousand people requested tickets\nThat there was tailgating outside for all the people who couldn't get in that people were lining up the day before the rally to try to get in that's passion attached to a particular person that person being President Trump and he's trying to transfer that mode Joey if you will\nTo the various Republican candidates last night he was trying to transfer that mojo do Ted Cruz and of course on the campaign trail he called Ted Cruz lion Ted\nAnd just before leaving the media or cash a cornered the president said da you used to call them lion Ted you still wind teddy said no now he's beautiful Ted here is the transition from lying to add the beautiful Ted that went on last night in Texas\n[noise]\nIs just bigger\nTaxes are going to really [noise] a man who is become a really good friends and you know we're a little difficult [noise]\nBut actually\nIf you remember the beginning it was a love fest nobody has helped me more with your tax cuts with your regulations\nAs a large group of people they called a caravan\nIs an assault on our country this whole maybe the caravan [noise]\nOh lord\nAnd common sense today than party [noise]\nThat American citizens which is why Democrats must be voted out of office to replace freedom\nAnd they want to replace it\nWith the rule of law\nDemocrat [noise] produce Republicans for jobs in this election you can stand up\nTo the radical Democrats mess with Texas\nThere yeah President Trump tried to transfer the passion for him over to the voters I should note again\nThe jobs not mobs references which actually originated with ... Miller Iowa City you're like man that's being executive no Merle was up in the evening with Newt and he went up the new and he says I got a slogan for the next election job not mobs\nAnd he said that's great and he got up on the stage before the W. H. O. listeners the six hundred plus people there were there that night\nHe's an admiral from Iowa City nailed the job ... then he wrote about his column the next day than the president put it in the speech and then last night in tech and people were waving signs it's a job not mobs and yes that's become ironic at this particular point\nBecause there's a mob of folk Seventy two hundred of them heading toward the southern border even as we speak and as Rachel was saying earlier this hour\nThe issue or that is starting to dominate the discussion and we talked about this is our number one to among folks as immigration and who's going to handle that issue better and that has an impact\nOr as far as how people are deciding they're going to vote in this upcoming election but never discount passion for a particular candidate and its impact on the voter you got a guy President Trump's whether you like him or you don't like him hero the facts that venue last night\nHeld Seventeen thousand people there were one hundred thousand requests for tickets there were people willing to sit outside for two days to go in and see him\nThere were people willing to sit outside and watch the rally on a big screen a big tailgate party last night and his entire job the president's job at this particular point take all that passion transferred over to the Republican candidates are on the ballot and head for success in November\nComing up next super producer Emory is here on the board today I appreciate that so much because he and I can talk with the world series ten Twenty years radio ten forty is WHM\nWould've Randy in your hand in it I just want a thousand dollars [noise] I Am standing if not thousands of dollars every hour all day will have the words and another shot at a grass yeah\nIf you like me it's currently thirty nine degrees you probably have at least turned on the heat overnight in your house and it's\nOr ten thirty I'm Wendy Wild W.
