H. all radio news when they were first chosen to develop these products the state's first medical cannabis manufacturing dispenser he will start sales on December first\nWhat you're getting at here is is someone saying well your actually turning people all the way he\nReally because of their their background right\nThat's exactly right and and here's why your what you point out is still important true grades are important but also\nThe the admissions we're looking at other things such as personal rating among different racial groups now what does that mean that does that mean that I give you a high personal ratings because we have good credit on the air right and I might give\nSomebody else a little personal rating with whom I cannot establish were poor well it's open to interpretation what that means that when you inject\nPersonality factors and say well we're going to use this as a part of the admission process\nThat just lends itself to potential abuse and so it is factors like that cannot be quantified\nBut that apparently or at least according to the link to discriminate against Asian Americans that's going to be hard to defend precisely because you can't put a number on it you can't make a statistic out at that but we'll however this lawsuit and that you can bet it thought wait a minute court\nRight and that's one of the reasons why they were talking about it is because everyone now is contemplating what a more conservative Supreme Court will do with cases like that and certainly that's part of this discussion correct\nAbsolutely especially now that you had to newly appointed conservative justices on the court why wouldn't a case like this be something that they decide that even the old even before that the newly appointed justices arrived it was also something that could have been discussed\nBecause we live in a day and age where you need a college education and to say that you cannot go to a school like Harvard if you are particularly demographic\nPrecisely because you're a member of that group even if you've got great great that's problematic I'm not saying that's true that's going to be up to the judge to decide right in fact is going on at Harvard\nBut the fact that we do have lost its like this it's not the first one it's not the last one and you get that other higher institutions are looking at their own admission policies right about now making sure that they're not the next\nRight no I think that's a great point does his weekly legal we took it take a look at the um on multiple legal stories in the headlines this week in a windy I Love to travel so these these miserable customer experience is on airline stories always\nAlways attract me what's going on with British Airways here\nWell right the British Airways as you might imagine fly long distances from other countries to Great Britain and and one of those flights\nA leading from the U.S involved the man who apparently after drinking five glasses of wine takes out as exposing himself to passengers on the flight does count you can imagine\nPrompts an outrage and the passengers tried to stop him there were kids on a flight and I guess fading greater that didn't happen one our end of the flight in which case they might have turned around when the alterations started and gone right down to where they came from but somebody can practice man with ... ended up being slapped and he was arrested when they land in the u._k.\nActually with candidate next week jail sentence or a court that was the bend it for one year which often he has an incentive to stay out of trouble\nAnd I suppose the next time this man's life it's either going to have to have a zero tolerance do alcohol policy or try to go to sleep instead of the alternative\nBorders or the water or your you'll never know [laughter] I Wonder what's going on when he this morning with Britain hottest crook what is this\nRight though another story from across the ...

H. O. L. radio news or a upper court has said no no the the the ordinance is to back can't do that\nAnd so now pinky is going to go to the Iowa Supreme Court the city of Des Moines going to appeal to the Iowa Supreme Court as to whether or not they're ordinance allows them to destroy pinky\nAnd ah not only is the ordinance or the previous ruling you said it's veg but I'm I'm intrigued by the fact that he names dogs\nThat the city specifically thinks\nAre dangerous pit bulls American strapped for child terriers in Stratford child terriers as well as those with the history of biting they're considered high risk dog now here was my contention yesterday on the air and this is what prompted phone calls tax e mails what have you\nKnow this sounds to me like what I went through growing up which is like it seems like every decade has its dog the dog that you're scared of\nDoberman in the seventies in the eighties it was German shepherds now I'm being told the pit bulls are extra dangerous and I thought isn't there is a myth isn't this isn't it how the dog is treated as to ultimately how they turn out\nAt a lot of you disagreed with that a lot he said absolutely not one person said you know if you raise a pet lion Jeff don't be surprised we start to eat in the neighborhood cats\nSo people and I and I was interested in I also got reaction from folks who are farmers would say no certain dogs are brought a certain wage up and they're dangerous and you got to pick these breeds out and say that they're dangerous\nIn and and a lot of the buys these days are against pit bulls\nSo there was more support for identifying certain dangers breeds of dogs than I thought there was because I think ultimately if your dog ordinance in the city of Des Moines or any other city is not a big there should be some kind of behavior\nThat indicates to you that's a dangerous dog rather than you pick out a breed and say well that breed that just especially dangerous\nBecause high risk dogs in the city of Des Moines they're subject to special rules their owners got to carry certain levels of liability insurance\nAnd animals that get into trouble if they're a high risk dog you could say they were going to strike against them with the city of Des Moines they're in danger of being destroyed his pinky it so the Iowa Supreme Court is going to weigh in on this\nAnd my question is to you or do you think there is truly dangerous dogs or is that um is most of you disagreed with me you said yes\nCertain breeds of dogs are just dangerous based on my experience Theresa's on the line and I want to get her perspective on it so Theresa do you think certain breeds of dogs are dangerous dogs\nUm I I don't I think it I think that I mean he got ...\nCan be trained to be there might be some dogs that means they're more apt to be ... it definitely depends on how they're raised and how they're treated and\nUm I actually met a pit bull and I was I Believe I Believe that nest now than when I was afraid of him when I met him I was asked to help care for him um he was spending ... black and he just he had to carry a spark that her life right um I was less government like on one day and\nI thought oh my gosh that's going to kill me no one's going to be her down and\nHe came over and kinda ...

I didn't really do it it wasn't me I I was a ... you know the usual excuses here from everybody does terrible things\nSo then the alliance or to get these people out of Germany and get that money and get them resettled\nInto a primarily Argentina they were the big villain the ... and a Juan Peron yeah they were paid millions of dollars to let these people in the lead these Nazi killer is in and they did\nAnd then at talk individual heroes to basically mobilize the Israeli government which was worried about Arabs fighting them and they weren't even worried about the ss at that time they had to be convinced\nTo send them aside after I ran and andme Angola which they did and then we go we go you know step by step on how they track these guys that\nWell and and bill is they said this is an emotional book for me the one of the passengers that I marked was is it has to do with the Israelis you write the Israelis believe in the practice known as the law of retaliation\nAs it says in the tourist show no pity life for life I Try to spur to hand for hand foot for foot so was that ultimately the Israelis motivator to say this has been an injustice against our people and we will put the effort into finding these guys\nHere's what happened after World War two the Jews that survive in Europe many of them emigrated to Israel\nAnd they demanded ... that the Israeli government track these people down\nNow we're killing Jesus a Martin to garden I I'm killing the ancestors the eighth and the series there's seven other killing books out Seventeen million copies in print\nThe most successful non fiction book series in history ... when we rode killing Jesus we establish a very strong relationship with the Israeli government which helped us immeasurably in writing that book we went back to them\nFor killing the ss and they opened up the Mossad files that nobody's seen and that's why we were able to get such detail in tracking these people down and knowing that the poor Jews that survived the Holocaust and Europe when they came to Israel and nothing\nAll right and they were devastated because ... family members were killed and all that but they after awhile said to the Israeli government hey you got to get these guys you have to track them down and that pressure was why the massage swung into action and finally did it\nThe book is called killing the ss the hunt for the worst war criminals in history Bill O'Reilly is my guest ten Fifteen is our time bill it would be a I I have to since I have some time with you I Need to ask you about current events that I Want to get a perspective you\nBecause you wrote in the ... when I Would term to be an emotional column in the aftermath of the cabinet and hearing where you called it a debacle and you said it's going to have some real permanent change uh for our country in the future\nOr give me an idea of what you think the long term damage was is over the the Kavanaugh Ford hearing that we all witnessed\n\nNope I just lost him for some reason I Hope it wasn't my question that offended him\nBut to see if he gives me a call back with the book is called killing the ss the hunt for the worst war criminals in history your author is Bill O'Reilly along with his co author mark do gone as he said this is a continuation in the series of books\nOr that bill has written with Martin do guard that have been incredibly successful and sometimes people look at it do what they think his bills political bias and they go oh I don't know if I should read it and then once they get in their hands they go these are amazing books\nSo ah the this is yet an amazing book and as I said for me personally this was an emotional book in regard to\nHunting down the ss okay my super producer egg says he will be back\nMe in a moment we'll get back to talking to bill O'Riley about what he thinks is the aftermath of the Kavanaugh hearing you do want to remind you a little bit later in the hour on the program a mostly going to have the lead to cast members of the love never die the Broadway series is back again in downtown Des Moines and we'll be talking to lead cast\nMembers that play bill is back with me on the ... news make lines are\nBuilt out that somebody's uh sabotaging it I mean [laughter] so it was an excellent question you posed Jeff and and I'll run down for you okay\nUm the cabinet situation I'm basically showed the entire country\nThat the Democratic party at this point doesn't really care about due process and the presumption of innocence now I'm not I don't know what happened and I've never criticized Christine Ford for coming forward and saying what she said because I don't know\nBut in this country if you have a denial issued you have to take that seriously\nYou can say oh I don't believe that they're not\nUnless there are facts that you can see\nAnd as far as justice Kavanaugh is concerned there were no facts known collaboration non you saw an entire party the Democrats condemn them at and in the process damage him his wife his children his parents and you can imagine because I've been in that situation\nI've been accused and I said very clearly\nI didn't do anything wrong item mistreat anyone I was not given the presumption of innocence for political reasons the same thing happened a cabin on a much larger scale\nSo how will this play out for the country number one I think there is a backlash right now and I think you're going to see that in the November midterm right I think the Democratic party has lost all momentum and independent voters are leaning GOP because they're angry about what they saw in the cabinet hearings\nNumber two I asked my staff on Bill O'Reilly dot com to find me one elected official in the Democratic party one one\nThat stood up for due process and the presumption of innocence we could not find one in the Democratic party and I'm a registered independent\nOkay not a Republican in the Democratic party is going to tell the nation we don't believe in the fundamental rights of due process for accused people they're finished\nIn this country that is a human rights for Americans that was built into the constitution by the founders no\nDoubt about it and you'll get me to all day long you can accuse all day long you can scream all day long but Americans want\nThat presumption of innocence and that is the big effect on the Kavanaugh as you put it debacle because it was\nWell and bill here's why I'm with you on that and we're obviously having us\nBack and forth in the country about whose behavior we should be more outraged about it seems to me if you're going to have a competition\nThe biggest thing is that people are upset over the lack of respect for due process and just like you said and people are capable of complex thought this is not\n[noise]\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news traffic and severe weather station news radio ten forty would you have\nIt's ten thirty I'm Kristin Scott O
