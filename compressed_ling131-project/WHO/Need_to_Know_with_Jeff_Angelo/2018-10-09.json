traffic and severe weather see news radio ten forty doubled you\nNine o'clock I'm Wendy Wild WHM radio news still some\nRain kind of clogging marine behind it sixty three degrees are topical story this hour with all the heavy rain yesterday more today there could be flooding in much of the central two thirds of the state most of Iowa is in a flood watch heaviest rain is expected to come in a path that does include to mind\nWas unusual to ration of heavy rain for for any time of year certainly we're seeing unusual let's not unprecedented rainfall amounts of parts of central Iowa\nNational Weather service meteorologist Jim leave they have some maps that show the path\nTuesday for weeks from today because it's very clear we've now seen the Democrats playbook if they take over the house they will not only starting patriots proceedings against this president\nBut they now have a notion of starting impeachment proceedings against judge Kavanaugh justice ... this is what's on their agenda the American people in the people of Iowa or too smart for that and they know that the only path forward for economic security homeland security national security it's some Republicans back to Washington\n[noise] gory let me ask you about the judge Kavanaugh situation and its impact on the race either women are really really mad at the president and Republicans note the shock on the left the to his comments last night the president's comments apologizing\nTo justice cabin on saying he's an innocent man or the Republicans are really fired up and this makes a huge impact on the U.S house I really respect your knowledge in this area Corey what do you think\nWell I think this Jeff I travel around the country a lot often with the president or the vice president and what I've seen in the last couple of weeks\nShe judge Kavanaugh has initial hearing and then he was called back the second time is Republicans are completely unified and one thing they know that the Democrats\nAre making a mockery of our election system in a mockery of what they did to him whether you're an establishment Republican in surgery Republican the Trump Republican uh Reagan Republican uh Bush Republican it doesn't matter this has galvanized the Republican base to turn out and vote because I Do think there was a ...\nOf complacency all of a success at this administration has put forth\nWasn't exciting people which to me it's a little mind boggling when you look at the economic numbers and the staggering low unemployment rate but the the Kavanaugh fight in Washington led by Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins and Mitch McConnell all very diverse all very different types of senators\nThat fight has galvanized the Republicans to make sure they're showing up on election day so the Democrats cannot due to the present and judge Kavanaugh what they are pledging to do if they take over\n... let's talk about the substance of tonight's rally the president will be announcing that he will order rulemaking for either team to be made available year round he's also announced a series of a of a trade deals in the last couple of weeks\nAnd adjust yesterday Cory Booker was in in Iowa talking to farmers WHM radio news at the top of this I was reporting that talking about how bad things have been for farmers and how bad it's been under this administration these are some timely announcements aren't they and they have an impact on the rural vote\n... they have a huge impact on the rural vote and you have to remember\nFor too long the farmers of our country had been forgotten because it was never a priority of the Obama administration\nTo understand how important our farming culture was\nLook whether it's dairy farmers in Wisconsin who are getting hit with a three\nHundred percent tariff if they were trying to sell their products up into Canada or soybean farmers or corn farmers are F. at all where we are now this president understands that we have to be self sustaining that's why he has helped bring back manufacturing jobs he's made sure farmers have the tools necessary he's cut\nA the death tax so that small farmers don't have to worry after they died about handing their land over to the government or having to sell it to pay their taxes\nThis president understands the importance of our agriculture community and that's why he's making the announcement just before he gets on the plane to head out to Iowa today\nOne more question for you Korea because you're aware of this as anybody else I've seen a lot of talk on social media yesterday about the quiet Trump voter you know there's such social pressure to not admit\nYou're voting for Donald Trump as we're talking about pulling in the surveys that are out there used to think worry the person that will go to the boots and vote for Donald Trump but it isn't too loud about it because all the social pressure applied against the Trump voter\nJust there's no question there is a hidden Trump voter and the reason those people stay hidden is because of exactly what you just alluded to the pressure that they feel if they say we're supporting Trump they call them racist they calm Xena phobic they call them you know every name in the book but what they did the Kanye West\nYeah who was hosting Saturday Night live you know they called him a racist because he put a make America great again hat on again right when you don't agree with the left position they inundate you\nName calling so there is a hidden Trump voter just think back two years ago right now it was just after the second presidential debate with Hillary Clinton the mainstream media said Donald Trump's chances of getting two hundred and Seventy ... electoral votes were under one percent\nThey didn't he didn't get two hundred and Seventy electoral votes he got three hundred and seven electoral votes and beat Hillary Clinton who only two hundred and thirty two so\nThat the Trump people are very sophisticated they're tired of listening to the fake news the media that has a a biased against this president and they turn out on election day because they love their country\nAs Corey Lewandowski was the campaign manager for Donald Trump for president two thousand sixteen he's also New York times best selling author his book is called let Trump be Trump Corey always a pleasure to talk to you thanks very much ...\nThank you would enjoy the rally tonight\nAbsolutely and he's right it takes me back to an interview that I did with a report or one of the very few reporters that was out there still Halleck was his name\nOr talking about ah maybe this is Trump thing this was during the Trump Clinton raised reasons I I don't know I think there's some legitimacy to this\nAnd the reason that he was saying that he talked to me about that after the election was over ... was the number of people at the rallies how early they showed up and stayed in line\nAnd the enthusiasm of the rallies and Corey was just alluding to that again the energy that gets injected into voters\nWhen the president does these rallies so it is a factor once again\nAnd certainly that factor is going to play\nIn Iowa tonight now coming up a little bit later in the hour it's the chair of the Iowa Democratic party my friend Choi price\nHe may have a different viewpoint on all this and I'd love to hear from him and his perspective as well you keep it right here on this program don't forget about that evening with Newt Gingrich it is coming up on Monday October Fifteen to get started forty dollars\nAnd you can get more information and get those tickets man they are going like ice hockey that's still a thing to say\nGo to an evening with new dot com an evening with new dot com return to a lifestyle story now this is very interesting with the technology in our world\nThat day new analysis of activity levels say nearly two out of three kids spend more than two hours a day looking at screens\nAnd this analysis says that these kids the more time that they ... they did they are looking at a screen\nThe worst they perform on memory language and thinking tests than kids who spend less time in front of

want to you to know that I'm a folks have a better chance of winning does Newt Gingrich ticket says I Will not\nBe entering the contest I I'd rather talk about it if you were sitting there but you know my radio and then I Do try and I are a threat to our friends and we are one\nOf the this is the thing that I always talk about all the time which is I don't I don't consider the people that I disagree with ideologically on some things while agreeing with them on other things to be my enemy and I always enjoy when he takes the moment during a very very busy campaign season\nTo give me the Democratic take on things so let's talk about first of all the impact which is being debated hotly across this nation Troy about the Kavanaugh hearings and their impact either you believe that women were very very upset about it or Republicans were very very upset about it give me the Democratic view what do you think\nIn your posted at the Iowa Democratic party what is the capital here he's what effect ... is it going to have on the upcoming\nElection well you know it's incredibly sad that this issue is dividing our nation but you know we've been seeing an increasingly polarized electorate here over the last several years anyway\nBut I Will say that I don't think that this is going to have a huge impact on the election okay and here's why because I think people are incredibly concerned about what's happening to them what's happening to their pocketbooks what's happening to their communities what's happening to their schools what's happening to their to themselves with their friends who happened to be on Medicaid\nOr what's happening with the economy right now I think that's what people are concerned about and that's what people are going to go to the ballot box about I think that you know this has certainly been the focus over the last couple of a last couple of weeks last month or so\nBut I think hum as we get closer to election day um people are going to be looking at what's who's going to stand up for them and that's what I think people are going to vote on this year so\nWe talk also about the president appearing at a rally tonight in Council Bluffs of course\nYou believe that uh if you're a Trump supporter in Iowa this is energizing the troops get them go to the polls are early voting started yesterday but from a democratic perspective how do you see the president's visit does it have again any kind of impact on the upcoming election\nWell I think it will and I think it will serve as a reminder that Republicans here in this state have been um you know lock step with the with the president\nOr for the two years that he's been in office and before he took office and I think people are frustrated by that and people are upset about that so I Do think that will have an impact particularly it'll help solidify an energized further\nThe Democrats out there and those folks in the middle who are tired of the president's antics whether it's making fun of or or making fun of people as we saw last week mocking um mocking people after the U.S around her for gas or forward Jeff I'm whether it's a his just kind of a bombastic behavior his uh\nLet me ask

I I I think a bite of a I I Will say a bite of a sugar\nOr like that will give you temporary relief from your anger in this but you're going to drop off again in a hurry right right I don't think that with real actual hole ... so\nA great commercial but but I I Would prefer you have a a a pack of ... and a banana in your bag or at your desk drawer than those stickers bar or some imminent\nAnd we've all been her doctor by check when we're trying to manage our diets that little meals throughout the day are are are advisable so is that part of what you're recommending here when you're talking about the ... and the banana and what have you that we can maintain\nA sense of wellbeing and a sense of energy by my little snack throughout the day as long as we're smart about those snacks\nHundred percent right that that we much rather you eat\nMultiple times during the day multiple small meals versus\nTwo or three large meals where you're going along this is in between you and your body's burning metabolized and the food and you're running low on energy and and some people get angry some people get a headache when they're when they're droughts like that yeah it can actually turn into physical symptoms not just emotional symptoms\nAh but yeah so the avocados all groups\nWhole grain no carbohydrate there've been kind of get beat up here in the past five or ten years but all these high protein diet or what we need some carbs right but we have to have some carbohydrates for our bodies that we want to make sure that there are complex carbs not\nSimple carbs like sugar and and sodas are what are you guys stay in Iowa so those are popular\nWe say pot where what part of the country [laughter] so uh\nThere there's very little difference to your brain between a glass of coke and a glass of apple juice it's\nIdentical in terms of sugar ... and people think oh I'm going to drink fruit juice because it's good for me but they take out all the fibers do all your drinking sugar sugar water so let's eat an apple instead of drink juice and drink some water from going that\nAbsolutely that is healthy living expert Dr David ... is very interesting comments and all of this and stuff we can take through the office throughout the day Dr by Jack thanks very much for joining me have a great day\nTo have ...\nSo that is interesting eating smart eating throughout the day and being smart about what you're eating\nUm and and yeah he is talking about of course uh the ... a lotta people hit the caffeine nothing wrong with that I usually have a pop that is how I say a pop with my lunch\nBut I'm also a I got a lot of fruit at the opposite as well to non really continue the eating theme coming up next because restaurants are now putting items on the menu\nThat are cannabis derived this is the next big thing cannabis derived products including food on your restaurant menu I'll talk to a guy who markets these products and what the appeal is that is coming up next the need to know what Jeff Angelo news radio ten forty W.

H. Joe newsmakers aligned Michael thanks for joining me today good morning\nGood morning how are you\nI'm doing terrific the the the basic question you may be expecting you give me an idea of the difference between the traditional MBA degree and the e MBA degree what is what's the difference here\nAbsolutely it's a great place to start though when you\nThink of the full time traditional MBA program it's typically for someone in their mid twenties that not working or quit their job goes back to school full time maybe even living on campus executive m._b._a. is designed for working professional demographic we serve their thirty eight years old on average about fourteen years of work experience\nThe nearly nine years of management experience with much different set of individuals that are sitting in the classroom\nAnd you're studying this Michael as the executive director of this executive m._b._a. council you got to two thousand Eighteen survey out a share some of the the highlights of of your findings here\nAbsolutely one of the things that we find interesting and exciting report on while these program certainly are still face to face more and more programs or injecting a distance learning component about fifty four percent of our members are now let me think technology in the classroom\nSo why do you think that these are are trending these programs and Michael is this have to do with the global economy than we're operating in I I I just think of a time where people were very impressed with an MBA and it still is impressive but now going to an e NBA I think that probably has to do with the state of our new economy and my right\nIt is that part of it and certainly what one of the things that the hallmark of executive m._b._a. program is teaching\nGlobalization and the classroom but then it something more than that many programs will offer an experiential that will emerge students than some geography outside of their home geography as a way of studying business on the ground certainly that is true but beyond that we're finding is working professionals\nIn the competitive environment that we live in a realizing that even though they may have had a great career so far they need to do something to increase their professional development and lifelong learning is something that is for everyone", "show_name": "Need to Know with Jeff Angelo", "year": "2018", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "09"}
