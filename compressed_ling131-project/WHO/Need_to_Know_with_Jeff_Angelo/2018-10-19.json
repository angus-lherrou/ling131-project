H. O. channel Thirteen coming up\nThat when he reaches top local story this hour in overnight police standoff in Indian ... ended peacefully according to police\nOh there were jets and be a big houses so it was a route it just kept making it to get another half million or get out\nOf all I Would never buy ads yet I Would never think of that [laughter] I like hers people's\nPeople start to people start to spend the money right yeah they get where\nWhere does it all go and uh we're told and right after I said hey you got about eight eight grand a year at the evidence that interest or eighty grand mud right or if you spent less than eighty you'll never run out he uh he managed to spend a little more than that\nHe's like I'm Still getting the jet really I Would fly first class I Would not by a jet that is amazing and and Spencer where your talk or in the media about possibly setting up a trust if you win this kind of money is Adam ... is that a good thing to do\nWell ... it spurs an estate planning a CPA conversation right yeah\n... if it probably it took about forty five days a I Believe that the better part of a month maybe a little longer for him to actually get paid so\nUh you don't want to spend yourself into oblivion before you actually get the check yeah and that may be time to find a good estate planning attorney in it at a good tax attorney and talked about charity planning and tax planning along with uh the different types of trust there is about five different\nTrust that would that would support all of a state tax control\nOr but you gotta biggest state tax problem and yet with\nYeah and and so Spencer we've all seen the publicity\nWhen somebody wins and days go by and the media says well this person hasn't come forward this person hasn't come forward and they finally come forward I assume that's because they're putting a financial team together so who should be on my team when I when mega millions today\nWell you know the the estate planning attorney the CPA financial advisor and you know and there are ways to climate without disclosing who you are right right you're going to want they're going to want you in the press yeah and then and then you're going to have to hide it won a\nPrivacy so ah hopefully somebody can claim that Don I'm asleep but that that takes a little planning time and a team of or at least the team to three professionals\nOkay and so finally Spencer it's hilarious to me whenever I look at these stories and I see what the lump sum option was after taxes then I go man that's a lot\nSo I I imagine some of the advice you have to give is how you actually can avoid paying too much taxes\nIn this case yeah because the the immediate tax bill which which we found was somewhat honest capable you know would take five hundred and forty eight million\nAre down to approximately three call it three hundred and fifty million uh\nYou know as a as a as a pro states' so don't go spend\nFive hundred right at and your odds you know I don't want to talk about the tax on the mathematically literate but that's what a lottery is\nRight right right so we already we're not good at math and and we're going to pay of basically a voluntary tax tonight you being honest about that and I guess the other advice based on your experience\n'cause there is such a thing Spencer and you're describing it as sudden wealth syndrome when we talk about you know somebody buying jets which I think is crazy but when you got that much money I guess it does make you a little bit crazy based on your experience right\nYeah well Warren Buffett all rancher jet with ... and you don't have to keep it up and it just spend issue which\nPrompted by idea [laughter] I'll keep my Netflix subscription going and rent a jet that sounds great that is Spencer we go and he is senior portfolio manager for the McGowan group Asset Management\nSpencer thanks for sharing your experience with us um and I I might be talking to you this weekend look for a phone call for me\nIf you're a lot of fun for the opportunity\nNo problem at all coming up to open up the ten o'clock hour I'm going to talk to a gaming lawyer because your co workers like Wendy are trying to talk you into an office pool now I'm not saying that's totally bad\nBut there is some pitfalls you need to be aware of and you probably can guess what the number one pitfall if what if your co workers don't want to give you the money anymore so\nThat's an issue nine Fifteen is our time and by the way yes I got a tax on the American top ... why did he say the lottery draw news this morning he was wrong I didn't want to get down a rabbit trail with him on this because we have specific topic to talk about\nBut no the lottery the the mega millions drawing is tonight\nAnd by the way if you heard Mary new Bower with the Iowa Lottery earlier this week she also warn you about the mega millions drawing which is that an hour before they draw is when you got to buy your ticket if you if you\nIf you buy your ticket with a with in an hour of the drawing that's for the next drawing you don't want to find that\nOut after you got the winning number so you got to buy your mega millions ticket an hour\nBefore the drawing before that hour and then of course you've got Powerball tomorrow night so you've been thinking about it let's have some fun it's a friday give me a call what would you do with the money would you buy jets what else would you do with the money five one five to eight for ten forty is my number to call\nAlso um you can text me in the American top ... percent accessories text line that's five one five Ninety nine ten forty you win tonight or tomorrow or I'm planning to win both what do you do with the money well what have you

year Monday Night Newt Gingrich came brought to you by ... by WHM radio brought you by our American stories\nAnd you may have thought that's that's kind of hype and it isn't it Jeff how no let me tell you why this morning president Donald Trump tweeted\nOut of hashtags hashtags jobs not mobs jobs not mobbed you know where that has tag originated at an evening with Newt Gingrich it was a guy from Iowa City he went up to Newt Gingrich\nAnd he said jobs not mobs and Newt Gingrich brought it up in his speech said man daddy is affective phrasing their job not mobs and then he put it in a national column that I read to you on Fox News dot com jobs not mobs\nGuess what the president tweeted out as a ... attack this morning after\nSaying it jobs not mobs in a rally last night that phrase

Harper next year\nYeah no you're never too yeah if there Rick short interested I'd probably by the end City Royals\nJust yeah and that and it wouldn't it the four hundred million would probably be actually too much they'd be shocked\nOffered them really don't have money left over to get Bryce Harper [laughter] Doug\nThanks for a ticket in Eric you wind up Powerball or the mega millions are both what would you do with the money\nI Would take the money and run and disappear you just disappear I Would\nJust go off the grid I find some acreage at a log cabin at just absolutely run ...\nYeah I I just friends and relatives who'd come knocking said come out of the woodwork to no man like\nGosh I feel like we're all ...

till\nTen o'clock I'm Christian most gun O W H A radio news fifty one degrees and cloudy ... breaking news right now with Wendy Wild who's got a additional information about an arson fire that killed two girls in western Iowa Wendy\nCourt Alabama said it was an oral contract but it was on it forced because family is are we going out there so\nJust make sure you your check your basis or the one thing to do is get it in writing\n[laughter] so you're right because everybody's going around today drew right and there is telling each other let's pull our money but you actually do have to get it right [laughter]\nYeah but I mean I think it's a billion dollars right so if if you're getting involved\nAnd you got twenty people are involved and you're putting five dollars then hundred you know hundred dollar cool make sure that if they'd riding hey I Know what my ... okay I've got five dollars into a hundred dollars or five percent\nOf the wedding and you know it\nIt's very easy to send emails and get these things in writing and have everybody agree\nRight okay so that makes sense to me you know somebody emails around the office and says do you want to chip in five bucks\nAnd ultimately you would hope there'd be an email that said okay we got this much total money so your percentage of the winning is what the your percentage of what you put in that should be in an email somewhere\nYeah exactly you take your money about it by the total ... you know so to purchase price and that's going to be your percentage pay up\nBecause drew what I think is the situation would come up is when people are throwing money in office pool\nOne guy throws in twenty and another person puts in ten and then you all think okay there's ten people I'm going to divide it up in ways you don't want the guy would tend to get more than he put in that that actually could happen that's great advice\nAbsolutely another another good thing to take a a ... you got to have you got somebody out of the office and you've been running the school for two years and they've been in every in every week you know or ... years and then they happen to be out\nThis week make sure you you reach out to them and say or just cover up and just say hey that can pay me back at another time but make stricter reach out to him and get an email saying that they want to pass because if you don't you're going to end up in court yeah and you know the last one was settled for it underscores\nThem out but of course you know there's precedent there from the past with them being involved and they were out on medical leave there are going to have some sort of you know we can go way back then\nI Want to go back to that Alabama waitress drew 'cause you said it was her money so did she get to keep the money and she didn't have to hand it out\nCorrect she cashed it in [laughter] don't workers filed suit against search and Alabama said it was no real contract but it's unenforceable so she kept the money\nWell and and now is a big point drew in this this lines up with what the financial advisor told me last hour and what you're saying which I think is just smart you can say all day how you're going to act\nWhen you when that kind of money of course someone to share it with my co workers but then when you actually have the money people's mental state changes don't doesn't it\nAbsolutely there will be blood\nAgree so high dreams you're doing now people change I absolutely absolutely any other things in my drew because really this has been great practical advice\nYeah here's here's a good thing to make sure you check 'cause we're all doing this but of course wouldn't it be great to be a billionaire yeah ... you know multi multi millionaire with some of your friends in the office something you need to check though\nWith the age our department read your code of conduct because if for some reason you charge something that was fun it is something that you know get your reprimanded\nYou know ride opera or possibly firing you don't want it to happen and on\nTop of that Cornell law a statement saying that any active duty government employee or if you're if it takes place on government owned or at least property ... is president\nSo stay away from the polls if you're on duty or if you're on government property\nMan that is all great advice and I think maybe I opening advice for a lot of listeners that's expert on legal way during his name is Drew Altman drew thanks very throw it in this morning I appreciated that was very good advice we'll talk to you again soon\nTake care of a great day\nYou bet we're coming up on ten Fifteen so there you go a lot of caviar to that\nBut I thought like number one would be have that email because seriously you think about it right ten people chip in to the to the to the pool\nAnd I imagine what you want to do to take care of yourself as everybody has to chip in the same amount you decide if you're the organizer like five bucks ten bucks what have you because you can't have Bob chip in in twenty\nAnd Jane chipping in ten and everybody says oh we're going to split this up now ten wage new that's not how it works the other good advice which I never thought about is if you've been doing the office pool for weeks in somebody's out you got to make him an offer to get in otherwise they are going to get their money as he was saying\nLet us talk now I'm a switch to an Iowa topic ah that is very very interesting this is really I think historic December first medical marijuana goes on sale in Iowa\nAnd a a company is now ready to produce it and is ready to roll it out and in fact did roll it out there is a article on WHM radio dot com which involves the products they rolled out the company is called mad farm Iowa Lucas Nelson's back with me on the ... news making line Lucas thanks for joining me how are you my friend\nGreat great thanks for having me how you doing\nI'm doing great I got I got some questions that I'm looking at the W. H. O. radio article Lucas so I noticed that on the products for example there are these numbers twenty to one to two one one one one Twenty one of those numbers what do they mean\nThat those are the ratios of the two main can have annoyed that will uh be that will exist in our products\nAnd that's the BP is the first number of years theme okay and ... is the second\nNumber you're saying and then really what those are going to be probably the easiest way for patients to quickly identify what product they're looking at what product that by what they're taking and ultimately what a that product is going to be here for and what symptoms that may treat\nAnd so if you're talking about our twenty to one product you're talking about wanting part DVD for every one part ... the\nThose are gonna that's gonna be a great product for someone suffering for ... years or or Parkinson's or maybe someone who needs an anti inflammatory properties and their medicine and then at the other end of the spectrum\nAre looking at are wanting to twenty product you'll have one part D and on the part he H. D. and that's going to be really good for someone suffering from from pain from cancer maybe or\nOr other chronic pain and then of course we also have a balanced ratio that the equal parts B.D and THC and\nI think that will really be a good product for people who maybe have never tried to medical cannabis product before and um you know are looking at what role best suit them and what's going to work for them and what we really wanted to do is give people a lot of options for their treatment\nSo the most THC right now that I can get a product Lucas is Twenty one twenty product you were describing how much THC isn't a joint\nI mean of course the big debate is over does this stuff get you high or not well how much THC actually isn't a joint at this point\nSure so if you look at a recreational market like some of the states out in the west coast or go to the anything or in a joint from maybe two hundred to two to three hundred ... milligrams of th the and then are the highest a dose of PHD you\nCan get is ... milligram ... one of our tactical\nSo significant difference and I think you're right it's important that that we kind of draw the line between what's recreational what's medical and and obviously this medical program here in Iowa and that's what we're focused on that's how we developed a product with those symptom relief for those approved conditions in mind\n[noise] now Lucas I think there is going to be some confusion around the December one day because um people are going to wonder how they can access your product now it's my understanding that the doctor doesn't actually prescribe the dose of the medical marijuana so how do I access the product\nThat's exactly right and it's certainly been a a point of a sudden this uncertainty around the program but ah but indeed the doctor is not prescribing medical cannabis but he or she mentally certifying that the patient has one of the qualifying conditions okay so\nThe the process starts by going to your doctor and having that conversation about whether this is a treatment\nOr that you may want to you know that you might want to try and the doctor ... on the department of public health form that do indeed have one of those ... are one of the approved conditions at once you've done that\nIt's simply a matter of turning that information along with some other identifying information into the state that will approve your card and then you've got to go pick up the physical card from the department of transportation and it's with that card that will actually be able to walk into the dispensary check in\nAnd and finally buy a product or here in December\nOkay and it was approved conditions that's a fairly small list right now isn't it Lucas\nIt really is there was only there is only nine or only approved or the state advisory board along with the board of medicine have a provided some I guess\nWhat I'll call initial approval okay sorts of ... um which would be potential condition that'll still have to work its way through the administrative process or we're still talking about several months before that and the condition is added but but you're exactly right right now we've got a ...\nSmallest there's actually compared with even some of our neighbors like Minnesota in Illinois\nPut in traffic all day I'm Eric has more on this report is powered by for never bred\nMelted honestly yogurt cheese on freshly baked one hundred percent clean bagel then sliced hosted in covered with cream cheese sound good visit your local up an Arab bakery cafe or order online for rapid pick up a narrow food as it should be [noise]\nLight rain is expected before noon today than this time will clear at the cold front approaches this state than when shaping toward the northwest you can expect hides in the middle sixties with a clearing staying overnight bringing morning let us back into the lower forties\nSaturday will be mostly sunny that even windy here in the northwest winnable gas near thirty five miles per hour with ties in the lower fifties\nWhen will set back toward the south last for Sunday but the mostly sunny sky high will be in the middle fifties that your latest news radio ten forty W.
