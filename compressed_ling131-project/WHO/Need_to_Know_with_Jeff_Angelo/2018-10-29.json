H. O.\n[noise] don't want to wait Joe ... and I arch radio station and on your age the radio ... to\nW. H. O.\nGot retirements on your mind to discover five retirement planning issue you should pay attention to market volatility ever healthcare landscape and much more take the first step in your retirement\nPlanning journey sex retirement to five one five to want to twenty six Seventy six to get the Freeh report that five retirement planning issue sex retirement\nFive one five to one to two six seven seven\nInvestment advisory services for ... financial for being a registered investment advisor not affiliated with any governmental agency\nAnd gallons of ethanol demand with secret waivers granted the big oil a massive get paid for by farmers\nStruggling to keep their farms if President Trump is going to do right by his promise to support American farmers his administration must move quickly on e Fifteen and support that increases and biofuels\nChoose not to touch ... these are tough times for the American far we need the president to keep his word on biofuels and paid for by the national farmers union [noise]\nThat's affected me what this proposal ways out it's not a price fixing thing or or or even a legislative requirement on on certain aspects of how the pharmaceutical industry operates it's the federal government saying we buy forty percent of all the drugs in the United states\nWe're going to start out like a consumer and we're going to say that we're going to pay what your charging the other foreign nationality\nAnd they can do that that there isn't it like use it all like it or lump it proposition for the the drug companies where they say look we're going to go with this average price and you guys are going to take it do they have that this government have that power\nWell isn't the government ultimately does have the power to get even so far as price fixing if it wants to I think what the Trump Administration has tried to do is not go there and just try to use their heavy hand at the beginning here\nSo that that's the biggest piece of this the devil's always in the details on how this ultimately ends up playing out and I want to be clear this specific to drugs that are part of Medicare part\nD okay be them boys so for a member of theirs\nMain part of Medicare is the part D program that really got its of all met through during the Bush administration\nSo that part D program is is your standard drug Lipitor for blood pressure medication for that and all that fun stuff right\nThese are drugs that are administered with in doctors' offices which are typically the most expensive drugs these or cancer drugs multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis these are drugs that cost thousands upon thousands now I've long said that the way that the government pays for these drugs is wrong\nThe White House came out with a white paper the beginning of the year that said it's wrong because it instead of five as doctors to use doctor administered drugs because the pay them six percent commission\nI'm using that so Dr realizes if I've got a Medicare patient I could put them on a standard medication or I can put them on a doctor administered medication if I go that route I'm going to make more money\nAnd so there's an adverse incentive towards Medicare part B covered drugs then there are part D and so what the Trump Administration has done and said we're gonna start small here we are going to focus solely on drugs within the part B system and we're going to say that whatever the\nThe pharmaceutical industry is charging foreign markets is the maximum the heartbeat will reimburse for this\nSo Seth I you don't want to overstate what ... what will happen as a result of this policy but you've been an advocate over and over again right here on WHAT radio for going to a more consumer base system so obviously you believed there would be some impact on prices right\n[noise] I Do I Do so let's put it into perspective once again just always like to do so yeah the Medicare system is about five hundred and eighty three billion dollars a year\nThat's what the the federal government spends on Medicare\nUh ha chess and AIDS or came out and said this is going to save roughly Seventeen billion over five years so in perspective this is one third of one percent of the annual ice budget\nSo we're not talking about this cataclysmic ship but it all starts with a first step yeah this is that step and I love seeing that the administration has finally saying hey we wrote this white paper back in February\nAnd now we're going to start acting upon it and this is a great first step\nWell and Seth you are one of the people that comes on W. H. O. radio and over and over again says that health care is not insurance health care is not insurance and I know it's an effective message because people are texting it back to me now\nWhen we do health care segments which is great because this is according you know this is along the lines that philosophy whereas this administration seems to be trying to get at cost rather than focusing on insurance am I correct\nThat's absolutely right so if you look at the Medicare system as an insurance policy doesn't work right\nThat this whole methodology and proposal doesn't work well the government is doing is saying no we are Uncle Sam and we are your largest consumer we are your largest buyer therefore we're going to ... power and listen this is what Donald Trump ran on is his ability from a business perspective to leverage and\nAnd and to run things like a business and that's what he's doing here this is the proposal it's hey we argue is all just consumer this you are charging a consumer over here that is a fraction of us\nAre a lot less we're going to pay that price\nSo says what would indicate success because I Would imagine based on what you're saying that this affects part B that this is a small step they want to see what the impact is and then maybe take a wider so they're going to be monitoring prices what do you think the next step would be\nIt's going to be monitoring price now here's the only negative right so I I I Love the fact that come on your show the positive but I Do need to if he was a little bit of potential negativity here okay not that I Want to be realistic\nIn these pharmaceutical companies now and I've talked about on your show had a lot of hands and their cookie jar right there's a lot the insurance markets that the distributors the prescription benefit managers everybody got their hand in this\nIt's not likely they're going to wake up tomorrow and say you know what we're willing to take a loss of our profit\nYeah I Do we need to watch how this impacts the private market the ones that you and I are part of\nRight because if the pharmaceutical company says that's fine if I'm gonna get less from Uncle Sam I got to get more from somebody else ... right yeah that's the unintended consequences here so\nI think that listen success overall is that we start to see these infusion drugs these drugs administered in doctors' offices these things the overall cost goes down these are thousands of dollars a month they need to go down the ... second step but there's two step process you know Jeff from Texas we're always talking about the two step by\nStep one lower Cosby a better consumer step to let's infuse transparency so that way the private market doesn't foot the bill the same process has to apply the private market as\nWell right so what the consumer on and watch for South is they do this if the news starts reporting that you'd the drugs you pay for are going up then you know the fix is in the prescription drug companies are trying to get it from use some other way\nThat's right which is why I think a week before right the administration came out and said they want some sort of a company started ... start having to post the cost of their drugs\nRight ads and so this is all part of the ...\nPart of the process and that's great this is infusing transparency that says what free market how free markets systems work that are effective and so this is the second step we gotta make sure that one doesn't happen without the other do otherwise all we're doing is taking the money from one pocket and moving it over to the other\nHealthcare experts evidence and he is from Texas and ... you're right to talk about it in regard to a two step what they missed ration seems to be rolling out a week after week after week one step at a time so it does seem to be this is a this is a this is a comprehensive process isn't it\nIt is and I'm loving it let's keep talking about the more it's on the forefront of everybody's mind and started changing this as it was and this is the big things the Trump Administration is doing different than the Obama administration the Obama administration while we can talk about the nobility of what they were trying to do with the Affordable CARE Act focused on only the finance system it didn't focus on health care\n[noise] healthcare experts that done since that's always a pleasure to talk to you let's talk again soon thanks Geoff\nTen Seventeen I Try to be your ... sanity in this crazy political world I'm about to do that once again\nYou aren't noticing what I Am noticing and I use the phrase political theater because you know that the coastal liberal media and the liberal politicians\nWould like to manipulate ... manipulate you and the only thinking one way about something and we're just too smart for that we just don't get credit for it but we are too smart for that here's what I'm referring to so\nIn the last few weeks we watched the behavior of the left in regard to the cabinet nominations and many people began to say wow\nLiberal mob mob not jobs\nThat phrase actually originated here in Iowa\nAnd the media said Republicans homes by characterizing behavior on the left as mobs idol thing and then you had panels on CNN going up these Republicans are just trying to fire of the voters were not mops never mind that over the weekend\nA Trump supporters in California came out of a Trump rally and were ... they were\nNever mind that in Tennessee Marsha Blackburn called for\nA moment of silence because of the synagogue shooting and hecklers\nFor her opponent yelled at her during the moment of silence never on these Republicans who they're All right\nSo in the past couple of weeks tragedy in regard to am evil man mailing bombs to Democrats prominent Democrats\nAnd a guy going an anti Semite going into a synagogue and shooting up people\nAnd the media really said how has President Trump possibly to blame for that nobody says Democrats opponents on blah blah blah no no the question just is how is President Trump possibly to blame for this you're seeing it I'm seeing it let me give you some evidence of that vice president Mike Pence\nOn the tarmac being questioned by an ABC News reporter here is the question and the answer\nI think a lot of violence that we now know that in the summer at a rally Harris who I'm the president on him\nAnd on any targeted Democrats that President bear some responsibility [noise]\nAnd neither did Bernie Sanders bear any responsibility\nWhen the Illinois man opened fire at a Republican baseball practice\nReality is people responsible or the people responsible\nAnd what what the president I stand for and I think every American stands for [noise] is it that threats or acts of political violence from anyone anywhere for any reason\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news traffic and severe weather station news radio ten forty do hold you\nRice W.
