R. G. R. top local stories is that what looks like we could be seeing a warmer than usual winter ahead\nOn the temperature side a lot of people will probably like hearing this but there is a lean towards above normal temperatures\nNow are going to keep ourselves out of this type of of a negative situation but it definitely have an impact on ... on your women and how they're interacting with each other\nWell Tracey I think that that was a great definition of the movement I think that's absolutely right I Do believe that you're also right that it is expanded toward our behavior toward each other in the office and and uh I\nI think a lot of uh especially older guys talk to themselves into have I'm winking at you're seeing something inappropriate means you're part of the team you're one of the fellows blah blah blah\nI think that a culture that's kind of going away is is that what you're seeing\nYeah I'll tell you you know I\nI have not personally I'm involved in any situation or that or anything like what we hear about in the news is there anything that have brought down any of these major figures but\nMy very first out out of college was working on Wall street and I was on a trading or a day to day\nI was listening to wear a scenario like that going on right and and exactly what you're talking about which is the well wherever we want you to get a feel a part of the moment that you're part of the boys club because it just was traditionally and a male dominated environment\nAnd then you're dealing with really high stress job you know people joke around and they anything and they can just ... I Love the strengthening the idea that comment at the big high powered types of jobs in position so\nI've seen it from a lot of different angles and and now in the work or like I said\nI think we have to focus on we're number one transparency\nAround our policy and what isn't isn't okay and make a very very clear but also\nWe have we have to first have on this problem a part of the problem\nBy building better culture and better work environment in general the integrity of on the openness of diversity and we're back like we have to be really clear about what our company's core values are and live with those day to day and I think the trickle down effect that will be here as\nWell and and Tracy I you anticipated my next question you're talking about building a culture in your company because I'm thinking of all the pressure now we put on human resources departments in offices and like you were saying earlier they can't write a policy for every specific situation so it seems to me like\nThe answer to that is in the culture of the workplace in general\nIn our culture comes from it kind of leadership yeah hey like this former leader now or ... need to stand up and say\nThat there's always stand for that that is why we come to work every day and in certain ... they're not going to be tolerated owned by the way on the positive and now we're also going to build a positive environment\nWe're going to have respect for each other going to have integrity and are dealing with each other are going to you know you have to come at it from both me sort of painted sign in front of a a empowerment building up creating more positive\nA sentiment and core values and mission for your so that they have something positive to work for ... as opposed to just something negative to avoid\nAnd Tracy going on the extreme end of things I I think the other thing is the reason that people may be in some instances overreacting are very wary about this\nIs always out there the use of an accusation to take somebody down but you don't live in the office I think that's always out there and people are very wary of it is that realistic that that is a worry and the beach\nTo air oh my gosh yeah well you know nowadays you just have to be ex is yeah I'm actually out there that early on\nAnd not very sad because there are a lot of women and men who are suffering from actual transgression rape that ban that they kind of marginalized by people who ... something like that as a weapon as opposed to\nSomething for empowerment and something that's brand than from the suffering that they felt because they've been you know harassed or or assaulted by somebody right\nYes and and I just really sad part of that but ... it with anything good I think they're going to the people who he is\nSaying that in a nature\nRight and they're they're good and bad on Arab people are going to take a positive or out of it and have great things with and then there are people that are going to do\nThings that you're talking about that that in particular that ... somebody to enact retribution or take them down or just get rid of somebody that's on your way in the workplace that certainly possible\nBut my hope is that again if we're if we're doing the right thing to create positive environment as opposed to just avoiding negative one and hopefully we'll continue to hire more people and integrity and will create an area where\nThey attacked that accusations are irrelevant in the first\nSuch great commentary they always loved to have Tracy Tim on our business and career coaches Tracy temps Tracey thanks robot in the program with me today and have a great week\nThank you found that had an awesome Monday thick accent\nNine Fifteen is our time there you go I wouldn't you think that just in general when people are interviewing someone\nA about taking a position in a company at this particular point you're just looking for the general culture that that person will provide\nIt's hard to get into the specifics it's hard to manage every ... somebody's a\nEvery individual behavior but I think Tracy had some really valuable things to say about what kind of culture do you have at your workplace and does that person you're talking to appear to fit in that particular culture then you kind of keep away from the specifics\nThere were also struggling with here I asked the me too movement continues to transform our officers what kind of transformation if you've seen in your office because of the me too movement\nGive me a call at five one five to eight for ten forty or the American top ... percent accessories tech sign which is Ninety nine ten forty high turn into politics for the moment while you're thinking about that question\nI I'm not one of those conservative lean right radio talk show hosts it picks on the liberal newspaper locally all the time that's kind of a cliche my attitude is the Des Moines register editorial board gets to say whatever they want to say even if I don't agree with it most of the time\nAnd of course they listen to me and they know that I'm On the air saying things don't want to hear but I Do have to point\nOut something appointed to Des Moines register editorial board made this past weekend that um I found very very interesting\nAnd and I'll tell you why I found it interesting I grew up in St Louis Missouri in St Louis as a liberal newspaper as well to St Louis Post Dispatch the guided founded Pulitzer\nYeah the guy who did the person who's got the name on the the award that's given to the newspaper reporter each year that takes the best stands against Republican policy that's the Pulitzer ward [noise] um and so he founded the St Louis Post Dispatch and and growing up it was so interesting because Missouri is for the most part a conservative state\nAnd I would read these editorials they would constantly attacked the Republicans in Missouri as do nothing Republicans\nBecause liberals don't recognize\nThe limitation of government or the lowering of taxes is in fact advancing an agenda\nAnd you you may disagree with it but if you're going to limit government and lower taxes\nThat is that that isn't a gender thing to it is not just the growing of government that is doing something but a lot of time if you're on the liberal editorial board you say that when a Republicans are advocating for less government more freedom and people's lives\nThere or do nothing that's what the post dispatch would always say in their editorial come so you understand what stuck out to me this past weekend when the Des Moines register editorial board indoors Fred Hubble for governor\nAnd in one of the contrast the Des Moines register editorial board made between Fred Hubble and governor Kim Reynolds was this this is a statement from the editorial the future heat that's Fred Hubble offers is very different from the one offered by his opponent governor Kim rentals\nHer vision seems to consist almost entirely of more tax cuts and smaller government\nMore tax cuts in smaller government and the ones that [laughter] that\nWhat struck me about the editorial and the endorsement if you just putting more money and my pockets and limiting government\nIs just that for that come on I can be your agenda that's the world view if you are progressive if you're if you're a person that's constantly advocating for the advancement of government in people's lives\nThat's the only time government is doing something in the eyes of liberals is when it's doing more things regulating more taxing more growing more things\nBut the actual lowering of taxes and the actual limiting of government or even just making government more efficient that is an equal agenda\nItem is well it's just that if you got that progressive world view a lot of time you just don't see it that way which is amazing to me\nAs the guy that does mean center right the fact\nIs that I think centralized seeing things and growing government and doing more regulation is actually an outmoded ideology at this point the technology technology that's available to you and me right now the different things that the society is producing for us right now has made us\nMore self sufficient more independent than ever\nAnd so central icing things and regulating things more and growing more control over people's lives to me it actually doesn't make sense anymore\n[noise]\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news traffic and severe weather station news radio ten forty dollar you\nOf rice W.

I make a conscious effort to take time off\nAnd I encourage all my clients to do something called create an intentional schedule where you have a hard stop on at four o'clock or five o'clock I have a five year old now and I have a five year old and he forces us to fix their way out a little bit of balance in our lives are a lot of balance so I Know in my day has to be done and the truth is when you have an intentional\nSchedule let's say you know you have to stop at four o'clock or three o'clock because you have to take your kids up at school or you have something else you need to do you get the work done and that amount of time right think about it like ready for you on that case and most people get so much work done it's crazy right he go why did they get all that work then right before I got a vacation because you were intentional about it the creating an intentional schedules the first step\nAnd creating those heart stopped times at the end of the day because then you figure out what you have to do to make it happen delegating is the other thing right sometimes small business owners does need to hire more more support the right support on their team to also grow their business that\n... mentioned have had yeah go ahead I was about to wrap up but you have one more piece of advice because this is all good faith All right\nNate it's just one more peace at this schedule your vacation right they won't happen if they're not on the calendar and it's also part of having an intentional schedule it that way you're forced to get the work done you can take the time off I Hope that helped\nThat does help or solar mentors is the author of the belief zone you'll find direct sales coach now dot com Ursula thanks very much for sharing your experience good stuff today and let's talk again soon thanks for having me\nTen fourteen is our time what just got to me about what she was talking about is how many times we've done segments on the show about people not taking vacations\nAnd saying because I talk myself into believing that the company cannot exist without me and I also appreciate she done Nate phone call\nBecause a lot of water so I was saying is targeted toward people that have their own business or or on their own and trying to do it all themselves and getting overwhelmed\nAnd I love the last piece of advice go ahead and put the vacation on the calendar it is and the reason it resonates with me is that something to do and I do I we at the end of every year actually plan our spring slash ...\nAnd we have him on the calendar we set them up this is when we are going on vacation and I think that's very valuable and you have to talk to yourself into\nAh that the company can continue to exist\nWithout you have a reminder that at the beginning of this hour I had a a grand and your hand key words you text the two hundred two hundred and you've got a chance at one thousand dollars there is actually sixteen separate chances a day sixteen separate chances a day for you to win one thousand dollars and the grand in your hand\nContest and so right after the eleven o'clock news the big show guys will be here and they will give you yet another key word\nAnd um and do you take that are two hundred two hundred\nAnd uh they will you'll have a chance of winning one thousand dollars the other thing that I wanted to tell you because of the folks like you ducked me an email me\nOn this or like I Love it when you got concert tickets to give away Jeff [noise] ah listed in November ... there is a concert I ...

away on this show so I Will be giving you a chance to win a in November to this upcoming cancer which I Believe has not yet\nBeen announced immigrant caravan we've been talking about that is well it continues to move toward our southern border we were told last hour by a reporter at Fox News that is now up to around seven\nThousand people and Donald Trump our president has tweeted out this fall efforts are being made to stop the onslaught of illegal aliens from crossing our southern border full effort you sort of peel back\nAt this point from talking about military intervention and declaring a national emergency which is what he had said at first\nBecause if you say well you know we call up our military when we believe this to be we believe that we are being targeted by an invasion\nForce that's when we would do it and a number of you texted in response to our talk about that in the first hour well isn't this an invasion force shouldn't we call up or military that is a point of debate but understand what this caravan consists of\nThis is where your cab yacht has to come in because I Am asking who organized this caravan who's funding this care about but this caravan does consist of families with small children\nAnd a ... an acting\nMilitary intervention in a situation like that you just want to be careful you just want to be careful we are talking about the issues that are going to impact the upcoming election immigration is one of them\nThe other that I Want to talk about is the threat of impeachment and look this is not a fringe threat there is a liberal billionaire named Tom style or who is funding a political organization whose sole purpose\nIs to impeach President Trump and in fact one of the a lead strategy is that this organization called need to impeach has told Fox News we're not going away\nDoes the impeachment issue have an impact on the mid term elections let's talk to a political strategist Audrey a tailor decker who's on the Lipman law newsmakers right Audrey good morning does the impeachment issue does it play in the mid term is it affecting people's votes what do you think\nWell certainly I think it's going to mobilize the last even more I mean really they're using that to get out and vote for when you get\nA mainstream Democrats like Joe Biden or Nancy Pelosi saying that there is no reason at all for articles and his men you know that they're using this tactic to get out the vote on the ... but that being said I don't think this is an effective strategy I read undecided\nVoters from moderate voter is you know I decided voters at this point if they were going to fall in one of his political can't\nDemocrat or Republican and our divisive political reporter it would have happened by now\nAnd so I think I'm excited\nVoter are looking at for really get into the the platform that candidates are running on what policies are they hoping to advance\nAnd that's a discussion they want to have but I think that's being effective strategy short term strategy that it for the last ... mid cycle\nSo I agree with that ... this is talking to your base getting them fired up and we know you and I know that the cabin on hearing inflamed or the Republican base is impeachment also an issue that inflames the Republican base and brings them out to vote\nThat's a really good question I don't think it has the same access to have an hearing at anyone at the end of having all with your life which is one of the most important is it adds to the Republicans they certainly conservative Christian voters voter\nI don't think they need to and he has this thing I\nRight that the Supreme Court here it but in all likelihood good and and everyone needs to take this area I mean Republicans need to take it seriously an undecided voter me to take it seriously\nProbably some leeway Joe radio news hour top local story core dodge police on two men line dead in an hour early this morning officers say they heard\nGunshots around
