H. O. radio and I listen to it\nAll day long all of it all of it and\nWhen Senator Feinstein gave her opening statement\nShe threw in all and read into the record\nThe accusations being made by three different women including Julie sweating it despite the fact that the two accusations that came after the Dr Ford accusations we're really not considered credible there's no evidence for it it was ... you should never read it in the record and here's why\nI mean I knew at the moment this was a tactical mistake by Senator Feinstein because\nMost of the people talking to me on the show whether you called me or texted me about Dr Ford's allegations against judge Kavanaugh were willing to say well I I'm willing to believe something like that happened\nHowever I don't know if judge Kavanaugh was involved I'm willing to listen I think that's what most people did when they went into the hearing with Dr Ford they said that sounds like a credible thing that might have happened let's hear what she has to say\nWhen you bundle that with the other crazier accusations including sweat Nick he was part of the gang rings thing gang rape thing that actually hurt I think Dr Ford it made her look like a group of women that were just making crazy allegations\nI came away from the hearing here's my personal view thinking that something bad has happened to her and I felt very sorry for her being dragged before the committee like that especially if her lawyers didn't tell her\nThat the committee was willing to send investigators turn California she never had to be in the spotlight she was used we need to know more about that by the way\nBut there she is I feel sorry for I think something happened I don't think\nBrett Kavanaugh was involved that that's my view and I think it hurt the whole credibility of the case\nTo throw in Julie sweat next allegations with Dr Ford's allegations\nAnd there has been a cabin all backlash it's not what the Democrats expected\nIt was the fact that a lot of people who are center right in this country said I Do not want sexual allegations weaponized for political gain in this country we cannot go there I'm not going to allow that to happen that is animating this next election I think the Democrats had hoped\nThat Republicans look horrible insensitive in dealing with this issue in regards to women and there'd be a further female backlash there's always there's always a gender gap\nAmongst women and who they vote for between Democrats and Republicans but they wanted to make that gap further and they're the instead there's been a backlash and I think Julie sweat next allegations hurt Dr Ford's allegations in the credibility attached to them\nYet that set in ... that said yesterday Planned Parenthood\nAnd a national abortion rights we said we still believe they tweeted this out we still believe Julie sweating it and the hash tag is believe all survivor that is not the position of the majority of American people\nTake an allegation seriously but you cannot automatically believe the person that is alleging we want there to be fairness remember when fairness was a big deal in politics now like nah never mind you just automatically believe it when they make the accusation and any person\nAny person that is not totally blinded bipartisanship can say that's not where I Want to go I Will not want these allegations weaponized and that's where Senator Grassley has going what he's done is he's referred Julie sweat Nick and my ... he creepy porn lawyer\nTo the department of justice for possible criminal\nInvestigation and here's Grassley statement and and cheers to Grassley for looking like the same one constantly in all of this he says well meaning citizen comes forward with information relevant to the committee's work I take it seriously this is a statement by Senator Chuck Grassley it takes courage to come forward\nEspecially with allegations of sexual misconduct or personal trauma I'm grateful for those who find that courage Grassley then continues in his statement\nBut in the heat of partisan moments some do try to knowingly mislead the committee\nThat's unfair to my colleagues the nominees and others providing information who are seeking the truth in other words is we can't allow this to be weaponized we cannot allow false allegations to be weaponized in the future against any nominee\nWhether they come from the Democrats or the Republicans\nMichael have an idea of course this show boating 'cause he would like to run for president than twenty twenty so he put out a tweet\nTo Chuck Grassley he responded\nWhat start the investigation tonight I Will make my client available for ... for an interview you can make judges Kavanaugh bail before sworn interview we also have nine other witnesses we want interviewed and specific documents we want requested let's go I say that show boating because this is now a criminal investigation\nBy the department of justice and they're going to investigate it and they're going to come back with a conclusion and you may see criminal charges\nAgainst people who bring false allegations with a political ... a political aims I don't include Dr Ford in that\nI don't I think something bad happens to a doctor for it I don't think justice cabin all was involved and I feel sorry for her which is why I Will not criticized her whatsoever\nAt her being dragged before that committee when she said I'm terrified and when she implied that the committee and we need to look into this and I want to talk about this little further and our number two\nWhich is a this election is going to determine how much you get to know about the events leading up to a doctor Ford's testimony either elect people who are going to uh put it on the back burner\nOr you're going to learn more about it but who dragged to this woman\nThis poor woman before this committee because they were so desperate to keep a conservative off the Supreme Court nine Seventeen is our time wanted to turn to a disturbing lifestyle issue the controversial rise of bullet proof back\nPacks major retailers in response to school shootings in America\nAre now carrying

W.\nThere's been all kinds of political fear rising about who may be responsible for this and we're going to find that out of court as a day goes on I have not been participating in that on purpose here's the issue the issue for me is\nFirst of all this is this is all all terrible no matter who's responsible\nAnd I hold the person that commits the evil or to personal responsibility and I don't actually\nWith these these crazy kind of things that go on I don't try to assign motivation I just say evil and craziness so\nI said look Kansas person who's been doing this can we just say that's evil that's crazy why do we have to try to a position ourselves in a political sort of way on this particular issue you know of course people have been coming up to me and going well I think it and they talk politics\nAnd there's no evidence of that it's just politically what you want\nTo have happened and uh and I just I just don't go for that however I you know I'm Talking to friends\nAbout this and go why don't we just say man these are evil people these are people that aren't mentally all there and just be done with it or we've got to find some kind of political blamed the set\nAnd the pushback by my friends to me is this they say well ... if you're already feeling a great deal of grievance against the world if you're already feeling very angry about things or you're not quite mentally stable\nThat isn't this political rhetoric pushing you over the edge and I say okay you know we had an instance of course where a a Republicans practicing softball\nAh were were sprayed with bullets Steve's lease almost gave his life on that field\nI'm at the same time\nOr can you always just say well if we only ratcheted down the political rhetoric in this country things like this wouldn't happen and I don't know if I can say that\nHonestly and while I got two angles on this number what horses already out of the barn I mean we can both point fingers at each other whether you're in the right\nOr you're on the left and say tamped that down buddy you know yeah you tear it down but look what are the driving philosophies I have is politicians are all about politicians corporations are all about corporations unions are all about you and that's Thomas all\nAs so politicians will always a band in any kind of principle if they believe it gives them an advantage in obtaining power so you can say tamped down buddy is not I don't think that's going to happen so it's it's not going to happen so if I take that viewpoint and I go look to political rhetoric ... come in this country\nWe're not going to tamp down people are going to say we should but if it gives them a political advantage then they're going to go forward because ultimately it's about winning elections\nThen um is there going to be any kind of ... is it useful to say well there's some sort of political\nAh thing behind this you know gosh if President Trump would only Tampa down or yes I'm I'm getting all detects all the Democrats are doing it to themselves you know even President Trump has has as sort of bought into the\nThe politics of this here's this tweet on this Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now this bomb stuff happens is is the president's tweet and the momentum greatly slows news not talking politics very unfortunate what is going on Republicans go out and vote\nSee why I'm uncomfortable with a tweet like that is I understand the political implications of it is not that he's wrong but I'm like you know what people are threatening people other people were suspicious packages there's some debate on whether or not some of the bombs are alive or would have worked in the first place it was just at attention getting thing\nOr whether or not it's terrorism it's terrorism and it's bad and the thing about\nTrying to assign you know political blame for political advantage is it really gets us away from that Ronald Reagan principle of saying you know what I'm tired of hearing Reagan spoke on this he said I'm tired of hearing society get the blame for the evil actions of an individual\nTherefore I have avoided any kind of political the arising on why\nThis person is doing this and that's not I'm not saying that that's not gonna happen but I'm Talking to you personally person to person about how I feel about all of this which is I'm just a big advocate of that uh that overall\nTheory that a person that commits axis of evil is responsible for those acts of evil\nAnd I don't wander out into the political field because I Know that the political positioning and all of this is all about making your opponent look bad see President Trump you shouldn't blah blah blah I mean there was a call for President Trump\nYou got to tamp down those fiery speeches at the rally\nWell why is he being asked to do that well because people don't like the fact that he's firing up as voters that's really the motivation it's not because we got to be safer when we walked down the street and it goes the other way to of saying see you Democrats blah blah blah blah blah that's all about winning elections it's not really about the situation\nAnd that's why I'm just really reluctant to attach any kind of political motivation to anything like this 'cause I just think it's a horrible evil act it's a terrorist act\nAnd the person responsible for it is the personal person responsible for it so if you're just tuning in W. H. already news has had breaking news today than it looks like there has been a suspect\nIn these ah that that in the in the mail bombings in east sending these devices through the mail arrested and it looks like that arrest has taken place in Florida you started hearing the news\nAh overall that the suspect that that that that actually was the getting quite the buzz on social media leading up to this particular point\nThat um that that the suspect was down in Florida and apparently now the arrest has been made in Florida\nAnd the details are just coming out and therefore W. H. already news is gathering that information they'll continue to talk to you about it a throughout the day and we're going to find out more information about that suspect and I guess maybe the finger pointing is going to begin\nBut that's why you haven't heard me do a whole lot of the arising because I understand when people are saying well you know here's who I think is behind the migrant caravan or here's who I think might be behind these bombings\nThere is no evidence to back that supposition up it's just what you want politically to happen at this particular point and like you said I think even the president gets caught up in that in his tweets when he talks about the political implications of the suspicious packages being sent to people and I'm like and\nYou know it's just a bigger issue than politics this is these are acts of terrorism and the person responsible or persons responsible for them or just flat out evil and I understand we do have an election around the corner and that people will try to say well this is the political motivation is this and the political motivation is that\nI'm just reluctant to always do that simply because I think the people that perpetrate evil perpetrate evil they are evil and they need to be held personally responsible for that\nAnd I did have a friend this morning the made a great point on social media that I also wanted to bring forward he said you know one thing I just like to put out there as I have friends that worked for the postal service\nAnd I'm worried about them right now and I thought okay again that's a very human dimension to this that is not political the people in the postal service that the people that are being threatened when these devices are being sent to their to to their regional stations\nAnd I thought that the human aspect to it I feel bad for the people targeted I don't care about our political differences\nFeel bad for the people targeted I think this is terrible I mean it's terrorism I think it's evil and then the person I Hope that they've got the right person\nThat that person will be held responsible I have been very reluctant to engage in any political the arising\nAbout why or or you know why this was done and what the timing is but we will get more details as a day goes on and we will have them for you here at W.
