H. O. radio news thirty four degrees and yeah it's sunny and warm up today details on the weather coming up\nI talk about those during the summer the orange barrels season is rolling to an end part of the one hundred street interchange it I eighty thirty five in urban Dale is now open to wrestle open and just a couple of weeks\nAnd he put the last two weeks in perspective in regard to what Donald Trump is doing and I found it absolutely\nFascinating here's the issue that new brought forward which is you know that the liberal coastal media likes to settle on one thing and everybody just repeat the same thing over and over and when it comes to president Donald Trump what they do\nIs uh they look for something that he has said that everybody in the liberal hive mind degrees is an outrageous thing and you ought to be mad about it and they all repeated over and over and over again the liberals are very good at this\nSo what new pointed out last night and this he said this is totally on purpose\nOr by the White House which which by the way one of the one of the points last night\nWas the you know oh you know these guys really at the White House they don't know what they're doing a Donald Trump doesn't really know what's going on and of course he's blowing that all the way Newt Gingrich's with these strategies that he's talking about the employed by the White House here's one of the things that I found fascinating he said you will notice\nThat in the last two weeks president Donald Trump has given free news conferences and those news conferences are really really long in fact one news conference\nIt was eighty minutes long and another news conference when so long that the media ran out of questions to ask him and he actually said look I still got more time you got more questions here's why he's doing it it's called flooding zone\nHe's asked about so many topics and he talks about so many things that the media cannot decide what you're supposed to be outraged about they all he he is destroying the hive mind\nBecause they can't settle on one thing somebody puts out this somebody puts out that ... suddenly all colliding and your outraged over nothing you got a good example of the hive mind this past weekend\nA President Trump gave his speech at Ohio he was praising Ulysses Grant he was talking about how Lee Robert ... was a great general but Ulysses Grant was greater\nAnd NBC News put an edited video on line and said argue outrage she's praising the confederacy because of course the why people voted for Donald Trump is racist right [laughter] everybody agrees\nAnd then NBC got so much pressure\nFrom conservatives but they finally retracted it and said okay that's not really what he meant we took it all out of context sorry we'll be back next week with another one [laughter] so I found that fascinating\nAbout the flooding the zone strategy and that that this would continue he would not allow the media to focus on something and the next couple of weeks\nFor them to be outraged about because he basically saying ask me anything I'll just talk about a ... all kinds of things so I found that to be a fascinating\nStrategy he was also asked and I know you're curious about that because this is the guy that was the architect of the contract with America that are the Republicans at such a success with in the nineties so of course people want to know\nOr how he thinks the two thousand Eighteen election is going to play out and I'm a let me add a little bit of my spending this in just a moment but let me give you his answer he is confident\nThat the Republicans are going to pick up seats in the U.S Senate\nNow on the house side you know everybody's looking for hope if you're conservative or Republican about holding on to the house he said it really comes down to the next three weeks he was not willing to make a commitment on the U.S house side I Know people are desperate for him to do that but he said look\nA ... and this tells me that the houses up for grabs because he was willing to say look the U.S house you know it depends on what happens to the next three weeks and he talked about getting on message\nFor the Republicans if they will get on message that they will not flood zone if you will with messaging then they will be fine but at the his his unwillingness to say hey we're yeah we're going to be finding out they told you houses up for grabs whether you wanted to hear that or not\nAnd he talks specifically about something that you and I talked about yesterday morning which is immigration he said you know get back on the immigration message\nThere is a bill out there now fully fund the border wall or do some things with immigration reform that are popular among the American people again talk about jobs in the economy take credit for that the Republicans are the better stewards of the jobs and the economy and yes the behavior of the left\nIs a factor the behavior of the left is a factor do you want to put these folks in charge you know he was asked about the uh he he he made a very interesting point\nWhen he was asked about the protesters that were clawing at the doors of the Supreme Court when Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in and then he said here is what's happening you've got\nA faction of the left that thinks that this country is fundamentally flawed\nAnd it needs to be radically transform and they wanted to use the courts to do that and it's coming to an end it's coming to an end the ... the one of the biggest legacy is you're going to see out of this presidency is at all levels of court's conservative originalists are being named\nAnd the left of the reason one of the reasons that the left is going crazy over that is that they know your deplorable and then you don't like a lot of their ideas but you're deplorable in this country needs to be transformed you know we're going to do that through the courts\nTrump is taking that away that's why you're seeing the crazy behavior and for me let me give me my own perspective I I'm a former state legislator you know I'm going to be biased toward this right\nYou got to be subtle and these issues in the legislature I Want to get back to a country\nWhere politicians are there to persuade you knew that their ideas are good and that you'll elect him and say okay go ahead and an act that\nAnd the courts their role is basically to say here's what the powers of the branches are your overstepping this isn't your role it's not to enact policy it's not to impose policy on you it is that the legislators the Congress as your representatives\nAre talking to you about the issues that you think are important and what do you about um and then they implement them that's how he talked about the craziness that you're seeing on the left right now which is that this is going the way that the use of the court system to fundamentally transform America is going away\nThe other kind of uh the other thing that he brought up\nThat also a lot of activists talked to me last night is a thing called the mama bear syndrome and how it's affecting this coming election I Want to talk to you a little bit about that later because it is a significant thing\nAnd how this election is being impacted by mama bears but I'm going to spend some time throughout the program\nTalking about what new had to say some of my thoughts based on conversations with activists\nLast night about what's going on in Iowa so I Want you to keep it right here but also what's going on in Iowa right now\nAnd I love it it's a sunny day I Want to have a little fun I Do want to talk about mega millions in the Powerball and I'm going to have a friend who just walked into the studio to talk to me about that if Mary new powers here that must mean

H. Joe in Des Moines good morning to you\nYour morning Jeff it's great to be with you and I know it the fried Ron Paul but the studies are showing that while they may spend two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to get the child at\nThe age Eighteen we're spending even more than that when they're all grown up in fact it's not just college it is beyond college yeah it goes on and on and off\nWell and the reason it's surprising people bill is we've all seen the news articles that say wow this is how much it costs to raise your child to adulthood well go\nAnd now a parents are saying it's costing you more after the child grows up is this a new thing bill or has this been going on for a while\nIt's been going on for a while it's just it seems to be extending ... even ... years and among the baby boomers we're having what may be referred to as like a super sandwich generation and that they are like a deck would sandwich generation I mean\nThey they get their kids through college and I think they're going to be able to save for retirement\nBut then suddenly their parents have a need\nAnd southern care for their elderly parents and then the kids come back in the picture because kids are trying to get their first house or ban homes or take care of the grandchildren children's a private school expenses or whatever\nAnd the parents just keep on giving and I know that one of the reasons we don't make a living and we may money so that we can take care of those we care about\nMy big concern is we've got a lot of folks out there getting more than they can really afford because they\nDon't say no and I think a lot of times they just don't know what can they really afford because it seems early retirement that we're doing All right but it only takes a couple\nChallenges along the way to suddenly we're not doing All right and if we raise children that are not self sufficient they won't be there to care for us either and so we've got to make sure that we're not overdoing it in these years where we are continuing to give to our adult children\nBill your your financial advisor and you really you pointed out the the issue here which is okay you take care of your elderly parents then you're taking care of your kids in your adulthood and suddenly it's retirement time and there is no nest eggs so when do you have to practice tough love when do you have to take care of yourself what do you think\nMurderous thug some people that are doing things that are so publicly wrong but we need to make it very careful about it as you say and now this gentleman is also dismissing journalists murdered I guess is a is on his way to being an American citizen I had thought early reports he was a citizen I mean I think there's something to being careful about\nOur people being abused but\nAgain caution is important and I think ... got to deliver some more facts to us\nAnd and I think then as you pointed out the next aspect of this story is once he comes back once he talks to our president how we react really has reverberations around the world doesn't it\nYeah it does that let me say this is where I don't I think the Congress' rights ... ... it's article want authority on things like international bears I'm all for it I Want more a muscular senators and congressmen but we need to be careful\nSome of the people who are reacting against Saudi Arabia are are are focused on their previous antagonism with Israel and others we just need to be careful I ... I think something short of destabilizing Saudi Arabia because they acted badly\nIs important and you know it may be that we get a fake because and by that I mean that Saudi Arabia says well\nSomebody was out of hand they were supposed to kidnap the guy which isn't very nice but we didn't want 'em to kill him and we may have to be willing to live with that lie in and and get some other things that make sure that this doesn't happen again in order to be careful about what could happen in that part of the world\nYeah I I had all the conversations are difficult I think you're doing a great job of summarizing he's the president of the eagle forum funding the author of the conservative case for Trump at Martin and always a joy to talk to you thanks for your perspective this morning\nHey thank you Jeff but talking about you know\nNine fifty two is our time news radio ten forty is W.

changing demographic and that consumer a population and\nUh we've talked in the past about the different generations are or groups millennials the a Shiite next Gen Z\nA day or changing the way these kinds of companies need to operate because they see the world completely differently than I Do as a baby boomer uh I grew up with Sears but uh this the younger age groups\nI don't know much about fears and it appears they Sears have not done a whole lot to change that and so companies have to take into account what these new or\nA groups are looking for ... for example they're looking for an experience they don't want to be told things they want to discover things they want to go on line and have Web sites\nReact to them rather than them reacting to the website so there are a lot of those kinds of realities that companies have to start taking into account\nAnd optimistic side Fred I think that's good news for ...\nSmall businesses because I Love to go down a main street when you talk about experiences a small business seems to really flourish in that environment what do you think\nYeah I think they're closer to the consumer I think the smaller the business or the closer the owners and managers candy\nTo their customer a Sears obviously after a hundred and thirty two years is a massive organization\nAnd senior management seems to have lost touch but I think you're right I think the smaller businesses if they will respond again to those changing demographics and psycho graphics really\nUh it it is a good opportunity for them but they need to pay attention to Amazon and what's going on around them because you know they're trying to take over the world\nRight exactly right the one thing that it seems is the biggest challenge Fred\nA and I think of myself as a consumer is I can go on line and say this is exactly what I Want and I don't have to look around word boom it comes up in the search engine that seems to me for it to be an ongoing challenge for businesses\nWell that's exactly right and with Amazon Prime a lot of times you can get it the same day yeah and you don't even have to leave your home so yes there there are some serious challenges here to people who are not Amazon\nOr by uh again I think that if they look at ... ... what their customer is meeting or wanting or how they want the customer wants to interact with the company and they take those things into account they can eat\nWell I wouldn't be doing my job as a radio talk show host if I didn't ask you if there was some company that you were worried about at this particular point Fred\nWell no not a particular I think we're seeing a a number of years or the toys are us and yet some others Walmart is trying to compete with Amazon\nIt seems like they are having at least some success\nI have a lot of grocery stores are now since Amazon acquired a whole foods that they are now having to think differently so it will be interesting to see how these companies are able to respond and what they are going to do and\nOther shit and into that and that successes or failures they're seeing and those particular responses\nThat's a really great point Fred it becomes a best practice this thing doesn't it like you look at what other businesses are doing and take note of what they're doing and then adapt to that\nYeah exactly see what other people are doing the what's working sea and more importantly what is not working yeah and do those things at work and don't do those things that don't work it seems pretty straight forward but he gets a little bit more\nNuanced than that a lot of times\nI always enjoy talking to Fred Paris she's out there talking to businesses about the elements needed for success Fred thanks very much for joining me this morning let's talk again soon\nOkay great thanks for having me on\nTen Fifteen is our time and just like I talked to Fred because he's talking to businesses I got a great opportunity last night\nDuring an evening with new to talk about a lot of people that are very politically talked to a lot of people that are very politically active thanks to broaden else for their sponsorship of an evening with Newt Gingrich last night at the Iowa historical building\nSix hundred plus people showed up to hear some very insightful commentary from Newt Gingrich and I wanted to focus on something that was very interesting to me and then combine it with the comet of the conversations that I was having last night\nHe of course was asked how he thinks things are going to shake out for the Republicans and the two thousand Eighteen election that's forthcoming in November he said firmly that he believes the Republicans were going to gain seats in the U.S Senate\nBut then on the U.S house side he said it all depends on what's going to happen over the next three weeks we're three weeks out by the way as of today from the November election so if you're a Republican or conservative when you were hoping that he would say I think we're going to be okay and house and he was not willing to say that\nHe said there are there we've got to watch the next three weeks to see if the Republicans\nWill retain the house now\nThat said uh I had a lot of conversations\nWith folks that are very active in the political establishment in Iowa last night I wanted to get their take from being on the ground and I would say to you that there are two under reported stories about the upcoming election that you're going to hear about on this show that the media is\nEither not on top of or just catching up number one the rural area factor in this upcoming elections you know if you're you're following the coastal media\n[noise] uh you're not hearing it all about rural areas they don't even know that that you exist and knew had an interesting perspective on that last night he said you know here here's what's going on people that go to Harvard\nMarry other people that are going to Harvard people that uh go to Yale marry other people that are going to get people to go to Stanford marrying other people to go to Stanford and then he said\nI can identify you for you the ZIP codes in which they live and those ZIP codes happened to be where most of the national media reports from\nHe said that's why they don't get Trump voters they don't understand you and that got me thinking because here I Am talking to activists last night at the evening with Newt event\nAnd they were saying look or the Democrats are getting trounced in rural areas they are uh they they they have an urban agenda and yes they are going to do well in areas that you expect the Democrats to do well but they're not doing well enough\nTo stop the travel thing that they're taking in rural areas and yes everyone acknowledges these rural areas are not as populist but we are talking about being double digits down in rural areas and what I've said to you and I still believe this to be true\nHave you with a look to a race like Cindy Axne e and David Young where you've got a district has got an urban area a rural area in a suburban area you say OK Cindy actually she's going to do well in urban area\nDavid you can do well in the rural area in the suburbs\nThat's where if you're Cindy Axne you've got to make up for how badly you're doing in the rural area or if you're David Young you want to do well in the suburbs do well in up in the urban areas and you win that that's where that race particular race comes down to\nThose you if you think OK Democrats are doing badly in rural areas doing well where you'd expect him to do well in the urban areas so the battles in the suburbs that's where the mama bear factor comes in and that is my second point\nThat's being under reported right now by the media but I think they might pick up on it because coming out of the Brett Kavanaugh hearing\nThe liberals in the media one of the story line to be that suburban women are going to vote against Republicans\nBecause they're so mad at how Dr Ford was treated and they believe that the Republican Party is anti woman in suburban women are going to take The Revenge of the polls instead what is happening is it's suburban women those that are center right and and I include independence that or center right\nLooked at these hearings and said that could be my father that could be my brother that could be my son here's a guy that has tried to live an honorable life\nAnd an accusation of sexual assault is being weaponized to try to stop them from getting on the Supreme Court how much more is that going to happen not only in the political world but in our offices as well as people try to advance that accusations\nOf sexual assault are weaponized to try to stop the advancement of these people\nThat is what is out there and people are unhappy about that is not an insensitivity\nTo actual sexual assault victims even knew last night said I think something traumatic it's happened to Dr Ford in her life we don't know what that is but we we believe that you do not want to be insensitive to those that have suffered this kind of trauma in your life\nBut at the same time and I have been talking about this for weeks you don't want this to become a political weapon as well in fact I got an interesting perspective from someone who works last night with sexual assault survivors\nTen thirty I'm Christian ...
