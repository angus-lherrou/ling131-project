central Texas among the worst hit areas our more\nPro\nIn Iowa he says in airports on airplanes and hotels and restaurants I've been approach to this is Newt Gingrich riding on Fox News dot com I been approached again and again by people who are glad Republicans stood up for now justice Brett Kavanaugh and took on the left not a single person has been hostile or negative in five days of travel\nNewt says I don't remember any political event that so galvanized Americans more than twenty million people watched Kavanaugh's tough aggressive defense of his family and his wife at his Senate confirmation hearing and it's clearly had a powerful impact\nThe national conversation is clearly continued to build toward a condemnation of the left\nAnd a sense of defending decent people from smears and character assassination Newt Gingrich's column on Fox News dot com continues one startling moment\nCame in Des Moines when Irene of ink and eat walked up to me at the Iowa historical building announced I'm Seventy five year old lifetime Democrat who switched to Republican and I'm now volunteering for the GOP candidates\nNewt continues to write furthermore members of her whole family in Iowa Georgia Oregon in Wisconsin are now Republicans\nShe told me quote the viciousness against Cabot all was the last straw the Democrats are no longer the party of John Kennedy that I Belong to when I was young unquote her tests\nAmmonia was reinforced by Merle Miller of Iowa City home of the University of Iowa and maybe the most liberal town in Iowa that is new writing about Iowa City I I agree with them but that's new writing about our city\nI'm Merle of Iowa City said two new at the Monday Night evening with Newt Gingrich event it comes down to jobs versus mobs or he he couldn't stop saying that at the event on Monday Night he loved Newt Gingrich did jobs versus mops\nNewt Gingrich continues to right in the Fox news dot com ... column shared on by the way on my Twitter feed or the initial poll in state after state have shown a real shift toward Republicans Republican Senator Ted Cruz is pulling away in Texas\nRepublican Kevin Cramer is remarkable lead over incumbent democratic senator Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota\nRepublican governor Kim Reynolds has begun to pull away from democratic candidate Fred humble in the Iowa governor race now that's not true but I that that is a great optimism on behalf of new but that's that's not true he's optimistic in this column\nBut let me give you an assessment of where the governor's race is right now\nWhat I Would tell you is that Governor rentals numbers are improving just like the numbers of every other Republican candidate post cabin all across the country is as close the governor's race in Iowa between rentals and Hubble is as close\nAs you are hearing it is probably we're going to go late into the night and uh and it's ... and that somebody is going to squeak it out it is a toss up race however\nThat said the governor's numbers are improving here's a couple of pieces of evidence\nJust a few weeks ago congressman rod Blum in eastern Iowa was once again declared the most vulnerable incumbent in the country as he is every time it runs\nAnd nationally he actually was being written off against Abby Finkenauer for Congress well now that race has become a toss up and that means that congressman blondes numbers have improved just like the governor's numbers have improved in his congressional district post Kavanaugh again\nAnd uh and that means that you know rising tide lifts all boats the governor's numbers are improving in an area where they needed to improve now the national Republicans are going to take a million dollars in advertising into congressmen blooms race\nAnd that's going to help Republicans including Kim rental also I Am hearing from activists in southeast Iowa\nThere were in previous Iowa elect world history some counties\nIn South eastern Iowa that were real liable for the Democrats that is no longer the case they are going more and more Republicans so a region that the Democrats have been in the past\nAble to count on is becoming more Republican and that is helping the governor's numbers in that region to say you can you you can think about it this way does I think about it ... in the state North West south west central\nNortheast southeast you're looking at how the governor is going to do in the upcoming election\nWell you know of course you're trying to gin up a a a behavior in the more Republican counties in in western Iowa\nYou're trying to do better in eastern Iowa where the Democrats do well and the governor is so it's not pulling away the numbers are improving for the governor but I'm telling you it's an every vote counts race you will probably be listening to W. H. O. late that night to find out who's going to squeak out\nThis particular race for governor\nAnd you're going to see a significant difference in the numbers in rural areas which tend to be pro Republican but are less populated\nAnd then you'll see the Democrats doing well in the urban areas the college towns like in Iowa City where you expect them to\nAnd are those are the more populated areas and then you're going to look at the suburbs like it ain't guinea\nBecause Democrats are hoping to make enough inroads in there\nTo be able to squeak out wins in congressional races like blood versus Finkenauer acne versus young\nAnd Hubble versus rentals and it is still up in the air but a ... although you Newt's article following on an evening with new on Monday Night is in fact correct in what has been going on\nUh that that there has been a post Kavanaugh boom for Republicans and that's going to be one of the more fascinating stories that you're going to hear\nA post election is because certainly the Democrats were counting on the Kavanaugh for hearing to boost their prospects to say that women would be so mad at Republicans that this will usher in the blue wave and the pushback on how Kevin always treated has been such that the blue waves been cancelled\nYeah it looks like to me I'm going to say this again it's not exciting to say it this way but it but there is no blue wave coming it is a normal midterm and let me let me state for you what that means on average the party out of power\nWins thirty two seats in the U.S house in a ... when the opposite party occupies the White House so the Democrats need twenty three seats to be in the majority in the U.S out so they have\nReason to be optimistic about the U.S house if the average is thirty two unique twenty three it's a bigger story if they don't win the U.S house than if they do add that he's still up in the air at the same time and my upset\nThat national sites are saying oh they've got a great chance of winning the house not if you know your history now have you know that on average they win thirty two seats the party out of power of the White House and then he twenty three okay I don't even need to look at a stat\nI Will do cast a skeptical I ate at these ah these out of state firms\nThat are talking about the chances of winning a seat because a lot of them are basing that on fundraising numbers and that's it ... or they're impressed by the Democratic fundraising which has been great this year absolutely\nBut they're not talking to people like we are so there's a lot of these out of state firms going I predict this I predict that now I Do trust and cells are in the Iowa poll or they she's fairly accurate and so I Do look at those numbers when when she when she announces them\nBut the out of state for him to like ... a lot of them are basing their numbers on fundraising and my goodness yes the Democrats had a great year fundraising\nBut you know to give you the big example nationwide veto down in Texas is going to raise a ... an eye popping amount he's still going to lose the Ted Cruz so you you cannot predicate your ... your your predictions\nOn finance on fundraising but then a lot of these firms are attempting to do that so I don't trust the out of state folks coming in here ... says they don't know\nI trust being on the ground in the evening with Newt Gingrich talking to the speaker and Newt Gingrich as promised on the ... news maker line Let's talk about the upcoming election with Eric Trump welcome back to W.

bring these guys on to talk about diet and you're an avid station he's absolutely right they'll start getting into you know corn or wheat blah blah blah\nYeah I Know I Know and then I get the email totally get that Dr find no talking about a gluten free diet and the fact is one of the big points he was just trying to make was that\nUm if you if it's bad for you\nAnd the government allows a certain percentage of the gluten product to still be in things that are labeled gluten free then that is a problem and that's what I found fascinating about at all not that I don't believe in it because I think that there are a lot of folks I don't happen to have a reaction personally but\nThere are a lot of folks in my life who do have a gun gluten free and feel like it benefits them and the information that he's providing that I thought was very interesting is you you know obviously the marketers know that this thing is out there and they're marketing a lot of products like water good break 'em ... that are gluten free\nAnd a ... and there and if you allow certain percentage of good news in there as he was pointing out then you're still going to have\nA problem and that was what I

who pointed out to me\nThat are fans of rushed the field of jak twice before and there's been no fine\nSo has the find triggered by the fact that the coach complained about it now Iowa State\nIs going to appeal does fine and the reason they're going to\nIs because they'll say look we do have because the nature of the fine is there's ... you know there there wasn't protocols in place to keep players from possibly being injured by the fence but there are I Know they are and you know that I've got a personal connection all that my son is an equipment manager for the tight end son Logan\nOn the in the cycling football program\nOr he is also a student coach he has assigned responsibilities of the fans rushed the field I texted him after the big win to congratulate him say hey what are you doing and one of the things that he told me was one of his job was to go stand next to the Iowa State quarterback has the Iowa State quarterback\nHeaded off the field as part of the protocol to just try to protect them and you know look where Iowans nobody's going to hurt anybody else when people are rushing the field but there are protocols in place it allows him to rush the field and make sure that the players are\nUm protected or so we've got this twenty five thousand dollar fine the fans have been publicly reprimanded\nUm and uh my friend ... rice you hear him here on W.
