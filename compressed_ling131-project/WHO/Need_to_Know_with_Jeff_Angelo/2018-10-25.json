compassionate solution to ensure the safety of Democrats the best thing you can do is to simply vote them out of office so they won't be in a position to anger so many people and remove them from daily public political circumstance in threat once again I condemn\nAll bombs in politics today well known Democrats are the targets we must protect them vote them out of office for their own good and

o'clock I'm Wendy while WHM radio news [noise]\nForty five degrees still cloudy at the Des Moines airport\nThis WHM radio news about you buy Wesley life online at Wesley life dot org our top story this hour two more suspicious packages being investigated this morning one turned up\nPut out the blame last night CNN no longer an objective news organization but the voice of the opposition was that the Trump rally in tweeted out President Trump points the finger at Democrats and media takes no responsibility for violent mailings today\nBut because he's not responsible for and we don't know who's responsible for it we we don't know but of course this is the conversation now about camping down the political rhetoric that the left doesn't like\nAnd what has to happen what part of the political theater of this is what you are being told to do\nIs to focus on the behavior and rhetoric of certain people but not think it all about the behavior in rhetoric of other people in other words wow your political opposition they're really bad ... through don't worry about what we've been saying and doing\nAnd that is just disingenuous\nThe thing that I Want to focus on the reason I brought up the CNN story is the media's behavior which is now being part of the focus demand the coastal media does not like it but let me give you a specific example of concerning rhetoric out of our media so you got CNN yesterday with no evidence whatsoever trying to uh to to uh\nPut the blame on these mailings on President Trump and Sarah Sanders rhetoric and the here's something that was a ...\nAnd by the New York times yesterday there ever a book section and they have asked some fictional authors five of them to write a fictional story in which they project what's going to happen in the relationship between President Trump and Russia\nAnd in one of these fictional stories that will be published in the book section of the New York times\nOr the author has written a story in which a Russian assassin steps out of the crowd and attempt to shoot President Trump in the back and his gun jams and the secret service agent protecting the president turns to the assassin and says here use mine and hands him his Secret Service got\nThat's the story that the New York times is going to publish in his book section\nBut America wow you ought to tamp down America\nThat is just amazing to me and as I've talked about in the past couple of years about the coastal media the lack of self awareness\nThe lack of saying yeah guys here's how we get it wrong is is is is flabbergasted\nTo me so little commentary for you\nAs we sit here and we do not know who sending these packages or what their motivation is coming up on nine Thirteen I wanted to bring up a topic that you have been emailing and texting me on\nAnd do a little reality check with you this is about the fact that many of you are getting your absentee ballots in Iowa now and or going early vote and you have realized\nYou can't straight ticket vote anymore and you cannot just circle one oval and that just vote for everybody in the political party that you want to vote for and many of you say you are annoyed by that the reason that we're just discovering it it was it a big package of election reforms passed by Republicans\nIn the last session and a lot of the other stuff including voter id er shortening up the early voting period that's what got the publicity this ... this was kind of there but wasn't talked about much and now people are going to ... and you're like\nHey what's going on with your ... and there was an article that made me shake my head in in in the national website Politico that said that Iowa Democrats are fuming over this change they think it hurts them worse than Republicans\nUm and there is a person who is registering younger voters to vote for Democrats quoted in the article\nThat says ah this is an attempt as a direct quote this is an attempt by Republicans to make it more confusing and intimidating the fact that you have to vote down the ballot confusing and intimidating one little bit insulting to the young voters they're trying to register\nAnd two can I be Frank with you about this if you're confused and intimidated by having to vote down a ballot maybe they that you're not actually the kind of person that should be voting\nIn fact you know you should be voting in this election W H A radio listeners do you know why because on this very fire radio station\nYou are hearing all the candidates you will continue to hear all the candidates on this radio station you will go in and you will go down ballot and if you're a W H already a listener you'll have heard from the candidates that you're voting for the the kind of voters I Would like voting\nI I just don't believe that there's any kind of partisan advantage\nOver whether the fact that you can't straight ticket vote in both parties are competing for crossover voters\nSo isn't this what who you're competing for is maybe a person that\nMarks the ballot a lot for one party is willing to to ... to go to another party I mean for example this is why you see all the Democrats focusing on suburban women they they think that maybe some conservative suburban women will vote for Democrats this fall\nThey're going to do that by splitting their ticket not straight ticket voting so I don't believe that there's an advantage for one party or the other in doing this that's my personal feeling\nAnd also again if you get to the secretary of agriculture race\nAnd you don't know anything about those candidates then I don't want the\nVoting in that race to be quite honest with you I don't you go and\nYou know a tomb that sounds like a really nice name that's got a good reason to it I guess I'll vote for that person to be agriculture Segre mark now there is a bold farm base named Mike I but I think I'll vote for the ... that's actually I Want your decision to be made\nSo I'm right with not having straight ticket voting I guess what is the difference to me is I don't see the disadvantages one party or the over ... you actually\nHave to say younger voters will be confused we think that the disadvantage for Democrats if they have to vote all the races so reality check for me because I Am saying is because a number of you\nHave emailed and texted me and said I don't like this at all so I Want to check in with you about how you feel about it and why you like or don't like it\nFive one five to eight for ten forty is the phone number to call\nAnd of course the American top ... and accessories taxing is five one five nine eight nine ten forty melts the first person wants to check in via phone line on this Mel thanks for calling ... what do you think of not being able to straight ticket vote what effect will it have on you\nI have never done it before but I heard somebody just as a protest\nAgainst all the federal rhetoric or the Democrats are putting out just vote right and I ordered I scared I've ever done before birth order I'm not going to be able to do it this year\nWell you could still go down though now you can still go down the ballot in just you just have to fill in the circle for every single Republican is that right is that annoying to you\nWhere are all somewhat ... it says it could be that personal the fact that I\n[laughter] [laughter] hurting my head\nI get I get a it's an emotional thing now that straight up I appreciate that point of view they exert myself he wants the emotional satisfaction just marking that one box you know I showed you okay I I mean that's that's fairly honest\nBut I again I what I don't understand I my my two viewpoints or this if you are going for the crossover voter whether you're a Democrat or Republican wouldn't you want people to have to vote in each individual rights and then number two to just say well this is going to confuse young voters that's that I just think that's\nKind of insulting to be honest with you and that so I wanted to give that the\nThat they wanted to get your particular point of view\nA now this texture says in the American top ... sex and not only is removing the straight ticket vote a great idea\nThey need to remove party affiliation from the ballot also [noise] uh no I wouldn't be in favor of that I mean if you want if you want to know who the Republican candidate is because that's the philosophy that you that you lean toward or the Democratic candidate I'm All right with that\nI I just I I I it was it's just the fact that people are saying oh the one of the other things that people are saying is well then you know such and such is not going to vote in the secretary of state race 'cause they're not familiar with the candidate I say okay if they're not familiar with candidates why would I Want them voting and there was just the people who know\nJust people know should vote in that race Ken's on the line that wants to weigh in and this okay what do you think about the lack of straight ticket voting this year in Iowa\nI guess my biggest issue is that I'm a voter and I don't need a bunch of politicians telling me how you can and can't vote it was I don't see any problem with it an act and a and I voted straight ticket and I have a split it up so\nUh my view on it and uh as far as a younger voters getting confused again that's not my voting\nShow yeah OK I'm more concerned about\nMy vote than I Am a politicians and I don't see why you're leaving well enough alone was like okay\nI can appreciate that'd be we just say look that was the problem that didn't need to be solved um ... again ... ... a couple of you were like oh removing all the party designations I think that would be okay then you've got to know more about\nThe candidates [noise] yeah I get it I get it but there is a philosophy that you associate we either party and it's okay to be informed about that philosophy Tim wants to weigh in Tim what do you think about the lack of straight ticket voting this year in Iowa\nA person was gone O W H A radio news our top national story this hour there's more to suspicious packages of showing up these address the former vice\nPresident Joe

I'm ... political persecution in Honduras well they just spent the last month in Mexico\nWhere they have all that you know the Mexican government tried to get them to ask for sounds so uh you know\nTo reinstate the idea or to or to legalize formally legalize the idea that if you come through a third party country to get to the United states\nThan that neutralizes your asylum claim because you're clearly when you were in Mexico we're not ... the government on but Honduras if in fact the government is persecuting you it would remove that threshold we've also said that a good idea and something that's been done in the past is to put\nA a large in a large camps right there on the border with mobile\nOf immigration courts lead here you know the sec if we can get these\nCases heard immediately in Turkey start turning these folks around within twenty or thirty days then that that's going to send a message to Central America that this game doesn't work anymore but in order to do that the other thing they need to do is is to\nAmend is a judicial agreement called the floor as agreement which mandates that you can only hold children for twenty days so that's what has really fueled the catch and release so Congress knows what it has to do is try to pass it\nTwice this year or these asylum fixes or contained in two large immigration bills neither of which got a single vote for the Democrats\nI Know that it's in a busy campaign season but we cannot allow Central America\nTo destabilize us politically by sending its people here we are not the uh release valve for central America's problems are over population it's time to get back to ... for Congress to get back to Washington and close these loopholes now\nDe ray of the federation for American immigration reform\nTen sixteens our time thank you Dave I Want to take a moment\nTo talk about the politics of it because I've been saying this for months and it all comes to a head now in the November election it is interesting to me that this was a top issue among the American people that is immigration and one political party the Democrats are willing to ceded\nTo completely to another political party the Republican and if you don't believe me believe the Washington Post\nAnd the New York times to newspapers that are not exactly you know pro Republican and their approach here's the Washington Post Democrats are struggling to respond to President Trump and his Republican allies who are casting the caravan of thousands of migrants headed toward the U.S Mexico border\nAs a failure of Democrats to help enact immigration policy in the GOP controlled Congress struggling to respond key phrase there\nSome Democrats said Trump\nIs vulnerable to counter attack on his core campaign issue given that his policies failed to reduce\nThe number of unauthorized immigrants yet party leaders and democratic candidates have largely been silent ahead of the mid term elections refusing to engage with Trump so there's the post\nHere's the times New York times\nFor the most part Democrats have tried to avoid the issue\nNancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer the Democratic leaders in Congress of essentially urge their colleagues to ignore it\nThe leaders in a statement issued over this past weekend said quote the president is desperate to change the subject from healthcare immigration because he knows that health care is the number one issue Americans care about\nDemocrats are focused like a laser on health care and will not be diverted\nUnquote well okay if I were to say the top three issues of the upcoming election what they would be a yes healthcare and yes the economy and jobs and yes immigration and what I Am saying is yes I Know that voters go for various different reasons to vote on\nBut it is interesting that Democrats are saying this is not an issue that's going to impact the next election this is not an issue on which are candidates need to actually take a stand we're going to talk about these particular issues which is fine\nI just I have not seen a situation where a major political party says okay one of the top issues being listed by the voters we're not actually going to talk about that\nAnd the migrant caravan is very interesting in that it's come up now\nAnd we're talking about it and there's one political party that says let's not talk about it and you heard with ... speculation was that this may be funded out of a politician in communist Venezuela and hoping\nThat the impact over ... is negative ultimately to President Trump did you get that video of these migrants streaming over the border and our inability to stop them but for now the discussion favors the Republicans at this particular point it could all change if they get here\nAnd Congress has done nothing\nBut that's where the that's how the discussion is leading currently\nAnd as David Was saying and as many of you've been saying to me that this is actually an issue that Congress ought to come in and address because Dave Ray's primary point was according to current law\nYou step on the soil and you say I Am a political refugee chances are you're in will go back to the topic of political
