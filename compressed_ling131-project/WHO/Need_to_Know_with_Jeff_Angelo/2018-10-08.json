rainy in Des Moines our top local story is dealing with the rain and the flood warnings that are now out for some rivers in eastern Iowa and flood watches are now posted across much of the state\nOr their lives their liberty et cetera in fact that is the purpose of government is to protect life liberty and property\nAnd the this mob or see a\nInstigated by Democrats is way off base way off or anything of the Congress and vision\nWell the other thing is you can imagine Michael I was interested to read this weekend on social media being from Iowa\nIs these folks saying you know the smaller populated states shouldn't have this much power in the Senate in fact there was a tweet that said you know those people who choose to lead a a poor\nQuality of life in those rural areas they shouldn't have both have the same power as those of us in lightened folks in the urban areas\nYet this is why the founders did it that way isn't it this is to make sure that they had equal say in the legislature\nI absolutely am to a a run off of that or the whole purpose of why\nThe founders had\nState legislatures a vote on senators as opposed to the people is because the the individual uh members of the individual citizens already ad representation of the house state uh and that included all the states\nAre needed representation in the Senate and that Senate was you know we we would've never got a constitution like we had if the founders had not compromise that okay we're going to not only split up the\nA split up that Congress has to do by several house\nWe're going to get representation of the people that are older people including the nut jobs out there [laughter]\nYou can have their tend to have their\nVoice but it would be off it would be balanced by a balanced equal representation\nA Senate and if we remember the original Congress under the articles of confederation the it was one state one vote\nRegardless of population so they they actually provided a little more voice to the people by spreading it and giving representation in the house\n[noise] Michael we also in a big debate on social media this weekend it's such a joy to talk to you in the aftermath of it all I'm In regard to the role of the Supreme Court matter of fact one pundit said look for increasing arguments about how limited\nThe Supreme Court role ought to ought to be because it is no longer considered to be an activist court it's a texture sexual originalist court\nOr so Michael ... what did the founders intended the role of the Supreme Court to be\nSimply judgment or their job was to look at the law and then a judge the case based on a law now a little bit different and one of the art or one of the reasons or our separation from England\nWasn't jury trial or we were not being granted to a jury trial\nA jury trial is a little bit different\nThan a Supreme Court or any federal court making a judgment on a case\nOr in the case of a jury trial citizens can actually sit on the court and if they think that the court is going to be a little bit biased\nThey can actually judge the law and then if they find that the law is cost traditional than they can judge a based on the law so that is where a a an activist court which is actually citizens\nShould be a should be involved there are in that they make a ruling on the law but not a Supreme Court not any federal courts\nTheir ruling is on the case itself and whether the law was violated\nMichael this is such a timely interview Michael is the author of founders revolution his name is Michael ... Michael thanks very much for your time leave comments this morning\nYou're welcome thank you for having me\nNine fourteen is our time a reminder of you love this kind of talk you're going to love an evening with Newt Gingrich and it is right around the corner October Fifteen is the date Iowa historical building our co hosts will be\nW. H. O. Simon Conway as well as Lee Habiba of our American story thanks to our friends at ... for sponsoring the evening before this program is over some time before this program is over\nI Will give you a chance to win a couple\nOf VIP tickets that evening that means two tickets to the event\nAlso attend our private reception here a W H Joe radio where you at a gas will get to meet Speaker Newt Gingrich stay tuned to need to know what you have to Angela throughout this program because at some point you will get a chance to win so bond he's been waiting patiently for to me to get to this segment where I said\nLiberal women were shocked to find this out\nThis weekend not all women believe what they believe this has been a a a image that has been carefully a promulgated on social media that is that\nYou know women in general all think alike and they're all mad at the Republicans are all mad if President Trump\nAnd this weekend that image promoted on social media was shattered\nAnd it does have electoral implications well talk about in a moment but I wanted to give you an example of what I'm Talking about New York times article Saturday the headline was white women come get your people Alexis Grinnell condemns the female senators who voted for Brett Kavanaugh in the article\nQuotes these women are gender traders\nThey've made standing by the patriarchy a full time job unquote\nShe goes on to accuse women who voted for President Trump as quote the same fifty three percent who put their racial privilege ahead of their second class gender status in two thousand and sixteen by voting to uphold a system that values only they're white yes\nJustice they have for decades unquote why would I quote that article because I was seeing that over and over again gender trader you women who are voting for the white patriarchy because that is in by the way a fact fifty three percent\nOf white women did vote for Donald Trump women of color generally vote for Democrats that's what happened in two thousand and sixteen and we're being told that suburban Republican women will be voting\nAgainst Republicans and give the Democrats the majority in the U.S house\nBecause they're so outraged by Donald Trump's behavior now the reason I'm a little cynical of that particular analysis is that is what we were told in two thousand and sixteen and that they were so outraged by Donald Trump's behavior\nThat they were going to vote for Democrats now we're being told the same thing and in other words as I've said on the previous program where we're being told were rerunning the last election you got to get it right this time and I'm going to talk a little bit more of those political implications in just a bit\nBut I Want to get to this commercial that now running in Rhode Island because as you get closer to election\nIt becomes clear what issues are going to impact that election you we can talk about it and we do leading up to the election but the fact is because of this nonstop political cycle you never know until you get to an election what issues are going to affect an election\nAnd so we now have behavior coming up as an issue in this upcoming election or maybe suburban women we're told\nWill be a voting against Donald Trump because they don't like his behavior or perhaps Republicans are going to be voting for Republicans because they're not happy with the behavior of the left\nHere's an example of that there is now a commercial running in Rhode Island Bob Flanders is running against Rhode Island Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse\nThe U.S Senator Whitehouse sits on the Senate Judiciary committee he questioned Brett Kavanaugh in that additional Ford Kavanaugh hearing that we had\nAt his questions are the framework for a new ad running in Rhode Island on behalf of Bob Flanders his opponent called gas bag here is that ad have you [noise]\nIt's ... or ... how do you pronounce that\nRefers to flash on we were sixteen [noise]\nGoing to talk about flatulence on a sixteen year of a badge [noise]\nUm [noise] I'm game\nWas on the world watching Senator Whitehouse asks about [noise]\n... [noise]\nWhat an embarrassment for [noise]\nMy select a problem solver [noise]\nAbove plan and I approve this message\nSo of course there are issues we're talking about these issues on this show but it is fascinating to me that behavior is becoming a big big issue now if you're on the left you say it's the behavior Donald Trump and the behavior of the Republicans toward women\nBut if you're on the right you are saying it's the behavior of the left like what we saw in DC this past weekend the pounding on and clawing at the Supreme Court doors\nAs Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in to the Supreme Court hears why this is important for the upcoming election I've told you on this program before\nThat in order for a party to win a majority in the legislative body they've got to win in some areas where they're not expected to win either Republican leaning districts or Republican district that has to happen it'd be the same as if the Republicans trying to gain the majority you got to win in some places you're not expected to win\nRice W H A radio news local story all this rain has to go somewhere and National Weather service hydrologist Jeff song says it's headed toward already full rivers and streams\nEspecially once they get north of interstate eighty and highway thirty those places that received a lot of rainfall over the past month or so and the capacity is very low rivers are running very high right now for this time of year in fact many locations mainstream cages are studying daily record high flows for this time of year\nFlood warnings or out for rivers in eastern Iowa flood watches posted permitting rivers in central Iowa\nOr top national story NTSB is investigating an accident in upstate New York that left twenty people dead\nIt happen Saturday when a limo failed to stop at an intersection and slammed into another vehicle in a parking lot all Eighteen people in the limo were killed\nTwo pedestrians also died I'm Trent rice ... news in thirty minutes breaking news and severe weather at once on a um ten forty on your radio and everywhere you are on the free ... heart radio app here's markets\nAnd good morning this market report Roger you this morning by ... mix December corn three sixty five and a half\nTwo and three quarters down march three Seventy seven three cents down November soybean eight sixty nine and three quarters three quarters higher January eight eighty three up half\nDecember we find is Seventeen and a half three and a half\nDown December live cattle one's Seventeen Seventeen down Ninety seven fed one Twenty one Seventy three eighty down November feed your cattle one fifty seven thirty five down eighty eight\nOctober lean hogs sixty eight Ninety eight Seventy eight December fifty eight oh five up by half\nA dollar November crude oil Seventy four oh three thirty one sense a barrel down those up six and a half\nPoints that's markets I'm Doug Cooper first thing\nIn the morning and the last thing and I get the news trafficking whether you need from Alexis say electric play ten forty W.

H. O. news brought to you by crossroads Shooting Sports [noise]\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news traffic and severe weather station news radio ten forty\nThere just seems to be a huge percentage\nOf social media posting that's what you're talking about which is it's really adrenalin emotional anger stuff\nAnd there's a lot of noise and not a lot of productive conversation so\nAre you surprised Melissa because you're an interesting combination you are your small business person and a mental health professional when companies get involved in civil would always surprised me like you know we're going to take this political stand and so you this thing and I'm like wow ... ... what do you think when you see that\n[noise] well I mean I I think that's up to a a company's values I mean what they know determinant and sometimes they're making that decision for marketing purposes and sometimes it's from mystic purposes and I'm not necessarily going to be the judge and that based on what I see on the outside but we still an email we can make our decisions as consumers\n[noise] what do you think all to mentally is the answer your you know I Love to get on Facebook for example when people are posted pictures of their kids their holiday picture shrink their vacations and stuff like that\nUm but then I ... I Try to ask myself as a person like well how much of the other stuff can I possibly tolerate 'cause I really want to get to the kid picked chosen Smith pictures and all that kind of stuff so I think we have to start setting some rules for ourselves to only\n[noise] yeah I think we have to use and he's healthy boundaries and and determine how much we can handle and and I think as your as your scrolling through to kind of check yourself and look for those physiological reactions in the sweaty palms the racing heartbeat stomach or the head and if I'm having those kinds of\nAnd respond and reactions and I'm and probably functioning more from I make a lot of my adrenaline released the fight or flight and and I mean the state of hyper arousal yeah if I'm getting to that\nThat's a good time and not comment to not post something\nBecause because I'm not using my present cortex and that's where rational thinking happened that's where I make decisions when thinking about what are the long term implication\nIt's of what I'm saying or doing like yeah right and so if I'm not adrenalin state it's a good idea to just step back a little bit take a deep breath and maybe it takes me a minute to work through that and adrenaline response and get to a rational place or maybe it's going to take me five years\nAnd before I can post on that specific topic and I think we just have to be more become more self aware so that the way that we are interacting with other is helpful to the conversation and it's also helpful to ourselves\nI like what you're saying especially about that adrenalin rush because I always think Melissa that I've over done it\nIf I'm it's bothering me like a half hour after I read stuff that I'm Still room and needing on it uh-huh and I always think okay why am I doing this to myself and you you got what you're saying is there is a physiological reason really for them to be my response was\nWell an adrenalin can be kind of addictive you know and yeah and if I'm stressed and I'm used to running on adrenaline I might keep looking for adrenalin fixes to keep that high going um but then that causes us to and function in a state that was really intended for short burst\nAnd not for long jeopardy right so that's where we end up burning ourselves out in causing health problems and and emotional fatigue and that kind of\nThing well and that kind of gets to a question I was going to ask you I think that might be the answer Melissa which is I've got friends that loved to I'll I'll call poke the bear and I love to get on social media and say something about whites everybody up and then you watch the comments section and there\nWere like there are people I I think what you're saying is they're seeking that adrenalin\nRush mhm mhm yeah yeah because once you once you have that you want more of it\nRight but ultimately that's not healthy [laughter]\n[laughter]\nSo I I mean if you were thinking about like the rules that we ought to create for ourselves because one of my my views on social media Melissa lives that\nWere advancing so far fast as a society technologically that we're not creating the social rules we need that's where the technology um because I I'm not for all you know pass a whole bunch of laws or anything like that I'm saying\nYou and I do agree to certain things and I tell this story I'm about just the other day a guy face timing while he was at the urine or in the bathroom [laughter] going to the bathroom and I thought\nThat that does he doesn't know that that's really\nThat's what I Do you let example because I think it's raising far ahead of our society's ability for you and me to go hey let's decide as a society here's the rule\nYou need some social advocate around yeah yeah yeah absolutely absolutely and and I think I think what social media is doing is revealing\nWhat is inside of us and and then this place that we have these control issues where we are afraid and so we try to control each other and social media is a place I think that's really coming to the surface and we're seeing it\nYou know so I think it's helpful if we can explore why am I having this response why am I releasing adrenalin why do I get so worked up when I see these certain post what is the fear behind that reaction\nRight okay I I mean I think those are those are great points by the way this has mental health counselor an entrepreneur Melissa vine of Des Moines ten Fifteen we're talking about how social media impacts our ability to communicate\nWith each other you know you're exactly right Neal is I think what you're inspiring me is is to try to think about why are people doing what they they do ... and you said he ... in one way it's a form of trying to control your world yeah\nAny other thoughts about when you because you're just like me I mean you're going down your your Facebook your Twitter feed and when you were looking at the different types of posts on there what comes to your mind what's the motivation\nThere well I think that and I think some people are almost looking for the adrenalin rush there almost looking to polarize and and it's almost like we want to be angry about some things sometimes that we go looking for our people [laughter] you know and and if you were to ask me about something\nPolitically right now and I didn't have enough information about it\nI might default to what my people and I put that in quotes and believed rather than actually exploring the issue for myself and and so when we tap into those and control issues what we're\nWhat we're really seeing it at play is this cognitive dissonance and so the best way to address cognitive dissonance is to allow ourselves to explore the opposite of what we believe and to really sit in that\nAnd I'm not even speaking to any certain belief system I writing in general and to allow ourselves to reading material and and really chew on it if it's something different than what we believe and and once we we read about both sides and learn about different angles of something and we come to our own beliefs about something where a lot less likely to be reactive\nThen if we're always believe the same thing and we're just afraid of exploring other avenues\nYeah I Know it's a great point so militias are going back to one of the points I made earlier do you think\nOf that the way we communicate on social media is now a translate into what I called real life you know so I'm there let's say I'm at a a bit of an event got some ah five friends there were starting to chat\nYeah is that interaction being impacted now are we changing the way we communicate face to face based on what we're doing on social media I think\nThat's a great question and I think that now and labels have become a lot more powerful than they used to be um because social media is causing us to label ourselves than what we believe in what groups we belong to an end when those buzz words come up in conversation I think it will can activate some of those same adrenaline and anger\nAnd the notion very quickly and easily and and then we tend to feel like\nOh I Can't be friends with this person because they said one of those buzz words or oh I feel really connected to this person because they said something that my group says\nYou know and and the other thing I think that we're also\nWere more were more drained as people can have all these kind of thing you're less likely to actually be able to be present with people and have healthy productive conversation because we have all this noise in our had been listening to all day\nWell no I mean that that affects my life because of course being a talk show host a lot of people like why don't you talked about that why do you talk about this when you talk about that and I'm like I Can't be that Matt all the time [laughter]\n... and here's the other thing is making me sad that this is on the uh the text line that I can see Melissa when were you and I are talking I don't keep poke the bear friends that means\nLike this person's doing what I'm doing which is the person that I consider to be a friend on Facebook I'm On following\nBecause I just can't handle it any more if they're wrong so angry all the time ... what I worry about 'em in in relation to that and what you just said about those buzz words is that we'll continue as a society\nTo separate into groups and I only have conservative friends I only have liberal friends I only have friends that have this religious belief is that a is that a legitimate worry in your mind\nAbsolutely because I think it moves us away from a place as of love and seeing people as as whole individuals I so I had actually been on both extremes at different points in my life right artist what my beliefs or and so I come to this place where\nI Would like to under ... I I Would like to ask to be able to understand better why does someone believe what they believe where's that coming from and and how can we find ways to build bridges with each other and rather than just punching each other and they know\nRight that is mental health counseling entrepreneur Melissa vine of Des Moines Melissa those are fascinating comments and I gotta feeling people will be thinking about this conversation for the rest of the day in a good way [laughter]\nIt didn't activate anger and it adds up [laughter]\nThanks for joining me I'm sure we'll talk again okay thank you thank you ten twenty news radio ten forty is W.

H. O. in Des Moines good morning to a\nGreat great to be with each other so John despite all of the hostility that was hurled at President Reagan he's considered one of the best presidents this country has ever seen can President Trump comes through this as well like President Reagan did what do you think\nWell I you know nothing's impossible I'd say it's probably pretty difficult for\nThe media they ever fall back in love with a with Trump is ... as they did over the years with Ronald Reagan and you know in many respects at the ... have been treated very similarly Reagan was\nNever the darling of the media when he was president at all but the advantage that President Trump has over President Reagan on the media front is that technology has changed times so much so that\nTrump frankly doesn't need the liberal media to get his message out he's able that with a couple of songs on any given morning during your talk directly to his base unfiltered and reach out to a hundred million Americans and then President Reagan never had that opportunity just just didn't exist\n[noise] yeah I think about that John because I'm a big fan of President Reagan's speeches and and how articulate he was on various issues man is social media it existed back in Reagan's day he he he completely would've taken advantage of it with me\nOh my gosh yes in fact I get that question asked more often than any other and that is if President Reagan\nCould've tweeted woody and [laughter] yeah absolutely hate wall of a you know Reagan was a master communicator and as you all well no there W.
