R. G.\nR. topical story this hour you're about to see we're getting started on ... new skate park today trees will start coming down on the grounds preparation will be done before when winter they're holding their groundbreaking in just about an hour and a half from right now ten thirty this morning the new lords and skate park is expected\nHere's the problem when Neal Finn was doing um a his own songs fantastic\nMatter of fact he did a don't dream it's over which was a song he wrote and performed with credit how going into landslide with Stevie Nicks that was amazing but when he did Lindsay Buckingham functionally can't not that's not Lindsay Buckingham\nAnd uh and then a first encore song was a tribute to Tom Petty Stevie Nicks doing free falling and she was so amazing so she was amazing the crowd was eating out of her hand\nThe show when she was not performing yeah that's my Fleetwood Mac review also this past weekend of course the big news with the Iowa football teams they all did great\nAnd the Iowa State band went viral tell us fantastic so they did the Jurassic Park theme during halftime during the Iowa State football games\nAnd a bunch of folks dressed up as T rex is came out and danced including swaying back and forth rhythmically\nTo the Jurassic Park themes that went viral Fox Sports picked it up first then ESPN picked it up and then everybody was picking it up it was it was it was tremendous Fox was having so much fun with it that they went back and they edited in the Jurassic Park scene where the scientists see the dinosaurs for the first time\nSo you had like stem Neal\nAs staring at the swaying dinosaurs Jurassic Park on the Internet it was a it was stupendous and congratulations the Iowa State banned always always entertaining always spectacular they went viral this past weekend\nThe news this past weekend let's talk about this uh Jason Clay where is the investigative reporter for the Des Moines register\nHe went and got all of the sworn at a desk ... de ... there you go it's Monday others have coffee for Jeff depositions\nWhen former GOP staffer Kirsten Anderson sued the Senate Republicans over sexual harassment you'll recall that ultimately that lawsuit resulted in a settlement uh and uh it ... it has been completed\nNow the issue that that irritated Republicans on social media\nWas that because this is a deposition involving a lawsuit against Republicans only the Republicans were accused of poor behavior in the legislature in this article that is the nature of the lawsuit you does it was a Republican said this this Republicans said that and the Republicans like wow that's really not very fair\nNow to be fair to Jason Clay worth today he has done an article on the ... situation which is that a navy Bolton accusing the Des Moines register of a poor\nUh conduct sexually toward some women in a social situation away from the ... the legislature the Democratic leader leadership in the Senate has called on him to resign he says I'm not going to resign\nAnd so there's going to be an investigation what that means is he's going to go before\nAt this particular point the ethics committee in the Iowa Senate which that I don't know what they can do about this isn't just behavior away from the legislature but that's what you got and Jason wrote the article today to be fair but then you had this huge article that appeared in the Sunday Edition\nOr using all these depositions and say oh these Republicans said this is a Republican said\nThat um and uh so you're wondering like a you know where the Democrats just standing around all the time go must do this [laughter] Republican behavior is outrage well no of course not [noise]\nAh there was a Republican staffer in the I'm In the article said it's a locker room atmosphere ended the Democrats participate in the locker room atmosphere absolutely they did\nAbsolutely that it [noise] um I served in the legislature from Nineteen Ninety seven to two thousand and eight and yes it it was it was and I think it's changing much like offices across the state or because of the me too movement I think it's changing I think people are reevaluating their behavior\nBut yeah there was a a a locker room atmosphere or in the legislature what I was there was I've also admitted to you that I was a participant in it and that now I've said some things that I look back on trying to be funny\nOr complementary that I regret and that's what the me too movement is doing culturally it makes us all go look back at what we've said and how we've acted in the past and go ... ... okay\nAnd you'll recall that I had former Senate President Mary Kramer on who was asked to look into all of these allegations after she completed her look into it\nAnd one of the questions I asked her during the interview was you know is the legislature worse than a lot of the office situations you've been in and I didn't even finish the question she went yes yes yes yes yes Jeff\nAnd I knew she was going to I suspect that you can answer that here is the issue with the Iowa legislature that's a little bit different than in office situation look to run for office you have to have any go okay you have to have an ego and the first place that's what causes you to run for office\nWhen you get elected then you really have any do you do I did other legislators do you you're you're sitting on top of the world you've been elected you're an elected official you know you you think you're you're a big smarty pants if you will\nAnd I'm a guy like me and other guys in the legislature you know we're we're guys or go wrong and have gone wrong in the office is they'll often go you know the women are really flattered by my inappropriate remarks and attention and they're not\nBut you create an atmosphere which up until the me too movement\nYou know the the women would go along to get along for the most part and you thought oh yeah they think I'm funny in Germany and you know and they're ... deaths but it's my job\nAnd what the me too movement the positive effect of the me too movement is that it is saying the guy's students [noise] check your behavior toward the women your office they're actually not flattered they kind of put up with it\nAnd they don't really like it and it's gotten me reevaluate it got a lot of people reevaluating\nSo on the political end of things look the Democrats are in a position in Iowa of there for the grace of God go why of course they were participants all of that they just didn't get held accountable to the level that the Republicans were but were they inappropriate to yeah\nAnd of course are they the Democrats are loving the register article because there's this positioning\nIn elections coming up of trying to get the moral authority on this particular issue and and I don't think either party has moral authority on this particular issue but they're going to try that anyway now here's a cab yet to that does all of this because I'm sure if you read this article\nYou saw your own office in it as well and I had numerous conversations with men who are after the me too movement went and went nationwide about how you just reevaluate\nYour behavior in general is a guy in the office and I think as as a guy in the office we're all trying to be better people so I think that's a positive about the me too movement I Am worried about the\nPolitical weaponization of the me too movement because when things become politicized\nThen it's easy to dismiss them set to give you an example of racism OK racism is an issue in in this country you know a guy walks into a store a retail store a black guy\nA in West Des Moines and gets accused of stealing the jacket that he's got on and you can kinda prove it's because he's a black guy that's that's true racism OK however\nIf you just throw racism out against people that you disagree with that ... that that's that's being used as a political weapon so for example a little bit later in the show we're going to talk about the immigration issue and its impact on the upcoming election\nI Do believe for example that we need to reform the immigration system and go to a merit based system like the president is talking about\nNow if I come up to you and I say I want to tell you about reforming immigration could\nYou just don't like brown people that's what your problem it no I mean it's an easy way to get out of the argument but it's not true but what happens is the net cheapens the use of the word racism any cheapens efforts to really go after\nRacism in this country because you start to look at it in part as in terms of racism that's just what the liberals use when they don't want to argue with me about immigration\nAnd you don't want that to happen to me too movement either that's just what people use as a political weapon when they don't want people I don't know confirmed to the U.S Supreme Court because that was the issue with the Capitol hearing a lot of people said it was being weaponized against Brett Kavanaugh to keep a constitutional originalists off the Supreme Court\nAnd when that happens the issue is then that people can easily dismissed any kind of discussion of this kind of movement because they just say I that's just politics and that's what I worry\nBecause there are a lot of good things going on in regard to uh uh the me too movement in regard to addressing racism in this country but once the politicians get a hold of everything they just tend to ruin it\nSo this is here's the deal or according to my experience in the legislature the locker room atmosphere\nWas in fact perpetuated by both Republicans and Democrats alike and I hope that it is in fact improving as it is improving in offices across the state as men reexamine their behavior toward women in their office was you heard on the W.

Democratic National convention out was sharing an immigration commission called for lowering legal immigration though it has been a bipartisan issues the voters to pretty much stayed the same party a gun in different\nDirections well and Chris what I was looking over your numbers here here's what surprised me we're not talking in most instances fifty one percent we're talking fairly big numbers saying I Would like Congress to look at the legal immigration numbers\nRight right and one of the reasons why when you look at\nYou know the Senate voted on legislation back in February that would have reduced quite a bit of ... would have reduced legal immigration by about a hundred thousand and then eventually about fifty thousand over time and then the house voted on Bob Goodlatte bill earlier this summer\nOn that would have cut legal immigration by about two hundred and fifty to three hundred thousand and both of those pieces of legislation bailed than the main reason why they get all support from Republican was because of the immigration reduction and that was\nAre the reason why we want to do the polling because you have that you have both senators and representatives states like California and even ... ... I don't think it's a good idea to reduce illegal immigration even though their voters to support it\nRight and and what Chris what's the reasoning behind this and of course the reason that I'm asking you is that both you and I\nHave the same goals I meant agreement with a lot of numbers USA's policy goals but what I Want to talk about it it's I'm told it's because I'm racist so is it fear of people from other countries are what's driving it\nThe fact that there are so many people across ideological lines would say we ought to take a look at the legal immigration numbers in this country\nRight well I think one thing people don't and instill their coal and ... and ... and ... and\nUh this ... hour pulling help educate educate voters around the country they don't realize that our immigration system does bring in one point one million new legal immigrants every single year that's not part of a you know the illegal immigration debate that's a totally separate debate at this country really doesn't ask\nIs over legal immigration other than these ... and and and Congress earlier this year um\nSo that's one thing people don't realize how many legal immigrants come into the country every single year I think part of it is the fear but people look at it as a worker issue even though the economy is doing really well right now we have record low unemployment rate um you know people they'll look at\nThey look at ... ... immigration as as as folks coming in and the and entering the job market competing with American workers for job you know as I said the unemployment rate is lower wages have an increase in over a decade or so people would like to see their wages go up and usually the only way wages go up as how height or labor market\nI'm ... and folks are also starting to become more aware of the fact that eighty eight percent of our population growth in this country is due to a new immigrant and their children\nThe other thing that I found fascinating this weekend because I knew Chris you and I were going to talk was uh the media seems a bit stumped\nThat Hispanics are are are becoming more and more supporter of President Trump and then there's ... there's this belief system that obviously the Hispanic vote is going to be against President Trump because of his talk about immigration but\nAre you finding that most Americans look at it didn't look you were honest about it I'm honest about it part of this is sort of fear of the of the other person so let's say let's be honest with it out there but it seems like a major driver of this Chris\nIs the wage issue the economic issue and that that doesn't matter what your background is\nRight right and that's the key when you're looking at this panic Americans in our polling did look at it it just break down a on a national level we just broke out\nBack when we found that a majority of panicked want reduced immigration as well and the reason for it is because especially when new immigrants come to the country from Hispanic country where do they ... they tend to move in areas that are more heavily ... bad act\nSo they're creating more direct job or Hispanic so there are a lot of Hispanic Americans that you recognize that it ... dropped competition that's driven by legal immigration and they want us to be more enforced meant to take away the fact of had to remove the illegal immigration component of it as well\nSo Chris you work for numbers usa final question for you which is\nUm here you've got these numbers you got policies that I think most Americans do support regardless of ideology but you noted earlier in the interview a lot of politicians run away from this thing is it because that the racism argument is so strong that they'll get accused of being raises and they just don't want to deal with it\nYeah I think it I think there are two factors the first one is is absolutely about one they don't want to be viewed as quote unquote insensitive hurt labeled as an anti immigrant\nAnti immigrant 'em by the second part of it is is the donor class a dark class the big business U.S Chamber of commerce the farm workers a Westerner restaurant growers association that\nThat that uh you know it's a consortium of farmers out west they want more immigration because they keep wages down um and that's that's the bottom line\nThey they want they don't want to hire labor market they wanna booster labor market because it it it prevent them from having to wait for ages raise wages\nChristian Lenski he is from numbers usa Chris always fascinating to talk with you on this issue thanks very much for having me\nAnd that some Frank talk from Chris right there by the way ten sixteen is our time\nWhich is that often when you talk about immigration reform in this country then you get attacked as a a racist in that ...\nAll of the uh the talk about immigration in this country however the other data that I'm seeing over and over again is it's not that people are mad at the immigrants they do blamed business for the problems that we have they blame business\nFor trying to keep wages down that's what Chris was saying but politicians avoid the issue because they think there'll be called racist\nAnd that is not the way people view\nMost to view this issue for the most part\nWith the election coming up I was fascinated by the fact that Republicans\nAre as they think about trying to turn out their base try to get people more excited they are going to turn again to the immigration issue they are going to talk about immigration this is all about getting up your base getting them just as excited as the Democrats are\nTo come out for the election I Am also fascinated and you hear me talking about this segment after segment\nAbout how the behavior of your political opponents is becoming a part of this election so if you are on the Democratic side you say look my people are all fired up because they don't like the way President Trump is behaving\nWhat's interesting is on the Republican side now given the behavior of the left during the cabinet hearing them now making the Republicans are an issue of left his behavior as we go into the election or just to give you an idea this is the audio from an ad\nThat has been released by the Republican National committee and it is called the left on on the hinged a mob here is that audio\nThey go low we [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] please get up in the face of from Congress people and that's\nSo in that Al Gore's ... multiple quotations as are some Democrats attempt to hitch their wagon\nTo this craziness that we're seeing and then uh CNN defending it by saying referring to these folks as a mob is offensive that's that's not a mob so\nI Am fascinated by the fact that here on this show you and I are talking issues and we're talking about immigration which is important we're talking about health care which is important we're talking about taxes which is important but as the Republicans and the Democrats continue to try to keep their particular bases fired up\nWhat they're also trying to do was emphasized the behavior of the other side and of course what you're hoping is if you're a Democrat or Republican that the independent voters will join you and your outrage\nAnd that was very interesting as we go into this fall's election\nComing up next we been talking on this show about the different important issues that are going to come before the now conservative U.S Supreme court\nA vital one is right around the corner is affirmative action I'll tell you about it next ten twenty news radio ten forty is W. H. Joe another exclusive Urbana\nSee you next chance when one thousand dollars from W H A radio is coming up right after the eleven o'clock news is called the grand in your hand contests are sixteen chances sixteen a day to win\nOne thousand dollars right after the eleven o'clock news you'll get a key word from the big show guys you text that two hundred two hundred and then we because you might get a phone call saying you've won on this fine fine now sunny Monday one thousand dollars earlier in the hour I was talking about the immigration debate\nAnd the trouble that politicians have in talking about immigration reform what about in our daily lives do you ever tried to uh start to have a conversation with a friend about a hot topic like immigration and it just goes south pretty quickly\nThat's why I was fascinated by this book conversations worth having\nUsing appreciative inquiry to fuel productive and meaningful conversations one of the co authors of that book is Sherry tours and Sherry's on the Lipman law news maker line Sherry welcome to W. H. O. in Des Moines a Eric I accidentally hung up on her producer friend could [laughter]\nWe will give her a call right back is typically a Monday it is a been an issue like going right through of this particular issue I've been a attempting to\nKind of moved through the program on a Monday and you've been hearing me like make mistakes\nDuring this live this life program and I'm just like it is a Monday I just need more coffee and therefore I accidentally hit the wrong button and trying to get my guest up thank you super producer Eric you are a friend of mine Jerry welcome to W. H. joined them on good morning\nWarning thank you so much for having us\nLet's open with the the the obvious question in a big way I've been talking about immigration specifically but in a big way how do you have conversations about topics like this in a productive sort of way\nReally want to be asking questions instead of making statements and advocating for your side of thing um that\nTrying to get to the heart of what is the other person really think and why do they think that way and what outcomes are they hoping for what's the what's important to them and how\nMight we find some common ground about what's important that both of us\n[noise] so is that what you mean by appreciative in where you where before you just launch into what you think about something you're trying to figure out where they're coming from and I really like what you just said what their goal is as well\nYes um\nIf you break appreciative inquiry found it to appreciate Maine to either value or something or to increase the value added value so it's about asking questions", "show_name": "Need to Know with Jeff Angelo", "year": "2018", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "15"}
