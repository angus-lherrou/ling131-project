stories from Des Moines news traffic and severe weather station news radio ten forty\nNine o'clock I'm Wendy Wild WHM radio news cloudy skies\nPatchy shower activity still in the southern part of the state right now temperature fifty two degrees starting to rise up all across central Iowa details on the weekend weather coming up a local story is the moderate to locally heavy rain possible over the next week in waves that could end up pushing rivers into flood stage again\nWe're concerned about the Des Moines the rack and reverse as well as many other rivers in central Iowa or if we get this heavy rainfall this advertised over the next week or so we could definitely see some flooding on both of Des Moines and the rack and rivers in central Iowa included the Des Moines metro area\nIn her opening comments with the Ford allegations and in fact one of my friends on Twitter yesterday said thought experiment if we'd gone on we'd gone into the hearing last week with just Dr Ford's allegations\nAnd she gives her emotional testimony and then he comes back and he gives his testimony\nIs he still going to be a Supreme Court judge does is his nomination withdrawn does he not have the votes in other words\nWas it the other wild allegations that came out that actually prevented the Democrats from gaining any ground based on Dr forge testimony\nIsolate yourself you got Dr Ford's testimony emotional I came away from it saying something bad\nHas happened to this woman I don't know if Brett Kavanaugh was involved but something bad has happened to her and at the end of her testimony people on social media said Brett Kavanaugh's folks this is this is a horrible moment for the Republican than Brett Kavanaugh came out and said look\nUh I wrote these comments only one other person is seen him and I'm going to defend the honor of me and my family and he was Matt\nAnd the reason that he made the point of it you know I'm the one who wrote these comments was people thought that his interview with Fox News was way too staged it reminded me of the ...\nA pale in interviews after she was nominated for vice president that somebody in a matter of fact I Would say some buddies\nSat down with Sarah Palin and\nBrett Kavanaugh to advance the Fox news interview and just filled is head with here's what you gotta you gotta be this has got to be your demeanor here's what you got to say blah blah blah and he looked robotic and he looked at me and it looked to staged and the Fox news interview did not help him and I think he knew it\nAnd I think people around them knew it he said I Am writing my own comments\nFor the for my hearing and he came out swinging and he's now written a piece in the wall Street Journal that said you know what you saw that I was mad and yes I did say things that probably were inappropriate\nBut I was fighting for my reputation I was fighting for the reputation of uh for for the good of my family having to talk to my daughters about these accusations\nYeah ... ... he came out of that and I think it saved his nomination so then I felt as a person that with like a conservative on the U.S Supreme Court a little punched in the gut last week when Senator flake said there should be another weeks investigation but what happened in that week\nWas there were more wild allegations being made there were more crazy theories being floated about what his um his yearbook inscriptions meant\nMatter of fact we will talk about that or shortly the devil's triangle which is I thought that that that does that was peak craziness well we'll talk about that in a little bit\nBut my point is that the week I think actually did help him I have to say that more wild allegations which created a a thought process I think among a lot of people that Dr Ford's allegations was just another in a series of wild allegations\nAnd so there were allegations then of course you have the FBI report which seems like the FBI report came back and by the way CNN reports that this report is one thousand pages long\nAnd mark judge was interviewed a you remember mark judge was the guy the Democrats and the judicial committee wanted brought before the judicial committee\nThe friend that was supposedly in the room laughing during the sexual assault of Dr Ford while he was not brought before the committee\nBut CNN said because of course now we just got to go with sources\nThat he was interviewed for three hours by the FBI and remember the point of my attorney that you heard on this show Wendy Patrick who said look the FBI knows what they're doing you you unleash them you say go look\nAnd then you come back with a report she said trust the FBI don't trust the politicians they're trying to direct\nThe um the investigation trust the FBI and there's been what CNN says is a thousand page report that the Congress people were able to read and the fact is that you have this allegation\nBy Dr Ford and you don't have any kind of cooperation whatsoever that's where we're at if you step back from your own partisan filter\nYou you may want conservative on the Supreme Court like I Do or you may be against Brett Kavanaugh because you don't want another conservative ... totally get that but you have to admit that where we where we are at factually is an allegation of sexual assault against him when he was in high school\nAnd no cooperation the people that she said we're at the party either say I was at that party I don't know Brett Kavanaugh um nothing like this was ever a I I I don't know any information about this particular allegation that's where we're at\nSo that's why I Am surprised as I watch the closed caption version of what Schumer and Feinstein are saying on the floor that they're continuing to talk about this credible allegation which I think a lot of people now say\n... ... a credible in what way is the only way it was her emotional testimony which said\nTo me in my non partisan mode just watching or something bad has happened to Dr Ford I just don't know Brett Kavanaugh\nWas involved and there isn't any evidence or cooperation that he was involved that's where we're at factually at this point nine sixteen is our time we're going to talk a little bit later in the hour with GOP chair Jeff Kaufmann about the political implications of the Kavanaugh hearings he believes as many do at this point\nThat it has helped the Republicans this fall in fact\nI wanted to talk to you just for a moment about my conversation yesterday with BBC World news I was very pleased that BBC World news came to me and said we'd like you to talk to our audience on television are global audience\nAbout what you think is going on politically right now and uh one of the questions I got asked after the interview was completed was um ... were the b._b._c. questions any different than you would expect from the American media\nI got done with the interview came out of the uh the studio and the and and one of my fellow employees asked me that\nThe interesting thing to me was no\nThey're opening question to me was this is the BBC\nDid the Kavanaugh hearing energized Republicans even though the the BBC is on to this and of course my answer was yes it has you you can't argue that now what I Will say being fair about putting on my analysts cat\nIs I don't know where the independents are going to land right now but I've been saying for months the Democrats are fired up about this election and they are they are but now the Republicans are too so where does the independence plant\nDo the independence say look I still want the Democrats to be a check on the Republicans\nAre are the independence so horrified by behavior that they saw the last two weeks\nThat they go you know I Can't put these people in charge of the country that that's a big thing they also asked me about the top issues are in the election which are are very much the same whether you're a Republican or Democrat it just as a different viewpoint on those issues it still is health care\nIt still is the economy it still is how your government is being run does your government speak for you\nThose those are the issues it's just two different approaches that was the question and finally they said how much of a factor is Donald Trump in the local elections your congressional elections that was my final question\nMy answer to that was I don't think much to be honest with ya I Know that's not the popular answer to give\nBut here's the thing you've got some really good candidates out there and I say that on behalf of the Democrats and the Republican so using the David Young Cindy Axne erase as an example Cindy Axne he is a very good candidate you may disagree with her ideology and her ideas but she's a good candidate\nDavid Young of course is a really good candidate very articulate on the issues very learned on the issue of very hard worker when you've got really good candidates I'm not sure the factor that Trump actually plays\nIn the local elections of course he would come in to fire up his supporters when he's doing these rallies his supporters are very passionate he's inspiring them to go vote and defend his agenda and I totally get that\nBut if you've got us you've got to square off locally between really good candidates as we do in Iowa\nThen I think a lot of it does come down to the candidates themselves I'm not sure that Donald Trump actually makes a big big difference or in this uh uh in this race\nAnd these races across the state coming up next why did a senator look at the FBI report yesterday and then come out and say man you got to be smoking bong if you'd come to any other conclusion\n[noise]\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news traffic and severe weather station news radio

S. refund probably actually\nYou with the biggest names in the news on the living in la for newsmakers by\nLetting in law from your first call for about one workman's comp or personal injury claims\n[noise]\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news trap began severe weather see news radio ten forty\nFrom person to get the perception value of the increased wage well just taking that money right back on the back end by increasing the health insurance premiums\nAnd so I guess the bottom line is there's really all you know we we discuss the politics of it the policy of it the practicality of all this stuff but there isn't really anything going on right now that's reducing healthcare costs whether it's for me or it in for an employer am I right\nThere is no you're absolutely right and and it was interesting I was having a discussion about this specific study earlier today with someone and I said you know ... everybody's culpable here no nobody's nobody's getting off on this uh ... not responsible because here's the challenge\nUh employers are really in a tight position the Affordable CARE Act\nVery specific requirements as to who employers had to cover at what level they reduced the forty hour work week to uh thirty our\nThey are required a certain level of coverage in the essential health benefits and Republicans couldn't get their act together and get that a ... you know repealed\nAnd as such employers are now stuck with having to cover more people and they're really at the um the insurance industry which is just find anything that health care system is kind of taken it to him\nAnd so the end result though is what I've said on your show number types the health insurance premiums are derivative of health care costs and we as a as a society as Americans\nAre awful consumers of health care\nAttention we don't research we don't ask questions we just blindly trust of the people in the white lab coats and marched to their orders and unfortunately we're culpable now in this ongoing cost\nOf health well and Seth when you say that and he said he'd previously in the show I get a bunch of tax in a bunch of emails are saying finally someone is saying this\nWhich is we are still not addressing health care costs and that's where the problem lies and you're saying that that we've got to be consumers to try to get it down but is that possible with this big third party system that we continue to seem\nTo be increasingly relying on\nIt is difficult and it's difficult because these third party systems is you're discussing a or not we're only giving out their information they don't want to be transparent matter of fact they want to be more inclusive they want to cut you know pull the curtains even more and\nSo you know this is the power of our system though we are the electorate we are the consumer we have power we just have to exercise that power we need Uncle Sam to step up in Washington to get their act together not take over the health care system you know I think both agree that would be a very bad idea\nThat's a bad idea [laughter] innovation going out the window that would do it in a heartbeat um but the government regulates the speed limits on the highway right right\nRegulate commerce they need to regulate the healthcare system and say hey it's not right in an IV bags that costs a dollar to produce is built on average\nFive hundred and forty dollars yeah hospital right so this is the area we need is an electorate\nTo step up and make our voices heard the second piece of this though is where there is data available we need to ask questions when you ask questions of our doctors we need to ask questions of our practitioners to say is this the right drug for me is is the right place I Need to go to get that MRI\nArgue in network right most of the bill that we review in office for our clients oftentimes find employers I'm having employees who go to a hospital only to find out they were ... by three different out of network ...\nOh yeah we're asked the question right\nEspecially if you're in you're in a doctor's office your doctor comes in you don't think about asking hey buddy you a network otherwise I get out of here [laughter]\nThat's exactly right in the recent recent report a show that emergency rooms across the United states are now staffing their facilities without a network doctors more and more ... and so while you may very well think I'm going to a hospital I Know and then my health insurance network and that very well might be a doctor that is saying you likely is knocked\nAnd therefore you're going to get hundreds of dollars in bills three to six months following that visit\nSeth ... you always bring a fascinating perspective to to me this is my healthcare experts ... thanks very much for joining me on this today and of course we'll be talking in the future have a great weekend\nThey shifted insect friday October fifth substance in there again open enrollment time for most of us and that insurance\nBill and and\nThis is happening partially because of mandated care as south was pointing out and he says you know the solution is not more
