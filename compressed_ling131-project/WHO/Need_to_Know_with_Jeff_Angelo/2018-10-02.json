today's top stories from Des Moines news propaganda severe weather see news radio ten forty\nNine o'clock I'm Wendy Wild W Rachel radio you our top level stories this hour the man shot sitting in a car Sunday afternoon in Des Moines was at target say police\nThe number of gun shots fired and this incident directly after the victim certainly indicates that that uh\nHe was the one thought out\nA plurality of people don't like the heartbeat bill the heartbeat bill being the abortion bill that the strictest in the country if you can pick up a fetal heartbeat you can no longer a board that of course is getting challenged in court\nBut here's the thing that that polling data doesn't tell you and this is important\nThis is important the passion of people on an issue there are a lot of issues out there that we're talking about a new show every day and if a pollster calls and says can I get your opinion on an issue you mean your opinion an issue that doesn't mean that that particular issue is the one that affects your vote\nThe passion on an issue is what impacts of up so I wanted to check in with you today because I don't have polling I just go to the listeners and get their opinion five one five to eight or ten forty\nAnd the Americans opposite accessories tax line is five one five Ninety nine ten forty what do you think the issues are that will actually impact people's vote\nThis coming fall there are a lot of issues but in Iowa you're having conversations with your friends your\nThinking about it what are the issues that you think will actually impact people's votes because for example I purposely mentioned the heartbeat bill which is that uh the Des Moines register immediate ... has a plurality people ah don't like the heartbeat bill\nBut of course I Know blocks and blocks of voters that are anti abortion pro life whatever you want to call him and that's ways their vote that is a strong enough issue\nThat its ways their vote that is a significant issue in favor I\nThink the pro life people are very motivated to vote on that issue alone I think if my pro choice\nFriends that maybe they'll vote for ... pro choice candidate as a as part of a block of other libertarian or liberal views on issues but I'm not sure that's an issue that drives people to Paul how about the controversy over the cabinet off thing\nWhere people are looking this thing this is ridiculous one way or the other maybe you're you you hate the way the Dr Ford got treated and you really do think the Republicans are anti woman and that motivates you or you're looking at this and going I Can't I Can't stand the behavior of the left on this I'm going to go\nWatch my protests but maybe that's a big issue you know another issue that doesn't get talked about at all under the radar buddies gun control\nWe were talking about it in the aftermath of all of the mass shootings that got top\nAnd now now it's faded from the the conversation but I Know those are motivated voters those that are pro Second Amendment is that\nSignificant in your vote 'em immigration we're not really talking about that at the moment but we were for quite awhile particularly in the aftermath of Mali tip it's murder\nIs that what motivates people what are you thinking what are people talking about or that you think will in fact\nA make a difference in their votes either for you personally you can you can weigh in personally or what your friends are telling you joy wants to weigh in and she's got an a personal opinion\nAbout what is a making a difference in regard to her vote Joyce thanks for checking in on this issue or what what's making a big difference for you what is affecting your vote this fall by\nI rocked and I I can depend on my power at ...\nAt a lot of that that you talk it out and motivate me out at certain rats\nYeah and I'm conservative asked by that have and I think it made me a great yeah I mean really great\nAnd cater to the point where I have never been politically active and going out campaigning hurt people are getting Ninety or a couple of times but not very like you know wait a local people I'm going to be giving\nIt a lot of money for the national are headed favorite air all of them that I can afford and I'm going to be a little cut down because I'm Matt [noise] yeah I Do not want\nThat kind of crap to take over the house and and I and oh great\nYeah what are you mad about when you say I'm mad overly cabinet thing what made you mad joy\nI'm I I have four but I have three boys yeah and I I and that may have\nTalent they're probably starting [laughter] half right okay and\nAnd my boy but even if even ask any of what they say is true and I don't believe any of that trio forget about the ... like that one out\n... yeah yeah that's what the yeah that was crazy how\nI I don't believe any of that trip but even at\nAny part of that is true it was thirty six years ago she never came forward and he had these people who have that where where record\nAnd to correct that his family his little girl truth there how totally inappropriate but you want your kids your how they pick out it was completely over that and I'm now I'm really not\nJoy I mean there are a lot of people like you and I I appreciate that you've called to represent that that voice that's out there thanks very much\nSaid here here's an interesting point about the joy just made\nAnd I'm Still thinking about this which is to water fact\nOur national issues impacting your local vote\nSo if you're contemplating for example Cindy Axne named David Young to what extent does the national issue override maybe the local issues that are getting debated in the young acne race like healthcare and and the tariffs and things like that\nI Wonder about that because I Know who did during the day of the cabin off for hearing that the term white male was being thrown around by a lot of the folks on the left on social media\nAs an insult and I talked about it on friday white male white male white male and I thought okay\nIs it becoming apparent to people\nThat the the issue that drives the national\nDemocratic Party is that they're anti white male and if you think that's an over the top statements the top story in Washington Post today is oh the capital of things you're as a lot of white males mad that's an entire story in the Washington Post so has\nThe party the Democratic party the party of JFK the working man and FDR the working man or the working woman now working man and woman so so that I don't get off my point here\nAre suddenly become the anti white male party nationally that's what their whole agenda centers around\nDoes that actually impact local folks when you're thinking about the race like between a Cindy Axne you David ... and you've heard the issues on this program that they're debating health care pre existing conditions the terror that the trade or you know the issues that that they are talking about is that\nWhat you center your vote on or or the or the national issues creeping in and just giving you a general a view of what these what these folks stand for as a political party and ah and you're not liking it so for example on the American top prison accessories Tex ...\nJeff I've heard from people who are voting Democrat because of me to the me too movement so I\nI told you what I think of you you know the the big issue is\nWith the Democratic party but is there an overall view that the Republican Party in in ... is in fact not the pro woman that's disrespectful to women and therefore that is over writing a lot of the local issues that are also fascinating to me\nAs I follow the local elections or are you calling in to a four ten forty talked to me about what you think\nIs a motivating you or your friends to vote this particular issue here comes Dan with his viewpoint damn thanks for calling in what's motivating you this fall when you go vote\nLovers um basically it's real issues are illegal immigration ... health care\nAnd the judge Kavanaugh\nYeah I think that's interesting 'cause I I hear you're on the health care issue I hear you on the immigration issue the judge Kavanaugh issue really has become something resonating with people so how does the judge Kavanaugh issue Dan resonate with you what's motivating you develop\nWell how is it ... the\nWay that they're acting in handling the yeah taking away the entire\nDue process of I mean he is guilty and it has to prove himself in a there is no I mean the case that is made against them but that it can buy any or\nOr anything it's bad enough that information and Rick I'm over the coals\nJust because of the show yeah so I think of to shovel\n...

I think the last ... president I laughed but he wants to lock he's going to the fact that\n[noise] and and what he has to do then Rachel is just what you said and it really seems like\nRepublicans don't like these showdowns where are we say all or nothing we're not going to take the budget unless it contains it but that's where you have to come down to it right where you basically have to say I am not signing another funding bill until you give me my border wall\nI think he he needs to be saying that loud and clear starting now and I met a Congress doesn't really\nBelieve that President when he says you know that he is doesn't like it the other is not going to find it because you thought he said he wasn't going to find another under there\nAnd then he got it you know they they have never seen you ... ... ... you're going to have to show that he area I think you need to start messaging on this early I'm going to veto any do you and me unless it has border wall and then he may have to follow through on our twice once or twice I think for him to get results\nAnd and that would all have to take place in December during the lame duck session he'd have to be forcing them to do something right that's right\nIs it possible they say well you know we're a lame duck session Mr President we just don't we don't care that you're vetoing this I mean it it does does it come down to a battle of wills here\nI think to some extent it may uh and I don't recreate I put my money I got benefits\nRace if the battle will [laughter] not really shown\nA lot of bark at so I think you're knocking over a couple of times I Do that\nWell that is a great point Rachel because the Trump supporters are very passionate about the president and about Congress roll a little math so he can use this right to get his way [laughter]\nYou have that and it hasn't kept it on the side of town but they're not together for about I have a much lower Ecuador ready to send a grab\nBag when I started using that that is a conservative partnership senior policy director her name's Rachel boulevard Rachel you've done a great job of keeping you up to date and I gotta feeling where the check you know and this again thanks very much for joining me today\nMy pleasure thanks for having me\nTen sixteen is our time I Want to go to an important domestic issue here I don't want to be all politics today because there are things that we talk about as a society that I think are important for us\nTo talk about and I want to a chat about happy marriages and their impact on society before I get to that a reminder about my Fleetwood Mac\nGive away because if you haven't heard about this I Want you to get in on this before it is too late this concert is coming up on October fourteen that Wells Fargo arena here's what you can do\nTo win a pair of tickets to Fleetwood Mac October fourteenth Wells Fargo arena go to W.

line Jim welcome to W. H. Joe radio in Des Moines good morning\nHey good to be with you today\nSo Jim we know the general details new trade deal Canada Mexico United States break it down for me is this in fact a good deal for the United states what do you think\nYou know I think on balance it is a good deal and of course at the Heritage Foundation we we thought that the NAFTA was a good deal but it needed to be updated\nAnd and this new agreement does that that does incorporate some of the elements that were in another trade agreement called the Trans Pacific partnership but especially updated a provision is\nRecognizing that we live in a digital age the Internet and that wasn't the case twenty five years ago what they originally after was negotiated\nA so yes I think it is a good deal and it certainly is a relief or especially many farmers in the mid west who have been concerned about the blowback from the tariffs by this administration so I think the markets responded positively yesterday they what Wall Street went up after this was announced him\nAnd so uh it actually doesn't make that many big changes to the existing NAFTA which will stay at forced by the way until Congress finally approved this new U.S Mexico Canada agreement that will probably be until even next summer\nAnd so are they the agreement does though keep in place many of the beneficial arrangements between the three countries\n[noise] gym there were a lot of people in small Iowa towns were manufacturing was the center of the talented blamed NAFTA correct or not or for that situation do you see this deal I'm making any kind of positive\nDifference in the area of manufacturing and and I would include advanced manufacturing in that which is where a lot of the jobs going what do you think\nYeah I think a ... in fact with advanced manufacturing that's\nReally that's really where the Americans have the strength of this that's why they need a access to other markets and they need to cheaper inputs are imported inputs that really have been how the twenty first century kind of global supply chains have evolved and so for this especially those higher tech manufactures I think this is good news", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Need to Know with Jeff Angelo", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "02"}
