W into radio news\nSome trying real hard to break through the clouds forty seven degrees are top national stories that were five thousand two hundred active duty us troops are being sent to the U.S Mexican border\nAnd just in general Rachel in your column you're talking about what he's encouraging people to march toward the border why you know what's the humid incentive you tell me about what laws or loopholes exist to encourage people to march toward our border like this\nWell this caravan had made clear I and many other legal immigrants that they're attracted you are the irony is that our our loopholes that exist in our asylum\nAnd what that means that basically they can come to the border crossing legally or illegally and still claim asylum claim a credible fear of crime you did a or tortured in their home country and at that point\nThey will be released into the interior of the country a given a court date later you know ... years later to show up for many of them don't I think they know they will come in they will gain entry and there'll be there'll be a country that is all they care that ... and that is what I think many in the chairman it as\nWell and Rachel that is why you're exactly right that all the experts are telling me that if they get here they're basically here and President Trump last night was on the Ingram angle on Fox News and said I'm going to um put up a tent city uh which one\nThere and get the votes to do it I think that is also an important part\nOf Rachel boulevard from the conservative partnership her column in American greatness is called only Congress can prevent the next border surge Rachel always a pleasure to talk with you thanks very much\n... nine Fifteen is our time and then a bombshell to use an overused word in the media these days but\nUh the media then reporting that President Trump in an interview with a program called Axios on HBO says he plans to sign an executive order that will curb birthright citizenship in fact on social media some reporters are saying\nThat that signature may come to de\nBirthright citizenship allows any baby born on us soil to automatically be a U.S citizen now I wanted to talk about the politics of this because I say on this show look we not only ask what the politicians are saying\nWe analyze why they are saying it but let me take just a little bit of diversion as you starting to get into conversations with your friends about the concept of birthright citizenship because I think a trap the people fall into when they start discussing issues like this\nWell this was perfectly clear we shouldn't even be discussing is perfectly clear and\nIt's not perfectly clear it is not perfectly clear yes this is a political issue yes if he signed the executive order it will go to the U.S Supreme Court all of those things will happen is not perfectly clear\nNow here are the two sides of the argument the author of the fourteenth amendment is senator Jacob merit Howard Jacob ... Howard he's from Michigan\nAnd the author of the fourteenth amendment said at the time this provision will not of course include foreigners this provision\nWill not of course include foreigners that's a direct quote from Senator Howard however here's how the courts have interpreted the fourteenth amendment and I'm not saying it's not a legitimate interpretation\nThe concept of a natural born citizen and the fourteenth amendment derives from natural born subjects in Britain the phrase which is in the fourteenth amendment and subject to the jurisdiction thereof then excludes foreign diplomats\nSo the argument has been the way that the fourteenth amendment is written is based on British law which does allow all people born in the country to be the citizens of that country\nBut that the phrase in the amendment and subject to the jurisdiction thereof excluded diplomats and only diplomats\nNow you may argue that in of course there's a reason President Trump is raising this issue today because birthright citizenship is not popular however if you get into a conversation with friends about this regardless of what side of the issue on and they're like well this is patently obvious blah blah blah you know it's not it's not patently obvious that drives me crazy\nWhen we have these kinds of conversations okay\nThe politics of it all we are one week from the election and here's where we stand exactly where we were in two thousand in sixteen before the Clinton Trump election\nVia there of course is a battle going on for the majority in the U.S Senate and the U.S house and if you look at the polling the polling says that many many many many many key races including races here in Iowa are within the margin of error\nNow you may say Geoff the polling was wrong\nIn two thousand and sixteenth no the polling actually wasn't wrong in two thousand sixteen the way that the liberal coastal media interpreted the polling was wrong\nThe racist state by state in many key states were with in the margin of error bought the liberal coastal media told you was there was a blue wall protecting Hillary that even though there were certain states in which the race was within the margin of error\nThat Hillary was going to win those states because those were blue wall states\nBut here's really what was happening Hillary didn't campaign much in those states and she didn't have a compelling economic message for those states so the blue wall thing was wrong wrong wrong wrong and the voters broke for Donald Trump in those margin of error racist so here we are again\nWith margin of error races\nAnd here is we are one week out from the election and\nDemocrats are doing a great job as they always do of getting their voters out early they get their voters out early their voters vote absentee they vote or in person\nBut what about those late breaking voters those persuadable voters that are still making up their minds as we approach election day there are a lot of them\nAnd if we're talking about immigration leading to election day it is possible to believe that those persuadable voters in those margin of error races break for the Republicans\nNow up to the Brett Kavanaugh hearing I would've said okay the Democrats have a lot of momentum on their side they're much more enthusiastic than the Republicans and they have the key issue of the election healthcare\nI Would have said that all the way up to the bread cannot hear that Kavanaugh hearings then energized Republicans\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news traffic and severe weather station news radio ten forty\nRice W.

five three three one Seventy nine Ninety nine tell them Jeff Angelo told you to call [noise] All right the Republicans would like you\nTo be talking about immigration as we head to the election which is one week\nFrom today because they believe that if that is the issue that frames the election they will be the winners on election day so we have a couple of issues today\nPresident Trump has said he's going to sign an executive order to end the practice of birthright citizenship if you're born in this country even to an illegal alien your citizen of this country that will be challenged the courts in court\nBut if he signed the executive order it's an issue\nAnd of course you've got the migrant caravan heading toward our southern border and the military being sent to our border\nOr to meet them when they get here last night President Trump sat for an interview with Laura Ingraham on the Ingram angle on Fox News and he said we are not going to let the migrants in we are going to build a tent city here's President Trump with Laura Ingraham\nApply for asylum isn't the law because Congress and they also we're going to hold them until such time as a drought where we have the facility and we're going to put up we're going to build ten cities were gonna put tense up all over the place\nWe're not going to build structures and spend all of this you know hundreds of millions of dollars we're going to have parents that are going to be very nice and they're going to wait and if they don't get asylum they get out\nAnd very few people they don't actually it'd be worn away they don't\nUsually get asylum you know the eighty percent of the problem is they released them and and then they have the trial three years later and nobody shows up but we're gonna unlike Obama and unlike others we're going to take the people were going to put 'em in and they're going to wait\nAnd you know what to things happen when they find out that that happens you didn't have far fewer people come up [noise] and also President Obama separating children from parents nobody talks about the long and said can never have separated now President Obama separate out in the beginning okay just so we all under said\nHere's what I like about a ... interview she's favorable to President Trump but she didn't hold back in regard to the questions and a and it was a very good interview she later on and we'll have this audio in the next hour she says you're sending the military\nWhat about lethal force as the migrants head toward the border and you'll hear the president dancer now in talking to the birth about birthright citizenship\nOr that he is the president wants to end of that you know it's going to be challenged in court and Reggie is on the line and Reggie is going to get this right in regard to why he thinks it's a good idea to raise this Reggie you're thinking what I'm thinking you want to see this challenged in court at this point right\nYeah I think that the timing of the girl you know the sort of on about immigration will have something to uh look\nIt up and on the Democrats challenge or now that we have a majority of originalist yep there will actually shut down and bow and birth right so the Democrats are kind of it's been a rock and a hard place right now\nRight exactly right it's good politics and you think given the make up now the Supreme Court it's it's got a shot at being upheld\nYeah that's why I don't think it's ever gone to the Supreme Court challenge of\nWhat the makeup of the court before that I Would have gone through it now I don't think it will\nAll right read yeah I think that's a good call thanks very much for talking to me about it and that that is one of the reason so many of these issues going to bubble up to the Supreme Court now what is going to be challenged here and and I said this earlier in the hour I I Can't stand it when we have these discussions and people like well it's just another no it's it's really not\nYou can argue that this particular amendment was put in place as someone did on the American choppers and accessories sex line earlier that he was put in for ex slaves that if they were born in this country they were ... they were citizens and it was not to be extended\nTo ah folks that are in this country illegally you could also argue that if it was based on British law\nThat in fact if a person was born in this particular country\nThat the only exception and the fourteenth amendment were for foreign diplomats that for people that are not under the jurisdiction\nOf this country I eat foreign diplomats and birthright citizen ship did not apply to their kids but was meant to apply to anyone else that was born in the country so there are arguments on both sides and what the point that Reggie\nIs attempting to make it I think he's right on if we're going to be having a lot of these serious discussions about the intent\nOf those that wrote these amendments the intent of the founders when they wrote the constitution of the next few years because we have an original list Supreme Court\nAnd if the Republicans hold the U.S Senate in his mid term election you will probably have more original list on the U.S Supreme Court and a lot of issues to text\nTo test in that context I'm just Angela this news radio ten forty W.

O.\nThree days before Christmas I get an email from my health care is saying we are not going to be able to provide you any more services and\nHappy holidays\nI was forced to move and when you're a C. five quadriplegic it's more or less of life and death situation now is really what I can I Do not believe that Medicaid privatization of saving us any money health care situations are getting worse and governor around\nSaying it's getting better at Hubble and radar they seemed to really get it ... than\nMedicaid privatization that Iowa has been a disaster and near the avenue your benefits or your pay reduced\nThen when they complained that just takes longer and longer than\nA day one we're going to start bringing Medicaid privatization to an end there all comes down to what your priorities are and we make those investments in our people in our communities and we stand up and we work together we can get Iowa growing the right way\nPaid for by the governor [noise]\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news traffic and severe weather station news radio ten forty do you\nUm and so it kind of I think it it it 'cause it's a fair conclusion that the mid term elections fall it's got the you know like you\nMay be unconventional while I'm that's first of all a you know that kind of all we have you know we have several different ingredients and the mic here that don't necessarily um makes sense for a huge democratic wave\nI got the president or ... or you know I'm a favorability up give the economy and the jobs numbers from 'em and we see in these battleground polls not necessarily the generic ballot like you're saying\nRight on the in terms of reading these national polls in terms of these battleground district we see that these are very tight uh within the margin of error and so I you know in terms of this big democratic blue wave that they've been talking about it it doesn't necessarily seem like the\nUm the ingredients are there now of course the bourbon women are going to play a huge role in terms of you know how it you know if there are the Democratic wave how big is that um\nAnd those are particularly uh that's particularly true in a lot of these races that were watching a weather or talking about I you know the suburbs of New Jersey are you aware of the ... um that that that can ... so um that's the thing we are definitely taking a look at\nWell and and Alex it's so interesting one of the big factors to me is that\nYou you can't even predict in this last week was going to be the deciding issue for a voter because up until I Would say and you correct me if you you see it differently of course but up until the cabin on hearing you you saw all the enthusiasm on the Democratic side\nThen after the Capitol hearing suddenly the Republicans got fired up and here it is the last week before the election and we're talking about immigration birthright citizenship\nOr you know and and and certainly some liberals on Twitter already saying hey let's not get distracted we want to talk about health care you know so if we still don't quite know the issues that are going to decide the the the election given what's what the voters going to vote on how how do you see it Alex\nAnd if you're a member and he hasn't seen a ... you know we're not quite yet at the point where I for FBI Director I didn't call me\nOh that's right in his letter [laughter] what you're saying if we had a few more days left [laughter] that\nNow I Know a lot over there still time for a surprise um\nBut you know I I totally agree actually I think that that speaks to uh the weakness on the Democratic side or the suppose that way that they that everyone's but I think in talking about and that they if they fail to really prove to stay a winning sort of a argument\nOr are they how credible alternative in terms of rallying around a particular issue\nI'm In a lot and um if you look at previous cycles brief by huge a wave effect I'll look at ... ... for example if you remember that the ... President Bush was terribly unpopular at the time the Iraq War with I I you know we're we're very much I'm just contented with that\nAnd that was the rallying cry for Democrats that go out to the vote and to effect change and the and the house I had the rallying cry with a bomb in here that that was just you know a time where\nIt looks like the Democrats are moving to too fast that we're passing bills without reading them\nAt the American people say oh we got to we're going to put the brakes on that one and a lot of Republicans did that walked over thing and how um the Democrats don't have a similar sort of like you know I can feel that it is used this time around and it's like we've seen them for going gray\nAnd then um in terms of the different issues I for example and Pete Smith I'm Tom dire it's dumping a bunch of money in two different races around the country of course yeah that's billionaire\nHe is running the need to you can't in and it you know specifically supporting people who are a favor he'd seen the president and we know from the polls out there that even people who don't like the president\nOr are fans of him they definitely don't want to see in the east and they don't want to see\nA justice cabinet odd but this is the you know an organization that does ... dedicated to the impeachment of President Trump potentially other people onto the streets and so you know some Democrats have been flooded spray on that\nAnd then some of them have been pulled way there's a lot I you know terms of Medicare for all think about for the Bernie Sanders al ... a case of course has the fact that\nUh you know they they went so far to the left in their primary when I'm at now they're sort of stuck in the general\nWithout sort of oh you're in the middle of the road that\nWell and then to use a good point and the Republicans favor Alex because earlier today I got a text from a listener that said just what do you think the stock market's going to do if Democrats win the house\nAnd I said it's not going to do well initially because we don't know economically what the Democrats agenda actually using it it it feels a little bit Alex like two thousand sixteen I Can't tell you what the economic message\nFor the Democrats is right now\nWell and and I think it's particularly tough for me for the numbers are so strong yeah um you know ... and I think that that that that's a motivating factor with independents that um you know on the one hand\nRepublican I think should be worried and this is where I think the the the ground game can be very importantly the art C and other organizations are investing heavily in motivating people to go out and vote\n'em you know you don't want to happen is for independence but maybe for some ... conservative base voters to sort of rest on their laurels outlaw the economy's doing well you you uh you know maybe it it it it leaves people sort of think about other issues or stay home um that's\nSomething that you want to prevent a ... so you know I I think that in terms of the economy though that the Democrats\nHave really failed or is that\nUm themselves the credible alternative um in terms of the economy and I think that it was very difficult for them to do so based on um the numbers that we're seeing so I think that the most that they can hope for is that the the numbers are so good that people sort of you know\nForget about voting or they where they had actually a sort of take the economy for granted it start thinking about other issues were Democrats might be stronger\nYeah right on that is Alex Smith she's the executive director of the conservative organization America Rising Alex great analysis today Thanks very much for joining me we've got thriving\nYou betcha ten Seventeen is our time you know if I wanted to do a show about hypocrisy\nI could just fill the entire two hours and easier to find the hypocrisy hypocrisy is like I'm really outraged about what you're doing when my son does it um I'm fine with it I could just do a whole show and I'll tell you what's been crazy to me over the uh the the past few days\nHas been sort of the finger pointing has been going on among the um the the media\nLike media is so crazy\nSo we are a great incidence of that yesterday Fox News business had a guy on a interviewing about the Margaret here then he goes you know they're gonna bring leprosy and smallpox to America\nWhich that's a crazy statement but the people out there you don't get me to Fox News they're just on TALK can't believe it then on CNN your panelists go up a said President Trump or has radicalized more people that ISIS [laughter] [laughter]\nIt's just it's it's crazy so do you want some adult flying media today here was something that caught my just because it was kind of cool\nUh the synagogue shooter in his hateful social media messages target an organization called highest highest as an organization which Reese settles Jewish refugees\nBrianna a reporter for CBS
