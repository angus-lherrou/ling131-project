I mean I think their lives Are Forever changed by the right not something to take lightly I um\nAnd and the thing doctor boost to your point that bugs me is I Wish that she could narrowed down to date a little bit more so the FBI could say on this date judge Kavanaugh was blah or was blah that to me bugs me about the investigation is I don't you you don't have any way\nOf figuring out if he was there or not at this party which seemed to me\nYeah well it does seem that I think we can kind of go into their questions about his diaries and yeah I mean occasionally but then again I I really think that should have done for I mean this is the problem that's where having the investigation first would have made them\nYeah but here we are [laughter] I I Can't I mean I think there are a number of\nPsychological experts who could point too I think after experts we've heard the reasons why I'm victims of sexual assault often don't remember those effect but remember what happened\nAnd she said a hundred percent he said it happened she said he says a hundred percent if it did happen yeah\nThat's where we are um I I just I don't know how you I'm a Jew dictate that um\nBut ah one way or the other the Senate is going to have to make a decision about the nomination um unless for some reason it doesn't come to the floor or which again I have no indication of that happening but it's just that I think at some point votes going to have to be taken\nAnd then one way or the other um you know or as a country where they have to move forward um and that it's difficult to see how that happens right now but um but we have to when you have\nTo properly different accounts on such a serious allegation I mean that's the thing that says this is really right I yes you can see why this is so traumatic why Dr Ford that she was terrified and you can see why judge Kavanaugh's literally fighting for his reputation right I mean I just I I the\nBoth of those and you know I'm not taking a position on this one but I just think it's um it's something that it's become so polarized that um there's just no room for there's no middle ground here\nThat is Dr ... the book one of the books that she is author shaping signaling presidential policy the national security decision making of Eisenhower Kennedy doctor both I really appreciate your very human perspective but all of this thanks very much thanks for having me\nNine seven gene is our time I'm going to also go to the other controversial moment in the Trump rally Mississippi last night this is why you hear me getting after the coastal media and their bias and also saying look I I like local media and I like local media because even if I disagree with local media at least they're here\nWMA Joe radio news commenting and and reporting on some comments last night\nThat Donald Trump made\nA after Mississippi rally about the charges leveled against Brett Kavanaugh knew her WMA Joel radio news say some people are offended by them and some people are applauding them that's why I Want to play you the comments in their full context\nBecause if you follow the coastal media it is an outrageous attack against the sexual assault survivor or if you've been listening to show for the last two days it's an expression of\nFrustration that an innocent man is having his reputation destroyed because people don't want to conservative on the U.S Supreme Court that is the bigger context of the controversial comments last night by the president in Mississippi\nHere they are here are the entire comments he made about the charges against Brett Kavanaugh screws what's happening now\nThey had a gang rape again when [noise]\nWell I turned out to be wrong\nSo many different charges guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous Veronica\nNot real dangers Ron\n\nAnd I haven't myself all the time but for me it's like a part of the job description [noise]\n\nLet it happen to be shouldn't happen to him should not to do\nWhat he's going through thirty six years ago this\nI had one beer right I Am wondering\nWell you think it was you know I was wondering\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't\n[noise] I don't know [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know where's the house I'm zone where was I don't know but I had one lives in a room [noise]\nAnd I'm\nIn my shoes and not a man who lives just shattered his wife is shattered his daughters are\nBeautiful incredible young ages [noise] they destroyed people they want to destroy these are really evil people\n...

because I've been I was chief public corruption prosecutor over the last decade those investigations are are issued to the county attorney into our office and I've handled more than than anyone else in the in that in the last decade and time after time I look at it\nBest occasions that if there were people in the office of law enforcement background would have been done differently\nOr from day one and again I Love the people I work with and I really enjoy working with them but every one of them every single one is an accountant or a CPA\nUh it's like having a football team with eleven quarterbacks on often uh you've got to build people of a team of people with different backgrounds to make sure you're getting good results right you could have eleven hall of famer quarterbacks playing on your offense you're not gonna win games\nAnd so to me a big piece of why I got interested in this offices I got tired of looking at investigations that should've been done differently but weren't because they didn't have people with the right training in the office to say from the word go how to build it so that it's going to hold up in a court of law Mm\nOkay so that is very interesting angle Rob because the one thing that you get hit with over and over in this campaign\nIs the fact that you're not a CPA and and I you made it a point before we went on the air that I thought was very important to bring out which is it's not an office that people pay much attention to so it can be assumed you've got to be a CPA and you're saying no that's not and in fact\nThat you bring qualities to the office that you think would be beneficial and not being a CPA so exactly you are you required Rob to be a CPA when people ask you that yeah how do you answer that\nAre not at all and in fact that's I think one of the best things about my candidate see this office has had tunnel vision the last three auditors have all been CPAs\nAnd again there's nothing wrong with CPAs but we need to shake it up a little bit [laughter] we've had a businessman we've had an attorney who's been seed auditor before we've had a realtor we've had a farmer or we've had a school superintendent lots of people from all walks of life and I would have held his position and I think part of the part of what I bring to it is a different perspective\nAnd a special qualification for the other division in the office for the investigations unit and my opponent or has claimed repeatedly\nThat ah someone who's not a CPA can't issue audits which is just\nI mean it's it's ignorant of the history of the office of many Iowans from all walks of life holding the position but it's also something that uh people in the accounting a profession and\nThree current Republican county attorney's as well as the former state party chair Mike Murphy have all said is incorrect and so there's no legal requirement whatsoever there's no a truth to her claim that it's summer I was going to cost the state more money if you don't have a CPA in the office\nAnd frankly I think it's good we I think the office needs to be shaken up and needs to have\nThe attention or on the investigations division for once\nYou made a point earlier I found very interesting Rob when this is Rob than democratic candidate for state auditor\nYou were talking about you were looking at these particular a previous audits and and uh they really need to be done in a way that they would hold up in a court of law and they got me wondering are there any issues that you stay out or you think we really got to dig into this we've got to supervise how your tax money is being spent in these particular area\nYeah yeah absolutely and and to stand out to me above all else number one\nMedicaid mhm look you've got people who support it you got people who don't\nThe privatization of privatization advocate yeah thank you for making it more specific test the privatization process and where we're at right now here's the fundamental issue this is the office in the state of Iowa that could be issuing subpoenas left and right\nAnd figuring out the truth about what's going on 'cause I think that's what this debate most debates need more than anything else a little bit more fact and a little bit less rhetoric\nIn this office could be going out there digging in and telling people what's going on or we're going to have a press called later today on the campaign talking about forty eight red flags or that the current state auditor missed waving around saying you know Medicaid privatization is having some problems\nBefore only after I suggested it did my opponent decided to initiate an examination of the privatization of Medicaid\nI don't know what the answer is going to be a when that office issues a an audit and answers questions but this is my point voters deserve to know\nYou ought to have that answer yet to lay out all those facts and it ought to be done and should have been started in time to get it finished before an election not because\nIt is a political effort because it shouldn't be it should be grounded in truth and facts but because there's politics in the world and if we're going to have voters making responsible informed decisions they deserve to have answers on that prior to having to make that decision in the voting booth\nAnd I think ... that you've pointed out earlier in the interview about the fact that uh you you you are running on a party ticket in ... when your opponent is a Republican is that is really the challenge of the authors isn't it you got to be fair to everybody\nYeah that is the challenge to the office and I always like to hold up a ... Johnson a former state auditor that we were discussing earlier to as a good example that\nNineteen Ninety four Republican state auditor ... Johnson nearly cost Republican Governor Terry Branstad a primary and the governor's race cars he started calling him two books Terry you said you're keeping two sets of books on the budget and that's not\nRight and it's and it's inappropriate that was a I think a goal\nFor any state auditor should be someone who is willing to go after someone in their own party and I have a track record of doing that the Iowa film office tax credit scandal I prosecute it every one of those criminal cases even though they happened under democratic administration\nOr more recently you could look at a county official democratic official in Webster county who is a convicted felon who cannot vote for any more Democrats because they embezzled money and I found the crime fitting of a felony convictions so that's the offer but I made\nBecause I didn't I didn't treat them differently just because they were a Democrat and I said you know what ... what you did hear deserves a felony conviction and under the law you're going to lose the right to vote but you you don't want to uh do the time don't do the crime and the time and this is a long time where they're not going to be able to vote\nBut that is Rob than he is your democratic candidate for state auditor is not a an office that gets a whole lot of attention but I think you now have become convinced today\nIs that only one that opposite neat looking into and uh uh one which you should make an informed choice Rob I appreciate your knowledge and your passion thank you for taking the time today happy to be here thanks for having me just ten Seventeen news radio ten forty is W.
