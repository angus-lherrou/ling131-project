R. G. R. top story this hour and a ... that probably won't be our top story all day but we are going to keep an eye on it at the stock market and we're seeing a bounce back already a half hour after the open\nThat's why you see such very very intense aggressive at a response on their part\n[noise] this is your what about that response we're told all the time that we ought to be ashamed of President Trump's behavior but\nIs this upcoming election going to be a referendum on the behavior we're seeing right now\nOn the left there was a video that went viral yesterday of Eric Holder saying when the Republicans are down we kick them and a lot of conservatives were sharing that video 'cause it it seems like this kind of behavior is really is in at using your words radicalized\nPeople have to ask themselves is this the kind of America we want a here you have the former attorney general who supposedly she'll be upholding the law are telling people to kick their opponents or congresswoman waters who would be the chair of a major\nCommittee saying publicly that they should ... down and drive out a topic like drive out of grocery stores drive out to restaurants a Republican you have a people pounding on the Supreme Court door um I mean\nYou know it's clear on the left that it's going to be Marlboro there there are as Abraham Lincoln said Cooper Union and eight and sixty or they will either rule or they will ruin\nA and I think that that's a real danger for the country and I think are\nFrankly I think that's been hurting the Democrats and that's why the last ten days poll after poll has come back and show people are really rally to the idea that they don't want this kind of behavior\nI don't want to say just briefly are speaking to an audience and in Iowa\nYou should all be very very\nProud of Chuck Grassley a Senator Grassley handled it very difficult situation I was the norm of skill for the very calm deliberation I thought that he was exactly what the American system\nShould be all about I end up I've known shot for many years but I thought this was clearly one of his finest moments as a leader\nI agree with you Mr Speaker because it seemed to me like in all of this whirling madness he was attempting to say and and I would say this about senator Collins speech as well they were trying to get back to what the Senate was supposed to be about and he kept trying to clean to that\nThe tradition of the Senate and how the Senate goes about its business but even he I'm sure you saw this\n... at times could not hide his frustration at the at the radicalization that what's going on around him\nWhile I I think when you when you had people are like center a book or behaving like children or you know it gets pretty hard to maintain the propriety of the Senate when some guys grandstanding or saying things that are absurd\nAre suggesting that if you are for Kavanaugh your quote consulting with evil ah\nDeclaring he's going to have a Spartacus moment which was as strong and I have to tell you\nIt's totally absurd the swatter this was a slave rebel last was crucified and the worst thing is going to have in the book or as we get a bad cup of coffee at the Senate dining room a you know but but this kind of childish behavior was going on for senator one it's one thing that comes from from the you know\nThe radicals who are protesting that's another thing when you have us\nSenators behaving like this and as a Senator Grassley pointed out to the news media there were more people in that Senate room supporting cabinet none of that interview by the news\nMedia 'cause they count then there were being demonstrate\nI I agree with you I remember a pictures being tweeted out of the women behind judge Kavanaugh and and Mr Speaker\nThe as the left is we're saying look at their faces and I thought these are folks that support judge Kavanaugh they are disturbed by what they're seeing go on in front of them they're not upset by the accusations that are being made against him\nOh so you're you're exactly right nobody got talk to in that room that's supportive judge Kavanaugh\nThat's right because they didn't fit the left wing media is a existing bias which is you know if you weren't against Kavanaugh why would we put you on the air\nThat is former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich is coming up on nine Fifteen an evening with Newt he will be at the Iowa historical building this coming Monday Night seven thirty for tickets an evening with new dot com Mr Speaker I'm\nThe son of a German immigrant my mom was born in Frankfurt and she and I believe this is the greatest country on earth that we aren't acceptable or exceptional nation\nYet I Know one of the things you want to address on Monday Night is the ... sense of patriotism among our people and you are a historian winded this pushback began against people like me to say hey you're Xena phobic hey don't talk like that that's insensitive to other nations when did that push begin\nOh I I think that it's been in the academic world at least since the Nineteen sixties\nOr it may be going back to the Nineteen thirties and it just gradually spread into the news media or an end to enter into Hollywood a and a lot of it's absurd I mean I I think I recommend everybody by the way that they read President Trump's speech at the United nations\nWhich is the best modern statement\nOf legitimate American patriotism as the basis of our foreign policy that any president has given a probably since the Nineteen twenties uh and it's just remarkable work and I think ... business is going to be one of the really big issues the next few years\nDo you think the American government should focus on Americans and should try to policies that help America or do you think that the American government should serve the interests of international bureaucrats who believe in some kind of global as philosophy so very profound and deep difference between the two sides\nLet's just figure I Want to get your take on the upcoming election because I'm told over and over again\nThat serve urban Republican women are going to rebel against the Republicans this fall\nBut it seems like I was told that when Donald Trump was running for president is is a narrative in search of reality or is this something legitimate that the Republicans ought to be worried about\nWell I look I think Chris shortly there has been a so called gender gap since Nineteen eighty four when Reagan was crushing Mondale among men by such a huge margin the original gender gap was if there were no men a rotifer Mondale\nAh [noise] so it's always been so many people talk about a I Believe it depends on on on how the campaign on for the next few weeks we just got a report today for example that uh the the insurance premiums for Obamacare\nFor the very first timer going down because of Trump's policy is not\nGoing up or they just signed into law a bill which allows you to ask your your pharmacist if there's a less expensive a price for your medicine if you want to pay cash\nWhich often turns out to be less than the co pay of your insurance\nUh that that's another one of those steps that the president's taking and the Republicans are taking towards reducing the cost of pharmaceuticals or the or the effort being made now by Kevin McCarthy a Republican majority leader two hundred was introduced a bill that really says look\nWe have to control the border to protect our children and protect our neighborhoods we don't want MS Thirteen gangs in our neighborhood which we don't want people bringing across the border fence and all and carfentanil would kill people which are being mixed with opioids and other drugs and are killing people we last year\nSeventy four thousand Americans died of drug overdoses that is more\nPeople died in the eight years the Vietnam War and I think a major issue which which every suburban woman understands is how\nDo we get safety for her children for her relatives for her neighborhood for those local school and I think that uh what what\nKevin McCarthy is doing is exactly the right direction to say we we normally have a right to control our borders we have a national security and personal safety obligation\nControl our border and contrast that with the Democrats were center of Feinstein introduced a bill calling for open borders and every single democratic senator co sponsored\nThat is the former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich he will be here in Des Moines this coming Monday Night an evening with Newt Gingrich Mr Speaker it was a joy talking to you I look forward to seeing you next week\nBut look forward to\nWe're coming up on nine twenty now Speaker Gingrich or just referenced that those bills dealing with prescription drug prices signed into law\nBy the president of the United states coming up a little bit later this hour I Will talk to the United states secretary of health and Human Services he's Alex
