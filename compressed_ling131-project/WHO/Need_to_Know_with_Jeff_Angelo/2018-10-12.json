all went bankrupt the country folks that would cause even worse damage than Obamacare did President Trump explained the seniors would be the hardest hit he also criticized Democrats for trying to force Medicare for all on us while at the same time demanding that we accept their open borders socialism\nAnd that's true it's no secret that Democrats openly brag about it especially the young progressive taking over the Democratic party now in response an angry mob of Democrats a socialist led by Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders went ballistic\nThey've accused Republicans of gutting Medicare for decades but when the tables are turned that can't stand that Democrats accused the president of telling lies and smearing them they also attacked USA Today for having the goal\nTo let

I'm Wendy while WHM radio now says\nThe flurries are now way off to the east in the northeast but some showers still moving through\nSome parts of the south the Des Moines metro area and southern Iowa is a little bit in the west as well with any tells on your weekend weather forecasts from Jerry in return coming up our top local story this hour for adults heroically tried to say the boy trapped in a house fire\nEventually by different points in the market now they want to be able to do high bar low were on the market right we don't have a crystal ball but my suggestion is your bond fund in your invest\nWhether it up or down votes on different areas of the ... oh you know it's called Darla or average it and it's been working for many ... and we want to make sure you continue this because it's all about long term in the market\nPeter a on a week like this week we start to hear people say make sure your investments are diversified how old are you a figure out whether you're diversified enough\nThat very simple steps the basic we want to understand what that means you have that the appropriately where one is unique income well one of those ... looked like picking on much worse than you are the ...\nDo you have different kind of ... one book on a long term you have another book that there's going or shorter term you have another book about dying for the money they asked us that or merges you on the today\nIt's all about for really understanding how you're at but I Will get it up on different on that I spoke with about doing different things that I\nAlso want to ask you about people that take income from their investments is they're all wrong way to take income from\nInvestments oh yeah yeah it's been around for a long time because people following what's called for first in rural America and they're saying that you could take up ... percent and it's been around for over Twenty years you can take a four percent and you have about five Ninety percent success rate\nDuring the time well the problem here is just\nReinvest and we're going to have a bump it up to four or five percent six percent because of inflation now your success rate drops to possibly Seventy percent or sixty five percent which is not good so it's all about understanding and having a proper balance in your portfolio and not going to one big portfolio all the answers\nThat is a great advice so of course Peter I open the interview by saying what's going on now now the second most ask question you're getting is what's gonna\nHappen in the future so let me go short term what do you think what what do you think about what you saw this week what are we going to see over the next few weeks or next few months\nYou know what we had a little bit of a solar I'm a bump up interest rates not so long ago they spent a week ago\nAnd interacting with the more sober ... now have to take a step back if they didn't so is this really appropriate for the levels of risk of wouldn't vessels are taken and it don't work for the economy or to slow down now we know the markets have been growing and the economy exploded but if you start to increase interest rate economy is going to mention we slow down is going to hit a ceiling\nSo ... years to the weather is the next ... months once one week or a year we have to get used to the ball to time because we're happy eventually hit a ceiling and interest rate and once you get ill and\nWe'd be able to go over to more of a a kiss to the level of overturned it was appropriate for that level of risk or we have to just keep in mind that this is going to be happening for some time and whether it's six months or year but this is not going to be the end of it\nThis is Peter ... he's the CEO and founder of PCB financial advisor group Peter I'm Glad you're one of my go to guys in weeks like this thanks very much for talking to me today\nGreat being here ... thank you\nYou betcha nine fourteen is our time want to give a shout

H. jokes TV also this morning of course\nI I'm ah ah well I played a a Christmas song or getting ready in the bathroom [noise]\nMy wife looked at me like she was going to make a call and somebody be dragging a body out before long but man you know I started celebrating Christmas right after Labor Day right so this now I'm just I'm In my element\nAnd and a van and I have talked in the band and Bonnie show or about how much we do love the snow I Love it until December twenty fifth then on December twenty six I Would like it to turn back to being Seventy degrees again\nMy wife and I it's funny where we're used away from retirement but we chat about whether or not we want to be snowbirds and our retirement because it does seem ... cool\nYou know to be like yeah I'll see you in April but everybody but I don't know I don't know that we don't know if that's our future or not [noise] yesterday I played you a a comment from former attorney general Eric Holder\nAnd he said to a bunch of cheering Democrats ah okay when Michelle Obama said when they go low we go high but I say when they go low we kept them\nAnd even Michelle Obama denounced that Michelle Obama was like no no no no that is no that is not what we do President Trump and spoke about it and said no that is that's disgusting that's what President Trump said [noise]\nUh and then Eric Holder tried to walk it back a little bit on Twitter he's like no not really saying to go [laughter]\nBut of course there are a lot of people going man this is a a this was a tense environment right now we don't need comments like that so let's do a reality check when my friend political science professor Alan sack was this comment over the line or is this really just you know where we're at\nRight now in the electoral cycle professors taxes on the ... news make aligned best You're welcome back W. H. Joe good morning to yeah\nIt is where we are but it also went over the line\nOkay yeah give me your take on it you got a sense of history here professor Saxon I know that the rhetoric gets kinda heated and sometimes we all joke about hey remember Hamilton bird you know it's been heated before but are we at a point where this an ongoing rhetoric is over the line\nYeah we don't want any good any more [laughter] than gr like that\nYeah I get over the line at thankfully president can decorate President Obama's attorney general Eric Holder and he was a ... law enforcement officer of the country for quite a number of here eminently fair when they're down kick him I just tried to backtrack on it and said I didn't mean anything\nBy that during my administration crime rate was very low but it was at that statement on the way around I think he knew it and then again later Hillary Clinton come in and there are not going to have the ability until the Democrats take over again I Would just take it to the icing on the cake\nWell and I know there are a lot of people professor sacks of blame President Trump for the coarsening of the language but they're also a lot of people would argue that he's symptomatic of the times that if you need a politician that's going to defend your point of view they gotta get down there and get justice rough and tumble as the opposition I mean\nHas President Trump had an impact on the discourse or is he a product of the discourse what do you think\nA little bit though that also President Obama even though he spoke very get lazy and that didn't lay and looked very disciplined his rhetoric but all over the top\nIn many places yeah how people might remember that when they bring a night we bring a gun you know\nThey make comments like that quite a bit and I will beat up on Hannity or something like that he made it almost in a jacket or way that guy it and it wasn't that kind of language that the president so he started as well and in a much lower the way that get it if it was there\n[noise] and what kind of impact as is having on the election professors acts because I saw so many people who were anti Trump but I mean\nConservative anti Trump folks watch the Brett Kavanaugh hearings and say I got a admit I'm kinda glad I got a fighter in the White House did that have an impact overall on uh the the the spirit of conservatives if you will as we go into the next election\nOh I think it did ah we're having a race here in Texas that very strongly that Senate race between kicker Ted Cruz Republican and a pretty formidable opponent Democrat that name of Pico yeah you'd make thank real name is Robert Frank or work\nBut I think that they're going to pick out thinking thinking over a lot more Hispanic voters and it's gotten pretty content as well that Ted Cruz seemed to be there in my head by a by nine points now and the same thing and if you let us take as well but if there are still very tight very complex here\nIn states like Arizona or where we have this Nick ballet or\nAgainst a very liberal democratic woman and that that could predict a pre tax rate till I think that those guys are hardening or they're there because they can generally\nYeah what I think professor ... I don't think at this point there's going to be a blue wave I think it looks like a normal mid term I looking back on the electoral history what do you think yeah tell me about that\nIn the morning as we head toward the weekend our top local story this hour a second person has died after a house fire in Huxley\nPolice say a Seventeen year old who was injured in the fire has died the team's father forty seven year old Brett banner spelled died at a Des Moines hospital on Sunday forty four year old Julie McLean was injured and taken to marry ... medical center in Ames\nTo other teams did escape the fire\nOfficials say the parents were injured trying to rescue their Seventeen year old son ... spelled who was a student a Ballard high school\nSergeant Joe Marcus Santos says he and officer Jackie lady pulled the mother out of a window tried to do the same for the father and son who were both unconscious but it became too dangerous\nThe heat and the smoke was so intense fire department couldn't get in there and they put him on the plane down\nBoth officers were treated and released from the hospital W.

hobby WHM radio thirty five degrees are\nTemperature at nine fifty to a reminder to you that right after the ten o'clock news [noise] I'll have yet another thousand dollars for you to when we're going to the grand in your hand kind of just\nWhat you do is I I just give you a key word you talk to the two hundred two hundred any weight and if you get a phone call a little bit later in the hour might be a strange number go and pick that up that will be somebody telling you that you one one thousand bucks if you don't want a thousand bucks would you like universal basic income\nThat is your government giving you a basic income every month guarantee there is a a presidential candidate who's running for president twenty twenty who's been advancing that idea\nAnd I'm intrigued by it so I Want to talk to him about it we'll do that as well after the ten o'clock news but first of all I'm looking at this new data that says that\nParents have just thirty two minutes to themselves every day and many hide from their\nKids to get a breather at of course of my mind I just I I envisioned a list there going during the closet right now Harry H Harrison is a parenting expert and joins me to talk about this data on the Lipman law newsmakers right\nHere you know do you think there were a lot of parents would hurt that and thought you know that that wasn't true I mean there's little time yourself when you're a parrot\nAnd do you do sometimes hide from them do you what do you think\nWell I think you make thirty three miners be helpful\n[laughter] jot [laughter] [noise]\nYeah I mean it and and what do you think I was the way it it's got to be or do you think it's unhealthy for parents to have that little me time what are you thinking\nOh I don't I I think it's terribly unhealthy but I'll tell you what I think it's happening it's been a\nMore and more parents ignore kicked up later and later mayor of both of my work on the other house come home with a nanny so mom I feel like well let's just keep up with ... o'clock that wasn't with them\nAll day and so all of a high\nRise condo in their stomach and my last book you don't put it on the night thirty or ten o'clock at night it's like well there are seven ... when ... work there just no time it'd be alone\nUm so you know that the first edition I Would have to get those kids to bed early hangar guilt feeling that you're not helping you raise your kids to bed early they spend time with your partner um\nHarry that is yeah that is such good advice because you're right people come home late feel guilty want to spend time with their kids so they're setting the bed times too late and it it is it's just too late for them and then yeah then you got no time for your spouse\nNo time and then you know that builds up over ... and you're now you're you're building a resentment and you may take on the white man here on the kid I'd like to put your marriage for\nThat's selfish but that makes you will make it much much much better parent but that marriage first secondly I put a lock my door\n[laughter] I hear you\nGood luck on the door a parents like oh my gosh oh you're trying to get in well you know you can hear it\nBut uh uh I really when I I really discouraged kid getting up out of their perfect warm bed\nIn Cali down the hall and companies are bigger ... it to a camera three am in after a while and it could turn back go back to that I mean if they're sick you'll know it but if it gets one is it you know our come at ten o'clock at night you're talking to your wife you got a lot\n[noise] Harry ... maybe they became negative\nI'll tell you the piece of advice that resonates with me that you just gave because a friend of mine I really respect gave it to me is you're no good to anybody if you're not taking care of yourself and and we're not spending time significant alone time with our spouse or taking care of ourselves and we say well that's because we are taking care of the kids\nAre taking more time for ourselves is viewed as selfish and do you see that as a barrier toward people taking care of themselves that they think I'm being selfish sheer\nAbsolutely I think that guilt is driving a lot of a lot of the reasons you keep your kids up late at night it would buy them anything that uh uh ... yeah people people in ... in today's age\nMany many many couples have to work mhm and that's fine that's good but but you don't have to feel guilty about it is you're put food on the table um that's what we can before it even more time if you have to catch their homework that'd be great way to hear how nine o'clock on eight o'clock [noise] those kids are in bed\nYou know if you talk to your wife\nTalk or talk to your husband I'm ... and you just want to keep people talk about how the Bob and do this all work all the time and a pleasure play out that if that's all you're doing\nIt hey you got to get stuck crackers do to help him their homework in bed at nine o'clock at night for America's become but you let it become that way you have to take control of that marriage\nAnd a hairy part of that is part of this data says that the average parent polled said they hide from their kids four times a week to carve out to me that that shoot indicator problem right if you're actually hiding from your kids four times a week\nI think that's an alert on that [laughter] I don't know if

Saturday in November tempt starting at ten AM\nTo learn more about the program and see the vehicles to the option to go to the the M. I. D. dot org [noise]\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news trap again severe weather station news radio ten forty W\n... N O W H A radio news thirty five degrees cloudy and dance in the morning\nSome of the incredible again from New technologies and distribute them to every adult in the country including every adult in Iowa and play on the federal government actually very very good at doing two things one\nLet me actors on a really big tech companies into distributing the game to people every month\nSo that's how it would work Andrews is Eddie attacks will be ... would have just beyond the tech companies and then there would be a guaranteed income for for adults in America\nSo the best way to do so and right now we have an income tax system that is really bad at the hardest thing to gain from New technologies because of the big tech companies will say that didn't make any money and a quarter\nAdults no taxes that the Amazon or the Google move it to say older earnings by through Ireland and no American attack but what we need to do is we need to join every other industrialized country in the world and have a value added tax\nAnd that way the American people will get a white of every Amazon transaction and every Google Earth and that's the big move I Would make\nIt so Andrew if if everyone was guaranteed a basic income every adult each month that I sat down to the table with you and I said let's work this out of course I Would ask you about the welfare programs what would happen too\nThose would we would do is go away and then everyone would just get a basic income every month\nWell there's a very complex Web of welfare programs in this country about a hundred and twenty six of them\nAnd so you can't go and say willy nilly that you're going to replace them my plan would be to say look the freedom dividend is down here and it's available to every American and if you opt for the freedom to evidence\nThen you lose your current benefits so everyone who is currently receiving welfare benefits will just look at it and say whether or not they prefer a thousand dollar this would functionally shrink\nEnrollment in welfare program but it has to be in because many many people rely on those programs or their their monthly living\nYeah and I would say Andrew ... again I'm I'm sort of imagine this fictional scenario where you and I are sitting across the table were working this out [noise]\nUm [noise] I wouldn't choose it if my welfare benefits were better than the universal income than you are going to give me because I think people respond to financial incentives so we have to take a look at the welfare programs wouldn't we\nWell yeah and I looked at the welfare programs and the majority of recipients are receiving less than a thousand dollars a per month okay and so people\nWould end up you you'd reduce the Roman and welfare program um but they actually like by more than fifty percent because more people would prefer a thousand dollars cash unconditional right in the ad worker benefits are currently getting\nSo you're a democratic candidate for president Andrew but I've talked to people across the ideological I'll ideological spectrum on this this isn't really something that's just restricted the people running on the Democratic ticket we've had some economists say this and I and I feel like it is because\nThis is how people want to deal with the replacement of jobs with automation is that what you're hearing as well\nYeah there there's a lot of alignment around a conservative and libertarian with people like Milton Friedman and Richard Nixon where for the uh and if you look at our practice right now there's one state that has a dividend or between one and two thousand dollars per year and that's Alaska which is a conservative\nState and it's wildly popular people know now that if you put money into their hands are citizens will know how the Senate\nAndrew I'm sure as you're a democratic candidate for president that you're going to be coming to Iowa to talk about this concept and I would imagine one of the push back so you get is\nBut Andrew are you just given up on the development of these technology jobs or or other jobs in Iowa and you're just going to give me a basic income so how would you answer that if people were saying don't give up on Iowa Andrew we want more jobs here\nOh this is the opposite of giving up on Iowa because we put ... billion dollar per year into the hands of Iowa in\nFamilies and communities and it would create forty thousand and three job in Iowa immediately because you know anyone listening to this where you would spend your money where your neighbors would spend the money the money would get bent on main street businesses\nIn Iowa and rejuvenate the economy so rather than giving up on Iowa this is the best thing in Iowa and the\nEditor one last question for because I have tested this concept with various people the the one thing that they question is if people suddenly had this cash in their hands that that would be inflationary to the economy what do you think about that\nYou know ... again to what we're experiencing at a place and then right now are not consumer good\nFood and what it is education health care and how is it ...\nAnd there were three things are being driven by factors other than money and people and we'd be able to the vast majority of the money because we're there will be very sensitive and and I don't need to compete for your business\nThat's Andrew Yang he is running for president in the Democratic ticket twenty twenty and also talking about universal basic income which he calls a freedom day but in Andrew it's a fascinating concept thanks for taking some time with me to talk about it today\nNo problem I'm coming to Iowa tomorrow I'll be over in Iowa City and if you want to find that anymore and go to yank on 'em or Google mind and Andrew Young but let's make it real for the people are not\nAppreciated that's timely information thank Andrew talk to you again soon\n[noise] ten sixteen is our time I [noise] I Know because a lot of you are texting me who is the free market guy uh you'd just overall philosophically it sounds like socialism or at least a form of it but it at the same time\nIt is a concept that people like a Milton Friedman talked about all along and uh so it is a concept which I've interviewed conservatives and liberals on about the universal basic income\nI ... I guess my my biggest thing is right now besides the fill the philosophy of it\nIs I I when he says well you could opt out of welfare and just go for this or but welfare would continue to exist and I and just instinctively I feel like it should be one thing or the other if you're going to go with this concept in the future but really interesting concept that I think is going to get\nA talk as Andrew said he's going to be at a rally in Iowa City tomorrow and he's going to continue to come back I Would have promoted so it was interesting to explore with him and give them a little bit of the pushback\nTen Seventeen is our time Kanye West in the White House now let me just lead with my overall thoughts on that before I talk about the reaction to it you know what my attitude is toward this which is a does a con yesterday at the White House this Kim ... at the White House have an impact\nIt does does Taylor Swift endorsing a Democrat in Tennessee have an impact it does but let's not overplay the impact of it\nBecause who they are appealing to his cohort if voters that really don't turn out and all those great numbers it has an influence but the influence can be overplay because these are not folks that magically you're just going to show up at the polls in the midterms there is a voting pattern out there\nAnd we continue to see that pattern\nA repeat itself time and time again that folks that would be influenced by ... or a Taylor Swift are not\nA huge number of voters the older you get the more you turn out\nBut it it was so it was interesting to me the overreaction on the left by this now they'll laugh if you're going to react like this\nThen you know there's an influence and you're not liking it like I said don't go for play the influence but there's an influence but yesterday on CNN and MSNBC after Kanye West\nWent to the White House went to the oval office press was invited in had a ten minute monologue basically with President Trump\nOr there was a guy named Tom ... from real clear politics on Twitter he compiled the comments of commentators on ah MSNBC and CNN in reaction to the Conway visit\nTom tweets out for those keeping score at home in the last twenty four hours folks on CNN and MSNBC I've called Kanye one dumb\nTo mentally ill three a house negro for a token five a minstrel and six a white supremacist all named thrown in ...\nOn CNN and MSNBC and less twenty four hours and you say Geoff white supremacy is yeah the first came out and said well he's ... now for the whites and supremacists\nAnd by the way a large National Association for the mentally ill has said would you please stop mocking Kanye West as mentally ill because that mocking make the stigma\nA stigma that people that are dealing with real into mental illness will suffer under when they see all this mockery but it is an amazing you when you talk about when politics just infiltrate every aspect of your life this is the reaction this is this is completely unacceptable\nNot only unacceptable from all the names that ... being called the unacceptable ... in proportion to the actual impact is going to happen but it just it just it goes to show ya you know you you you get off the liberal ranch\nAnd my goodness you your person you personally will be destroyed for doing so it's an overreaction and it is in fact quite tasteless\nSkies in Des Moines our top local story this our students and faculty at Simpson College of learned at the end you know the school is cutting programs and eliminating Thirteen positions\nHearing that the department clothing\nThat Simpson freshman jade Wilbur but Joel Johnson of Simpson says the cuts were needed\nThose are due to lack of student enrollment of crawling student enrollment off the air so\nThe Simpsons fulltime enrollment is down about one hundred thirty students that's a trend being seen nationwide\nMeanwhile art teacher Justin ... who's been teaching artist Simpson for Seventeen years hopes they'll find a job justice fulfilling audio from W.
