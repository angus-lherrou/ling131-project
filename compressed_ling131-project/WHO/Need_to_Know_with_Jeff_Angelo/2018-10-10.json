H. O. this morning and yourself Andy you as an agriculture reporter you pulled out of that announcement what was big about those announcements so what were the things that\nThe president was delivering to a rural audience yesterday\nYeah it's um a couple of things one the idea here of cleaner air and cheaper gasoline because we know that most consumers when they go to the pump\nBy on price mhm not everyone but most of them do\nI can tell you a quick story about that I have I have been involved in an ethanol promotion where I was asked for a couple of hours to stand at a gas pump and people came and said I'd like to pumped gas for you\nI've got a coupon for pennies off on your ethanol he'll buy ethanol through me and to a person their eyes flick to the prices on the pump ... they calculated the money aspect ...\nAnd then said yeah go ahead and so I learned a lesson that day it is price yeah the I'm completely with you\nAnd it's a it's about ten cents a gallon difference between eternity Fifteen yeah now is based on some ethanol markets outside influences you understand right right right but we're talking about savings in gasoline we're talking about cleaner air and we're talking about for the number one industry in this state the producers\nIncrease demand by there are some projections two billion bushels of corn long term not going to happen a year from now but maybe even more so than that\nIt's an industry in the state that has been the focus of negative news concerning these trade renegotiations\nAnd it's building momentum or maybe reverse thing I guess the psychological momentum from okay this is going to hurt there's a lot of pain going on we're seeing some suffering to pay U.S Mexico Canada agreement got done the new NAFTA is done\nNow their support coming from this uh moved to make a Fifteen available year round for\nNinety percent of the vehicles on the road everything made after two thousand and one now and you know here's\n... things that have been done the momentum is being reverse yeah and imagine what could be done in the future if the elections turned out the way we want them to there you go there there was a big\nMess is now the big debate Andy was ah of course the oil companies are not going to like this the oil state legislator so they're gonna try to tide us up in court right because you when you're talking to me as a consumer and is what I Love about your angle on this sure I'd like to start saving money next summer by by any Fifteen\nI'm not going to get the chance we'll\nSee [laughter] somebody said that and I'm blanking on the name right now Jeff but somebody said the only thing that's guaranteed after yesterday as a lawsuit and [laughter] I hear ya ... and\nHere's one of the things that they're concerned about yeah it it's not the only but apparently in the clean Air Act to somewhere there is an exemption written in for ethanol and the wording actually says each ten okay now biofuels supporters are confident\nThat is not a big deal\nBut it does apparently form as one of the basis for a potential legal challenge now a again by understanding early on and when you Fifteen year round is being talked about that was part of a deal right if we can do that and also\nTied to it or in combination with it\nA restructuring of the renewable identification number okay\nThose are separate him this directive do eat Fifteen Iranian gift that started we're also going to take a look at some things with ... to try and remove speculators were bringing more price certainty to that market\nBut a Fifteen year round and not going to be dependent upon what you know with a Fifteen year round is over here\nAnd over there is the re in discussion there not tied together they're both independent and that is thought to be a big deal\nSo Andy bringing home for the consumers and I appreciate his uh his analysis that a little bit later in the program I'll bring you the political analysis of why this was very important and its implications for the upcoming election but anti Peterson thanks for taking the time and\nReally love your you're on the spot reporting hey I always enjoy it Jeff yeah very much appreciate that hey as we get closer by the way it's October tenth\nAnd the evening with Newt Gingrich's October Fifteen so as we get closer I Know a lot of you are now saying OK looks like at my calendar is going to let me go\nTo the Iowa Historical Society\nOr October Fifteen that Iowa historical building seven thirty that night an evening with Newt Gingrich the former speaker of the house the Fox news analyst yes he's going to speak he's\nGoing to be answering questions from our own Simon Conway and Lee Habib of our American stories he also will be taking your questions if you want more information go right now to this website an evening with Newt dot com an evening with Newt\nDot com it's nine Eighteen this is news radio ten forty W.

Fifteen now can be sold the around\nThen we'd get cheaper gas now as you heard on WHM radio news there's gotta be some room making up for this and there's got to be an equipment upgrade or by many of the gas stations but look you put the incentive out there\nIsn't that going to happen I'm a free market guy you you make the free market conditions possible to sell you Fifteen which is going to be cheaper gas I think they're going to be a lot of stations it'll jump at that so\nThat's the consumer implication of the\nPresident hoping that the rules will be in place by next summer and you and I can get the Fifteen now the wild card is lawsuit that that are of course the oil industry doesn't like this at all and you're going to get a lawsuit how long will that back up he Fifteen actually being available to you and me\nThat's what we'll have to track as consumers now what are the politics of yesterday now my democratic friends are having a lot of fun and the fact that a lot of uh Nebraska people showed up at an Iowa rally that was obsessively to boost the prospects\nOf the governor and congressman David Young but remember a what Corey Lewandowski talk and talk to us about yesterday this is about media market not only the thousands of people\nThat were in the room but you are reaching the Omaha Council Bluffs media market which reaches out to rural western Iowa where there are a lot of Republican votes\nAnd so the dynamic is ginned up those Republican votes you know the Democrats are fired up and nothing is going to stop them from being fired up and they're expecting big turnout on the Democratic side for a midterm election that's absolutely right and\nNow the Republicans are working hard to counter with their people so what the president is doing his job is not to reach out to the persuadable person his job is to rally the base\nThat is what he was doing last night and comfortable it's that's where he is going watch where these particular or an rallies take place couple of them are weak\nKey places where there are close elections the president's job is to rally his base his supporters to go to the polls and counter the enthusiasm of the Democrats that's why you got\nThese kind of remarks last night at the rally in Council Bluffs in Omaha here's President Trump at last night's rally\nWanna destroy everything that's all that good at this thing no campaign is resist [noise]\nHours [laughter]\n\nAnd it's beautiful family is a national embarrassment a national disgrace\nWhat's happening and you see where they're coming from using including the phony protesters that got paid [noise]\nAnd now they want to protest because they didn't get paid yeah and they want their money [noise]\nSo now they're going\nThat surround frogs that

Democratic party that is not an issue that actually reaches out to a persuadable voter that is an issue that makes the base really really upset and so he is going to unapologetically\nHammer away at

have no response for the truth\nThen you just go I'm just outraged the set it and then you have to happen in a couple of instances left that comment on the paid protesters which is you've got people on the mainstream media saying yes there are organizations that organized and get people to locations and bus him in and pay 'em they're admitting that you got that\nUh you also have the uh the the part about where he talked about who leaked to the letter\nOr by Dr Ford member Dr Ford wanted to be kept confidential when she wrote a letter saying that\nBrett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted me yet somebody leaked that letter and then in her own testimony Dr Ford said and then I got pressured become public because I was told the media was going to go ahead now me anyway so who who who pressured that poor woman and I that I have nothing but sympathetic\nTo the doctor for it in this program who pressured her to have to sit there\nIn front of that committee I remember during the testimony when a Chuck Grassley said you know we would gladly send people out to California and taking your testimony in it to be sitting in front of us today 'cause she said I'm\nTerrified and she looked puzzled like she hadn't been told that who manipulated that that is a legitimate\nStory so when the president reference that last night and accused Senator Feinstein if we can let her people start yelling lock her up and I know I Know the reaction in the middle of all but isn't the story who leak that poor woman letter for political gain that is as legitimate story\nFree as the accusations that were
