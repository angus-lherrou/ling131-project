R.\nG. continuing to the fog and drizzle almost across the whole state and heavier rain and even some thunderstorms now in western Iowa moving in from the ... area also north of the Des Moines area and really Easter by thirty five at this time continuing to move to the northeast details on the weather forecast W. H. O. channel Thirteen\nComing up our top local story this hour at a time when Iowa farmers have been worried about terrorists will China a new deal from Taiwan to buy more soybeans it'll be signed this afternoon at the Iowa State capital\nDes Moines police are expected to release more information later this morning in a shooting a man shot in front of a woman and two small children in the broad daylight Sunday afternoon Gary Barrett reports\nToday he made clear he's very concerned with the country's just tearing itself apart\nAnd for whatever reason right there in the moment in the room he decided to make full use of his powers as a senator to say no and to slow things down but there's something else at work here Jeff he is retiring from the Senate but he's still openly considering a run for president in twenty twenty\nAnd guess where he happens to be going on Monday New Hampshire as a tonight he is still scheduled to speak there on Monday\nThere you go Senator Flake the New Hampshire today because he's not running for reelection in ... Arizona\nBuddy he wouldn't even thinking about president\nAnd he's thinking about president because there are folks out there like Jeff Flake that believe that somebody that can look like they're above it all all this partisan bickering people would support there is your reason right there he's the person who did it he's the first thing that went on sixty minutes\nAh with senator Coontz the ah the ... the Democrat on the committee the other night we are he's above it and now he's going to go to New Hampshire he's running for president\nWants to run for president there is your answer or after his uh his comments on friday he took the boat and took the vote in exchange for another week still way while the FBI investigates using my quotation fingers judge Brett Kavanaugh\nUh Joe Manchin the senator from West Virginia put this on Twitter I applaud Senator Jeff flake decision to rise above the partisan circus on display during this entire process it took courage to take a stand and call for a one week FBI investigation to get to the bottom of the allegations against judge Kavanaugh\nRising above the political circus and now going to New Hampshire because he liked to be president there's there's your answer that and that is an issue so\nUnderstand that this FBI investigation is nothing but symbolic uh they're they're going to go and interview some witnesses I'm In ah in connection\nWith ah the allegation by Dr Ford the same witnesses have already submitted um as as reports to the uh are are are actual statements they've signed\nTo the Senate Judiciary committee and said either they weren't at the party or they have no recollection of this particular incident they'll say that again a report will be issued to the White House there's no criminal investigation that results out of there there there's nothing that result of this [noise]\nThis is why Senator Chuck Grassley last week tweeted\nAbout the investigations that go on when allegations are made by the Senate Judiciary committee\nBecause it isn't like these allegations are being made and senators go man that's just terrible I Wish we could do something about it\nThey do do something about it just a reminder because I read this tweet last week to you Senator Chuck Grassley about twenty of my committee investigators tracking down all allegations that leads and talking to all witnesses and gathering all evidence\nWe have the experience to federal agents on details from ATF and ice along with seasoned congressional investigators from my nominations and oversight teams and temporary Supreme Court staff\nSo every allegation is already thoroughly investigated the FBI background check\nIs symbolic although there is a\nThere is a reason for the Democrats to want these this investigation and so by the end of the week you'll have the narrative set now the optimist in me says that after the investigation is done\nFlake and Collins and Murkowski the the the the holdouts here the the votes that you need\nTo get Kavanaugh confirmed say okay we have been satisfied by this week long FBI investigation using my quotation fingers and now we're going to vote for him and he gets on the Supreme Court that's what I Hope the Republicans do the Democrats have a couple of ways they can go with this\nFirst first of all you're seeing this narrative already shape up today which is you know who controls these investigations the White House this is a very limited controlled investigation it's not even a real investigation we need a real\nInvestigation we knew it expanded the scope of the investigation so that narrative is already being shaped this morning but there's a second narrative\nOut there over the weekend multiple liberal activists\nOn Twitter put out hey if you have information about Brett Kavanaugh\nYou can go to a field in office and give them the information you don't have to wait for them to come to you go to a field office if you got anything on judge Kevin I'll go to a field office and talk to them\nSo the other narrative that you'll be hearing by the end of the week is the FBI or officers have been overwhelmed with allegations against Brett Kavanaugh we can't have a boat we've gotten more allegations\nTo to investigate that also is a potential narrative by the end of the week but what you hope because I felt punched in the gut by Saturday because I I Want of course judge Kavanaugh to be on the Supreme Court I Want another constitutional originalists to be on the Supreme Court\nMy hope is at the end of the week it's it's just the way and he finally gets on the Supreme Court I'm disappointed because of course today is the first day of the fall session for the U.S Supreme Court and he's not there but you hope that eventually he will be\nYou hope that eventually the holdout senators like a flake like college like Murkowski will say okay we're satisfied\nBy the week long investigation and at the end of the week we will have a vote\nBut if that occurs then what occurs amongst the Democrats well impeach MIT [laughter] and you and I don't want to sound like I'm an over the top radio talk show host this is seriously being talked about the Web site Axios\nSays that ah Democrats in Washington\nAre already talking about if they can gain a house majority in the mid term elections they will talk about impeaching Brett Kavanaugh and getting them off the Supreme Court that of course follows talks of impeaching President Trump after they get the majority in the mid term elections\nAnd ... and X. feels is talking to insiders in DC this isn't like crazy\nWe're weird website talk these are people saying yes there's buzz in DC what will happen if the Democrats win the house midterm uh lead they win the majority of the house in mid term election well you know a lot of endless investigations and the President Trump\nA mentor solely him before the next election comes up in twenty twenty but there is legitimate conversation about impeachment\nAnd are not only impeaching now President Trump but judge Kavanaugh as well that is that is a thing that people are talking about in Washington it is it is just it it's madness now\nIn Washington DC as far as the ... the political parties wanting to get their way nine Seventeen is their time I wanted to make one more point to you about the Kavanaugh nomination before we move on to some other topics this morning I'm\nVery reluctant to use polling on this show anymore because of the Trump Clinton election you were told that Hillary Clinton had a Seventy five percent chance\nOf that I'm a uh she was going to win president of the United states\nAnd when that did not happen there were a lot of people that say I just don't believe polling anymore so I'm very careful and very selective and using any kind of polling data on the show because I Know your attitude to it but sometimes there's a number that comes up that's so interesting I Want to share it with you\nBecause we're hearing about a female backlash\nTo putting judge Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S Supreme Court\nWere always told that women are really really mad about this nomination well the poster Scott Rasmussen or had this uh this information over the weekend and some people take a swipe at ... and say oh he's just a partisan Republican actually his polling firm was one of the most accurate in the last election\nHere on the numbers about judge Kavanaugh's nomination fifty one percent of men had a favorable opinion of Kavanaugh as did forty five percent of women\nHowever Scott Rasmussen says the person gap is what we've come to expect that is that more women do vote for Democrats than vote for Republicans so there's always a partisan gap so the partisan gap in the support for judge or the gender gap\nThat is a in support for judge Kavanaugh is fairly normal but here's what's interesting\nEighty one percent of Republicans have a favorable opinion of top Kavanaugh including Seventy eight percent of Republican women\nSeventy nine percent of Democrats have an unfavorable view including eighty percent of democratic women so you've got this thing that goes on with the coastal media where they say women in general it's like what they do with immigration they talk about illegal immigration and legal immigration and the same breath\nThey they conflicted too so we're women will have a real backlash against is ah not Republican women in the partisan divide is they're not the gender divide coming\nNext is Congress going to upgrade your flight experience will talk to
