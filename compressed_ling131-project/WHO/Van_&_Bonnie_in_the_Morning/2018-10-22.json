H. O.\nVan and Bonnie in jeopardy Angeles sitting in one of those two and Senator Grassley is on the phone line this morning good morning sir how are you\nYeah are you guys are in trouble you got Jeff there with you to fill in\nTrouble until he did come in\nAnd that just really\nHard on himself just keeping an eye on [laughter] well\nI I Want to tell you it's always nice to wake up to ... instead of ... [laughter]\n\nPretty good yeah\nThat a lot of ice cream together to haven't we\nHaven't and I I think an ice cream every day is a\nGood for the [laughter] you know around here they screened case the doctor away just like an apple\nA day and I am right with yet\nA lot of people here in Iowa were awfully proud of the way you handle this whole Kevin ... thing and and I'm just curious I'm not going to ask you a bunch of political questions about it because everybody's done all that but I mean our how're you doing with this whole thing is is changed you at all or how you after this is all over how you're feeling about this\nWell I feel very very good about it and I think ah remember\nKavanaugh's kind of a a a watch word for this election coming up by I think the extra two weeks that we put in for this uh uh a justice or longer than the average is the last five ah probably it turned out politically to be a good thing but it sure was stressful for me\nA little bit\nBut the one thing that overcomes at all is you'd be surprised the number of people of Iowa ones that I probably have never met come up to me and they think the for conducting a fair and thorough process a particularly emphasis upon fair and and\nBeing a low key about it as opposed to a cutting people off letting everybody make their their comments you know\nI can remember back in school and I took government class they taught you about the three branches of government the executive the legislative and the judicial and it seemed to me like they were teaching me the judicial was the one that wasn't political but now it's your appears that way well\nYou got to remember putting justices on the Supreme Court is political\nBut thank God politics has an entered into the secrecy of the uh uh justices making up their mind how they're going to rule on something now I suppose sometimes a person's personal views uh come into a decision\nBut I always say this about judges or we use the word judicial temperament that means leave their own personal view was out of it and are they all look at the facts of the case and the law or the constitution\nAnd just based upon those two things nothing else should interfere and and so I think the work of the Supreme Court is not political but it sure has become political getting people on the Supreme Court\nHow do you think this whole thing is going to change the way confirmation hearings will go in the future what is this going to change it\nAs far as I'm concerned if I'm chairman of the committee it won't change it because I think that what we has the Senate Judiciary committee ever responsibilities do is I have a fair and thorough herring and based upon his competence and his judicial temperament\nUh and and quite frankly I think that it got personal in the last two or three weeks because I I think are the people that were opposed to cabinet on\nA thought that if they could change tool Republicans and they could probably do that on the issue of abortion or something like that then they wouldn't have to worry about anything else they get this guy de faded probably buy a fifty some to forty saw\nBut ah as it turned out or they couldn't find any fault with his uh uh decisions three hundred and Seventy said in the made in the twelve years he's been on the circuit court of appeals\nSo then they started all the other stuff that was more personal about him\nAnd they throw something at the wall or a different one every day none of it stuck and finally it was approved forty fifty to forty eight so I think that in the future a ... it's it's going to still be based upon a person's competence and his judicial temperament\nYou know I heard the doctor forget threats judge Kavanaugh got threats how about you did you get threats\nA well a a you know I'm supposed to be senator number one as far as somebody they arrested in Long Island [laughter]\nBut I say Fox News had my picture and Collins picture on yeah we were threatened a way back in my suit ... phone call to sue city office and Cedar Rapids office around the first to September\nBut uh in the final analysis a ... and ... whatever thought that they get an anonymous phone call but the arrest of somebody in Long Island or friday I think it was\n[noise] you know one of the things I heard back here and there were a lot of people that were praying for you and the whole situation\n[noise] ah you know there's nothing more comfort comforting\nIn a in a time of stress like I had those last two or three weeks to have people say that they were praying\nAnd a first Timothy to wanting to says to pray for people in government and it was short comforting to know that that was going on sometimes in my own office sometimes or somebody heard something on a religious radio station saying you better pray for Senator Grassley and\nAnd things like that that's very comforting\n...
