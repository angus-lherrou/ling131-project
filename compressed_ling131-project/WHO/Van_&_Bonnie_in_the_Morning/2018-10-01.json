mean they are like ... you talk to you later [noise]\nLower back and we have we have to be with us of course he's got a program on WBAI nature radio from ten to midnight every night and what a great program it is\nOur American stories and that kinda ties in with our visit from Newt Gingrich that's coming up on Monday October Fifteen highly how\nYou doing I'm doing great how are you both doing how fabulous very well we talked to a new the other day and he really loves that program and the concept for mostly because it's so positive and that's kind of what'd you were shooting for when you came up with it wasn't it it\nIt was what I was hoping for which they say what are the stories about America it'll make us proud it'll keep was positive in this big fight we're having across the country it's obviously between socialism and capitalism but it's about something more to it's about our spirit\nAnd it's about the American character of self governance versus the government taking care of us and so I thought what better way to do things\nBut at the end of the day let's be reminded of who we were we are and who we might would come\nAnd storytelling is the way we've never done this before you know when I talked about this five years ago and I pitched bill Bennett and a couple of or you use of our movement and these guys you know if you've got to do it go do it for a nonprofit we don't take any government money and we're really grateful to be on such a great station like W which\nI think it's interesting how exciting and informational and really interesting deeply interesting history can be a lot of people that history but boy you do a great job of making it come to life like it did when it happened\nWe get to do the life from Henry Ford and people don't know what Henry Ford managed to make something a product that was only affordable rich people and make it affordable to middle class people and the whole world he got rich bringing in the price of a product down or also raised salaries so that people could afford to buy those\nCards and then for it because of our manufacturing plants created the arsenal democracy so when we were going to fight the Japanese and the Germans were able to build playing at a\nBetter and more rapid rate and those sports factories got turned around and we used to create your style democracy and then the next day we did a story about what is ... and about the man who the guys were one of them was a born again Christian and they were talking about the song simple man and work from\nIs that we're starting to drift from their Christian roots starting to dabble with drugs and with the things that can get your kill and ultimately it was a story about redemption and meanwhile you would have thought you were just hearing the story about Leonard Skinner but it was about so much more\nYou're going to be here on our with our evening with Newt Gingrich right on Monday October Fifteen\nThat's right Monday October Fifteen one night only news coming into town nobody knows more about current events what's going on in the new the new year also to support our American story and it can go to ... dot com and you can get your
