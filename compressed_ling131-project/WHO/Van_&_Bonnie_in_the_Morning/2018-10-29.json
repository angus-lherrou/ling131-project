year we automatically got very interested in that and a Julie is on the line ... its rigor ... thank you very much at my ...\nMy maternal grandmother to pronounce it right but I think fish in a\nReason I ask you is because uh NBC News building one way and uh on your book ... another swept through your book was ... that I think that's fair [laughter] All right so ... to lose a basis for this thing ah you ... did you lose your mother and that kind of ... some things\nI did I did I lost my mom on to all the time um\nBut before we go there I I just have to say it the idea of being\nOf ever writing a book about goes is not one that I ever had growing up in Montana [laughter] so I I just have to lay that out there it it sounds just as crazy to me as it does you even though I obviously believe it and do it through it still sounds kind of crazy\nSo anyway back to your mother\nYes I lost my mother's old timers um and then about five months later I'm One of our best friend was killed in a car accident so I had the while I'm pounding grief\nAnd what I learned was when we're in grave we're in chaos and that's when we start to shed are rigidity about whatever belief systems are in that for me likely that started to happen because I started to see goes photograph\n... and I never I never had before that ha\nNever had seen him before and I was a skeptic I didn't believe you know my job is chief data stretches\nOver at ... now and you know I'm kind of a nerd ... among some of the most creative people in the world and and\nBut I still you know my universe is ruled by numbers so ... imagine a surprise\nI see I grew up or go send photographs or these photographs that you took and then when you looked at them you sound goes in the pictures\nYeah okay and I would see them in various places and what happened after I started to see them in my photographs I started to see them another\nSo it's not like I had you know some superpower that somehow it goes and you know in front of my iPhone because that's what I think that the voters with a such a special equipment require\n'em but I started I they were very clear to me and but I think what happened\nAnd this gets back to the whole idea about being in the chaos and your brief um is I did look at it pictures from the past and actually have the you know goes and an older photographs but I think that I might that have\nThe eyes to see and and that means that you know if you\nDon't have I see that means that you're probably much more ethic and so if you don't want to see something you're not going to sound like they don't want to hear something you're not going to hear it um and I think that's very much where I was in and all this you know Journey Through grief you know happened\nShe goes in your
