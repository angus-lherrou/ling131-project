of Bethel Lutheran Church in Kitchener, Ontario now with a message titled God created here's pastor heart\nGrace mercy and peace be unto you from your lord and savior Jesus Christ\nOr certainly checks for today is found in the beginning of scripture genesis chapter one verse twenty seven so God created man in his own image in the image of God he created him male and female he created them let us pray\nAlmighty God heavenly father your generous goodness comes to us new every day\nBy the work of your spirit you lead us to acknowledge your goodness to give thanks for your benefits\nAnd to serve you unwilling obedience help us to see the world as you see it just the others and remember that they too are your ... children\nGive us the courage to see your hand in all people in the farmer the migrant worker the store clerk the butcher the Baker the refugee the c._e._o. the politician\nThat yet to be born and then all of those whose work makes it possible for us to gather here today\nTo sit at your feet in your word less us in keep everyone in your care through\nSon Jesus Christ star lord\nOn that it's right there at the start of history the start of it all the genesis as it were in the beginning God created\nThat is our heavenly father is will to create to give life where none existed or exists it's there where God from nothing brings everything into being you know the history you've heard it many times before\nFrom darkness comes light\nThan water then land than vegetation than sun and moon and stars\nThen see life followed by life on land\nWe see God's handiwork bringing life into its very first existence and God made the beef up the earth according to their kinds and the livestock according to their clients and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind and God's saw that it was good\nThis account alone would be a magnificent have been to watch ethics for sure but God wasn't done\nNo his crowning achievement was still to come then God said let us make man in our image after our likeness again God brings to life that which never was it's the creator the one who is life bringing into life us\nIt begins first with one man\nThen being the loving father seeing how sad man is with not having a fitting partner he puts man to sleep and takes from the man a rebel and from it\nMakes a woman then the man said this that lasted bone in my bones and flush of my flash she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man\nHere it is where to become one again Adam is completed as his wife who was made from his side is at his side again\nAnd God Bless them and God said to them be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and some do it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth\nThe giver of life now gifts the couple with the ability to create more of what God loves so much and let's not misunderstand as even though man and woman have the ability to create a life together is only one God gifts it to them\nThat all life is actually created he is lord after all [noise] so we're once no lights existed now life in many forms exists today and God's crowning achievement that of mankind has since grown to over seven billion people\nIn such a huge number it is hard to not feel a little in significant I think families who are blessed with three four five or ten children and how some of the siblings feel as if they aren't even noticed among many others in their own home vying for the attention of their parents and as a parent it can be ...\n... to give equal amounts of time to each child something demand more than others\nAnd it isn't wrong it just is what it is\nThat said though our heavenly father has no such limitations no he is greater and he has kept a watchful eye on his entire creation and each individual he's created with the attention is if we were the only\nOne on earth before I formed you in the womb I knew you says God\nEach life before even coming into existence God has cast his gaze upon delighting in having us hear his voice and that we would be led home to him\nNow if you don't know the story it isn't only about the good stuff\nNo there is the part where death entered where God had created so much life\nGod's enemy the devil the great liar and deceive her chained to destroy that which God loves the most you see the devil cannot be God Newark take his place in fact when the devil tried\nGod banished him and send him away from the heavenly places hating God as the devil does though knowing his powerless a beating God one on one the devil targets God's crowning achievement seeking to hurt God by hurting those he loves\nJust as he did with the first man and woman in the garden the devil continues telling lies that\nWe can be like God creators of our own destiny is that we should focus on what we want and try to get it at any cost don't worry be happy for that is what you see you can trust me I can show you how to get\nIt once created in the image of God our\nLives got twisted and turned upside down and where once we walked with God now are natural inclination is to walk to the beat of our own drum\nWhere before we would've seen the value and everyone who was created in God's image\nWe now see them as a means to our ends obstacles to our goals or simply inconveniences wars now exist among people's tribes and nations as we seek to get our own wants Matt\nWe may lie and cheat or speak poorly of others to get the promotion we want or something else of value that we place the lives of others over\nWe may see those who are born with physical or mental challenges as of less value them those born typical maybe we think there must be a curse from God at play there the parents must have done something wrong in their lives to be given such a great burden", "show_name": "Lutheran Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "07"}
