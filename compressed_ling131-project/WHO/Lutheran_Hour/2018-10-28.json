has been revealed apart from the law although the law and the profits bear witness to it this right standing comes into effect through the faithfulness of Jesus for everyone everyone who trusts\nYou see there is no distinction there is no difference all have sin and are falling short of God's glory and yet\nAnd yet as a free gift by God's Grace they are declared to be in the right through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus God's what Jesus forward in the place of mercy through faith by his blood\nGod did it to demonstrate that he is in the right\nTo passing over since from beforehand

hundred and first anniversary of the day Martin Luther among can professor from the University of whittenberg and Germany posted is Ninety five theses\nNow before we go any further I Want to make sure everyone listening knows the Lutheran password you identify yourself as a Lutheran you might not have realized that we have a password so here it is\nJustification by grace through face so what does it mean\nIn\nSometimes we lose friends we treated like a password of code or magical formula and we repeated to prove that we're real Lutherans\nBut what does it mean here's what it means I'm not God and you're not God God is God\nGod is God with us or without us but God became God for us when he became the man Jesus of Nazareth\nBack to the first part I'm not God you're not God God is God\nJust a couple of months before he posted his famous Ninety five feces on October thirty first Fifteen Seventeen Martin Luther wrote the following man is by nature and able to want God to be God indeed he himself wants to be gotten does not want God to be God\nI think the possibility of\nBeing in something like Harold Crick situation is very disturbing for us smartphone toting self defining early twenty first century individuals' see we've been told to write our own stories and so it's strange to imagine that we might have an author\nIt's a strange thing letting God be God it's a strange thing being justified by grace alone grace alone was the phrase the first Lutheran Protestant Reformers used to describe the one way relationship between God\nAnd God's creatures\nGod gives creatures receive\nPassively like characters in a story\nThe Bible describes God is the author of the story of the world so we can think of the world\nThe universe and everything that happens in it as one great long story with all of us his characters and then we must think of God as the author of this story this means that God is the creator but not merely like a designer\nAnd also does more than design for example my smartphone had a designer but that person hasn't touched this machine a long long time if ever the majority of of this creations lifespan is spent far removed from its design or not so with an author as long as the stories being told the author never leaves\nThe authors continuously present in with and under all the characters settings and turns of plot\nAnd author is a creator but not in the same way that a mother and father are creators of father begets than a mother gives birth to their child right away the parents begin to interact with the child is a fellow person who's like them in every way only smaller mom and dad smile baby smiles back", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Lutheran Hour", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "28"}
