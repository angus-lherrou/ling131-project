wreck idleman show we're heading off to pleasant ridge Michigan Kirk you're on the air how are you\nHi Rick thanks for taking the call and very good happy to how can I help\nI have a question regarding financial literacy I have a twelve year old son and a ten year old girl who I talked to a lot regarding the importance of managing debt saving money and invest in for the future\nThey both shown some interest but more so my son I got a book from the library which my son read the entire thing and when it's very excited\nWhen he read something about how to invest you know three thousand dollars for my summer job into a rough\nIRA in forty years later it's worth a you know big number it was all exciting told me dad I'm going to be a millionaire Sunday so\nI'd like to continue um that thirst for knowledge but didn't find anything more at the local library for him to read\nHowever I Would also like him to learn more about life general financial realities things such as various bank account savings checking credit unions how to balance a checkbook\nUm various kinds of insurance credit card in credit card debt and then just also investing for the future so I'm Wondering what books\nOr digital media would be available for his you know that would be age appropriate for him yeah I don't feel like a a word book or software to go along with it so it can provide like hypothetical examples for him to work through their anything out there like that\nA law clerk I'm going to give you the apply\nThe silly gauge didn't so focused on financial education for your kids you know we lament in\nThis country that there is a substantial amount of financial illiteracy\nUh parents seem to be talking to their kids about everything these days religion politics drugs sex but they're not talking about money\nSo I'm really glad that you are because we have so many Americans growing up financially illiterate they're not taught me this and K. through twelve or they aren't getting any college classes on it and employers are certainly not selling them much about money so I'm really glad you're getting your kids off on the right foot\nI'm going to give you two answers\nFirst is my first book the truth about money\nOr that book is considered a classic in the field a personal finance was named book of the year I'm by the Institute for financial literacy when it was first published\nAnd it covers everything about personal finance from getting out of debt and dealing with credit all the way to multimillion dollar states and everything in between\nUh and the first three parts of that book are really aimed perfectly for your children understanding what is money held his money work of understanding compound growth\nA and the very basics of money so I Would encourage your kids to read the truth about money second\nOn going to direct you to a website called jumpstart dot org\nThe jumpstart coalition for personal financial literacy is a nonprofit organization that serves as a clearing house they collect\nUh information and resources from dozens maybe even hundreds of organizations academic organizations nonprofits government agencies as well as corporations that produce financial education materials\nThe jumpstart coalitions materials are almost all free all of it's available on line a jumpstart dot org it's designed for teachers and parents of kids K. through twelve\nSo if you go there you'll find a wealth of data information articles videos work books quizzes all kinds of information that you can use to help foster your children's educations\nI Will definitely do that right thank you very much\nYou're very welcome Kirk thank you so much for the phone call you can do with Kirk did and call us the triple late plan wreck that's triple eight seven five to sixty seven forty to whatever your personal finance question we're ready to help you and you know Jim and higher so focused\nDawn financial education financial literacy that's why we spend so much of our effort it's why I've written nine books and gene has written one of her own\nAnd why we do some of these seminars this year I think we'll be doing eight hundred seminars by the time of year is out across the country and why do this radio show every week for you and why we do television specials for public TV around the country\nWe are really focused on financial literacy because we know what a problem it is and how so many Americans are just\nIlliterate when it comes to the subject and it's why I'm very happy to tell you Jean and I have written together a first book uh and it's for children\nThe book is called the squirrel manifesto it's being published by Simon and Schuster and is being released November twenty about a month from now\nAnd it's our first kids' book it's aimed at children ages four to eight and it teaches children the most important fundamental lessons about money so I encourage you to go to Amazon dot com Barnes and

and Steve a great to see you once again you've we've cracked a few jokes and the had a good time here ready for some football\nAnd I appreciate the fact that you read the intro exactly the way I wrote

welcome you to another beautiful day happy valley oh it was just a quarter will shower to Rob yeah I just I Can't wait to get down to the field [laughter] with you in mind atomic Shay earlier they got to keep you on the field oh yeah oh yeah\nThere's there's no doubt about that but hopefully the rain will subside it's supposed to and of course so this is one of the best care field sitting in the country are taught game but Indiana last week and\nNever easy to it on the road and the Big Ten you got it done what a ... well for Penn State that afternoon\nPhrase makes early one well which is typical ... hundred and seven yards so that's to another you're rushing games and said this year but Robby he's\nCarry the ball Seventy two times the last four games at Eighteen ties to obviously some of them are maybe a broken past player or whatever but still at Eighteen times the game for a guy that you prefer another good hit\nA and miles Sanders I think he I think he's earned more touches because the Sanders was really good last week out of the backfield career high and receiving with fifty three yards\nCuts targeted six times last week made all six catches and between that and the running game standards is going to be a thousand yard Russia or this year for them he's the guy that can take some pressure off and the biggest problem I have had this year offensively that's really stalled them as they've had\nTwenty five ... passes this year\nI mean that just crushed as an office or something like that happened the thing is one thing you notice with Iowa they convert their third downs forty nine percent forty two percent on third and for better but when they have to make a pass by their guys are making catches of making ...\nSanders what has a press chew and kind of described his style obviously sick forms of generational player a ... mile Sanders is a one cut ... guy who really fits the offensive line they all sense of winds are good straight ahead blocking offensive line they give them a crease he goes\nHe's not a guy that messes around and dances or anything like that he can get to the edge he's got good speed but he also has the ability to get to the whole quickly and then get rolling and I think his where he's really been a plus he's become a better blocker he's become a better receiver\nAs we're Barclay really expel the last couple of years great receiver well Sanders has become a good receiver which is what they needed\n[noise] he talked about the drops this wide receiver group as it got better as the season is rolling\nAlong it's a funny thing is I watch them in practice robbing the catch everything right and they get in the game they got to drop here and a drop their joint Johnson's been getting better as the seasons got along that's fine\nRandom Polk has struggled a bit the last couple of weeks with hanging on to the football handler catches ever learn All right so he catchy he's been fined that can he's the big play guy and this off and I don't think that there's enough ways to get him touches because he's about it's exciting players uh they've had in a while and I've had some exciting players or\nHow is the fence up front because they're obviously going to go against what are the better defensive line so see yeah\nThey're going to have their work cut out today 'cause I mean this this defense of fun I mean I looked at Ohio State obviously and then I went to the tape of Iowa in Iowa was every bit as good as Ohio State is between ... and the Nelson's and everybody up for it they're just really good\nFor James ... and then what happened here with the sanctions everybody knew that would be the slowest area to come back 'cause you just need the numbers and the time and the experience was probably the

February to good to see a good afternoon I don't know who said but the line is the main\nThing is to keep the main thing the main thing they knew what he did and that the library of Charlotte in that case the main thing is that Iowa defense and Nate Stanley keep doing what you're doing\nWell yeah and this isn't the type a day that you're gonna have to really concentrate on the handling the ball holding on to the ball and this was a regular\nGrass fields so boring a little money to down there something that doesn't happen on synthetic turf so uh yeah it's it's just not going to be an\nExplosion idle twenty five points might want to I think so yes I I Would agree with you we're we're we're watching\nA heavy drizzle or Mr call it what you want it rained hard all night long off and on and throughout the morning or as a great running back ... return or kick return or what are the little new watches you look for going from field turf to natural grass on a day like today\nWell one of the things that that'll happen it is I think a slows down the path rush 'em because the big effects Eli I'm In their ... their feet or slip\nOr when they're on a natural grass fields so when it\nIf it's soggy or one of nonsense Lyman makes contact with them and stuff on their feet back ... and ...\nAnd [noise] Penn State is trying to do with the ... year that's sort of deal or are there almost twenty six or seven now then that was their goal to get fifty for the season so let's hope they get zeroed today\nAnd that's been a pretty good number for the Iowa offensive line so let me reverse the lines of scrimmage or and ask you about the old line leads the Big Ten with only six ... allowed what are their issues on a turf like today\nWell we're a little better off I think because I'm are all kinds of linemen are are built to Ron oh they're not heavy weights is that in there and slug we pull them a lot we expect to unveil to get on the outside and walk\nAnd so I think they're probably impacted the least or anybody a on a day like just in fact a lot of our pets the mood was light days like this so\nWell and that's why it's a it's encouraging to see that Iowa run game come on like it has the last two weeks ...\nWell yeah and and talking to jak ham who's my counterpart here at Penn State this morning he said Indiana last week was second by second for all day they ran for two hundred and twenty five yards so let's hope that are over there so I can put that kind of a running game to the U.S together today if\nThe guys can run Ninety nine plays like Indiana did last week they should get out of here\nWith the Turks straight road victory Polack you'll be back a little bit later on your knees just scratching the surface to surface jets keys to the game are coming up shortly you're on Iowa Penn State uh were brought to buy weapons hybrids get more out of your street corner investment with liberals hybrids ... offers the highest performing corn genetics\nAnd the

celebrate\nBig brothers big sisters of Johnson county proceed support big brothers big sisters adjustment county and one on one mentoring and so if you got time stopped by today they've got a rap all prizes and\nHide everybody with a big brothers big sisters in Johnson county with that we bring it Hawkeye athletic director Gary bar to Penn State now twenty five years of member\nOf the Big Ten they've been a great ambassador like all of our institutions Gary uh\nUh yeah they had the situation and twenty eleven twenty twelve with Sandusky that ah really turn the entire university upside down not just the football program but they seem to have emerged from that a bit but you know the the effects are long standing we get that\nBut uh when you look at it as as a ... an athletic director initially ...\nWhat do you think about when you're you're able to promote the fact of Penn State is in the Big Ten conference\nWell first of all I wasn't ... at the time but I've had conversations with the commissioner Delaney and others about how when we first added Penn State there was a lot of consternation a lot of concern that they weren't going a bit but if you think about it they do fit the profile academically\nOr the size of the institution public research or certainly their fan base in their stadiums there a broad based program they offer a lot of sports so uh they they really are the issues that you mentioned not withstanding ... really are a terrific a member of the Big Ten percent many reasons\nWonderful academic institution to one thankfully it's a great ... and all that we're not back when you look at a soggy turf like today natural grass how has the quarterback were you able to you know when you've got to block it out of your mind you've got to play your game but how did you always approach a day like today\nThe biggest issue you have to get out of your head and just a you know if you have big hands as a quarterback it's an advance\nDuring the day like today because the ball is slippery\nBut the ball is built in such a way or the you know the middle of the ball is built such way if you have large hands you can handle that so I actually this week compared to last week I Would much rather play in a drizzle as a quarterback and play and forty mile an hour gusts so assuming that the funding is good and\n... as you mentioned they have a they have a reputation for having a great tariff I was down there earlier it\nDoes look solid um you know I I think it's going to come down to who execute says as a Eddie said it takes a little bit extra concentration and it would be really nice to have a running game today\nYou know you're sounding like coach ... now a\nA that takes a quarterback with big hands Nathan Stanley has huge clauses he calls it so that should bode well for our quarter back today and he prefers wet over windy I like that I like that term\nA look let's switch sports here because the guy the outstanding Iowa Hawkeye a women's field hockey team is here in state college and they play Penn State tomorrow the opening round of the big tent tournament\nThe fall season is starting to wind down in a lot of sports in to a cross country team is a big tent championships demand in Nebraska this weekend and\nInterestingly we play Penn State here tomorrow in field hockey I think it's two top team top ten teams I think we're nine and they're seven uh we we were able to beat them two to one in a close game at home so uh they'll they'll be watching and and cheering on the ... a two day Hawkeye swing through\nThrough happy valley indeed despite the elements of good luck to the men's and women's cross country teams that Lincoln, Nebraska tomorrow for the uh cross country but cross country championships it is that time of year isn't it\nIt is in a it's a fun time of year and you know clearly with football we're six in one and and I've been asked several times of the commenters may boy big game isn't it this week and I said you know when you're six one every games\nAnd I've noticed you've taken a peek at Wisconsin north western Michigan state Purdue as somebody said earlier you know how do you see this race there are so many so much football left the next as another month of there's\nThere's a reason to college football playoff doesn't come out with its first poll until this week and there's a reason for that early on it's fun to talk about who's ranked where but this is about the week where are the separation begins to occur and clearly ah we're in a situation where we want to separate ourselves the right way to day\nIndeed thanks for coming by as ... good to see you guys Gary barter Hawkeye athletic director uh stopping by and our what those hybrids pre game show right now it's time for today's
