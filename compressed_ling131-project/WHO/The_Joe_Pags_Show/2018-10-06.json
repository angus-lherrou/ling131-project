{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WHO", "content": "So you probably ought to raise the interest rate uh so if you were to get an inflation move like that and you then raise the interest rate would you be tight or were you just be responding to a condition for him\nI see of two percent inflation and a two percent fed funds rate let's just say that's normal well if you're a three percent inflation shouldn't you have a three percent for fed funds rate does that mean anything's actually any tire oh\nRight does a rate hike now and do continued rate hikes through the rest of the year the what are the politics of that especially here in a in a midterm election cycle is I Know I think\nWhatever politics are are done uh there's not going to be I think there's not another meeting until after the ... ... maybe just a day or two before but uh I think the fed has made it clear that they're only gonna do rate hikes if alternating meeting okay\nI'm\nEven if they surprised by doing a rate hike just before the terms uh\nEat and then even if that rate hike was a mistake that slow the economy right there's no way that it would have the slightest pick on anybody or anything for months and so the idea that that would make anybody\nYou know less satisfied with Republican leadership I'm In for a vote or you know that kind of narrative there are many different narratives [noise] uh it's just absurd it's just that whatever affect the fed was going to have it it's\nIt's gonna habits are they have it so you know if it's got to the election it already has\nWell let's talk about in terms I mean you have you gone out there and said that you know midterms are basically a referendum on whether America is glad I got what I Want to talk about that talk about how you are looking at the at the midterms right now and what you're tracking versus maybe what we see you know in in in other in other outlets\nUm typically in the terms and you can go back many many many many years and look at the historical record others it's quite clear\nIt seems that with the economy is strong or weak with the president is popular unpopular what tends to happen is whatever party does not control the White House makes big gains in the house is\nOkay and that appears to be a pattern that is just part of the American soul and or maybe it's part of the human soul big except the American system so little unique but the [noise] so we see it here but for most people politics is like the Olympics\n... get interested in sports once every four years right or at least you get interested in things like gymnastics was a reporter so the ah\nThe people who will get interested in it just two years later yeah or the people who are really angry about the way it turned out two years ago okay and this time around is Democrats for years ago it was a Republican\nYou know one of the things that were asked a lot about is what we're kind of seeing what we are tracking um especially in the trade side you know as the as the U.S China story kind of continues to move forward or in some respects metastasize as we see the additional tariffs um you know they they've taken effect after their announcement\nAfter promises of you know the Chinese retaliation and you and I talked about this in the past in terms of then kind of coming out and saying you know we're not going to devalue\nWhat happened right after the recent move or the the recent announcement on the tariffs I especially as it relates to us equities and Chinese equities where you know you were tracking naps but what happened after this announcement\nOr a question because what's been happening all during this trade war which really started in March is us stocks of basically crawled straight straight up and Chinese toxic crawled straight straight down there to downright Berra market\nAnd their currencies done the same thing so if you're a non Chinese investor who had to buy the Chinese currency to buy Chinese stocks you got hit both ways on the stocks and the currency like ... thirty five percent this year [noise]\nSo what happened after sort of the worst of all the ... came out a week ago if the u._s. stock market went up the Chinese stock market went up twice as much so\nWasn't supposed to have [laughter]\n[laughter] yeah\nOne of the things that was driving the sink or early conclusion\nWas the financial pressure being put on the Chinese fighter stock market by their currency market by their bond market and all of which are in great distress and we're sending a useful signal to the Chinese that as painful as it is going to be for you to capitulate to Trump\nIt's even more painful due to have your economy imploded have what would really be the first ever recession in in China's a modern

Africa Deborah yeah of course we expect Obama to be able to fix anything you haven't done anything\nIt turns out your ... your damage\nDone anything it never had any experience there was no way and we should expect him to be able to fix anything economically guess what my father has done that he had built a business that he did bill that instill it shouldn't be a shock to people that were able to turn that around and now the Democrat\nIt's one a reversal of that they want to take everything and go one eighty why because we have all time historic lows for blacks and unemployment for Hispanics for women you you want to reverse all that I mean if the Democrats the don't ask Donald Trump came out today in favor of oxygen\nDemocrats would be against it I mean that's their policies just hate\nBut we have to show up we have to stay on the fight because people's they've done I Love your dad's doing it's so great it's amazing it's\nYou know but as I say well how we vote for who is your congressman they are voting for November what do you mean it was November right they're not even the way they want to vote and twenty twenty but they don't realize that it can all go away in twenty Eighteen they don't realize that Donald Trump is on the ticket in twenty Eighteen Donald Trump is on the ticket in six weeks\nSo we got to get out we got to mobilize if you like what's going on a\nMixture of fight for it because the other side I don't know what they are motivated by I don't even know what their platform is other than you do have an outrage I mean you know what they are outraged and they they should be outraged about their platform and their failures over the last few decades but they are outraged about something else but there are turning up\nWe got to turn up I said all the time they're like no no no the same fake news media that said Donald Trump can't win as saying that he's going to lose now\nBelieve it I see the numbers you got to get out you got to stay at we can't just be fat how being lazy and expect this stuff to continue he needs he needs to guys like Ted Cruz he needs guys like ... to all of the congressional people in Texas that are up he need those guys helping him he can't do it by himself he imagined giving the house Nancy Pelosi\nIs there a question I\nThink about it I mean that would be a disaster for this\nCountry but we got to turn around and we've got to bring our friends\nIt's trending on drugs today the ... I'm going to be the speaker again it's Donald Trump junior and ah we we always appreciate the time a couple of things they didn't realize that your dad had the magic wand the whole time and one\nWas commonsense inexperienced right you know this isn't a magic wand it's just you know you can't expect a community organizer to ... understand let alone actually affects your weight real change when it comes to economic fiscal policy by on fiscal but I think about it we we've discussed the economy I Know him what about foreign policy\nI look at the end you look at the Israeli embassy you look at what's going on in North Korea that took guts fine you know we don't just draw a red line in Syria like Obama did when they crossed that they slap you in the face will they they tried doing that and we should put fifty seven Tomahawk missiles in there and guess what the rest of the world was watching\nOkay we were not going to let people take advantage of something whether it's trade deals got NAFTA it can't be renegotiated\nCan be done and congratulations Mexico and Canada now on board done when when you have a real leader\nI Wish that we had somebody in journalism in journalism was dead known him and he says is all the time too but it didn't go on one person steps up and says\nFormer President Obama just told me one thing you did that caused this to happen because how do you take credit for it if you look your dad when one eighty on everything Obama dude and fix the ... how can Obama even for a second even think to themselves yeah I did that because we're not\nWe're not fighting a fair fight and that's why we all have to get out because we're fighting with one arm to arms to arms and a leg it feels like at times because the media look like I said oh no this is the new normal one point ... percent leptin that doesn't have to be why why would the New York times back him up on that front because they needed to make him a success because they all believe in the asinine policies you see that\nI mean look at what's going on in fact that in bed or August putting up a challenge I mean Beto O'Rourke and run for mayor of New York city and be on the left side of the ticket\nI mean that's the only way you know his his\nMoney's coming from all places other than Texas\nBecause you know those are our tax that the values that he espoused or you know the attacks on law enforcement want to eliminate ice in the ... I mean I've only saved nine hundred kitten last year from you know a sex trafficking but there are terrible we should get rid of them I mean these people are insane and so we have to get out we have to stay motivated we have to bring our friends\nAnd you can't buy into the media stuff just look at what's going on in your business is look at what's going on your place of work with your paycheck I mean you're winning with these policies these policies are moving the needle these policies are making a difference in America's getting respect again because we're not going to let little third world countries push us around and slap us around\nYou know I have a ... and we have\nTo remember that because they can all go away in November\nAnd people need to realize that it's Donald Trump junior and I appreciate the access let's talk about Texas as you know based in San Antonio Fifteen stations in Texas we've got a hundred and twelve around the country but we focus now on Texas because it was ... challenge Robert Francis awoke is what I call news somehow cold really appropriating but he's Hispanic but he's\nNot he's not at all that spending and he'll pretend he is for the road but that's a democratic ... you can get away by the way if Ted Cruz did something like that now he happens to actually be Hispanic something but if it's something like that they would destroy ... absolutely you you you got out of every day for better or it's\nNot a problem when he said something about what was the voluptuous breast or whatever that that's not a problem that only one day story of Ted Cruz did that it it would be you know he should be disbarred he should be you know write it killed ...\nWe're not fighting a fair fight and there's down ticket races that are dependent on this thing has been great for Texas He's done he's fought for those values I look at them you know ... platform and like I said I mean this is in New York City mayoral candidate running for senator in Texas\nWell he's getting big support from Ellen so you know that's good it was like oh this is Donald Trump junior so you're in Texas you got Ted Cruz who I've known for longer than he's been a senator and he's always made promises that he's always done exactly what he said he would do which is your dad and went out in the primaries but they're very very similar politically in that\nThey're not doing it politically based say I'm going to do this this this this moves and your dad and Ted actually believe I should do those things I promise bigger it was just given as you know a ... puppy dogs it's weird well of\nCourse I wasn't I I really respect that I mean was it was a brutal primary and a little story I don't know if I'd actually even said this publicly but ... you know a couple of weeks after that and it was a brutal primary there was\nA big AI dinner in DC you know the usual lead on\nThis stuff I I went and all my friends are from Texas I'm there all the time hunting fishing or raised a lot of money during the campaign down in Texas I'm sitting there at the Texas table and a couple of friends ... at the table and we actually have a great dinner good conversation\nAt the end of the dinner and we say hey ... you know we're going back to the Trump Hotel right in the middle of DC on Pennsylvania Avenue a couple of drinks hanging out whatever you want to come along it came with us and that and the Trump Hotel we had a great time for three hours knows that got you know but you know when I showed me\nBeyond the guts if he understood Donald Trump going to be president and he was going to help support policies that he believed in that we're going to be good for America and they were going to be good protects and he was able to put all of that aside and now they have a great relationship\nBecause they're doing what's right for their constituencies and that was impressive to me that was a great\nA testament to his character and everything and I don't think I've ever told that story before but I think it's actually relevant huh because you're doing what's right for your constituency and I don't see that everywhere else I mean again look at where ... money is probably coming from\nThat probably doesn't represent the average guy in Texas right now that it's probably represents the average guy in a Hollywood studio somewhere else you know that's\nThe difference and I don't want Texas to become California\nAt Texas a yeah I mean just look at the economic success if it had to look at all this debt but you want to become California give me a\n... and the people from California bringing their politics but that doesn't make any sense to me it's a it's Donald Trump junior you have an opinion as to why anybody would listen to I'm going to take away your tax cut ...\nI'm going to lower your paycheck we're going to open the border we're going to get rid of arguments enforcing the border and every single week they're either catching them is Thirteen or stopping sex trafficking\nWhy would anybody want new blows you to be in charge of good things are going so great right now why you have no idea but like I said\nWe're we're not in a fair fight you know the media will show business low right thing to do I'm all for taking care of other people once we take care of our own problems but we've got plenty of friends we got a disastrous education system would what twenty eight and like the world\nAfter a long list of third world countries to the gym and half of you know to spend that I have spent the a small fraction of what we spend per capita right I mean we had we had that problem that we're working on fixing and they're making great progress with all\nOf those things but like we need to keep going and you're going to have people in there that basically the next two years until twenty twenty you will be a total stalemate nothing will get done it'll be a total disaster I Want to keep this winning going for another six years so we\nBy lions

to win the west but there's just no new world was me world not if you opt for winning over wanting which is why the hawks are geared up\nFor getting their first road when the seasons today and keeping a whole observer bacon better known as Floyd of Rosedale and purely from a pig's point of view why wouldn't Floyd want to stay in the Hawkeye State\nNot counting Floyd himself at any one time this is real there are approximately twenty million hogs being raised in Iowa in Iowa producers market approximately fifty million hogs a year so\nIt's obvious that employed wants to hang with his pork beef he wants to do it right here in the state that produces nearly one third of the nation's pork\nOur special guest today knows exactly what it feels like the lip Lloyd but before we welcome and former

football especially with ...\nKelley Martin back in the fold and that doesn't mean next standing won't take a shot down the field\nOn the flip side to Iowa as defense better be ready for those gifted Minnesota wide receivers in particular Tyler Johnston he's caught to twenty two pastors in five touchdowns\nAnd then a freshman Rashad Bateman a kid out of Georgia who Georgia offered after Minnesota offered but he he kept his commitment to the golden golfers this kid's a pure freshmen attract Minnesota\nAre better than Seventy percent of the ... are freshmen or Richard freshmen and they've been

you know I think we had a good bye week a productive by we think we've made progress and had a chance to rest some guys\nAre now you know this past week it was all about game prep and realized in the conference game were on the road or first road games we got a couple of things that we really have to be focused on and uh be another another good test for a football team to see see what kind of improvement we can make\n[noise] and hopefully a lot of improvement jumped just focus on Iowa was defensive front against Minnesota's offensive line because if they can get pressure on these

other enough if the rehash of those old great stories we had back in Cedar Rapids but as we were talking I mean it's been a while the Cuban in the state of Iowa yeah Seventeen\nYears I moved out was of course a on a W empty radio for a long time grew up in Manchester\nAttended the Luther College so uh never forget my roots that's for sure you as I say you can take the boy out of Iowa a but the I was going to stay in the boy so this was always my favorite week Rob is you know to get the ... and now gophers on the same field and I'll get to see you guys and and and watch uh watch what I Hope to be a pretty good football game today and I'm\nReally happy that it's not the last game of the regular season and November especially up here\nYeah especially now that the dome is no longer hair right 'cause that was at least a a comfort I Know to a lot of Iowa fans who would drive up they wouldn't be All right well we can at least be inside um earlier in the year is good it's a little chilly today but it's not like what it could be when when you get to November that's for sure\nNo doubt about that well this this year or two of the PJ flak erupt improvements Mike from year one tier two and then also what needs to continue to develop\nWell he is you know with with what he's about uh it it's all about recruiting everything he does as cater do recruiting and so you can see from year one year to\nA ... an increase in the level of talent on the roster now young talent and so you have to live with some mistakes the quarterback is a true freshman jak ... dead um had a pretty good start in the non conference and then on his first row start wasn't so good a plane or a higher level of competition and I think\nYou know even if you're a senior you know sometimes that can happen when when you're a freshman you're gonna have to live with some mistakes and so I still think that um you know the goal for team is a is a few years away from where they they want to\nBe I mean like I said you know obviously he wants to compete for the west division and get to Indianapolis and you know if if you're talking about that kind of stuff then you can be you know a national uh you know figure in the national chase maybe at some point not every year I don't think that's realistic but on occasion\nI'm white Kirk has done like Wisconsin and this west division where have you um you know if you're good in that year then you've got a chance to make some noise on a national level and I think like to let let's say today the golfers or seven point under dog they need some stuff to go their way or if they're going to pull the upset\nBut I think go for fans can at least see the talent levels upgraded he's got another good recruiting class already set to sign in December\nAnd then as that continues I think the goal will be hey when I ever comes to town if you play your game you can win it it's not quite there yet will it happen I don't know but I think there is some hope there you can say I mean\nYou'll watch the freshman today and you'll see and make a mistake or two but then you'll watch this were shot Bateman for example he'll make a catch day you'll say yeah that kid is going to be all big tent someday\nYou talk about the talent aware is most of it\nWell they knew they needed to get better on the offensive line and so they're red shirt and some guys that are that I think gives them ... you know in the Big Ten particularly and this division when you've got ... Wisconsin if you can't block you're not going to win and so\nUm they have some guys that there are the you know kind of bringing along there but the skill spots they need play makers um and and so they have gotten those unfortunately they're best play maker on defense got injured he's out for the season\nAntwon Winfield junior he was just a sophomore of course that named familiar for Vikings fans listening down in Iowa do recognize his dad was in one Winfield senior one of the great tackling quarterbacks ever\nUm and this kid was smart you could tell he was around the game I'm In three weeks of football this year he was Big Ten defensive player the week one week big tent special teams play or the week another\nUm as seal the game here against Fresno state which is unbelievable interception and now he's out a young guys out now younger people have to fill in for him but plain making I think ... that's one of the things when like goes out and watch as he wants to see guys at when\nA for sure when they're on off into the ball's in their hand they can they can make positive things happen\n[noise] we'll have more with like Grimm on the roundtable segment here on the pregame show more Hawkeye football from their field coming up\nYour game games ... barbeque large here and get mine kept going back ... barbeque or young company filing papers Mardi Gras Barney during world ...\n... it may not want to get done yeah\n... teamed up with a guy a bloody ax to give away a VIP experience for the Iowa versus Nebraska game on November twenty\nThird the baggage includes for tickets pre game feel access to watch warm ups and a Jew hundred dollar team shorter give guard registered chance to win an organized force dot com backslash Monica ... dot com backslash medical medical health plans was proud\nTo be a sponsor of the Iowa guys for over forty years we've been earning the trust of communities we served throughout the heart of America we'll see you at the game on November twenty third\nTailgate seasons people and that means today is Hawkeye football day\nOn your way to the game stuff hire local to fuel the dry and grabbed snacks for their own [noise]\nAnd if they get together and remembered it stuck on the court\nThen I just everything the whole nine yards\nHi enlightened highly thinning located in the heart and ... and beat 'em all location ... from the ...

both teams [noise] um you know we're looking for our first went in the west so that that's going to be important part of this Minnesota's undefeated at home this year so far so there's\nThere's a lot to play for both teams are three in one eye it's early enough in the season that uh the seasons have not yet been defined for either of us so this is this is critical Ed Ed's point about\nComing off the loss and then what do you do in a by week and a each time we have that by week you know cooking I sit down and I I listen to what their plan is you know you arrest them guys you you work on some things you you're right the coaches are grinding on\nA you know tweaking things making things better but I think the coaches feel very good about the way the players handled it from a maturity standpoint\nOr even though they did get a little time off when they were here and when they came back they were sharp and that the point is it this time just get a little bit better every week and we'll see if the if that paid off\nAnd I know you were a working harder than ever over the by week because uh basketball wrestling a lot of the indoor sports either have started or we'll be right around the corner\nAnd that's something I guess today is whether feels more like the winter sports like a brand and Lisa in Tom's teams and all of our winter sports are are underway swimming is is under way so I think we have a we have friends a media day on Monday so\nHere we go here we go and this is a time of year where the ball sports are still going ah you know big win for um for soccer
