lived in the neighborhood [noise] couldn't afford she would take a painting I she was something else from them\nAnd so she has one of the best collections of African American art for to Africa\nAnd it's all on display in the restaurant and it just\nTend to that she um she opened her doors to white people\nThat was totally against the law but\nThrough just the fact that she made everybody behave and all of that sort of thing and she had good relationships with the police have turned a blind eye to it and they actually\nShe yeah a mayor the mayor could come or the police chief could come and meet with people that he might Ajmi within the African American man today at\nThe the tape so that was actually a ... for political purposes to some of them\nThen it also became a place where you could that the planning\nShe was involved in all of this and was so wonderful about opening our doors [noise]\nBut the Nineteen sixties duty traces wasn't just changing the way people came together around a plate of food\nHe was also providing a space for people to come together looking to change America\nAnd I don't know how we did it but as I said my mother in law was kind kind person and you didn't have any African Americans armed police force that I'm they were all\nWhite but they would come around and she was they that they have a picture most sandwich so she would take the ... to ... they would call that bribery [laughter]\nBut she was just that cat and the person she liked to do things by your she liked to get him so she wouldn't do that maybe that helped us out because nobody ever buy that at [noise]\nWe had Jim Dumbo ski over Ben Smith to started but all kinds of things right in that restaurant and nobody ever by the way the once you get inside those doors\nNobody ever ever bought them through the police would never come in and bother with customers never so they felt safe to come there they could eat they can play and all the Freedom Riders that's where we plan they ...\nThey would come and visit ... gumbo fried chicken [noise] so I said we change the\nCourse of America over ... number ... ...\nThe primary purpose of a restaurant is to serve food but the obvious secondary purpose was to provide a place where people can come together and talk to each other faces the base do keep chases provided that space to people who were previously unable to and talking has something to be a chase still places a high value on today\nThat's what we're not doing it not all game come together I don't care if you're a Republican or what your come together talk and those those guys that was friends with those guys like Tip O'Neill and all those people they knew how to come together and talk and and\nYou would disagree a bit that's okay but you would talk and we come to a good thing and meat and so that's what we did the lead restaurant\nEven at Ninety bar leach is continues to work at her restaurant every single day it's over\nAnd also continues to open the doors to everyone in the New Orleans community and beyond\nAnd she's not binding and suddenly down anytime soon it's just not in her nature\nKeep trying to do a little bit every day every day you

you have to make a woman novel and that takes them doing it takes sacrifice\nMaybe you will have long thing in the hills maybe you have the hair but that child will be on the move\nAnd that's a trip to do we have to concentrate on educating and making these children under the than what it's all about sometimes into hard thing to make change it\nAnd that's what you have to tell young people today okay you can protest you can you put the past me an idea I\nCan make you are responsible for what your grandfather did that your grandfather I have to build on that I have to make changes I Can't stay there and they overlooked with they give them the liquid they'd do\nYou remember that but that makes you keep going on that you don't talk about it every day you move in you move to make a difference

O. three day weather forecast on channel Thirteen meteorologist ...\nDirty chew in Des Moines radars clear skies are clear it's thirty six degrees [noise]\nWe continue with our conversation with Brian holiday his book perennial seller and here's Ryan telling the story of how stumbling onto a band influenced the rest of his life and the rest of his career\nIn two thousand one I I Would have been maybe fourteen years old and\nI was trying to illegally downloaded Metallica song pirating site audio galaxy and I accidentally downloaded a song by the band I made and I I don't remember what metallic is on I was trying to download but\nThe one that I did get is etched in my memory it was a song called hallowed be thy name by iron maiden and I couldn't have known as a Thirteen year old and a fourteen year old at that seven minutes song\nI think it's about a condemned man last night on earth that this song would take me on this strange journey that I'd see the bad and many times over the next Seventeen years over many different presidents that that even contained within that so I Would be less than that I Would I Would help me make a living as a writer\nBut a few weeks ago I was in San Antonio and I saw iron maiden play a sold out show it would have been you know twenty thousand people in the audience and next to the same friends that I remember telling on instant messenger about this band that I just heard of\nAnd in front of us with this for a decade old heavy metal band from east London that since Nineteen Seventy five and produce sixteen studio albums you know it doesn't live album two dozen world tours\nLiterally thousands of concerts in sixty countries that sold close to a hundred million albums it hit number one five different times\nFifteen million social media followers two hundred and fifty million streams on Spotify which is more than prince or Madonna this is a band that hasn't been on the radio since well really ever\nAnd what iron maiden is what they inspired and me and why I think there are a lesson to most create is is that they are perennial in the sense that they have an audience\nThat they own that they perform exclusively for right so most bans are trying to put out a single to be on television to be on the radio to get new fans and an iron maintenance said their lead singer Bruce chickens and he said\nYou know we're like farmers we have our field and we're showing that field\nWe don't really care what's going on on these\nOther fields there's supposedly a story between the lead singer of iron maiden manager of iron maiden\nAn at an industry event and some young agent came up to them and said look I you know I admire he said this to iron man's manager he said I admire what you do it's just incredible or the success that you've had and and\nThe manager said to him you probably think that I'm In the music business and the guy said yeah of course and he said I'm not in the music business he said I'm In the iron maiden business\nAnd and what he meant is that he didn't care about trends are fads or whatever else is doing it didn't care about other acts even in there and that she only cared about this one band and about making something that's true for those fans and and something that that that they cared about and so as a writer I've always\nI've always taken a great lesson from that how how do you\nHow do you not care what's going on around you and only care what those true fans want and need and how do you make something special that goes to some core part of the the human experience for them and make it so good that they want to invite other people to join that exclusive\nSort of community or Coulter club with you and and so when I was trying to ride in perennial sellers sort of a recipe for how to do that you know how to how to develop that\nThing you know step funds which I Would say in an obviously he lived many years before I made and he he would say that the most valuable thing\nFor an artist to achieve is a faithful following a reliable group of readers who looked forward to every book and bought it who trusted me and who's trust I must not disappoint\nAnd I think that's wonderful advice whether you're you know a Baker or a mechanic or a best selling author or a multi platinum musician is how do you achieve that following and and build that platform that that's that's what the book is ultimately about\nAnd here's Ryan on the relationship between creative artist\nIn marketing I talked to many creative and writers and entrepreneurs and I I tend to find that they follow a an arc\nWhere they they throw themselves into making whatever it is that they're making and it takes everything they have and they get there they limp across the finish line and I think they're done\nAnd sadly that's not true\nI liken creativity to be in a marathon\nThat you finish and when you walk across the finish line instead of someone grabbing you buy their shoulders and put in a metal around her neck\nThey they grab you by the hand and pull you to the starting line of a next marathon\nWhere you have to run again in that second marathon is is marketing how did you get attention for that
