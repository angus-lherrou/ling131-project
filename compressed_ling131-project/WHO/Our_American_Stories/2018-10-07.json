parking doesn't seem like a necessary component of automated driving but it could very well may parking general a lot easier in a utopian or dystopian depending on your opinions each year where cars drive themselves and Mercedes ... developed a way to do that\nI'm so they're saying and I quote again their their release um if if you're having trouble parking [laughter] they said they get it the ... feel your pain\nNow because my in tournaments car it's not going to be part because when it's parked it's not making me money or so while I'm In by shopping or something like that it's going to be available\nSo here's the thing what they're saying is basically the idea is you don't have to ever park your car right and you don't have to trust someone else to do it right you just have to let your car and I quote do its own thing\nI'm kinda scared about that now I'm like OK all the way it works you need to park your car to designate a drop off area uh-huh venue use a smartphone app to send the car off to a park itself\nNow the parking lot or has decked out with all sort of intelligent infrastructure they'll be able to register any vehicle in the area to monitor everything so it's not like sending it off or to do battle or anything\nSo can we really like the Batman scene where he liked calls for the car and then like the car stopped that's about the point where we're going to get you
