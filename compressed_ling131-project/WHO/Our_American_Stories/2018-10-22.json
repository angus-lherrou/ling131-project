{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WHO", "content": "Of their decides that they're going to give up their combustion engine car and go for electricity you're going to see a direct impact and proceeds now so when you're talking about taxation I have to pay devil's advocate and I got two hands up so I wouldn't know jak because he's wearing a hat [laughter]\nNo I'm not I'm not I'm I'm okay here's my question mhm\nWe talk we talked about electric cars yep I asked a question about who's going to see who's going to pay be declining revenue from registration because there will be according to everybody else less vehicles on the road\nMy last year or two of them hold on\nTo pay the electric tax and quite honestly yes things of all I understand that but this time compared to a hundred years ago when the auto industry put ... the horses I quote out of business right\nYou've got the same thing going on here except the number this time is going to be more expert in trouble because of all the other industries that are tied to the auto industry now ... last stages repair shops that kind of stuff\nRight go ahead Kate yeah so many things [laughter] let let's start with one and so little time yes number one electric vehicles will not necessarily reduce the number that's a ... vehicles and that's another conversation because they're not mutually inclusive\nThey may not be mutually inclusive\nBut you can't tell me at some point again like Sasha says the Chinese thinking decades out that somebody here thinking decades out being me going okay at some point maybe in my lifetime we're gonna have a situation where\nI'm afraid that as a combustible engine guy anyway\nThat all the sudden we started getting less vehicles my ability to register my vehicle is going to start exponentially going Hi\nOkay but you miss the point going electric is not going autonomy economists vehicles will reduce the number of vehicles going electric you can still own an electric vehicle like people do today by Tesla and still drive it still have to register it let's be clear number one what your health for\nThe impact of all those pollutants we've been putting in the air what's your health for I Know that there are other benefits that the uh that this offsets also you're still going to have bodies shops they ain't going away\nEven ... get an accident it happens\nAgain electric car versus a ton of his car the bigger issue is autonomy and that's not the point of this conversation right now we're just talking about a proportion system the larger issue is you're going to have in place of gas stations you're going to have charging station we're seeing that growth in our own\nCommunity right okay so the taxation on the electric cars can where do you fall with\nThat specific I don't like how they're approaching it\nAh basically let's give you an example K uh Mississippi\nThey are they're putting a flat tax it started October first Seventy five dollars for hybrid a hundred and fifty or for a total electric to if you're a hundred percent electric hundred and fifty this is on top of your regular taxis that you're paying registration to renew oh wow yeah\nOkay we're yes we're going to charge me a hundred dollars if\nYou're driving a pure electric in the state of Mississippi in addition to your tax bees in addition to your insurance in addition you will pay another hundred and fifty dollars now they said it's going this revenues go into the state highway find infrastructure department transportation\nOkay hold it [noise] I Am I Am an island I go to Mississippi I have an electric car ... am I going to be subject to part of that\nTown you don't register to be able to church if you moved to Mississippi enrich your car there yes\nOkay dry out there now\nIf I'm a resident of Mississippi I'm getting I'm getting I'm ordering up because that is discrimination\nAh but here's my thing and I okay I'm going to play devil's advocate but before you do that there's another point I Need to make yeah OK on the ... on a similar thing as a federal level they want to kill the EV tax credit completely\nRight now it phases out when an auto makers sells two hundred thousand or more\nIt goes to zero Iran mosque is on that verge so we'll see how he does when they don't have the federal tax credit right now there's a a senator from his state who remain nameless but are also producers coal and gas and it's not Texas\nA that wants to eliminate it completely I think that stupid to I mean there are ways to do this but I don't think that going after individual owners is the way to do it I think you can do it a with\nA novel things I've heard like parking fees other things there's other ways to work this in but you shouldn't penalize you shouldn't be working to encourage folk uh because of the fact that there are health benefits less a heart ... or less heavy chemicals a whole lot of other benefits\nThat this thing off says well with that we've

restoration classes scanning your photo collection and a lot more to know if we can help Alexander's photo valley jumps in West Des Moines and on the Web where the hell was talking to the store\n\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news traffic and severe weather station news radio ten forty\nAt talking about fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson well he's now saying indicated he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore\nOr he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria ... that Glenn Simpson is unreal legal jeopardy in all of this you also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia probe in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nThat was a great piece by Jonathan Turley ... three reasons mother may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker no saying the FBI failed to provide a\nFederal surveillance court with important evidence well we do that now for a long time and we know that\nFor Pfizer court judges\nHanded information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lives that was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through ... from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele a foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the CIA\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the Pfizer judges that it was Hillary Clinton the paid for this information and it's unbelievable\nIt could be happening in this country but it looks like we are finally beginning to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so Jason shape it's is with us\nFormer congressman now on Fox News contributor author of the New York times best seller the deep state we have Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova of the gentleman ... with us ah thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your will house and it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request as\nThey seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issue a subpoena when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or committee I can issue a subpoena but the only way to earn for that is through the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the OJ won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\n... the name that people need to also familiarize themselves with is mark Elias market why it was ... he was ... for the DNC he was careful for Hillary Clinton he was counsel for a ... group he was involved there\nThis this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name along with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that was\nGoing to plead the fifth and it can get away with that make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can just threaten to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think is important\nThey should make him show up and in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth\nIt's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope they send you were talking to your former friends and telling them to get them to uh get hit in to the Congress to take this ad and I don't care if they're not ...\nI'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got a subpoena you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later\nYou don't say oh mine he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think about scene and you said Pina and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it they say that I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... the gang of eight information the three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying oh I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get some subpoenas but let me just say this 'cause this is really important all the names that you heard Michael ... Mr liar\nAnd said or all those people they are key to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom which we that Congress has an important issue a subpoena score\nWe now know that the FBI or am I fix\nAnd that you see a cue to conduct electronic surveillance of American city citizens on foreign soil without legal authority to do so\nAnd that information what fact conversations George Papadopoulos\nWere intercepted and in the course of intercepting those compensation they found out that off the top of it was not interested in Hillary's emails or anything else and they never gave information to the by the court\nYou know it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testifying that in the the nine months of the investigation\nLeading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end if there was something there there's no there are there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media elite strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid ... that dossier information has leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion\nBut they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be good begin I\nIs there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right the people that were in that meeting and river the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after\nA district Colombia's relieved of his duties but just before a Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being the most candid about what was going on there but\nEach of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition uh transcribe under oath or before Congress you don't have these five minute little ... you know after you have questions\nWhen you do this and I've been in these things go for an hour for the Republican than the Democrats get time than another hour for Republicans and you can really get in depth information if they would do it that way\nWell Victoria I think that's true and that's right and that's just not fair but\nThe obstruction continually I Will take a break we'll come back more with Jason Chaffetz and Joe diGenova also but Dorian ... with us\nI Want to remind you our friends at my pillow they have done it again call their
