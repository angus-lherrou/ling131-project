something surprising happened\nI was pregnant again and I thought how am I going to go through this pregnancy I now work at now let me down to sleep and every every possible thing that can go wrong in a pregnancy\nBut here I was pregnant and I knew I needed to embrace that and just try to be as courageous as possible and walk through this pregnancy I was so sure that things\nWere going well then you're going to have a girl and with my uh cheerleading gymnastic background I decided\nTo look at how how young are how old is she has to be to be in cheerleading gymnastic and I was looking that up and it was Eighteen months that I thought that so far away but um you know I went in for the sixty make ultra sound and I told my husband if the baby is healthy\nThen it's a miracle and I said but if this baby is a boy at the bigger miracle\nBut I still uh sure that this is a girl this is going to be our miracle so we went in for the ultrasound\nAnd the doctor checked everything out\nAnd she said your baby is a hundred percent healthy I don't see any reason for any\nUm any other pets\nShe said do you want to know the gender of the baby and we said yes and fully expecting it to be a girl\nIt popped up on the screen and it said it's a boy boy that are you sure it's a boy and um I was so happy to have you with healthy I didn't didn't matter if the baby was a boy or girl but then to learn that we were having a boy when we were told that we probably could have a healthy boy I was just\nSo amazing such a miracle we're praising God so thankful so then\nWe that whole day and for a while we were so excited but then more feared wash over me because like I said before\nI knew everything that could go wrong in a pregnancy and I've met at that point countless\nParents who was having a healthy baby and then their heart the babies' heart stops at forty weeks are um there's a there is um you know just different issues that happened within delivery and so you know we just I just try to focus on the positive and Ninety eight percent of the time I was fine but I Would\nLying if I didn't say it wasn't a little worried and each week I I Would feel like he wasn't moving and so I Would go to the doctor and do the stress tests and um I didn't care what they thought of me if they thought I was nuts for coming in all the time well on August twentieth\nOf twenty twelve my water broke in the middle of the night and we went to\nThe hospital\nAnd as you know we waited um you know as I was laboring are babies' heart was\nGoing up and down frequently and he went McKown IOM and I'm like I wasn't violating it as rapidly as I should have been and so I asked the doctor after being there it was probably about\nFourteen hours after my water had broken and they said are we going to have to do a C. section and she said in a couple of hours if something doesn't change yeah we're going to have to do that but because of your situation\nUh we you know we can go ahead and do the C section if you really want that the last thing I wanted to do was make a decision I didn't want to make a decision on\nSomething and then for it to go wrong and then to scratch that decision and so when the the doctor left my husband and I started talking and it probably wasn't even a minute or two that passed and she came rushing in and said your baby just made the decision because his heart rate had dropped\nSo low uh they rushed me and to have a C. section and emergency C section and I remember telling my husband and I want video no matter what happens so just roll the camera\nJust I I Need video and no matter what happens please just get the video so when they get to see ... I was still conscious at that point\nAnd uh they they brought him out and he wasn't crying right away which we expected um and then I heard the most beautiful valid or baby cried\nAnd I have that on video\nAnd I have me crying and my husband crying and it was\nThe most wonderful moment that you could ever imagine after everything we've been through this over five years on this journey and to finally have a healthy baby but\nYou know I delivered him and he cried and then I was able to hold him\nAnd then we were able to bring him home and\nHe's he's named after my husband's always Robert David here's junior and we call them RJ and he's five and now I mean he was just a light of my life [noise]\nAnd he knows his big brother's David Ethan she talks about them and and we've been very

recently asked me why\nWhy they didn't even want to stay healthy and I said honey I I don't know why and I don't ask why any more I resolved not ask why any more because I Know that\nI'll I'll never have the answer until I meet them again you can tell I Am in heaven with them all know why and\nEverything will make sense that's our that's our story and it's it's not over\nPeople ask\nMe questions and I don't know exactly how it's asked but this this option that everything better because now we have our Jay and yes I I think\nPartly it's better because when my husband and I we're dreaming the loss of our babies\nBefore we had RJ we're also grieving the fact that we may never raise children of her own and at least that part has been answered for us and we've chosen not to have any more children we just\nGet attended birthday parties and family dinners but I could see that he was beginning to grasp the change that we were about to undergo\nGiven time will be your aunt and uncle

I'm In Missouri curious too but they don't normally ask why and especially about things that the kennel to directly see\nUm [noise] so I was always a very curious person a and at one point they just became very curious about curiosity itself\nSo you know I decided to spend more than four years are studying you know what research is being done in psychology and neuroscience about curiosity I spoke with many researchers in the field the visited some labs and so on and um that's the result is this book\nAre we naturally curious or is it something we develop is there a curiosity gene he's won\n[laughter] yes so we are naturally curious in the sense that studies show that I'm forty to fifty percent of uh these trait of curiosity as with many other psychological traits are genetic\nNamely if your parents were very curious her grandparents were very curious chances are you'll also be very curious person so so some part of these genetic but of course\nThere there is there are other parts that are um you know just environmental and depending on your particular circumstances I mean it depends on\nYour parents who and how they they talk to you your teachers or maybe the church you go to um things of that nature of the environment in which we leave I mean does that allow you the luxury of being curious about certain things and not about others and so on\nFor curiosity has done a lot for human kind I mean you posit that it's kept us alive in many respects and if if if anything it's expanded our life expectancies and so many other things\nFrom the creation of fire which I think is you know we can take it all the way back there that was curiosity itself wasn't at the unseen and the next thing you know\nWe're creating this thing out of nothing\n... right so so curiosity and indeed the rise of course all scientific research it drives the process of education it plays a role you know in books we ride films we see an even simple conversations I mean you don't want to have a conversation\nWith somebody unless you're somewhat curious about what they have to say\nI'm and indeed goes back all the way to the pre humans and the very early humans\nWho had to be curious about you know what does fire do you know how can I use that I Would do to do and and things of that nature that expended both the diets of the early humans and uh you know the fact that they could start to do all kinds of other things that they couldn't before\nLet's talk about the two dimensions of curiosity that you're talking about in your book and one of them has to do with let's just say the senses and the other with the intellect I'm Talking about those two things\n[noise] so are there are various types of curiosity so one curiosities for example ... it was being dumped perceptual curiosity\nThat curiosity Wi Fi when something surprises us or when something that we've seen doesn't quite agree with what we know or at least think we know I'm a you know think for example you know of\nUh some children in some remote village uh in in South America seeing a white person for the very first time thinks of that type of things that really surprise you\nThen there is a ... curiosity it'd be standing curiosity is the love of knowledge what drives us to learn things it's a pleasure you know or anticipation of pleasure that coming from New knowledge\nAnd that's uniquely as you as we said before that is just uniquely human\nThat's right that's a that's a characteristic that these uniquely human\nLet's talk about some people are not talking about some curious people and to the new feature well let's talk about one first Leonardo da Vinci\nYes so Leonardo has been called up by a\nA Kenneth Clark of the art critic the most relate list curious mind in history and indeed you know here is the person you know of course we know him from his works of art the Mona Lisa and all that but he was really curious about everything I mean he has\nYou know he has left us with some seven thousand pages of notes and probably there were maybe maybe double that when he lived\nAnd in in those these studies everything from the flow of water to the flight the birds to how do you paint to uh how long is the time of the ...
