there'll be family ventures and\nOne thing that struck me\nLearning about all the cameras disease was\nThere were many gaps that we're\nSlowing down the pace of innovation and the rate of discovery\nThe impediment to allowing\nInvestors to gain confidence and opportunities or many of the largest companies in the form of space looking at neurodegenerative diseases\nHad been a becoming more reluctant to double down on investments they were watching many failures in the space as a drugs proceeded into the clinic and undergoing human clinical trials with with negative results\nAnd so I'm really are\nAre initiatives are all in service to fill a photo with drugs in the pipeline being able to better characterized identify patients and a really give\nAlternative uh innovative ideas or an opportunity to be tested\nMy father was raped or be American and fatter\nOr when he was in his late seventies he received a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and we quickly became aware that there wasn't a disease modifying drug available\nTo him or to anybody\nWe knew we wanted a spring into action\nAnd the way we knew how to sort of follow in his footsteps of investing in innovation and identifying or people that were taking risk in the space and\nWorking on important and challenging problems uh I really try to understand what's the right set of questions to ask each step along the way what is our theory of causality disease Alzheimer's disease is composed of\nA number of different factors which contribute to each individual's\nResilience as well as their vulnerability to\nBe affected by a bad actors that are either\nNative to our systems with mutation or uh\nInfections that come about or really the cascading effects of other environmental factors or factors of aging\nIt's only been in the left or perhaps thirty or forty years that we've started to fully accepted ... federal court of aging and that it's something we believe we can reverse\nThat the way to address this understand\nWhat stage of progression is it still possible to interrupt these processes that\nIdeally also reverse this\nIt is impossible for just one group to have all the funds that they need\nAnd the discovery of the prevention and care of this disease [noise]\nThis is a project the whole world had to gather together in order to find answers\nThe finger study which is the finished geriatric

aim is to prevent cognitive impairment\nAnd secondary aims include decreasing disability cardiovascular risk factors and related morbidities depressive symptoms and to have beneficial effects on the quality of life\nHere's the lead researcher me I can tell too\nI Would say if I went to a person thought that the trial I ... I met dean so for me to\nBe known ways kind of interesting to what we eat the bench and says while I was really like the fall ... action so I felt that now it's time to initiate something new\nSo I think the joke that group and we said Bonnie on started feeding a trial that was ten years ago I have actually a bike rack Missouri\nAnd we'll put out and my when I was young I was in the nature she was leaving the state house where I was leaving at that time it too badly long time before she got the day I don't see so I still can't read that but if you really cute she was very close to ... when she was you know\nChange the behavior he was trying to hide things she caught the late ... and kind of personality so that personal experience has helped me at just that\nHow much outside that can be for you and how we fought that they need to try to find each\nYear multi center randomized controlled trial but the one thousand two hundred sixty participants age sixty to Seventy years recruited from previous studies participants were randomized into either the multi domain intervention group or the control group\nOr the individual if two years I really felt had been very encouraging there have been\nA very bad neat Nick got the trial but the early ... had been using the debate that that shit that's nice that they have the nanny focusing only on one end to that intervention all one race factor for example the physical activity so they have said that he ...\nHe had the stress in the nation so here that intervention go pet twenty five percent highly open a finite weekend also see that even every so often they the the function of decline if lower in the intervention go\nBill Russell is in my mind the greatest team leader in sports history and what that team accomplished I've never seen anything like that I mean they want to eleven\nNBA championships and Thirteen paid people forget that we talk about the the bowls Michael Jordan and the warriors today and Brian change you know but what we don't see is that incredible consistency\nThe whole notion of a team that has won\nTen NBA titles and yet still hungry to win an eleven kind of incredible and they pulled it off year after year and now again that street began ended with Bill Russell started\nHis rookie season when they won their FIRST Championship and the Celtics that never want a title before ever and the year he retired last half championship to the streets and the the following season they\nThey didn't even make it to five hundred and make the playoffs as many more years for them to return to glory so this was completely brackets by bill Russell and I want to make the point very clearly that I'm not saying that all you need is a great captain to have a great team I mean you need a lot of things a lot of things have to work but\nTo me the captain is really like the urban ... and now\nIn the punctuation all these other things that might be more interesting and more memorable without the verb it's not a sense it doesn't work together and that's kind of a role these captains play it and bring them together and Russell was such a great example because Russell was\nAbsolutely on the court completely strange he was a big man did not score which was very unusual for the day and\nYou know back then defenders were supposed to leave the you know but she would fly to the air and block shots and he played this ferocious strand of defense was completely relentless and no one ever seen anything like that and his numbers were were not startling so people didn't understand and\nYou know off the court to he was strange I mean he didn't care about endorsement she didn't sign autographs she was very perfectly with the press and and didn't really seem to care much about the fans are being a role model or anything that we associate with\nWith leadership [noise] you know in fact he he turned down the hall of fame you know when he was conducting they just didn't want any part of it [noise] people thought he was the oddball but really what they didn't understand it was that\nHe cared about was the collective accomplishment of chain and all that for everything went inside that team and inside of the team to team is loved him\nYou know and everything about and they understood him completely and they would do anything for him and on the court you know he understood that you know what the team didn't need someone pouring in\nA basket and getting the highlight reel and he's someone who do all the glamorous grunt work every dirty job to be done in order to help the same way and then that was his role so\nHe is just the epitome of great leadership and he was on misunderstood in time and you know I think only today we're really starting to understand the full dimensions of what he brought that team\nAnd anyone who was around during the day knows bill Russell was by the way he played at the University of San Francisco to college as well\nMore of the captain ... is our American

here in the morning cloudy and sixty nine degrees [laughter] [noise]\nThis is our American stories and we continue our conversation with Sam Walker author of the casting question for anybody out there who's listening leading anything anyone who's a sports\nFan but even if you're not what a great discussion we were just talking about Tim Duncan probably the highest paid person to ever written in academic psychology paper because in college Sam he co authored one title\nBlowhard snobs ... interpersonal reactions to excessive ego to some in the opening paragraph is the line quote simply put we don't like you go to ... people\nSo we've been as an undergrad Tim Duncan got it\nIt just shows you the level of intelligence an emotional intelligence that the great leaders ... and I don't know I think I think that my sense with Duncan I've ever spoken to him about this I Know he's very proud of the paper but I think that really was who he was and that that research that he did really explain to him\nThat he was as a leader he went to look like a leader that you would you would pick out of a crowd I mean to me it's always said if you walked into practice you'd never imagine that he was a leader of the team because he didn't\nJoin the loudest voice or um he wasn't a huge presence of a charismatic person who bark orders enjoy anything we use is supposed to do\nWhat I found in my book you know what I Hope his aspiring in it to people is that\nYou know you may not think that you have readership characteristic she may think that there are things that you just start good at but really the truth is that all of the things that these leaders did were really about behavior and the choices that they made and the team context every day\nAnd behavior can be modeled the leadership can be\nCan be improved choices will be better and when you start to understand what leadership really involved and you start to separate out the ... then you can see why someone like Tim Duncan may not be the guy on posters and every kid's bedroom but he is by far the winningest and most effective leader the generation\nYou know his coach once said that Duncan didn't have an ounce of MTV in him even agreed to be paid less than market value why did he do that what was he thinking on his agent must have went to me what are you talking about you want the maximum so I can get the maximum commission what are you doing\nYou know Tom Brady to the same thing with the patriots than you would restructure his contract every year so that they can have more salary cap room to sign of the players I mean it's that's what you do he's made more money I'm sure that he ever imagined it would make your life and as mostly players haven't\nIt's not an application and he cared about the team\nAnd the teams result that's where all his satisfaction came from etiquette much more than his satisfaction from adding more money in the bank or having you know yet another super car garage and that didn't matter and she's an incredible person and you know I have so much respect for him and I\nI Do think that there's a lot of appreciation for him but he is often left out of the conversation on people talk about the greatest players of all time and\nJust don't understand it I don't understand the hall of fame mentality where you know we separate out an individual from his teammates and say this person deserves special praise I don't understand any\nThink they knew that that their whatever they are accomplishments world depend on the other people that you can't really divided team and two it's important parts\nLess important parts which are they all one unit\nIndeed I Want to quote from the book because it's such a good quote and it's something we all know inexperience in any workplace quote one of the great paradoxes of management is it the people who pursue leadership positions most ardent Lee or off in the wrong people for the job\nYou then cited a study of superstar CEOs now as they lifted themselves up they often lower others in the process Tim Duncan in so many members of your captain class they did the exact opposite talk about that\n[noise] well my favorite example of this is a woman named Carla over back and I doubt that you immediately remember that name\nShe was the captain of that great Nineteen Ninety nine us women's soccer team that won the world cup and\nYou know really dominated sport for about five six years I just wanted the best soccer teams of all time and you remember mia Hamm and Julie fatality and Brandi Chastain all the big stars of that team but\nThere's a reason you don't know Carla over back in because she did not care she did not want you know who she was she had no interest in the spotlight whatsoever any personal accolades and she was not the best player on the team she was a central defender and\nShe never did any flashy she never scored she you know would would pass the ball off the minute she got it to one of his teammates and she you know she just played with this relentless pace but\nWhat was amazing about her I think she understood what leadership is really about and it's really about service\nShe was incredible what the because she did things I'd never seen before when this team would go on a long road trip to Japan or Norway they would get to their hotel they be exhausted and they'd get a knock on the door and they open it up and it was Carl over back who was carrying their bags", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Our American Stories", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "10"}
