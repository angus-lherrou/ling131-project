was in the hands of the Brookings Institution and he turned to double the needs of the week on the team in place that can go in and get those documents but that's true for that then I later realized that was a time when I should have stopped and said wait a minute Mr President\nLike about the consequences of this but I did not\nSelf righteousness is believing it was so good that you couldn't be compromised\nAnd that's going abroad it's fatal and was in my life because I was so sure myself when I didn't realize how vulnerable I was as every human being is\nWhat a confession and anybody who's

guy just couldn't walk away\nAnd he could of he could've just accepted a plea bargain in a void in jail time and which one of us wouldn't do that can you imagine coming back to your wife and say look on the I Know I get out of this but I really got to do some time because you see my walk with God requires it\nWhat are you actually done by the way\nWas obstructing the Daniel Ellsberg investigation by leaking information from his FBI file he would now it's been seven months in prison time in a place that gave Chuck a perspective on life that he couldn't find over the forty years he was a free man\nAnd yet the most amazing thing in that prison I've seen things matter at my heart ache for them because they're relying on their bunks during the nothing there's nothing to do and their bodies after thing on their souls Karolyi\nJust a slow death is a horrible thing about doing time as we might say but I grew to love those guys I was reading the Bible study and that'll passage in Hebrew switched to God became loading the angels for a period of time that he would not be ashamed to call us his brothers\nI looked around all these guys drug dealers and murderers and bank robbers and all kinds of people and I thought to myself I Know better than they are\nI really got to love one we've got a little Bible study and I was seven of us through history convicted dope the ... ... ... the ... a month when a hundred\nAnd four on the special counsel to president steak and we'd be on our knees praying and I really had a great relationship I discovered in prison\nAway from all that power the trappings of power away from all the distractions in our culture when you come face to face with yourself\nBut you find out which alludes you to life when you were seeking all the things with the world\nBut a powerful testimony and you know we were doing Johnny Cash his life we found the same thing out\nOf the cash didn't see himself as being better than those guys he was singing to him to prison and I think bono had the greatest words you could ever said or man when he was there to you a judge Johnny Cash you said Johnny Cash doesn't sing to the damn teach things with them\n\nSo close and served his time and then he decided to serve is calling calling that he found while serving his time\nAnd the question comes why do I go into a person's\nAnd he left me that I've been asked that for the last thirty three years since I started going and I said why are you going into prisons somebody wanted me to work with a known most of the politicians knew a lot of the world leaders and politics and so people suddenly why don't you work in the ministry among among the leaders of\nGovernments I said because gods coping with the president's why because they're not collect it and why do I care about that\nBecause I firmly believe those the ... the first question you ask about where we come from\nThat we were created by God in his image the Margot date you the image of God is in every single human being regardless of color state of us last stage of his life\nDegree of dependency regardless of his country of origin the image of God is in every single person and so I go into those prisons to this day\nLoving those men because they're a God's image bears\nIndeed\nCosts inform the prison fellowship ministry and started an in depth look at how both conservatives and liberals look at incarceration and then of course what the Bible says about at all\nTo Christ changed the person who was\nThen we got it on one of our prisons where he worked for another year and now he's out of prison pastor of the Hispanic church in Houston bringing in ten or twelve ex offenders out of the prisons every month into his church\nThat's hard to argue\nWhen you've seen that over and over and over again that's ... evidence that something does happen to those persons to convert them from one lifestyle to another and to live a different way and it is the only answer we found that crime\nIt is the only answer so far by the way it just drives I think many government leftist types crazy\nAnd not all but I think the bureaucrats particularly because this is a really private solution and the spiritual solution to something government just can't fix\nNow let's look at the big picture what kind of scale we're actually talking about here\nToday that runs ten prisons in America as Christian presence as models\nGetting a phenomenal recidivism rate phenomenal success we have fifty thousand volunteers around America and the ministry of spread to a hundred and Thirteen countries of the world every Christmas we deliver gifts to children\nWhose parents who are imprisoned\nFive hundred thousand kids a year we've been doing this since Nineteen eighty two incredible things up none of which I planned you got to believe me I'm a pretty good strategist I knew a lot of plans like I didn't plan on this I thought okay God if\nYou want to take my news here in the prisons you take me a news me in the prisons and he did far more with my life my broken us and I don't know I Wish those that might have been able to do with my life out on my own power and influence an ability\nHe didn't plan it and he said I'm a heck of a strategist but I could've never plan this and that is so true and it's so true in so many of our lives\nChuck it inspired others to serve their calling joining in his ministry again fifty thousand volunteers that's just crazy let's\nHear from one person who's calling Christ working through Chuck it inspired a billionaire we spoke with earlier this week name be wings you use junior guy was trying to give back to our country by wading into the world of politics\nUntil one day everything was changed because he met Chuck\nI've met Chuck costs and along the way and I like to say that you know Chuck vaccinated me when I was looking a because he\nProbably outside of my dad is the is the one person that it made the biggest impact and in my life um and the Chuck basically told me or something that I'll never forget it should look into\nPolitics is nothing but a reflection of culture\nIf you don't like the politics look at the culture if you want to make a difference you're not going to make it in politics you are going to make it fighting into the culture wars and at that point I was looking for a a\nSignificance in my life I'd I'd I'd made or the money I I was looking to go in and help my country I mean anybody can see the war in a world of hurt and uh things only gotten worse since then [noise]\nUm but I uh I saw what Chuck was doing and then I realized that what I was looking for was not going to be found in the mirror that was going to be focusing my gaze on the other\nAnd we talked to be weighing use junior and you can go to our website at our American network dot org no ... junior had\nNever been in prison but he was well he was addicted to something else and it was work and his pride had put his work before his family he lost his wife in the last things that were precious them and that's what led him to the lord and then ultimately to Charleston so go figure\nSo here's this billionaire dedicating resources in time\nTo doing the same thing in the same kind of work charcoal and does in fact we talked to one of those prisoners the other night David ray it was a part of that program inspired by truck Olson and David had killed a person\nWhen he was Seventeen or Eighteen years old and we talked to talk to them frankly last night read all kinds of things and I got to tell you it was breathtaking in the ... here listening was I

finger some of his\nClosest associates and execute them he continued working in Philly he felt that he had to get out or they were getting close to him\nAnd that was at that point on Easter Sunday in
