[laughter] so the uh\nThe people who will get interested in it just two years later yeah or the people who are really angry about the way it turned out two years ago okay and this time around that immigrants four years ago it was a Republican\nWhen one more question before we leave ... one of the ... most interesting things that you wrote about the China us negotiation is something that I mean is is completely unique I haven't seen it anywhere else but it makes total sense\nYou said one of the biggest concerns is what happens from a social construct with China\nIf they continue to push or if they pushing the wrong ways as ... as negotiations continue um you know especially as it relates to any sort of pressure\nThat China would bring to bear on foreign businesses doing business in China ... remind listeners what you were talking about because this is so important and when they share it with people you see the light bulb go on and it's just like of course that I mean they do not want to risk is what is the social risk\nThat China faces that the U.S does not as we continue to move through these trade negotiations\nThe problem is with a couple of different dimensions all working together against China one is that the modern China or the China not subsistence farms in rural poverty but of glittering cities are full of\nWorking class people it's never experienced a recession so it's ... we do not know how the Chinese population will react under\nAnything but full employment of the highest unemployment rate to try and experience the last twenty five years for point three percent in this country we consider for three percent\nA boom you know they they call that things are going so well but what would happen if they got six percent or seven percent you know now you would ... and this is across the very very large population so he's percentage point represents many more millions of people that it does here [noise]\nUh it China is a police state where a you've got to you know disarmed sheep like public being monitored at every street corner by cameras are official thicken recognition software [noise] so\nThe problem with all police states is the problem of leverage is often actual originally with a\nRather says it's political leverage by which I mean in any prison police environment\nYou've got hundreds and hundreds of people\nThat wanna guard yeah that one guard has one guy and that one guy has twelve cartridges and one of the ... and that's it\nAnd so if something goes terribly terribly wrong\nUh you got what happened to the Soviet Union in Nineteen eighty nine where a couple of people swarmed over the Berlin Wall of for some reason the atmosphere research that they made the decision about the machine gunned them and then the next twenty five people ran across the wall and then six weeks later\nThe evil empire of the Soviet Union had broken up into that you can separate countries right six weeks later and nobody that all the great the good the wives of Henry Kissinger is of the world predicted anything like that and\nIt just happened to six weeks and so what could happen in a nation of one point four billion people where you've got you know half of them on minimum wage living in cities have I'm Still a subsistence farmers\nAre there enough right believes that is president Xi Jinping's nightmare that's where the pressure that's\nThat was not Alaskan he's the chief investment officer at trend ... great friend of mine great bend of investing sense but go listen to the much longer conversation there at investing sense dot com\nAnd while you're at investing sense dot com you'll also find the Andes conversation with GT Taylor about what to watch for in the upcoming midterm elections in how it might impact your belief that wraps up this week show for Andy Smith I'm Bob Richards thanks so much for listening we hope you'll have a great rest of your\nInvesting senses brought to you by financial engines and advisory centers throughout the United states including your local advisor center the financial engines advisory centers provide investment advisory services to the clients use in research and announces perform\nAnd the worm brothers cartoon me by at me actually worked\nAnd the discussion was didn't actually work and the people who bought the topic or by league coyote thank you very much right didn't know how to use it properly and daffy duck\nBut I meant by anybody in the Martian well but mainly yes Wylie coyote meet me I'm telling you [laughter]\nAnd ladies and gentlemen I'm like I said this show has reached new oh wait a minute\nWait wait a minute wouldn't you agree we talk about if it moves we covered the ... Dr ... really kinetic but that road runner\nI road runner wow road runner I'm just saying road runner were all about freedom on the road so maybe you asked me was actually a in favor of up the road runners freedom\nAnd I gave him the defective stuff so wouldn't work there's no love for\nAnimals moving on to the ...\nNo love for act me I got some love for acme I mean I think that they gave me hours upon hours of young stimulation and laughter and entertainment for products that don't work\n[noise] and again let's go to the park [laughter]\nMan has no love ...

I suspect that numbers higher because there's a number of people who've actually filed a complaint taking pictures post them on line of the actual failure of\nThat bracket yeah I mean social media on this one really really erupted and it was surprising to me the amount of forums\nOn this particular subject that had to ... months months before they actually really now what they're talking about specifically in this particular case is a a point a to frame what they call the track bar\nAnd attract bar is what keeps the axle in place mhm so in other words when that well breaks when you're turning the wheel you're literally turning the actual yup and you've done yeah wow yeah yeah so it's it's an issue\nUm now nobody's died yet now when I go in and from this thing this one of these things where the companies actually er and we've talked about this before with a stop sale ...\nCompanies should stop stealing this vehicle in other words they can't sell them to make sure the problems fixed yup\nOkay and again anyone who's driving a twenty Eighteen twenty Nineteen jeep wrangler Jay el now what is the jail the Jay el as a model of the wrangler\nOkay um my father and you

this is one of those where you know you pull it over you contact your dealership and they get it again it does yeah who not drive and this is one of those things that I'm sure if you've got something with the two thousand eighty two thousand nineteenth this is one of those reasons why you get the app for your vehicle\nBecause you're asked after you put in all that information the minute that something goes out that even as a safety concern they're going to let you know\nYour informational dash on your wrangler we'll let you know when you actually turn it on if there is something like ... with this particular item if there's a recall now is that is that a Chrysler\nApp or is that a government after you can load the Chrysler app okay I did not know that yeah they've got they've got one
