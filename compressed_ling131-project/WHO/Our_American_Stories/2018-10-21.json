the picture that we've got here okay yeah I'm a trick it out\nYeah it almost looks like and what do you call it like a forklift basically in a way um because it's right there in front and then they have it set down so much so that way it doesn't interfere with like the site level because what's in front of\nThe wet imagine if we can engineer one of those steam tables\nFor a street vendor oh yeah and you could do your whole business right there and talk about cost you can put it anywhere that's true and by that with like the ability like square so you'd have it on your cell phone to get paid for it yeah\nYeah you'd be able to go places where a even food trucks couldn't go\nYeah no that's no that's true now does that battery charge as the psychosis pedal and that's what I was going to ask\nIt really doesn't say that\nBut I Would think that you would still probably half the plug it in at some point I mean you may get some regenerative motion to it but probably not enough to completely recharge the battery oh I Wonder if it's got a plug\nIn option where you can plug in like one of those a portable a solar panels\nYou know what I'm Talking about like you got 'em for ... the only problem is solar panel for something like this doesn't generate enough electricity over time to be worth it oh I was just curious but it would be really cool though if you had the ability to be able to plug this thing in you know if you needed the extra juice while you were at wherever you were at mhm that would be\nHere's my question [laughter] are they going to make an industrial sized more free preventive way more the more he doesn't want more and more fee is they don't charge a little charge your cell phone to charge it up when you're at the airport and you can't find a plug in\nMy thing is is that we've got like the portable jumper cables right you know in that little self pack right how difficult would it be to have these little again maybe like backpack style or something like that where it's a portable energy source for I mean not for your electric car but for like these electric\nWelcome to capitalism I'm sure if somebody will come up but here's one really cool thing\nI'm with the two wheels in the front and you would have never thought about this but uh the way that they've got innovative can can ... of the fun actual ensure that the goods being transported on the low platform don't tilt when your bike it's cornering they stay horizontal unstable\nIt's tilt leveling bikes tilt when they turn ... ... this one you don't lose your load when you turn a corner it's like a gyroscope\nCould be in a way yeah yeah okay so they're gonna they're gonna actually produce this thing and I can see this in developed countries everywhere ultimate food bike\nI mean could you imagine something like this I mean even in Des Moines right where you have somebody who buys like five or six of these has five or six people out there and they're just delivering food like downtown like it\nIs oh jeeze yeah in the ... you had if you had a hot box on this thing yeah oh yeah that would be awesome or go you're even one step better ah replaces the ice cream truck\nPollution known noise very low in at all I Need the noise I Need that saw we did that song you don't have the problem yeah but can you imagine\nI mean the concept of where you can transport a whole new way if you're a hub well it brings mobility do a whole nother level yeah last mile delivery of small packages with the right kind a box on the front of it which could be over the wheels to get some\nLike ... if you're I'd like one of those bite parks or something like that or let's say you're trail bike trail and you stop over for a picnic and you order like pre order on grab hub that you want this here and so the driver takes the last mile or so you bring it\nTo our better if you set this up right again steam table or maybe a small hot plate right up for small meals\nYou could pull off on the bike trail somewhere and have hot food it may be cold refreshment available for a price in a way that does not mess with the environment a traffic noise or something yeah the possibilities with something like this are endless\nThe only issue that I have with that mhm and you're absolutely right it's a great capitalism thing mhm now if you're going to sell that food during the health department and see a but yet and that's where the problem\nBut you know what not a problem you've got to be inspected food trucks are inspected desk or not a big deal if that's what the case is not a big\nDeal had those coolers remember those coolers and those those hot that would keep her food either hot or cold\nYou've heard arch it at home when it was electrical\nWhat I Would expect to see on this thing is is ... years steamed table or your preparation table in front your supplies as a saddle bags ... mounted in the back\nYou know and it may into something and that would be extreme but uh you could do short venue type things um you know this this I just see\nA lot of possibility there's a lot I mean yeah I could definitely see especially if they can like gear up that electric electrical current like maybe get like a larger model if\nYou have money that then you get trade offs of weight charging your chair ... um but yeah this is really cool and I would not be surprised expect to see this in big cities in the next three to five years\nI Would I Would agree with that because we as we know a lot more people are moving back to our downtown\nYeah and a food truck isn't always the best way to go imagine going up into like a a\nA a building complex you know ... we can be in the courtyard in our food so yeah ... thing to think about coming to a place you
