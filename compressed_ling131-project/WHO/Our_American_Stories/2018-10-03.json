the critical moments came\nLewis didn't take the\nShow the woman with him who is purpose was to speak shoulder to shoulder to shoulder the horses [noise]\nMy own theory about this is the\nLouis thought of himself as an explorer the purest sense of the term and the idea of the explorer\nIs that he alone I'm\nUsing only his own\nHas to make contact with an entirely alien people that if he had

[noise] but\nThe other two are frozen in fear ... says they were trembling like a leaf that they were crouched down at the fetal position\nReconciled to die\nWhich they expected no doubt we'll see their site [noise]\nSo Lewis says top out or they happened to have a canister\nOf Vermillion paint and his kept bag at a record but that was a sign of friendship so he said he lifted the old woman
