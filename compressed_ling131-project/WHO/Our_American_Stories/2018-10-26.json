and how the whole joy was crying and it was very very powerful and uh [noise] we still are twenty seven\nTwenty five six seven years later\nIt's never been a person\nWho would get better over time today is sober living a much better line\nCurrents Betty Ford and his wife Shelly for that\nBut also something central to his life today\nFirst of all came really strong when I said before about the alcoholism as you have to have somehow some kind of spiritual foundation\nThis\nThe truth [noise] my mother called me\nAt work one day she was crying almost hysterical\nAnd there was a crucifix\nHas ever said this to anybody else\nCan I help somebody out there [noise]\nShe was crying and ... ... bedroom and she has a crucifix that was on her or there's casket\nAnd frankly flying with ... with his little boy\nAnd I wondered what would it be like to have Benjamin Franklin as a father I mean a man who was not only a great inventor but um [noise] created the militia Pennsylvania in order to defend the frontier of Indians and then you know created the first postal system in Pennsylvania and [noise]\nThe University of Pennsylvania and then of course became one of the greatest American patriots during the revolution but what if you like to be that man's son oh and then of course I found out that Benjamin Franklin's only son was illegitimate bastard\nBut that he was raised just as if they're legitimate sun and the two of them were partners in politics and in military affairs later and policy\nUm so it was an extraordinary father son relationship and the fact that they went different ways during the revolution and the William Franklin became the governor the governor Jersey while his father of course was the greatest patriot\nDrove them apart and I thought what a tragedy what a great story so I actually wrote a poem about this in the Nineteen nineties\nAnd do you have that problem with me right now you know no I mean it's it was published long ago and\nAs often happens because I I was a poet before I became a biographer several of my poems have been transformed into these larger and more complete biographies well good for that\nAnd that's really stuck with you I mean it went from poetry to sue or to non fiction and it's in the end poetry has this story telling as well and uh and that's what you're doing here talk to the listeners because a lot of people don't notice about American history\nThis was no duck walk for ordinary Americans it's split families it split fathers and sons some people with the revolutionaries and the and the patriots\nSummer with the with the with the crown and some were just hiding under the table hoping it would pass how did this basically split up in a particularly in the area where Franklin lived in Pennsylvania\nOf course the numbers change but at the beginning of the majority of the people were against the revolution and in fact\nA Benjamin Franklin and his son in their works of diplomacy I'm In England tried to prevent the revolution we was only after the British because of government became more and more oppressive and they sent troops to Boston um [noise]\nThe Benjamin Franklin finally became a patriot fairly late in the game around Seventeen Seventy five\nOr so they both resisted the revolution as far as the numbers are concerned by Seventy ... Seventeen Seventy six um I Would say a third of the American people were for the revolution\nA third were against it and the other third we're just trying to blow with the wind and try to you know try to I'm trying to keep out of trouble\nAnd talk about now and just briefly will will open up the open up the lid on the next segment about this father son\nConflict but with the weather battles out in the streets was this quiet was the simmering what was the what was the climate like for folks day to day uh obviously Franklin and ... had something to do with newspapers as well talk about what it felt like the news today all we hear about\nIs my goodness the climate today in America it's just so hard but my goodness we have seen much tougher times in this country\nWell I'm just as an example um during the past stamp act uh there were riots in the streets in in Boston in Philadelphia and buy some Seventy five um\nThere was really open warfare in the streets of many cities I'm over the over the tax of the very various tax collector as people protecting them people attacking them\nAnd by Seventeen Seventy six there were these provincial a committee is safety who would I'm actually hold individuals accountable if they said anything that uh that seem to be threatening to the movement for independence\nAnd this was the point where governor Franklin you know it was the last governor of New Jersey was defending a defending the loyalist people who protected the crown so it really was it was a revolution in ... I mean it was a civil war in the streets of the major cities are all over all over America\nIndeed it was our first civil war I mean that's when I got from the book I mean we had one before we had one this is looking at me and this is Daniel mark Epstein and he's terrific book the loyal son the war in Ben Franklin's house more after these messages [noise] [noise]\n\n\nNice to know what ... there's talk your retirement account and Social Security are under threat this election covering both sides of the big issues let's talk about the ... starting tomorrow morning at nine o'clock news radio ten forty W.
