I Would\nI ran into um what's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator\nAnd when I was in Washington went during the Capitol hearing said he was a total jackass during those hearings it was coming out of where I was going in and I said senator Sean Hannity how are you\nWe had a very cordial conversation if he was sitting at a table I Would never I might go over and say you know send a drink over you know I might just because I disagreed vehemently with them I don't feel I have a right to tell them you don't belong here\nHe has a different point of view than I Do what we get to settle out at the ballot box I\nHave a fear and when I say fear with him regarding myself [noise] that one of these people might walk up to me in a restaurant my fear is that my response will go viral\n[laughter]\nThat's my fear I mean I've asked myself how would I had always situations and hello man of the ... that's why I say I have a fair I'm like yeah I'm going to stand up for that all Amy the old me would come out and then if I'm with my wife told me would come out and then it will go by what my response would go by what but I think they pick and choose the targets does exactly\nWell may be but you know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half ... and they know this well it's a it's it's not going to top crazy people but I got to tell you something I Will walk away I Will do everything I can do to walk like\nI Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice we ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect if we're doing grappling or or outright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were ... you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but\nMost people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like past caught then they're going to get past and somebody's going to get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful\nAt it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions but I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think I mean\nWe don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the left now that just means we don't have to get his dirty as they did well\nI look I don't know I we just had Newt Gingrich on and past and what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of an Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation and Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on paralleled economic success\nFourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican then that stupid the party leaders are stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that there's a caravan is not simply a random occurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly decided to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the others they say listen I'm tired of this\nBecause all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they\nPretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and emulate it so you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you've got to say that I have it to another level and you're you're propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a at African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at a picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty sixty one was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million more in poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have\nFour hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWhile the president didn't get credit when you break down votes demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing it's not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message is recording tell him as a message to let them in the black community I\nCome from a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really go\nFor it would do with the conservative movement for\nThey're going to vote with us because they're starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly but writing president from for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN and MSNBC just starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get the all the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this\nDay but if if we all believe in in ... the father Jesus or something okay and I think all of us here do if we believe that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes ... the word or\nEducation from the Latin is didn't do could I to bring forth from within that tells you that God put it there our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people\nAnd that's what I see Trump's doing and it and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's a great story of the two years of Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get that what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again he needs to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we had an alien Abul lights it flows from that\nBut I think the left as authoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are\nAnd I I think the left as losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort to identity politics and changing the rules and this identity politics\nDividing people on the basis of race and gender is\nEvery four to them for years at the same thing rich versus poor versus young black versus white a run up against a race a sexist massage in this Tacoma ... Islamic phobic they weren't dirty air water and they want to kill children and grandma throw over the cliff\nBut also they also hold eyes up to ...\nYeah and they want the polar ice cap to melt\nSean

saying\nAll of these countries that were given a lot of aid to and they're going to let people leave their country income racing towards our border I'm all for immigration but it's got to be done orderly it's got to be done legally\nAnd you can have what do you know you can't have seven thousand people just drop on our door and say take us in or were horrible people uh especially when the only

about the guy mashed literally ripped\nIs leftovers I guess just maybe it's taken a meal home to somebody else and rose it outside the restaurant door banging on the guy's table somebody's going to get killed here you watch somebody is or hurt severely it it's going to happen then nobody on the left ever can critique their own side for the rhetoric they're using it\nAnd he's Scaramucci is with us I just finished cover to cover as ... brand new book uh and it's phenomenal and it's the Inside Story about Donald Trump it's called Trump the blue collar president\nAnd how billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle of blue collar Americans that won the presidency and all those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they liked the way judge Kavanaugh was treated ...\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so we're with what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light show on like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that infect light\nWell the president has that the Trump Twitter\nInsect light and they're all going towards the light in their vaporizing a Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test\nShe's less of a Native American and your mate into the vapors Asian the caravan issue the way they're handling the care of an issue if the galvanizing his base that Kavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they figured okay me too movement seems to work there's no due process and the meat you meant\nLet's take this guy that's a very well credential judge\nOr he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter\nInsect vaporized or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of and the president's base is actually going to turn out much higher percentages and people predicted and so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we've got a very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate\nAnd it couldn't happen without the energy and the for tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do it when I'll say the CBs carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what if you like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're gonna have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nNow the president is is battling back on all these ... and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there we're not we're not able to do the job of\nStopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them and Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people the illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blame the Democrats\nAre not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively know Sean that it's just all it is is he sees recognizing with the legendary Milton Friedman one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United

crazy on the president's response oh\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents\nAnd democratic elected officials that have voted in laws I don't understand why

every measure and more job\nOut of the bottom ... percent of the society showing the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border\nAnd so he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot now have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons who was either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get it and he called them the blue collar billionaire yeah and they said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President because it's the other day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not their jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any that are in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look where you started died you know\nSean

the baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents that our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies of because what we both know is that you cannot system ties or through a political system created equal outcomes never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which is really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and her kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she's do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction is that it seems like there's no limits here but\nThere's no moderation left either ... the Democratic party it used to I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nBecause you're losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society uh even though it sounds great on paper\nAll of your ideas when they meet contact with reality or disaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people it's happened to me it's happened to me on a college campuses it's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling\nI'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it are both the you know what you know what's great about the people just want you to think of as it's Ninety five percent\nOf east professor Sean or liberal but it's about forty five fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the malarkey\nAll right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is one of
