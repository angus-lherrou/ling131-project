inflicted right yeah right it wasn't like a big a big sac that cause the formal or anything like that it was totally self inflicted\nI was fortunate enough to jump on it in the end that's what was the right quarterback either well yeah it was picked Roman there but you know he'll have been in there for I think every snap well almost every step up to that point\nKevin for that looks like Nebraska gave its first one of the couples swings years since we last update on the score but I Do get a lot of callers but real quick Nebraska is on the verge of picking up their first one of the year they're

Bless you because I'm there all the time myself you know the wag the ball never gets that high so sort of flags on top of the stadium with whatever they're worth I did have a chance to interview the kicker right right at the right\nBefore the third quarter and I said you know I saw you out there ... it's a field goal post twice he hid it why like dead on it twice a one on the right side one on west side and I said what are you playing the when he says you know what I\nIncite thirty yard all we've got to kick it hard because out side thirty yards we're going to have to play the wind a little bit\nSo that you're right there if you kept the wind about if you've got the ball Fifteen feet are lower the when on the field was not that big a deal but that you know we all seen it in the second quarter to ... by Marilyn\nIt literally once it got to a certain point and went backwards yeah um so so it you know when yeah I'm not saying it was the fact that wasn't a factor 'cause it was but it was all about the trajectory of the ball but the one thing it did make the when do it would damage it's cold out\nThere here where you are Joe thanks for the call man that was awesome it gives me enough to join the sign and thanks for ... kind of clearing up some of that when stuff because yeah we're going to get his folks from the stands down on the field maybe not as a as violent\nShaun welcome to the judge was barbecue sound up first of all how do you smoke Sean\nHey Jay WN at the right way okay\nSo I'm back I lost my train of thought earlier but um I got to say when when we watch Minnesota game last week and\nA over the course of the last few weeks ago at in game stuff I kinda wondered if I look at you what I what does which is dominant up front and they often line and run the ball and we absolutely have to\nAnd this week we did I I wasn't quite sure if we had a building up front to dominate another effect of ...\nThe way we did this week and it proved this week we could which is a good thing it's a great thing as far as to when I was talking about\nI couldn't section one thirty one member every week it was still pretty windy up there the flags were still windy I'm Glad we have a lot longer feel goals but I like I said before\nWhat is the most important thing that I saw this week you know what our ability in a game when everyone knew we had to run the ball we were able to do it that's a big deal\nYeah completely agree with you Sean I Know that's a it's kind of playing off your first point there but I'm Glad you called back in many hundred percent right the line was fantastic today and I think that that goes back to that question you brought up last week\nAbout that running game you weren't alone I think that's what John said oh you weren't alone and kind of wondering if that identity of the Hawkeye is being able to run when they want to do what we think or hope that suck identity was that gone today they prove they can do that again so great caution operation\nTo wait for ten forty let's go to Dennis Dennis welcome throws barbecue sound\nYeah are you doing guys like your show bank ...\n... ah want to make a comment about the deep end up I've been watching a Hawkeye for many many years and that ... it's been a staple air they coach or write a play and write\nA bunch of guys going to donate their plans to really really good football\nAnd uh I I appreciate watch ... get a lot of glory and they should have that button up a lot of what they would put up more points today it's a win adamant blonde but uh I got to say the the uh the backers that we got now they could shift around positions and they're really classroom really good football\nWhen you say backers and if you mean the the safety is the the defense Iraqis\nMake these corners lion actors all all the back yeah they are allies doing a great job to get the parrot grace it in the mail for boys I tell you those are the big boys there you got to throw the ball over it or not doing it very well so they're doing a great job upfront you\nAppreciate the call Dennis that's a great point to all of them in that defense all you're\nRight that bad but living in ... I I might disagree with what do you think you often gets more accolades this year the defense cause I think the defense has gotten more than ... has gotten more act yes I agree with you so Scott Andy Joe ... we need you to stay on hold because we are going up to the top of the hour and we started the conversation with you know well it wouldn't\nDo it justice [noise] oh don't do that and I knew there was a cheesy it wasn't until you pause oh if you just would have kept going people would have been like that's his name too but you pause and it's kinda like see what they did their student did there but I did it for you to to their I appreciate [laughter]\nWe got one more hour left to go we still have to get the cycle into each and a lot of phone call Elena do Twitter's been blown up the phone calls were blown up is the joking barbecue Santa [noise]\nThe only way to go ... and I arch radio station and on your age the rainy I'm Katie RV ADD to\nBring those morning doubled you wait Joe\n[noise]\nHeading back home I'm Joe cheer on Fox News Guatemala says a couple of thousand Tom during migrants who were part of a larger caravan hoping to eventually get to the U.S turned around and headed back to Honduras\nSaid others are determined to continue this by President Trump's threats of retaliation and no matter the risk\nThey spread I grew out of your broker I Am so we'll see if Russia will see what was that\nOne quick question what what happened with north western today\nAh with well they won but it was an ugly when going to Rutgers and pointed out that that's a good question\nI I think the question is what happens to North western on a weekly basis [laughter] I I mean how does how does it lose to Akron how does it lose some of the games that loses\nAnd then you go well how do you win some of the games you when it is they make zero cents an hour if you you're kind of watches gave me a Rogers going are they gonna lose to Rutgers they didn't but they should have blown out\nRutgers right yeah definitely yeah I Know I\nThink when you look at this north western team Travis as this season shakes out what we're really seeing is they are beating good teams and they're beating bad teams so you you beat Rutgers barely beat Nebraska Barrow\nAnd the shuttle last breath screws up ten with five minutes to go\nBeat Purdue barely\nAnd they lose to do lose the Akron get beat by Michigan may go to they play they host Wisconsin next week so if the yo yo is going to do something it better do it next week and then Notre Dame that we have to that before they face Iowa\nBrad thanks for the phone call appreciate it thank at northwest is going to be a tough one to to figure out I think before that they come to ...\nAnd by the way here's here's a man's will pass or when he got into the\nSo we'll see if they mess so goes up tough [noise] he was four or five for sixty yours coming to an old first first one [noise] gonna throw here [noise] you look at\nEarly bird it to the ground by to Maryland defenders\nThere's lots of Scott Ross by the way officially got his first one is the rescuers had goats probably didn't that goes you know given week seven\nKnow now that I was in a in a car to go to Scott\nHas been a whole for twenty four minutes Scott welcome to the justice barbecue sound out\nHey gentlemen how are you doing doing great buddy\nI got one little I'm In the Oxford and all but was that high school coach that call and I hated that system\nNo no no no no he was he he wants his final comment was hey from a high school football coach a ... the state of Iowa needs to drop its RPI system\nHere but you know what I I think it's\nBetter than what we because guess what you see\nThese first west and yeah I Know what dominate any ice ... on the side and you know and\nWe ... we go in it and it should be valley Dolly John ...
