that well she didn't really believe Paula Jones and she did take Al Franken side\nAnd you know it as [noise] you know you just got to watch this\nIt there's no end to this now they are not going to stop until they\nGet a no vote on Brett Kavanaugh that's just this should not surprise anybody and Jeff Flake is now in Massachusetts today trying to run for president thinking he's gonna which by the way the way to do it you don't like Trump go be the end thirty six days\nDemocrats they'll make their case and they're going to ask you to give the house of representatives to Nancy Pelosi in the Senate Democrats the Chuck Schumer if that's what you want on election night in thirty six days and you want to turn on the TV and find out the results if you stay home well you'll get the government you deserve we always do\nYou want all progress that we have now achieved in two years to stop that will happen too\nBut all the senators saying well no no no we got to limit the scope but it's got to be very quick expeditious and and just have the FBI do this that's not what they ever intended they want this to drag on through the mid term elections in the hope that Donald Trump doesn't get to make is pretty court nomination\nAnyway joining us now is Carrie Severino she's the chief counsel policy director for the Judicial Crisis network a welcome back to the program well as predicted the bar has shifted\nAnd now the Democrats won an extensive FBI investigation but from my standpoint as it relates to professor Ford there's really only for people that need to be interviewed and I would assume by now all four of them probably were\n[laughter] I'm sure they were it was either find people because they already had been interviewed by the Senate Judiciary committee like the the the goalposts are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to that to believe that any of these people um it it can take themselves seriously they said\nIt's going to be in four days a week and now they're going to have an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial there you know she works that that are out every Democrat that that now they're going up the Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI are actually going to be this horrible part is an organization\nIt out it it it is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's lifelong reputation here line\nHere when I got to do like two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know re Donovan famously once said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my ... name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think ... ever gets back in many many ways\nI mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on there is someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there's certain ... ... people who are going to get simply use that as their case is counted the name of discounts them because they disagree with in any way\nA clear someone who does ... incredible amount of perspective on the bench\nKavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as a lower court judge the Supreme Court\nThey saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they walk to fourteen different times they've found out they vindicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think um they are not going to be watching this\nWith the same knee jerk or part is in response as I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people are ... but I like it\nIf the parents who bought her reputation now\nIf you read James Comey's New York times piece that he came out with the ... it to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the FBI's pack it in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was writing an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her\nUm but then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are interviewing people in quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange\nUm and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day uh I don't think that's a ... in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized I could see that\nBut for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not um once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says is one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them then there's what he says refusal to do so\nIs its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because\nMy FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer\nEver and I'm like why am somebody who loves the FBI don't love the upper brass under Khomeini and the cave and struck and page but\nThe FBI is is the ... the FBI people I Know the fault of the earth people and I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn\nGeneral Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the FBI didn't think he was lying to them\nAnd you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say\nBecause it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the irony that says hey look he told me coming and low right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book

I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here with the agreement or with our colleagues and Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware L like Chris but he was never part of this agreement what compromise has been reached for Chris ... she is voting no\nHe's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about his drinking habits so Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and ... and the fall and incredibly any credible lead within a week\nI think the FBI is about finished everybody can look at that report for themselves and see if it's changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Geoff oh did you sing committee with the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited in scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii he wants men by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants an F. FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report\nYeah yeah that's where we are so my dad owns a bar and so a throw in ice is like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is that so much BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to lay\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're great and then I just outlined it was a ... three witnesses that Dr Ford named\nMess for ... that there are any a credible leads within that\nAt world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this I have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do a there your colleagues maybe you have some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe mansion and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but\nRight close to be limited in scope is now\nExpanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you came up with a pretty interesting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh delayed legitimize\nThe way he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election\nAnd take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with their senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kevin ... the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused on not given up on hand less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact that most Democrats will know no matter who Donald\nTrump ... they've already against ...\nYeah All right so now what is going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and\nWell a smart question Martha\n... is a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... for its claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning death the to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota wants a Heidi Heitkamp to vote no\nI don't agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country and November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to these red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh so you mean you're you're communicating Hannah I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers beyond that\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about sending a tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well and then we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook\nThat if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days thirty five we can I find that extra vote\nThat way we would have a good nominee or have the lights salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here\nI think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nOh it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for Kavanaugh it's only an election year conversion and they're only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back\nTo to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care is like you know I'm a Baptist I don't care how you found Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh is highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point\nThis has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and as saying a lot it will change the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's not a complicated issue for me\nIf we follow vote short or less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves a ...\n[noise] yes no I think they handled it properly because these are serious allegations but she identified and and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to re try this case I made I don't mind you've made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about Cabot all\nBut they have on them is that this is the environment we live in senator and I warn those audience on radio and TV every two and four years\nIf you're a Republican or conservative when you're running for office you're going to be called a racist or sexist appoint a massage the homophobic Xena fold Islamophobia you're going to be accused of wanting dirty air and water you're going to be accused of wanting to kill children\nAnd it's going to be all look alike of youth throwing a grandma over a cliff [laughter] it is as predictable as the day is long and now with Supreme Court nominees\nSixty percent of the people leave the judge Kavanaugh should be on the bench so if it if that doesn't you know all I can say is that the stakes are high who would follow Kevin after this they will destroy everything we stand for us Republicans if we legitimize this it only happens to why is it always just us\nThis is it time to fight back stand behind Kavanaugh getting the votes he needs he's a great judge and destroy what I think it's been a process that will destroy the country\nI got to tell you I don't think anyone would even want to run for office under these conditions or you know even for you taken a strong position I mean you've been mirrored in slandered about oh if I all the right people just so yeah people that hate me too so I don't\nKnow I don't think you'll find that on I don't think you had a fine or moment in all the
