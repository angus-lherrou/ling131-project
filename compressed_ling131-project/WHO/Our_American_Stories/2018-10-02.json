I didn't have to have drugs that was the only it was like a phenomenon now if I went out to smoke cigarettes\nOutside the door and there's three people there and I wouldn't even go near him I'd have to because I wouldn't want to talk to you follow me I wouldn't want to talk to them so to me when I was behind that behind that table talking about might go I was in a it was like a you know there is amazing new\nThing where I could talk to people and so I didn't need that but obviously if I had cocaine or what you mean that would be the same but what I noticed that could have the same passion with the with the cocaine or without only in one spot behind that but once I left that both\nI mean it's like walking into another world I'd walk if I'm In I'm and I have to talk to you and your the next ... we're going to talk about the weather\nIt's not happening I'm climbing up I'm avoiding hey I Want to talk to you later I didn't know what to say it was very socially stunted in that respect where I'd probably have their social skills or what a twelve year old\nThe home shows were the one place in my life\nThat was a search and it was his world his hello not the uncertain world outside those doors where he was damaged by his parents the drugs and then on known as future\nThe show's word the place where he could feel\nThat he was a positive force in this world\nFor me I didn't have money it didn't matter if I had money I Would I had a skill I could go out and get money by borrowing money I Would pay you back double because when I couldn't accept anything from anybody by of another one where I don't accept I'm a giver but I Can't accept which I worked on you know I Can't accept if we were going to we're going to go to lunch guess\nWhat I'd have a hard time you buy a new life that's the way you know I Am and that's a woman that's actually it's not a healthy thing either is able to accept is also a just as good as blessing someone but I couldn't accept especially back then\nIf you and I were doing drugs I'm not taking some of your drugs you're taken mine you know but she'll be able to be announced ill or show\nAnd should gee see people coming up I just felt like God gave me the idea for the pillow in the first place I'm On while I wouldn't get depressed because of that was like a constant speed up people going this is amazing you know I had this with my neck and this and I'm getting sleep now I Know it was such a divine solution I could've sat and just\nHelp people forever and never got it I wasn't thinking like okay\nI'm gonna make millions of dollars my thought was always I'm going to help millions of people [noise] there's a difference [noise]\nBut to reach its fullest potential in helping people there was just one person that he had to help for\nHim to sell it was march of two thousand eight when he was brought to that intervention by the three biggest drug dealers of Minneapolis the ball people that might have woken some people up but not Mike yet\nHis Christian faith was always there but if loaded in and out of his heart\nHe grew up in a non denominational Christian Church and never had a real relationship\nWith crime\nAnd the interesting thing happened a week after that and um [noise] little intervention\nI'm sitting all by myself in this place I was living and I get a phone call now from member I mean we talked about that little public access station that I that lady was nice ... she would air it's just every now and there that you know and I would get phone calls of people wanting to buy pillows down you know show us helping me out and and uh well that night it's about\nNine thirty at night and the phone rings and I am sure and and I'm up to and you know of course I'm Still up for probably two or three days and she says you know I um [noise]\nThey the guys on channel six and I said yeah she says well she says God God they praising God told me to call you and see what you're doing is so important\nTo the kingdom ... can we prayed about it and we and I said okay so we're praying about a half or goes by and she goes she I say in order to buy a nice job are named them by the way for this you know the proof that this out and bought another hour goes by another lady calls up and this never happened okay I really got one called the ...\nAnd she calls up she says the guys you know channel six then invented this pillow and nice to be as she goes well I haven't bought one and and but she said um I was going to comment ship it's okay to pray with you she said and what you're doing is so important to the to God and I'm going okay\nAnd so we pray for about an hour that was the long run into a trade I tried tried not to you know I'm drawing lines of cocaine I wanted somebody to talk to any way you know and I'm now three in the morning this guy calls up same night\nAnd he calls up and he answers and he goes I Want to get to your the guy on TV and he was mad and I go yeah he goes goes let me get something clear here I don't believe in God but I keep getting this dream that I'm supposed to call you and show you what you're doing is important to God and he slammed the phone down very upset\nUntil somebody told him he couldn't do it\nWell nobody told me I couldn't make this impartial and couldn't make it you know um amazing on my head I'm just going to be the biggest ever until my friends and family\nMike says that in a dream there were specific numbers about this hypothetical infomercials six that that came\nTo I'm going to go to a million dollars a week or two million overnight\nA ... or something they're pretty much was asked to nothing but here we go and someone introduced him to a so called [noise]\nI said I have this dream in the same from her show just a real audience and I didn't want to me and I didn't want to be on TV I said maybe somebody do it like we do at home shows you know just make it real and she goes no you need an actor and she says and they wrote a script the phones are lighting up like Christmas trees I wanted to throw up I said this is\nNot what I Want and she goes I'm a professional and all this but now the money kept going down almost all the money we got from my friends or family\nThat ever put their life just leaving me because we're running out we didn't even have anything so divided up climate I met this other guy who's going to do this empty Marshall well it turned out I was going to do it because he had seen so much passion this guy says you need to do it then all of a sudden they wrote the script\nAnd I went to ... they had this big professional guy come in and he's sitting there and he's listening to me read off the script and at her and he goes this is the worst disaster ever this guy's terrible okay being me you know this is it's ... they didn't know what to do so they they decided they would go with no teleprompter\nThat Mike which try\nLiving the whole\nWorld and for Marshall also become hard surface and it's no good [laughter]\nOn just one hears ruined America so we\nGo in there to film it and I was so scared and but once again I got behind that owner and it was like a shield between me and the audience were cut my comfort zone\nAnd I just went naturally or whatever non October seven\nTwo thousand eleven I'm living in my sister's basement and and this aired at three in the morning\nAnd all of a sudden this half hour infomercial comes on and I'm\nI'm watching myself you know usually I Would get so uncomfortable but I'm going I hadn't seen it yet I had not seen that and I and I couldn't watch it so I'll just for the first time I watch it and it was surreal and it wasn't like you I'm On TV it was like wow this is like the mind\nSet that you get exactly what you need for your individual next port okay you can see anywhere you want you can make\nLittle ballooning I'm\nTake six pounds and pressure to hold\nWas just all natural that it was like it was real it was what I wanted I didn't want it to be a cookie cutter\nYou know infomercial and we exploded we went from five employees to five hundred and forty days we were hiring people as fast because we're working out of a little schoolhouse we made our own call center because I I had trained a call center in Connecticut I trained them\nBecause I take customer service so seriously I called on the second day I said yeah what's up till the guy goes I don't know Google it I fired him on the spot I was so upset and [noise]\nAnd we made our own call center in a little schoolhouse reporter everybody my friends everybody she meant we took phones through the night and I look back now and they see everybody got their pillows and time for Christmas I mean we're we're making them hire ... teaching them how to so\nCan you show yeah here they go make you need to be CEO I go that sounds horrible don't they just take money and then it and then I go to a charter department to go that really sounds bad I mean all these things I just wanted to make pillows you know and we took in\nMillions of dollars over the next six months\nBut the experts continued to tell him that\nIs the way [noise]\nTo make this out just says this is terrible did you write this yourself we can do so much better and blah blah blah\nAnd now it's number one in history that look it up I'll put it up against any at Avon burn\nMike's added lived infomercials than the American people have responded to because he's genuine and real are now selling over Seventy five house and my pillow products\nAnd people said oh Mike you can't make a pillow here on the United states you got to make it overseas I said no you're never going to get a patent on a pillow and all these naysayers and I fought every single thing was a constant fight and the infomercial finally fatigued\nAnd when it did for being\nIn the summer of ...

severe weather stations on the news radio dead forty W.\nAnd then when I was a human being it was still in power and I thought what else is out there and I learned about a hundred and thirty five miles for race across Death Valley in the middle of summer so not only is it the most extreme running it was you know the most extreme temperatures on earth\nAnd I thought that's crazy a human being could never survive and these conditions I got it\nIt and I and I finished that rate of the bad one world marathon and I just kept finding these these new and different and more extreme and intense challenges to keep pushing the envelope to see how far I could go and that's kinda how I stumbled into it if you will\nAnd I think you know we had done an hour with David McCullough on the Wright brothers and it just turns out these guys weren't in it for the money they weren't it for the fame\nThey just wanted to get up there and give it a shot and and fly and it was a hobby for them it ...

know and let's say how much exploration that left on planet earth I mean and when it comes to physical and the average I mean I Know we have folks like you know on my skin and you know space missions to Mars and things like that but as far as you know scaling the highest mountain on earth are you know crossing the\nThe the largest desert it's all kind of been done so now it how do you do the most intense thing possible and that's kind of been my driving spirit and and you're right I I Do because I Love it I it's it's you know [laughter] what do you get when you finish one of these races you know you you might get a a metal or trophy I mean there's a lot of cash versus\nAnd involved in these but I just love the challenge of of of of\nOf actually bettering yourself and that's when it comes down to it you know can you um you know can you push through perceive limitations and unlock stepping that's greater than that\nYou don't you just testing your own limits you want to know what you can do or can't do in the Indian and the challenges it's just your own personal challenge and I don't feel like you were raising against other people are ... other people in your endeavors do you\nWell you know the ... certainly competitive and certain elements but I think I'm competing more with myself than anyone else\nSo I think at the end of the day the only time I feel like I failed it when I haven't given it my all a lot of these races I Do it's it's more about survive [laughter]\nYou know you might be racing salmon for fifty miles your mouth but race but the last fifty miles you're you're you're you're you're you're rooting for the other guy and he's written for you because it it is really just about survival more than anything else\nWhat led you to go for the fifty marathons in fifty days in fifty states I didn't even know that was possible I didn't know there were fifty marathons\nGuy told me he was part of the fifty marathon club that I thought why what is is he said I've run a marathon every state of the union and I said how long have you taken to I've been working at it for ten and a half years\nAnd I thought wow I'd love to do this but I I Want to see and I have ten

this show is look at different ethnic groups to come to this country\nAnd it's a tablet roaster when you get a year I mean when the Italians came here they got called names when the Greeks came here they got called names the Puerto Ricans game here the Irish came here but in the end we all just sort of merged into a giant melting pot\nAnd what's been remarkable as I looked it up when I called ethnic America is how different groups did when they came here and the Greeks were fears entrepreneur and real risk takers\nThe talk about a little of that Greek DNA because we are where we were born not entirely but it has an influence on us to talk about um you\nHim off their teams Fox News we report it sounded as if you slow\nStanding can feel\nLosing\nEverything is so crazy when you feel\nIt's

Wednesday low tonight at fifty seven areas of good will continue tomorrow partly to mostly cloudy a little bit warmer higher sixty\nFour will get up to the eighties though on Wednesday that's the forecast from channel Thirteen I meteorologist Ed Wilson and eleven thirty two in Boone it's fifty two here in Des Moines cloudy now sixty four degrees\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nNah this is Lee he'll be then we're talking to the corner as to the ultra marathon man who's also written some books alter marathon man confessions of an all night runner and his latest which we'll talk about it in a moment the road to smarter reliving the ancient battle\nAn effort run that inspired the world's greatest foot race and dean before we do that just a couple of basic questions I Know the audience is thinking how do you train for this stuff and how do you avoid knee injuries foot injuries and just all around hurting\nBut you know how they train for this stuff you do a lot of it so for instance a couple of days ago on Sunday there was a I live in San Francisco there's a marathon and Oakland I gotta I just signed up and ran a marathon just kind of spur of the moment\nSo you do a lot of running and I also do a lot of cross training to avoid those issues you just talked about to avoid the issues and you have ... ... a joint pains\nI Wonder if they cross training I mean what's called high intensity interval training so hit training I took a course of the day I'm constantly doing pet to push ups I've got to pull up our my office pull up\nSet up a ... constantly moving\nOr even now at them during the interview I'm walking around the room I'm standing up uh I write on my book standing up I never sit down to bounce right on my toes as I'm writing\nSo my whole life is built around physical movement I see life is training and training is life and I think that people that just run um it's kind of a recipe for injury overused century so I always encourage people to mix it up\nAnd I also encourage people look at their entire life through the lens of an athlete\nEverything I Do is to be the best animal being can be so that has to do with my diet\nMy cross training my actual training my sleep patterns and also has to do with interpersonal relationships or let's face it if you know if you if you don't have a good solid foundation with your family and that puts a lot of stress on you you and you don't perform at your best so I really look at my life as you know how can I be the best\nPossible athlete if ... you know as I can and do everything with that land\nAnd then you know so often I'll talk to athletes and we did an hour on West Point just\nThe institution because it produced so many great leaders military and otherwise a NASA NASA exploits from West Point a unheralded and even sports you know my ... he was a point guard at a at West point his coach a very young Bobby Knight go figure\n[laughter] it's just incredible to tell me this in mind body and spirit what is there that you do on that spirit side is there a part of that equation that you pay attention to his welding\nWell I mean I think that's [laughter] that's my running\nUm that you know that's where I find my God if you will you know I'm running as a I'm a I'm an interpreter um you know just by nature so running to me and if you saw or Iran up in the hills uh north of San Francisco I it's a beautiful setting I'm I'm Out by myself\nI have a very close relationship with nature\nI'm almost more comfortable running in nature that I Am and groups of people in fact I Am more comfortable\nAnd I think that you know unfortunate that that's something that's been lost as we've all as a species as we've lost his relationship with the outdoors with nature and to me that you know that that's part of the human experience and it it makes me feel spiritually and lived as when I'm outside running through the hills\nUm and you know it it unfortunately a lot of people are in the industrialized world just don't have access to that experience to do they live in cities that are so built up but I Would encourage folks to try their best you know even on the weekends to get some are wild and just you know immerse yourself in the grand\nOf of the planet of ours\nIndeed and by the way we Reader's Digest it all along piece on the health and wellness of people who take long walks or exercise in and around nature and it was remarkable what the findings were dean\nIt's not surprising to me we broadcast just south of Memphis and when you draw a circle around Memphis around two hundred miles or so you're going to find almost all the great American musicians and writers\nTeam from this area in the area of music it's remarkable and it's these wide open spaces and this peace of mind and having to fill up your own space\nBut I Know I you know it ironically I'm I've written all of my books I've written for books now I write all of them when I'm running because I have some of my most clarity I thought\nI wanted him out by myself running and so I carry a digital recorder with me and I just dictate and to this has been running and and that type of my notes\nAnd you know even in each case that the only you know the the only real thoughts are those that occur while you're moving [laughter] and I you know so I I can completely relate to what you're saying there\nOh it's so it's so true and and talk to us about the diet thing because you said you know eating really was a fundamental part of you and your performance and to talk about that ... that that regiment you go through what you eat and what you don't eat and more\nYeah so I I've really refined my died over the years and I've kind of self selected on um those foods that leave me with the most energy and feeling the bat I'm I eat more of those foods that you know leave me feeling lethargic and you know kind of drag me down I've cut from my diet\nAnd I basically arrived at a place where I Know processed food that thing that that has to go through a machine or be refined so\nUm I don't need a grains like rice or oats wheat\nI basically eat as though I was an endless all man if I Can't pick it from a tree pull it from the earth or catch it with your hands I really don't eat it so it's it's just you know they call it the paleo diet um that said I don't cook a lot of my food either so it's kind of a raw paleo diet\nAnd the amount of energy I mean I can I can go nonstop throughout the day I without ever experiencing a lot of energy so I think that that that dietary shift is really helped\nAnd everything I Do this you know ... yeah yeah he said that man makes it don't eat it and if it tastes good spit it out\nAnd not not advise and let's talk about the road to Florida because this I I assume is your most personal book dean or why did you write it and talk about the book if you\nGet what the word is part of it you're right it's it's a very personal journey and it's about the original marathon and the ... the Greek runner feeding ... that ran the marathon\nAnd uh it's uh it's basically a history book as well so\nYou know ironically right now the book is it's number one on Amazon and the category of Greek history and I'm not a historian but I doubt very deeply into the history of of ancient Greece and the evolution of running a marathon and\nI also learned a lot about my identity and I think this gets back to what you talked about um you know being a Lebanese and wanting to know more where you came from", "show_name": "Our American Stories", "year": "2018",
