passed a year ago um ... that that cat was like a human being to me a furry soul\nAnd uh several people around the world I've probably gotten twenty emails from people who Medicaid or are involved with various kinds of um meditation type of forms to access\nAnd they have all gotten the impression that both times that this has been my cat uh the one that had passed and I feel that
