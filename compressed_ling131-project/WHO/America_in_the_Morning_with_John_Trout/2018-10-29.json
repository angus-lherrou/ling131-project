when I get on these rules but I don't sleep\nThe second day very well it seems like after about five or six days of this but I get on this trip we're falling asleep and my body is falling asleep in my my mind's away I guess they caused the process but\nIt's almost like I go into a different universe and there's always being that I see and usually trying to get me and call me out of my body and not

hum\nIssue or a problem um or is it somehow opening spiritual world I guess my answer is I don't know I think that if you if you do look on line or consult the doctor they will they will tell you what I said which is you know these kinds of things happen and sometimes when people are awake there in a kind of an in between state of consciousness\nI'm you know and that they'll talk in terms of
