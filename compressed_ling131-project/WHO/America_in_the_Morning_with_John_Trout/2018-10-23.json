{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WHO", "content": "And I think that's really a one of the most fascinating things that I go over in the book because a lot of people have these experiences and then people kind of go well no one guy there that did that so you must be mistaken or maybe somebody was traveling through or this or that\nSo ... I Hope that helps them sort of get a better idea of what could be happening in that situation\nLet's go to Chris in Columbus ohio Hi Chris go ahead\nOh Georgia since you're a gift there has been a in Ohio northeastern part yeah I've got to ask I Believe he did a show from there the man's school reform and tore\nYep we sure did and every time I go there and there's something it's electricity and if I could I'd like to share a love story\nWas sure okay my mother and full blooded Cherokee of call been quite a few times [noise] a following ...\nBut anyway uh my father died and three months later my mom she's really depressed\nDidn't know how things were going to work out you know to put two kids\nAnd just before gay liked she woke up my father was there\nHe came in her bedroom sit down on the bed mom stood up her daughter kiss through and said honey everything's going to be All right both beautiful and the strongest power of everything is love and\nI was going to share that with sweet mhm\nSo these sometimes these stories are just emotional is well aren't they Brenda\nYeah yeah you know I mentioned a little bit before it's these aren't negative experiences for the most part in in my in the real and that accounts that I go over with these people that have people I've met over the years\nYou know sixty sixty seven percent I think are more positive than they are negative and it's this idea of someone coming back saying goodbye\nSaying you know it's okay um ... you know these are positive experiences in their life changing and they reaffirm the connectedness that you had with this love one and and these are important things and like we talked about before it it could heal some sort of psychological wounds and help you move through the grief process\nSo this phenomenon could be used as a coping skill and there's a lot of research out there that says that sometimes paranormal experiences arts uses coping skills um so you know I always shutter when it's always negative negative negative negative goes goes go scary scary scary\nScary not like that in real life go to Joe in the Bronx side Joe's going hey George how are you know\nGood\nBrendan yeah I wanted to ask you a question then maybe really a story about a full up are rich and then I seen um [noise]\nYou know the um the question is do you think that there is a subliminal under channel of communication going on between the go see a permission and the recipient of that goes to experience\nUm maybe perhaps subconsciously there's this supplemental um communication two way communication going going that precipitate the a ghostly upper mission appearing\nAnd I had\nA full reparation experience\nHalf the my brother passed away um I'm a singer songwriter and I was having writer's block on his song and I've really destroyed before on coast to coast um my brother comes into the room [noise] um he looks the way he did when he passed away in the hospital\nI'm short of 'em and uh it's it's during the day or at the foot of my bed he walks by and he speaks to me and says just get it done and then disappears into the wall now um can you may be elaborate on what\nCould have precipitated this\nOr does your does your brother pass away or he was he a this was after he passed away how long ago that he passed away a ... a ... before you have the extra and maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years okay All right\nI'm while answer your second question and we'll get back to the first\nOh good so I I think it's kind of similar to the what we talked about earlier you know what though it's been thing his wife and then the wife got his age I find the workbench you find the pumpkin there\nThis is an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment um possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness and communication is happening\nIn other words he's saying get on with the complete your song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because I don't think you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation to resonate with the consciousness of your brother\nAnd when you resonate with something not just information it's visual stuff as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as that I'm unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like that there was one case in my book that I go over where a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night and this\nFeeling like his dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog in the water injured and\nYou can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow I feel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and they had a reading each other's emotions and then he wakes up cars finds a dog that type of thing so\nYou know why there isn't physical communication or words there's some sort of like I'm understanding or you're reading a mind type thing\nWhere do we get the book to go study sprinted\nTo go study at Barnes
