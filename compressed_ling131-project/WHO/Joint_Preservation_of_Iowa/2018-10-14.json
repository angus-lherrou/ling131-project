of prayer she writes I once met a brother from Ghana West Africa ... who is completely in his PHD in the school of world missions at full or seminary\nDuring one of his troops home he attempted to share the gospel with several people who lived in the community although they listen respectfully no one turned to Jesus Christ\nHe later learned that they were intimidated by a witch doctor who lived nearby the witch doctor capital of his authority hanging outside his home a lattice basket filled with water that never leaked\nMy friend decided to pray that God would empty the basket\nHe stayed outside the home with a witch doctor and prayed all night that God would demonstrate his power at some point he fell asleep\nThe next morning he was awakened by a commotion the basket was empty that town so amassed revival as people learned about the God who caused the water to come out of the baskets there had been a power and counter and God\nHad one just like our story today\nPeople of God\nLet us commit ourselves to be people\nOf prayer\nAs individuals as churches I Believe that the church could have so much more power to accomplish great things for God if we just for brain more we need to always be remembering those assuring words of another early Christian\nMan named the apostle Paul\nListen to these words that he wrote if God is for us who's against us he who did not withhold his own son but gave him up for all of us will he not with him also give us\nEvery thing else good question people of God maybe we'd be known\nAs a brain people trusting are great and loving God who
