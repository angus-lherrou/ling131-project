wife Carolyn Hart\nThank you mark ... that was your son Ashton team with you it was yes thank you very much\nCarolyn even in the message we heard that that did faithful they question whether the parents and the blind beggar had done something\nWrong to causing by men\nHave you face that kind of doubt in your own mind\nWhen I found out that I was pregnant with our youngest daughter now well I was not thrilled\nTo be pregnant and I'm embarrassing to admit that to people I have two kids that were getting ready to graduate high school and I would\nJust add a point in my life where starting over with midnight beatings and diaper changes that wasn't really what I had in mind for myself at that point and so for the first few months that I was pregnant I actually really was struggling with now I Know this is a blessing but it doesn't feel like one\nAnd of course then I obviously did come to terms with that I was very excited when\nNo our born she was beautiful but when we received her diagnosis of Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome there was a guilt and a little bit of fear and wonder you know and oh God punishing me\nFor for being so ungrateful and for not accepting his\nYes right off the bat\nYeah that was something that I\nDid have to struggle with for a while before her me I'm ...\nNow I can think of times where I looked at my past you know when I was young I kind of like\nIn Solomon lord forgive me for my rebellious youth\nBut there there are instances where things come into your life and you'd be like oh you know I Wonder if God is punishing need\nFor that [laughter] but it's really not how ... works right\nSo it sounds like both of you had an opportunity to come to a point in your lives when you learned\nTo ... to God well\nCertainly plants that I had for this season in my life have been changed dramatically\nBy NOAA arrival you know ideas that I had for myself my on my\nOlder for children were in school finished school or leaving\nHome even all of those things have been put on the back burner because now I and not\nOnly mothering a small child again but also a child that has some out of the\nYeah I think if there's anything that we know by reading God's word is not that you became a Christian and all of a sudden your life is perfect but in fact you you can expect suffering you can expect trials because\nYou are literally going in the opposite direction in the world wants to take you and that's going to increase friction great friction\nThere haven't been to our fair share of trial but um there's also been a lot of joy and a lot of a blessing and I think you\nKnow statistically speaking to Noelle and her surprise arrival but also her\nI'm surprised diagnosis\nI think that when we received that diagnosis we all reacted in a very human way we\nWere scared because we didn't know what that meant we were\nSad because\nWe grieved this idea of the life that our child was going to have\nTheir were element I'm you know uncertainty and fear of what other people\nGoing to think and how does this and you know how this is going to impact our family long term I started thinking about the fact that\nYou know Perry and I may never have an empty and that and that's a huge thing to deal with and to come to terms with and what I didn't realize and what I didn't think about was the huge blessing that we were going to get through her\nThat was one of the greatest lessons that I learned through this whole experience so harm of God Bless us with her was just that one\nWe got to know her and once we\nRecognize how amazing\nAre differences make her how kind and how unconditionally loving and how\nAmazing she is like she has to work so much harder than everyone else to achieve the same task that we\nAll achieved quite easily\nIs so much rejoicing rejoicing over little tiny things that you would normally take for granted those are the things that I feel like God has taught us through the well and when I watch\nThe way that our children are older children are with\nAnd the patients and the acceptance that they have learned and the way that they have grown in their opinions on people were\nDifferent I just feel incredibly Brian what's been incredible for\nMe to realize and and I think it's a good reflection on a simple conditions we get very caught up\nIn looking at the ... the dark clouds of uh\nThe potential of something that happened and so you can get very focused on the challenges of bringing up a a child who has Down syndrome and and and really just get\nSo wrapped up in the old you're thinking about\nAnd what we we fail to see is that there can be more going on than needs are so you know some people might not see a\nHaving a child come into their home is a blessing she was absolutely lesson for our home and continues to be today because you know she became the sunshine\nThat we all were able to revolve around and be blessed by and and this you know the little person who is just beaming love\nYou know she has her brother or something like that but a more often than not it is just about\nI I Want to love you I I Want to be happy with you I Want to smile I I I Want to make you happy and and we\nAll uh we're there for her you know to help her with the challenges and so we learn more compassion and\nCare and all these things and and that's what God was giving us was this opportunity to love and to serve in\nAnd we may not realize that at first but wow what a blessing we've been given and it was so thankful for it\nYeah and even the blessing now of being able to share our story with other\nPeople and hope that we might somehow encourage someone else who\nAt the beginning of thirty me um you know just finding out that they have a diagnosis dancing or my child you know prenatal a year after they're born or someone that they know that\nYou're that that hopefully it will just help people to open\nTheir mind to refrain thing\nThink about things a little bit differently that this isn't a burden or a tragedy that\nIt's their life it's a little bit different but it's a blessing number law and um\nYou know especially with all\nThe talk lately about you know prenatal testing and eradicating Down syndrome in certain countries in the world and of course that's not what they're doing they're just killing all of the baby that have Down syndrome before they're more um which is\nJust heartbreaking and so to have the opportunity to go be kept linens and all the cat thinks that group is alive and um and sharing\nYour story which is really going to run\nA Noel how like a beautiful gas and\nI Want to thank you both for sharing a little bit of your story sharing your family your beautiful family today and the gift of your way the gift of the message that you\nBrought a pastor and thank you very much thank you pleasure for\nA special thanks to pasture Perry and Carolyn hard Lisa Jackson hand Lutheran lemons league Canada no pastor heart invites us to

power and the glory Reverend ever at home and\nThe lord bless you and keep you the lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious the lord look upon you with his favor and branch you his ...\n[noise]\nWant to wait Joe Joe ... and I arch radio station and on your age the radio Katie R B a day to\nUse radio morning doubled the way they do\nAnd when I talk to people and the NFC there's someone that is saying and and we're right down the middle they either say we don't have enough deer or they say we have too many\nAnd the honest answer is whoever's saying that they're probably right\nBut as the state the deer heard is is fairly stable and it's really at a population\nThat uh that we feel society and the state of Iowa can can manage\nNow that doesn't mean that where you have your place to hunt or where your tri stand is\nA or if your next to an area that doesn't allow hunting or it might be a city that doesn't allow it it might be a landowner that ah is not allowing hunters to come in and shoot does in those cases that might be that we don't have enough deer and likewise if you're in one of those spots that\nThey have some restrictions on the number of deer that are harvested there especially the does\nThey're not going to just stay on that farm they're going to travel over to the neighbor's farm and eat their in their corner there soybeans and we have too many they're\nLike why is this time of year when they're when they're moving um they've got other things on their mind or as well as being pushed around with hunters or where crop yields are coming out\nThey do get out on the highway so folks please be careful I'm unique to watch uh and of course uh I I'm I'm I'm pretty sure that uh it's it's far safer to drive through that deer hit it you're going to have a lot of damages but don't try to swerve and\nThat's it because the consequences of that are are far more serious so folks please be careful and uh and we'll we'll keep managing that deer her at the right level for everybody and uh and hopefully have a a a safe fall here on the highways\nDo I remember correctly though we have quite a few hunters from out of state because we have quality deer hunting\nWe have a lot of folks that try to come from out of state and and we're limited by the number of of license as we can sell\nBut Keith you're exactly right or that I have not hunted in a lot of different stateside I have had the pleasure of hunting one time in in Arkansas\nAnd ah the honest answer is in Arkansas their biggest fear is probably our smallest here and and the honest answer is it's just the way we manage it it's it's the way that we allow those big bucks to to breed and pass on as genetics\nOr when they should be um it's the reason we have split seasons for opportunities for hunters to to come in and harvest those deer and then of course we we encourage people to to shoot does\nIf you have a problem where we do have deer that are that are eating a lot of your crops we have a great deprivation program we have deprivation biologists around the state that will meet with you\nView those damages and then issue you tags so that you can go out and harvest those those and and that's what I Believe is is probably Ninety percent of the success\nWe've got great soils we've got great crops we've got great trees and food um that's going to raise big deer too but uh were really fortunate in Iowa\nYeah we really are and and that you could broaden that out too because of uh people like to come to see the president comes to Iowa I bet he's in Iowa and more than any other state\nWe have a lot of folks that travel here for a for hunting and fishing and recreational opportunities and Keith that's why I'm so proud of Iowa and that's why I'm so proud of ah of having the position I have today Indian or\nYeah I noticed your chest is kind of pumping out\nThere is sticking out just a little bit if\nIt's a deli divine chapter Isaac lonely as having a program Tuesday evening a call ... population trends Todd Logan shoots joy say ... ... yes that's right well ... is a the speaker and uh uh\nI I I think we have quite a few of our state people committed Iowa for pheasant because we're famous for says\nWe've always been famous for our upland upland birds and and pheasants and Quayle and I guess the report out I'd like to give to folks is or\nIf you if you can find good habitat which we have on on on all of our public lands and in this state owned lands that we manage but there's also a lot of private land out there as well that has good habitat\nThe pheasants are there um I I think ah as we've seen in the last few years some of those areas are all in northern Iowa northwest Iowa north of the interstate up or I'm not going to say any counties yeah but ah\nUp around Iowa county and tame and some of those places the pheasant numbers are really going to be good it's hard work now I'm I'm not sure you and I are going to be able to walk those fields but once again if we can find some folks that want to take you and I we can block we can stand down at the end of the field and they can trace pheasants overs\nAnd then we can shoot him there too so uh there's an opportunity for everybody whether we want to walk those fields or whether we want to stand at the end of the field to gave\nYeah been there done that I I I got to convince so I don't hunt nearly as much as I used to in fact a hug crows more than anything because it's easy you camouflage in the ditch turn on the call and see what happens\nThat's another great sport or we just we like people to be out there hunting and fishing and camping and and and all the things that are that we help Iowans do hear\nYour bet caused by the way a W H or radio listeners if you want to have a question from I guess this morning I call is it five one five to eight for ten forty to aid for ten forty and he can give you an answer on whatever questions you might have\nAnd in the meantime I Want to know that there was a news release from the dead are says enjoy I [noise] excuse me and I was natural landscapes fishing Iowa's rivers and streams this fall\nUnique angling challenges hidden around every band so I I don't hear much about fishing or these this time of year but I understand a ... a really good to to catch and really tasty to eat\nI tell you what it's it's one of those things that probably lots of us and and quite honestly myself included\nUh we get so excited around fall we have our guns cleaned up and everything like well I didn't have my ducks stamp wind up but everything all lined up and ready to go places to go and and the friends that you go with and family\nAnd we just we don't think about fishing a Martin Conrad or one of our great fisheries biologist that we used to have a retired a few years ago\nOne day came over to me and we were talking about hunting and how exciting it was and he says Bruce ... don't you understand that fall fishing is really the best time to go fishing uh the weather's cooling down the the streams and and the rivers and our lakes\nAre are in great shape for for fishing whether you have a boat or whether you're on the bank or whether you're standing on it on a fishing Jedi\nAnd uh that the fish are hungry\nThey're they're getting ready to to to go into that winter mode of little ice fishing is a lot of fun too but standing there and fishing in the fall weather and everything that's going on around you it's a great time folks if you're if you're missing fall fishing quite honestly like I did for a long time\nGet out there and do it I'm I'm watching the weather it's cool down now uh I think Thursday's the day to go so\nI'll just make a prediction a biotic badger lake with me on Thursday and uh we'll probably catch a a limit of crappy and and some blue gill as well\nAnd Iowa has some some really good fishing too I've talked to a writer's from well I used to be a member of the national association of writers\nThat's not the correct name but by memory is incorrect either anyway they like to come to Iowa because we have a quality deer and a lot of the writers for I think it was filled the streets fake anyway he likes to come here and fish to\nUh we we have great fishing opportunities and it's not that we don't all like to take that trip somewhere yeah because when when we take that trip there's there's a lot to it more than just catching fish but I challenged people I say\nUh if you want to take a a week to another state and fish for whatever species you want to fish for take a week in Iowa and just spend it here and I wouldn't go to our reservoirs go down to lake rapping a stay at honey creek or state resort by the way how you're down there I just well throw in a few little plugs in advertisements\nBut fish there go up to northeast Iowa and fish for trout in in some of the highest quality trout streams we have in in the nation right here in Iowa\nOr people don't understand it and and how beautiful it is up there but fish there or or fish in in Missouri or fish and the Mississippi take your big river fishing and do things air right down to your smaller streams right down to our state owned and managed lakes\nFind a farmer that's got to a farm pond and knock on the door and a and strike up a conversation and the relationship\nAnd you'll probably have some of the best bass fishing you could have any place in the United states and some of our great southern Iowa farm ponds takes permission and it takes a relationship but they'll let you in there\nAnd I'll bet you aren't a lot of ponds are under fish\nThey they get to I'll never forget a a good friend of mine and southeast to here has a new pond he's stocked with blue gill who bass\nAnd a couple of three years later we had a big rainstorm added washed a whole bunch over the dam and he called me it was ... I went out to the ground is covered with little tiny fish\nThat fall he had the best fishing big fish and everything so it really was a a plus instead of a negative", "show_name": "Joint Preservation of Iowa", "year": "2018", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "07"}
