{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WHO", "content": "You're listening to the Lutheran our I'm Mark I sure along with Dr Tony cook and or a new speaker Dr Michael Ziegler we thought we use this time to help our listeners get better acquainted with you Tony when did you start off\nYeah uh well first of all welcome it is great to have you here thank you I thought it might be interesting if we would get to know a little bit about your family so is there anything that you'd like to to share\nWe enjoy each other [laughter] but yeah yeah yeah our house is a lot of fun my uh wife Amy and I we've been married for\nSeventeen years and we have four children uh the oldest is Fifteen youngest is\nEight and yeah we just we have a lot of fun we have\nFor chickens than a dog and [laughter] and we live in the city of St Louis so you're allowed to have chickens in the city and just to give you a view and our our family life we had a Fox\nAttack our chickens a couple of nights ago and my Fifteen year old son and I drug ourselves after our daughter woke us up and said the chickens are screaming the my son and I had to go out with flashlights and few of the Fox and\nUm I didn't get a great night sleep that night but that's just kind of our house and a lot of energy and action and uh my wife is always makes things fun and the kids do as well\nLet's talk about the your work as Luther and our speaker each speaker that we've had has spoken to a particular context and its issues you represent now a different generation of Luther and our speaker what do you see as the great challenge of our context\nOr as I understand the organization we are an outreach organization and I think the challenge that we have is the same challenge that everyone in the church has that our our culture at least in North America has shifted and\nThere's some church hurt and some skepticism and often\nApathy towards what we have to say and of course I Want to share Jesus and I want to share the word of God and so I think that's the challenge is how to bridge into that that apathy and sometimes a anger towards the church\nAnd our listeners might be interested to know that besides being the river and Dr Michael ... you're also lieutenant colonel\nMichaels they learn in the United States Air force reserve tell us a little bit about your military background and maybe get into the transition that you made from air force to the ... years ago\nMy dad served in the military for Twenty one years in the air force and for one of those assignments we were stationed in Colorado Springs which is the home of the air force academy and we had season tickets to the football games\nAnd when I saw all the kid that's in their service dress run to the end zone and do push-ups whenever the falcons would scored a touchdown I knew that I wanted to do that I didn't know what it is but it just looks like ... really cool and so that had been my lifelong dream is to go to the air force academy and\nThanks be to God it happened I almost didn't get in and actually got rejected and then a month later he got a call from a the ... the senator who got me my er my nomination and and said hey you still want to go to the air force academy I fell on the ground and it was so excited that my my dream was coming through\nAnd I served a five years on active duty I wasn't a chaplain actually a lot of people ask me that I I served as an aircraft maintenance officer\nA air mobility command which is all the big plane's cargo planes and the arrow medical evacuation and air air refueling those planes\nNow one of the things when we were going through all the candidates I'm a for the new speaker one of the things that stood out to me was that you have a a distinctly different style in preaching did you talk just a little bit about how you develop your your preaching style\nMy desire is to be conversational and it I think it relates back to the question mark asked about the challenges that we as preachers face today\nThere's a there's a book you probably know the title as as one without authority or I don't remember who wrote it but that's we we can't as preachers or the gospel it doesn't work as well to lead with our authority\nSo how else can we lead to connect with people connect them to Jesus and so that was part of it was just a desire to be conversational to the desire for me to be interested in what I'm saying and to become a a student of the Bible anew every time I go back to the text\nYeah this was a unique opportunity now that you're just starting out and people listening getting to know you a little bit more if there was one goal that you had in mind for what you hope God would do through your time here or what would that be\nWhat drew me to this organization is that\nThe love of the last and to focus on outreach and that's what my goal\nRight now as I can imagine it is to help that effort to be a small part of that larger effort Lutheran our ministries is much bigger than just the Lutheran our we're we're reaching out all over the globe but if I can be a small\nPart of that to to speak to people who are on the on the fringe of the Christian faith or outside of the skeptics and a half believers\nAnd that's a lot of us who go to church every week and so to try to speak to wear those to come together where a someone who goes to church but it's not quite sure if they really believe all this and and then the some someone who's completely skeptical about at all how can we\nReached them and saw what I Hope from from the listeners is that we'd be able to create something that they could share\nYou know you you send send this to the pod cast linked to your grandson to your granddaughter your niece or nephew and say hey listen to this and let's talk about me for coffee\nTo learn how you can support the world wide outrage moves run our ministries go to Lutheran our dot org oh\n\n\n\n\n\nOh\n\n\n\n\n\nOh\nOh\n\n\nOh [laughter]\nOh\nOh\nOh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh\n\nNow Dr Ziegler invites you to join a gym in praying the Lord's Prayer\nOur father who art in heaven\nHow we would be dining\nDie kingdom come by will be done\nOn earth as it is in heaven [noise] give us the state our daily bread\nAnd forgive us our trust passes as we forgive those who trespass against us\nAnd lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil\nDesign is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever met\nThe lord bless you and keep you lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you know the lord look upon you with favor and give you peace amen\n\nWant to wait Joe ... and I arch radio station and on your age the radio Katie already eight feet you\nUse radios boarding W wait Joe\n\nGathering in Greece in
