{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WHO", "content": "And faith is a trust and its trusting that the solution God has provided in Jesus crucifixion in his resurrection\nIs sufficient and even though I don't understand it even even though I don't think anyone probably can\nI trust in it may be another way of saying that same thing is to say that the\nThe cross of Christ is not so much foolishness as it is an offense it's offensive to those who are trying to be right with God on their own terms and it's all soon offense to those who think they don't need to be right with God\nYeah I in the passage that was the basis for our tax for it today in many translations it's translated as a stumbling block or a scandal on\nAnd that is something that causes one to stumble or in some translations to it falls on someone in in hurts them crushes them kind of thing okay and so that is the gospel I mean it's foolishness but it but it is an offense and\nIt's interesting because today people are very very concerned about offense and offending others and and from our research we found that one of the\nMain reasons why people are apprehensive when sharing their faith is the fear of a fence\nBut the the irony of it is that the message that we have is inherently offensive in a stumbling block\nSo just like the Bible passages tells us we preach Jesus and Jesus crucified and it is this stumbling block it is as you said\nAn offense an offense to the Jews and a folly to the ... it's a it's a fence to our reason it's right in your face that says you can't understand this the only thing you can possibly do is trust\nLooking ahead to next week's program it's going to be an important day here for the Lutheran our because Dr Michael Ziegler is going to make his debut yeah the next Lutheran our speaker Tony what do you think about that I think that is great [laughter]\nUm as as one who has filled in 'em over this past year when we have been in our vacancy speaker I'm thrilled to have him come here I'm also thrilled because he brings to the table\nSuch a vibrant and unique way of proclaiming the gospel and um every time I hear him preach I learn something new from it I'm engaged by it and I know that our listeners will be as well so\nI Can't wait to have him here not only and you might not know this not only um does he preaching the Lutheran our but he's he's a member of our US ministries team\nAnd so he works with us in in the development of our programming and figuring out um the ministries that we're developing and he speaks into that that process as well so uh well he's a voice on the\nRadio he is also a valued partner in our United States uh outreach of the gospel is a whole\nI think our listeners will discover that each speaker brings their own different style and to the program in the case of Dr Ziegler I think he's going to make use of the radio medium in a special way talking about that theater of the mind and you know making use of his voice to bring the words alive to the listener\nYeah he has experience actually in um doing the gospel of mark from memory in connection with the gospel of mark program at Concordia Seminary in St Louis\nIt's amazing to hear him recite scripture from memory and he just doesn't remember it but he embodies it ... and um he presented in a very engaging way\nI remember that when we were going through and and having people record sermons and you know things like that during the ... the first time that I heard him the first thing he did was read the Bible passage\nAnd I was like wow if the sermon is as good as him reading the Bible passages who's going to be great but he has he has a talent\nFor interpreting\nAnd he has a talent for conveying with his voice and I and I think you said the or the mind is a great way of doing that when you listen to him preaching close your eyes and you can visualize a what's going on in the message\nAnd just a heads up for our listeners I think this is going to be a case of active listening being called for on your part it's this is not going to be the sort of thing where you can have it just kind of\nGoing in the background I think Dr ... really captures and engages your imagination and requires you to follow along carefully 'cause he's going to take you on a journey with his sermons\nYour salvation free but listen [laughter]\nYou know I'm no he's a he is engaging and to follow along with him and I was I was a similar professor for a number of years so I you know I think I've heard a lot of things but the way that he presents the message I think okay\nI haven't thought about it like that before and my only problem is that while he's preaching I start thinking and I started going down these well okay I Wonder what that's like and then I have to remind myself to keep listening because he's brought up these topics that are still engaging\nIn presenting them in ways I haven't heard before so um he's he's a gifted preacher but whether we like to say he's also in many ways challenging\nIn the fact that he's not going to say the same thing in the same way\nBut that he's presented in a in a fresh way an engaging way in a stimulating way\nTo learn how you can support the worldwide outrage a Lutheran our ministries go to lose to run our dot org or call one eight five five John three sixteen that's one eight five five five six for six three one six\nOur email address is in ... LA jam dot org we see\nNo oh no oh\nNo [laughter]\n\nNo\n[laughter] oh\nYeah\n\nI see a show\nOh yeah\nOh\nYeah\nOh\nOh\nOh oh\nOh oh oh\nOh\n\n\nOh\n\n\n\nPlease join me in praying the Lord's Prayer\nOur father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name\nBy kingdom come by will be done on earth as it is an Avon\nGive us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trust passes as we forgive those who trespass against us and leaders nodded to temptation but deliver us from evil\nFor ... the kingdom power and the glory\nWherever endeavor I'm In\nThe lord bless us send us from all evil and bring us to everlasting life oh man\n\nThis has been a presentation of Lutheran our ministries [noise]\nDon't you wait Joe ... and I arch radio station and on your age the radio Katie already eight feet you\nW wait Joe\nSixteen chances a day every weekday can grab in your hand\nHey I'm Brian and I just want a thousand dollars in Palestine I just want a thousand dollars every hour we'll give you the key word to enter I've been searched twice today protects it to two hundred two hundred for a shot at one thousand dollars is my first time texting and can you describe\nThat use radio ten forty W. H. Joe how are\nThey are lashing out one piece at a time there flailing away wild as only he can they're getting venomous because they've locked themselves into a corner Rush Limbaugh everybody\nWants us to have these conversations then when we engage Trump thing they want us to talk about I eat them happened to shut down all your racist or a bigger whatever gaze at one\nRally is for a pair of political rivals I'm Pam who south Fox News well accusing President Trump shredding an American value is former vice president Joe Biden fired a crowd in Nevada where Democrats that chance to flip the Senate seat in next month mid term it's time to get up let's\nStream and in most of the cases they granted and you can go out there and you can get some excellent fishing because you don't get the pressure fishing that you do on some of the more popular streams and then if the streams pan out and they they support the trout and they and they grow well\nThey'll work on a ... minute agreement with the landowners so that the general public can always have access to that stream\nAnd I have trout maps dating back from the early nineties where they had many of these putting grow streams and they have turned into big in regular trout streams day\nAnd there had been studies the entomology of the ... the whole northeast Iowa area by the University of Iowa\nAnd they show trout in so many different streams that are listed on the trout now so they are migrating they are growing and they're expanding their territory so get out their fish\nYeah well and the sooner the better I Would say\nYes oh yes there today is a beautiful day to be out there a while whether you're a trout fishing whether you're bass fishing wall I this is a good time of year to be out fishing\nThe Fisher on a feed for the wintertime so they're going to be up looking for their forge a there can be the smaller baked fish uh and if that's the case then you want to fish around the we'd banks where the smaller a big fish will hide naturally get the bigger fish on the outside\nOr the cat fishing has been I guess okay off of the south east ... Street Bridge because I've seen several people out there the river is high but as a river continues to fall then the then those are cats\nShould again go back on a on a on a good feed [noise] uh yeah it it it is is a perfect time to go out there before the lakes turn over 'em before ISIS over you'll have some really good fishing days\nWhen the ice guns we still good to have pretty good fishing I Would think\nOh yeah was soon as the ice while as soon as the ice is safe to walk on a get out there and start ice fishing um and of course is the winner progress is in the ice gets thicker you need to take that shelter out there with you so you can stay warm and comfortable\nAnd yet in Iowa where you can fish year round the trout streams in northeast Iowa very rarely do they freeze over and the season is open all year round so you might be up there fishing and you're going to run into people from Illinois Wisconsin Minnesota coming down to fish in Iowa because their seasons we're close\nYeah at some time ago I ran across the guys from Nebraska not even gave clear up to the northeast Iowa so that's wonderful well a lot of us to talk about flying tying a or do you do you think\nThe sheet with artificial lures like flies and so on a better than a say worms or something like that\nAnd eat it depends on the situation um sometimes worm for work better and I've gone trout fishing where the worms have worked really well I've gone trout fishing where the hard crank Bates worked really well and then I've gone fishing where the flies work really well\nUm you know it it just depends on where you're at and what your fishing for I I like to tie flies um it's a very nice relaxing hobby for me\nAnd of course I've got a picture of the first Fisher I ever caught on a fly tied it wasn't a monster but my eyes of most press the fish I ever caught\nGreat how long have you been doing ... uh I started from fishing in the late eighties\nAnd I was I had returned to school up in Iowa City and I it was a short drive up to the ... show on a Saturday or Sunday I'd zip up there and fish at that time I used ultralight equipment and stuff I fly a ... a fly rods and stuff\nI caught fish I had fun I came a move back to the morning after I graduated ended up Marshall town and then went fishing one time with the fly ride and caught a fish and that's the bug\nOnce it is it is that I as\nI was telling you Keith on them ever the north ... chapter of trout unlimited here in central Iowa\nAnd we have teamed up with bass pro shop you were talking about ... yeah and the fourth Thursday of every month between now and including April we will be having a flight tying them and ... out there on the Thursday from six to eight PM\nCome on out see what it's about if you are tire bring your vice out bring your ringer materials sit down with us ah teach us something and maybe we can teach you something many people that come by they just want to see how it's done\nOne thing I learned when I first started flight time is that no bugs are perfect so don't worry about your fly being absolutely perfect and that whole so true you know you can throw the ugliest looking thing out there and goodness of fish and I just fight it\nHad knives and you've gone for years that we spent some time in Colorado she used great big cars I use ...\nAnd the the uh catch was just about to say yeah it's kind of a\nKind of interesting but either way W.
