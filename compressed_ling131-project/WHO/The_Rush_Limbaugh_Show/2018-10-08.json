I don't I don't want to fall back on that to suggest that this is a anger they feel is not legitimate is legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm a democratic voters is less than what we think it is\nJust because some people have announced that they accept the money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would\nSit around and do nothing in twiddling their thumbs all weekend long if they weren't being paid I think the demographic rages real and it's been a real sense election night\nTwo thousand sixteen they thought they were going to win that aren't they going to land so they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the election and consequences\nThey

of the American people which they cannot do in their current makeup which is why\nI ask\nOver and over if the Democrats at large elected Democrats really are unaware of the impression these people are creating about\nThem\nAnd when these are mad in saying this gusting Democrat protesters and they are identified with the Democratic party and I don't know if some elected Democrats really get that I can be all wet that could totally get it and they could be promoting it and which is probably closer\nTo the to the truth than not [noise] but for those that\nDon't get it it amazes me that it is

the\nIt's not a dirty little secret but it's something to always keep in mind\nAnd frankly I was\nHappy watching the news over the weekend to hear a number of people on our side\nMaking this point because it's a point that's been true for as long as I have been doing this program and the longer we say constantly to the left uses the courts\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that the left cannot\nSucceed in implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts\nAnd that's why the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal Democrat presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts as they can with the leftist activist judges not just plain old simple judges who rule on law\nAnd there is a dirty little secret behind this folks\n\nThe Democrats simply do not have the numbers in the country to pass their agenda in Congress they do not\nThe numbers to implement and pass their agenda legislatively otherwise they cannot get their beliefs their ideas past as laws in America they have to rely on activists job just to do it\nNow you might miss it was Russia or ... before no nothing new there well there's nothing new about it but particularly its in its relevance its power\nAnd it's important has been magnified in this current Kevin a fight and explains in one reason why why this is so important to them they are in their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land\nThere on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in the land a rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue\nThat these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down you won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\nAbortion the American people haven't decided that\nThat was forced on the American people by a leftist activists judge and a majority on the Supreme Court\nAnd any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this white power structure that the left so despise isn't so hates\nThat they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively\nThey need activist judges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every ... this is the\nPoint what they believe in\nThe idea is they have must be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\n\nThey cannot withstand legislative tests\nIt's the same reason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about their agenda they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do\n\nIf Obama had been honest about the way Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these years\nYou've Obama had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was going to cost you anything you would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever wouldn't be\nThey routinely soft sell what they really believe they do not come out an advocate socialism or communism in presidential campaigns they will do it as a as a case of a Alexandria or gets difficult task who's lunacy on display in a leftist district in New York is harmless\nBut you put her on a national ticket somewhere and she kills it\nWe have not lost this country and we have not lost that which can be traced directly back to our founding but the left once everybody to believe that that founding and everything traceable back to it is unjust unfair\nThat it is also racist and sexist and massage sticking all these other things that are despicable we must do away with it\nThey don't have the ability\nTo to win any of these issues legislatively are you left us you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot review this every thing they want everything they have achieved outside of Obamacare has been forced\nOn the country the country has been bludgeoned into accepting it\n\nThe country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way and if you don't look the other way and if you find it then what did they do they sue you\nThey try to ruin you or they bully you or they harass you or what have you this is not the behavior that does when things legislatively\nAnd yet the Democrats firmly believe that all of this is going to lead to this giant ... blue wave and I don't care even today\nThere are links all over the Drudge Report where if you click on them you're going to find a story saying yeah it's over Democrats when and when big and even the Republicans think so\nA P has them Reuters has some New York times CNN doesn't matter where you go there's always going to be a story where Republicans agree it's over\nThe Republicans deathly afraid Republican scared to death no way they can resist that coming blue wave\nSorry don't buy it may happen I don't buy it\nI don't trust anything I say on the news anymore and I certainly don't trust the bunch of polling data\nGiven what\nFallacies existed in both the news and polling leading up to two thousand sixteen\nHere is a story [noise] [noise]\nI'm a website called the Babylon and be a Democrats shutter an idea of having to legislate through Congress should Supreme Court lean right\n\n[noise] I don't know if this site is legitimate or not or if it's if it's a hoax site what they're doing a satire on the truth because it absolutely is the case they are ...\n\nOf of capital a Kevin are being on the court simply because of the shift in the courts that it represents\n\nBuddies undeniable folks it's factual it's right in front of us they have not been able\nTo succeed implementing the leftist socialist communist agenda via the United States Congress\nThey can do it in their state legislatures I give you some places like California and so forth they haven't been able to do it nationwide it has to be forced him\nAnd of course for that to work for the use of force to be working half the cave to it\nYou after it came to the bullying which has happened on gay marriage it's happened on transgender bathroom issues it's happened not every oddball leftist cultural demand out there they count on everybody caving they count on everybody's suing for peace until Donald Trump came along\nI could trace ... she was on C. span two on Saturday Saturday show called afterwards why does this she was running for attorney general ... is an attorney general and she said something outrageously stupid that we've highlighted here and I forgot what it is but it's in the Alexandria\nOcasio Cortez vain and it just it it just after nine stupid I Wish I could remember it it's in our show our guys but this is the first I think maybe we've had a sound bite her before but this is\nAn appearance about a book that she has written called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger and the host of the CSPAN afterwards show is Rutgers University women's engender studies professor Brittany Cooper\n\nQuestion if the devastating to me than if white women cannot have a public life private life professional life or in protest in what are we to do\nLet me read that question again it feels devastating to me\nThat if white women cannot have a public life a private life professional life or in protest then what are we to do\nAnd here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister\nAre we angry that it has to be white women before we take they started seriously or or I think it's an do we also acknowledge that we need to wake the white women and their power their products no power can be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still oppressed\nAnd then in fact in this strategically necessary and this goes back to the question do we need why women question that every candidate\nIt's an electoral question with every candidate needs to ask do we need white women\n[noise] now this wouldn't be happening if it hadn't been for the realization that a lot of white women support and Kevin ... and I don't know if it was so much that white women supporting Kavanaugh is that they were ... it it it scared to death\nAt what they saw being set up\nAgainst men\nThey have sons they have brothers and anybody would have half a brain watching what went on the last two weeks would have to have been blind just see that the Democratic party had a line the itself in such a way\nThat men were often don't Matt ... lake guilty simply because they exist\nSimply because they are capable\nIn fact [noise] let's see there's actually a story with that exact point made the here and I think I moved to the bottom of the stack\nBut it is is a woman making the point that Kevin raw is as good as guilty because he could have done it\nAnd he could have done it because he's a man he could have done it\nBecause he has male genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe both the Ford that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're old woman with the sons and a husband that you love and some brothers and you're watching this you wouldn't miss\nWhat is transpiring that men are automatically guilty all it takes is an allegation the obligation doesn't require any evidence in fact the fact that there is no evidence adds to the fact that the allegation is likely to have happened because that's what men do\nAnd I mean the Democrats there and insurgency they become a political uncertainty and as you know what if they're the they're defeated they just change tactics\nAnd the new tactic um you know they employed with a judge Kavanaugh with Christine ball before they had a two for that someone that not only educate argued that someone that was wanting to put on a suicide vest for\nOh I just think that this is the new battlefront and thankfully we have Trump who cannot who has put so much the on the spider Republicans\nAre ... true true but maybe I'm maybe I'm silly for trying to force this issue but let me just ask you point blank\nRight since you have talked to and willing to address the issue do you think that this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior but just we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior which was\nWidely publicized and Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make he rose up all of these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get in the halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so they got an elevators they shouted these people now the Democrats have not once called out that activity they've never once told outside their side to stand down do you think\nThe American public watching that\nIs going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it or do you think the American public\nDoesn't care one way or the other end doesn't even really notice it\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they've they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working blue collar class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow\nUm increase the numbers with women on these type of issues but I think largely to the American people are going to be turned off and\nI I think it's all going to come down to a who who is able to get out get out the vote in a month but\nThat had well see my point twenty twenty let me okay this is my I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this was that\nIn my scene and just world the Democrats just exceeded and getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm the king a book's title the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by this\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to punish this month just common for the way they have treated this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans ought not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kind of frustrating to me but that's the case [noise]\nDemocrats think they were going to have turned out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election Democrats think the whole country is because if they really\nDon't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think that they're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout there is\nAnd they've got new stories predicting that\nThanks so people are going to be reading it people are gonna be reading Republicans don't have a chance\n\nYou may replied no I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think they have the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago\nThat the event had an happening and what twenty nine days when it happened\nA true yeah when I'm when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right and there are some people saying that this is going to be forgotten by the time the election comes around a lot of people\nI saw him on Fox they a lot of learning puns and commentators oh this is going to be so old by then actually heard a couple of people say the things that people are going to vote on probably haven't happened yet I just have to chuckle\nUm\nOh I can I can see what the passage of pie you cannot maintain this\nRiver passion for long nobody can welded but we're talking about I'm Talking about reasonable people I'm I'm I'm saying it's it's understandable to me that some passion on our side is going to fade there's still a
