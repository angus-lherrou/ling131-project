nationally we should be close to about fifty percent harvest it and then you know press ahead aggressively next week on harvest\nUm I think when you look at it a two thousand nine or you know when you're up over this oral five area those are certainly a catch up with management opportunity\nAnd a November being the next year we got up over nine fifty so you do not tremendously great numbers but numbers that you can live with all these early I'm with Brazil so far the other thing Brazil's crop\nUh no weather problems down there there are about forty four percent planted on their core are starting to push forward on soybeans no other problems there are a little bit dry but not an issue there so it looks like we've got some competition in front of us\n[noise] Charlie who ever done was

Mexican one one thousand twenty fourth Peruvian one one thousand twenty fourth Colombian industry trace maybe to the drug cartels in Columbia\n\nWhy is there a dearth of Indian DNA why is there not much Indian DNA out there\nOr was the problem bustamante couldn't find any matches for Warren using only Indian DNA so he felt the need to expand\nIt to include in South America when\nOther reason there isn't much into your DNA is because they are very very wary of\nThis the Indians themselves the Cherokee tribe the leaders will tell you they don't use DNA to determine the limit injured they use junior logical trace\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus has in this country in the Mormon church out in Salt Lake City has one of the most advanced respected documented\nIn your logical praise organizations that you'll find I have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing\nAnd that story I get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but I'm the same token there are some benefits that had been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize\nDNA if any of this but\nThe the media of course has a role here because everything they reported about this turns out to be an abject lying separatists inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American\nDNA and by the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she wouldn't have to take a test from little kitten with wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA test\nAnd he wanted to present her ... have or take the kids take the take the test of his kids using it in a debate future debate\nAnd that's what he meant that she wouldn't do and he kept that she wouldn't show up as the Indian if she did do it but you talk about it's not going to melt down and it's Trump that is causing this\nTrump is literally causing these people lose their cookies Trump is causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and throughout the American left and I have\nI have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about\nAnd most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion and my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about the Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can in this next election why\nWell the media tells us the American people are fed up after two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it and go do it over\nMaybe take back their vote for Trump and this is going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house in a massive landslide and at one point we're going to take the Senate but then if you look at\nThe reality of\nVoting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right and it all started with Iraq Hussein all\nIn two thousand ten [noise] do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama you go through the two thousand fourteen mid terms\nThe Democrat Party lost over twelve hundred seats nationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses a governorships a you even go to\nA local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost well over a hundred seats\nThey were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election\nThey continue to lose even more and the and the dance that lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in ... near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nI'm not a robot should've are never going to sweep big never going to wipe out\nThe Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had they couldn't they had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination somebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set of gaps they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed older polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two thousand sixty eight elections\nThe Democratic party had the least amount of power in terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties\n\nNow the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago\nSo from two thousand ten the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they can do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nRock Obama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral prowess of the Democratic party\nNobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear every day is this coming blue wave this gigantic Democrat landslide on what evidence is this going to happen\nWhat is it that has stopped the trend\nThe people in this country had been voting against Democrats\nIn ways unprecedented I mean to having the fewest number of electoral seats since the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people have been voting against you so what is it the Tampa and that is going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift\nMake people stop voting against Democrats and vote for them why it's none other than Donald Trump so says the media so says the Democratic party\nWell on the basis of what if you take a look at Trump's agenda and the economy and policies in so far there's no reason to vote against it in common sense there is no return hasn't done anything to worsen anybody's lives quite the contrary\nAnd in fact there's a story from CNBC today that you're not gonna see widely reported let's see [laughter]\nProbably put CNBC ... survey soaring economic optimism points to no blue wave in two thousand eight team is this the the NBC poll or survey\nAmerica is experiencing a record breaking era of good feelings economically speaking optimism about the ... do you know that there are seven million jobs open in America today actual number seven million one hundred thirty six thousand job openings in America\nFor context the U.S never had even six million vacant jobs open until April of two thousand Seventeen\nNow we have an historic seven point one million jobs open that means employers are looking to hire that many people\nThat equals a roaring economy that equals no problem getting a job if you want one with that many job openings it is and employ ease market if there's that much demand for employees the employees\nCan set the terms based on their level of expertise that experience with whatever it is they're applying for none of this in the world of common sense\nSuggests that people would be unhappy by it or about it ever want to reject it and yet that's exactly what we're being told that the American people are sick and tired day hey Trump they despise Trump they're embarrassed by Trump they were barest by their vote\nAnd yet\nIsn't a federal Lincoln bit of evidence that people have turned around and want to vote Democrat\nIncluding the two thousand six game presidential election\nOr those of us shouting at me ... what what what was don't fool yourself Hillary won the popular will be three ...\nIn Des Moines our top local story this hour after months and months of detours in waiting around a couple of major road construction projects

I couldn't think of it Elizabeth Warren\nAll four of them\nAre just raided damaging October surprise backfires for the Democratic party Elizabeth Warren tweeted twenty different times yesterday about this\n\nNow I'm not a denizen of Twitter\nBut I Know a lot of people who are and then the Twitter verse that's considered a meltdown\nWhen you tweak twenty times in an attempt to persuade people\nTwenty times attempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown and again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying right along with her\nThe Stanford University researcher who studies to focus on us this DNA\nDid not actually use samples of Native American DNA the Boston Globe quote to make up for the dearth of Native American DNA\nDr Carlos ... samples from may go ... in Columbia to stand in for Native Americans now\nShe's out there touting that it's true or she is an empty you got one one thousand twenty fourth\nAnd there wasn't even any in the in our Native American DNA tested and which she could be said to have in common or compared to I mean it's laughable it is the static\nAnd I think this is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton's making a fool of herself each and every now they're saying that what Bill Clinton did with Monica Lewinsky that was not abused that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult\n\nSo Hillary Clinton is making it asks herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the me too movement she's on you're cutting it\nAnd selling it out in order to save both herself and her husband or soon to be barking on what a stadium chore or yes\nBill and Hillary are going to mark a nationwide stadium to or where they're going to go and hopefully draw crowds of twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show on\nSay edge because of course they can't let Trump upstaged on like this I mean if we can do what they can do it if Trump can do and anybody can do it they're going to try to get in on it\nThere's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say\nNot like people care what Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say\nThere is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going to say there's just the it factor that\nTrump has the Hillary certainly does and they haven't never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent habit\nAnd I'm Talking about this ... type of charisma back in the nineties when he was running for president in shortly after the first term maybe he had it and they really they or I was expanded a bit by the fact that he was president but neither of these two are anywhere near the wake of Donald Trump you know what\nThis is why does it like the Democrats trying to come up with an answer to me in the first ten years in the spring and Gary Hart parents\nSome ... some of the state treasurer of Texas they gave a radio show Mario the pious they gave her radio show and the media highlighted every one of these Democrats radio talk show who'd never done it before as the rush killer\nEvery one of them was anointed end inaugurated as the Democrat that\nWas going to steal the limelight away from this program then Air America came along and uh and they did the same thing\nAnd it never has happened every attempt to supplant take over relegate this\nProgram ... security has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up\nTo get the kind of crowds and the one that you may think rush them enough rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest folks\nYou may think that what we're going to find out common sense will tell you Hillary Clinton could withdraw fly just do a\nBook selling party she couldn't draw applies to a campaign appearance that's why she didn't do very many of them it would have been embarrassing how few people showed up the ones there were big crowds they did in fact most people in\nThe country's

in the first place an apple watch is a slave to the phone\nAnd\nApple ... even if if the show he had a new watch the series for which he didn't because it hasn't been out long enough\n... but even if he did if he if he bought it in the United states and had it it's still not capable of L T E operation in Turkey apple has not yet brought\nLT each service to the to the I watch apple watch in Turkey which means that there is no way his watch could have worked independently of his phone\nNow there is an app there are a number of apps\nOne of the best ones is called just press record and on your watch it's just a giant red button you press it and it starts voice recording and it ends up saving the recording on your paired iPhone but the phone has to be within range\nAnd I'm I'm here to tell you with the fiance and the iPhone in the car outside of the concert was no way\nYou\nIts its maximum twenty yards Bluetooth that that connects watches to phones twenty yards twenty five hours I'm

have seemed to watch right taken it off\nA and they would have needed the fiance is iPhone to find out what was on it\n\nThe watch is still not an independent piece attack even watches that can operate under LT they still need to be fair to the phone there's not enough storage capacity on the watch to store the data of a recording it doesn't start at you can store I think up to a\nHundred songs maybe more now but for the most part that has to stream them it's not an independent device so the ... there probably is no evidence on the guys watch or even on the phone\nIt well the [noise] except for his heartbeat stopping not even that the phone will still have to be at some point put back in range and connected to the fun to watch wouldn't need to be back into close proximity the phone\nFor his heart rate data to show up on the phone\nIt's simply it's simply not possible what they're saying\nThe way they're saying it's not possible to watch is not independently capable of
