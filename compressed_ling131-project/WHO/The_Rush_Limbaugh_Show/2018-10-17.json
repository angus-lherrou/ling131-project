those votes for\nRight so Landis cooperative as about a hundred and fifty million bushels a storage space and we've got a processing plant in roles in Iowa so our strategy is to take the soybeans in Tacoma way um and\nAnd try to average the um the worst damage with a higher quality damage so that works well for the member and um and also it's the um the role of the cooperative here to help that

of struggling talked earlier today [noise]\nSo let's say there's some quality concerns or first with soybeans what what do you recommend doing because a terrible basis levels and in sub profitable level prices here what what options are out there\nBut I think the best thing producers can do is to be starting the crop we talked about that I think the last time I was on his don't make any of

basis wise is that all those things are the western us didn't have anywhere to go or we remove are we moving those around at all to try and change that you know\nReally not too much you know that's\nThe problem is we just don't have enough demand for soybean to work through all this big supply and there'll be there'll be times will uh\nMake exports sales will make products and that's when the will start to narrow the producers can take advantage of that but you have to be a very astute marketers very winter ... how do we get in touch with you Brian [noise]\nOur phone number directly

W. H. O. radio news fifty degrees and clear in the Des\nDown his nose but they didn't care because Obama was hip he didn't care because Obama was cool they didn't care because Obama was wiping out the Republicans except he wasn't Obama was enabling the Republicans wipe out the Democrats\nAs we discussed in great detail yesterday\nAnd ... came to me today\nHe said you know what you don't even know what you did yesterday I said well yeah I have a good memory and I I remember what I did know you don't know you don't remember what you did with your with your watch story I said you mean about the show he said yeah I said well what do you mean you blew up\nThe entire intelligence community excuse or story or having evidence of how ... they were out there saying that there were probably going to get proof of his interrogation and murder\nBecause it does apple watching here you'll come blowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's technologically not possible\nYou blow it up and you didn't even know what I said well no because I wasn't aware of they were using the watch as that central if at at elements\nProving their case but then when ... said this to me I have the pause I had to contemplate and then I had to consider it as a point\nBut there was one of these things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just I Know it's impossible there is no way that democracy\nThese watch could have recorded anything can happen to him and there's no way it could have\nTransmitted or transferred it\nTo his iPhone which was in the possession in his fiance in the car in the parking lot of the consulate there's just no way especially sense apple has yet to activate L T E service\nOn watches sold them operated in Turkey so on the last\n... had entered the password for the consulate why my network on his watch which I Know he didn't do because most people don't even know they have to do that most people don't even have a watch don't even know that watch will work on why five\nMost people think they got to have the phone right next to watch in Ninety nine percent of the time it right\nBut if you're a watch learns a wife I network like at your home that your phone logs into regularly then the phone to watch can access that I find that work independently of the phone if you're not close together\nBut only if you have answered that why fi networks password into your watch\nWhy five settings [laughter] I Know that this guy didn't do that [noise] [noise]\n[noise] I myself didn't learn you have to do this until a couple of years after I got my first one I mean that's how ... your a setting that it is anyway certainly since you just\nBlew up you blew up\nThe reason all these intelligence people were giving for knowing how he died you blow it up now they have to come up with something else\nI said well I was totally unaware he said well you should be aware because they're mad after [noise]\nNobody's mostly they they say the show was recorded the events have have to record on watching their base will say wow that's cool and then you come along and say no it's not possible\n[noise] another headline you probably have seen this so should've pressed Trump tells the a P he will not accept blame if the Republicans lose the house\nThe truth of the matter here is there are more stories today two or three more about the dissipating blue wave\nIncluding none other than the door yeah I'm\nA Democrat National Committee cheating and electric and bringing\nDown to Brazil\nWho strangely enough showed up on Fox that I should shut up a bill hammer down to Brazil did not go to CNN did they get rid of her because they found out she was sending answers to Hillary [noise] that's right\nSo see and I got rid of Fox willingly open are mentally had done it Brazil on and hammer was asking are all about the blue wave and other Democrats are planning to do this and that's well you know twenty days is a long time in ... bill\nAnd I don't scramble my eggs before my chickens hatch I said who is listening to hear Dan Rather\nI don't scramble my eggs until my chickens hatch\nShe said naming\nThere's so much she left it couldn't happen that we don't know that could affect the outcome here\nExactly my point\nThe impact of the election the events are they going to do that may not have happened including cabinet although although there is even more survey data now that the cabinet story was a one way benefits to the Republicans that he has not benefited the Democrats\nAnd the Democrats are seen as the angry party\nAnd at the Kavanaugh scenario as it played out benefited and continues to benefit Republicans\nHold a media is getting a little worried the Elizabeth Warren folk honest thing blows up to the point they can't continue to carry the water for her it's dead\nBut rock Obama is refusing to hit the campaign trail to drive by Senate Democrats are stunned shocked where is Bert rock where is our savior they're asking for Iraq's nowhere because you know what ... knows he doesn't help people on the campaign\nTrail he\nWas like Obama's going to put his reputation on the line here the only way Obama wouldn't put his reputation on the line here start campaigning is if this blue wave weren't\nA deadlock if the blue wave or why are you still hear me [noise]\nOh yeah I got a couple of stories Democrats upset whereas Obama they're asking worst Brock at least villain Hillary are going on a stadium tour nobody wants that\nThey can't find mama I'm telling you Obama is not going to GO Campaign in a situation because of the blue wave is not a lock and that's the only way he would show up for Rocco mama doesn't help Democrats go take a look he doesn't have coattails\nIt's during Obama the Democrats lost those twelve hundred seats and in right he campaigned for Hillary two thousand sixteen remember how he\nDid it do you want a third term of ... if you want me since we continue you know do you vote for Hillary at what happened to\nNormal just Trump was the ... late at night Hillary Rodham running them and so\nHe's not there\nSo it's all falling apart and these two three stories here on this on this dissipating blue wave and Donald Brazil's Enron now I'm not sure you know it's a long time\nTwenty days so the a P pulling out all the stops Trump tells a piece he won't accept blame of GOP loses this is not what he said and this is why Trump is in the media all day it's the only way he can counter the fake news in the lives that they tell about\nIt here's how the story begins facing the prospect of bruising electoral defeat in congressional elections\nPresident Donald horse faced Trump said Tuesday that he will not accept the blame if his party loses control of the house in November and a wide ranging and is there any other kind of interview\nThem wide ranging you think that's not a cut and paste job in every media is how about a narrow scope interview we ever had one of those you know they're always a\nWide ranging interview uh three weeks before election day Trump dismissed suggestions that he might take responsibility as his predecessor Denver midterm losses\nOr view of the outcome is a referendum on his presidency said no I think I'm helping people\nI don't believe anybody has ever had this kind of in fact that's what he said he never said don't blame me\n\nCan I read the transcript of the interview this is CNN's transcript of the AP interview and their headline\nTrump tells a piece he won't accept blame of GOP loses house ready [noise] three two one\nHey Pete reporter okay so my question is if Republicans want to lose control of the house and a ... or a couple of days later depending on how long it takes count the votes do you believe that you'll bear some responsibility for that no I think I'm helping people\nLook I'm forty eight and one in the primaries actually it's much higher than that because I endorsed a lot of people that were successful\nThat people don't even talk about but many of those for the aid is you know where people that had no chance in some cases\nWe look at Florida you look at Donovan in Staten Island he was losing by ten points I endorsed him he won I can give you a long list of names look at Georgia governor many many races and I will say that we have a very big impact I don't believe anybody's ever had this kind of impact that I'm having they would say\nThat in the old days and if you got the support of a president or if you got the support or somebody it would be nice to have but it meant nothing zero like literally zero well some of the people live indoors to have gone up\nForty and fifty points just on the endorsement in nowhere in that statement does Donald Trump say\n\nHe doesn't even addressed the house being lost he doesn't even accept that\nA penny offers it as a premise told they say if Republicans lose control the house with a ... do you believe you better responses but no\nIt's one thirty I'm Christian ...

Don moment is wrapped it up mowing his smaller is gonna be releasing at\nAny moment I got to be talking about before them in terms in hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping\nThat the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done we'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump stole the election is imminent\nThat is what they're hoping they are hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed up near the ill educated under educated on the educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time before this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that well then he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is they will create\nThis cloud of suspicion this cloud of\nDanger that\nPort handles disaster for Trump they'll referenced this each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms wouldn't\nBlow it releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might all of\nThis is going to happen to one degree or another to second thing\nThis tells me is that Mahler himself is waving to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really end\nThis because his report goes to Rosenstein\nFor for ... when does your support for Trump again\nDuring the campaign OK okay or the campaign and one of the reasons that I think\nDuring the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay against a seven anyway he um I became\nA a Trump supporter one of the reasons was because she's got to be so good for the country and he is and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life that these people are happy to see the country doing well\nThat's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair and my dad was a Democrat my mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy in trying to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high\nRight now for not only myself people in the neighborhood because you said it before it was you were gardening um he said the Trump ...\nAnd he says is the only reason the only way I can get my message out well his tweets are good but not that many people really hear it and I can understand why he is not addressed the nation I don't understand ...\nWait a minute when you say when you say packing it you mean you're about to abandon from\nNot advantage Trump but I'm really losing a lot of energy and frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn your preaching to the choir which ... most of the time and the press conference they ... they skew anyway\nSo if he addresses the nation and he should he should be proud of what he's done the greatest time economically that I can never remember it I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like is\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very ... I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made in the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit\nFor the country doing well in that shocks you write\n[noise] you know not anymore it's a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country\nThey really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen how we can take the bullets day after day I mean he's ... guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with us from because he won't do a national address and try to reach people that his tweets don't read your audience that he that he doesn't reach but your real frustration the U.S\nIs with a news media and many people are in the same boat who are doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't ... it ... me it baffles me out of the country so it was so well and so many people are going to go out and vote and they have no idea they newscast and they\nWhy do you think you are a well why do you think you're one of the few people that let realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListened to you if you read\nThat but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with\nAll the jobs and all of them are wages going up\nOr am I ever seen anything my\nPoint is I think you can be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of this and that more people are aware of it then you may know and of course\nIt could be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse lie about it and you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard with Warren here they could not cherry Tobar surprised they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievement\nTake a break but there has to have to say rush public by being met worry\nRenews in Iowa depends on you\nAll right to all of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy five are older and only one hundred thousand dollar life insurance rosy or larger I Want you to get a pen and I want you to write this information down\nIf your age Seventy five year old and I'm a hundred thousand dollar or larger life policy did you know you can convert that my policy into cash right now I'm not kidding you can turn your life insurance policy and the cold hard cash I Know the economy's been a struggle for many people need cash they need it right away\nAnd you can get cash right away for your life ... if you're over Seventy five you have a one hundred thousand dollar or larger life almost you don't want you to write this number down give these folks who call it's all free get rid of those insurance premium stopping those turn that policy and a cash right this number down eight four four\nWe buy Seventy five use the cash to pay bills medical bills whatever go eat ...

recreational facility\nAnd it's amazing how honest if he is about what journalism is now this is not about\nContemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current\nIn either country it is a\nModern era of generic piece in other words the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's big one of them small one of\nThem is very serious take them very seriously don't do tabloid anything don't focus on celebrities and the other one is nothing more than pure trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is but one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does\nIt's flat out amazing how honest it is in terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people both of these papers in this in this miniseries ended up targeting the same targets\nThe same powerful people some of them in government some of them out or some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the big people powerful people rich people\nThere obviously has to be something they're doing with breaking the rules in the gun suits breaking the rules there has to be something mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out\nAnd and and ruin them which many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target I was never\nI had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that\nThat that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it and they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist in these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a or a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbs led if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\nAnd it remains so today it's just\nIt's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day and I was Donald Trump\nAnd any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin on it's all\nAbout destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them and and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watched this I've seen two episodes so far out of the ... and I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brave in early on is this is one of the the editor\nThe head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is fixable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected by life\nTo him everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why his favorite his philosophy in life and the way he guides\nHis journalists is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\nWent to great lengths to show how this this Lees editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there they they have some kind of a relationship not particularly like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word to file\n\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being a Pete if I was about somebody else for the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in in the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you would have ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like it live with it\n\nAnd the president I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to post or the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise]\nIt's just it's ... it's it's perfect if the kinds of personalities you would have to be if your job is destroying people\nNo conscience the belief\nThat everybody is flawed that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\n\nNobody is decent nobody is white [laughter] it's amazing how this in the eyes\nOf a journalist an editor\nNow I imagine real journalists are going to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's\nIt exposes too much uh\nPeople have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than the entertained by it it just starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women the competing\nEditor of the clean paper or the above board and paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirm the Peter file story while the other paper\nPuts it on the cover of having confirmed it because the editor at the other ... doesn't care whether it's true or not wondering calls they got as Peter found just get it up there and get it on the newsstands or as the female editor didn't have the guts to run it and sell the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking\nThey obviously are not worried about me too movement here\nEver put this thing together so the name of this press\nI have no idea it's it's I think it it just completed airing 'cause I've got all six of them so I just compete in completed it's um it's run cycle in the u._k. which means it's going to be on Netflix\nAmazon Prime wherever I don't know where it's going to be but it won't be long and if you remember me talking about it here and if you watch these kinds of things it's it's fascinating 'cause it's not about politics not about current but it's not about Trump is not about conservatives liberals any of that\n[noise] if it's it's bad hit\nEverybody everybody as a rubber meets including the people at the papers\nThe reporters uh\nI I have to admit I was so [noise] anyway here's Donald Brazil now I Would I did not lose my place she's with Bill hammered a day and they're talking about the blue wave where she thinks we're headed\nAnd remember now this is a woman that used to be one of the head honcho those are the DNC the Democratic party who in hurting normal countenance would be out there's oh yeah boy wave Democrat's gonna win ... gets it's our time people are fed up but that's not how she found\nHow many days in a long time in politics [laughter] I'm not breaking out the champagne and I'm not trying to scramble my eggs before I get my chickens why we still have to improve turnout turnout turnout turnout democratic victory depends on turnout among millennials one on a farm millennials voted in the last midterm\nWe also got to make sure that we pay way before we can get a blue tie we need these ...\nTo when they're wearing says I'm confident not overconfident if you asked me today well but I Do differently in

universally opposed to him\nAnother poll quote at this point in Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved for the job he was doing and that was after\nThe failed pork you it was\nIt was
