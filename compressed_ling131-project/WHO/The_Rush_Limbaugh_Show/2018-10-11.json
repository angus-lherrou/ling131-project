five one five nine nine nine fifty four Ninety One nine nine nine five\nFor nine one [noise] twelve fifty three winding down the big show clock here Bob when the big show dug through fourth markets Andy as well Andy we have on the telephone line with us Don rose with the U.S commodities and you've been using dawn in the three big things today\nUm we've been talking about are one of the big things that came out by eleven o'clock was the USDA reporting ... give us the or the bullet points give us the highlights there\nYeah good afternoon when you look at it I think the surprise on the report was that you went down six tenths of Bush on corn usually it goes up I think the other thing was the ... acre harvested acres on soybeans went down six hundred thousand acres\nAnd the yield only one up a three camps they left the demand completely un changed on soybeans and change the experts at all\nAnd they took the export up on core and so ah are balanced table is uh just over one point eight billion in corn but still I have the eight hundred and eighty five million on soybeans but I think the question mark Bob is heavily stock in a harvest low\n[noise] well it's interesting Don usually big crops get bigger and court at least going the other way is that based on harvest results\nYou know I think it is I think when you look at it so far these deals I think number one remember we had just lost the yield already dialed in so I think it was just probably over shot a and the government did have ... ... under test plots\nAnd it looks like the U.S they've ... somewhere around Seventy five percent of those so um you know a little more accurate but um you know and the government didn't account for the weather issues that we have also\nUh this is the first of October and we all do we've had issues with harvest here in the west or mid west so that one it may be out in front of us yet when you looked at the November report\nBut do you think about a a weather losses on corn and beans with some rotting issues or some pot issues [noise]\nWell I think I think you have to say that that's a good possibility here that we'll see how the weather goes the rest of the ah the harvest here but uh you know when you know up in the Dakotas when you have a flooding yet down in the delta and you have the big water logged areas of the mid west\nIt certainly isn't the normal harvest that you would like to get a crop out with good quality like we had last year\nWhat about a non harvests double acres is there a possibility with the all the ... that is particular soybean wise that could play a role\nIt could play overall I think we'll have to watch that and the and\nCertainly the government took a Kansas guild ah acres down about four hundred thousand and uh you know from some uh issues down there so it's possible that that those acres usually they have it most of it adjusted right now but it's still work in progress here and\nYou know I don't think you want to get to bound up that this is just a crazy bullish a market\nBecause you're still lugging around eight hundred eighty five million a ending stocks on soybeans which is monstrous and all time record on soybeans\nBut I think what it says is you know do you have to get real negative here either it's the carry on the market that you have to make sure that you can uh somehow capture as you go forward\nYeah I wanted to ask you about this to us you and ask him up today with their I'm twenty eight Tina ... statistics that hundred and twelve page\nUm thing that'll give you a headache if you try to read all of it but it it shows again that the cost of production is below or above the average market price done so a lot of ... on foreign storage is what it suggests\nWell that's exactly right and the and I think what we're saying is this is a crop when it's large and you've got some marketing opportunity spaces too wide carries are too big that you have to try and merchandise your way into a profitable situation I think you can do it but you have to be a you know able to use some of these tools so\nI think that's the key you know the other thing in this report the government left a Chinese imports and change so there you know sending a signal that the the global World Trade is not going to change a lot on soybeans all these for next year\nDo you mean what we've heard a lot of fear and a lot of hype is that what you're saying done [laughter]\nWell you know you you can have to read into the government and they said we're going to improve that there's\nGoing to ah you know eventually go away or they stay in that list in the world is going to buy the soybeans from us and sell them you know in the world so I'm you know you have to make them a function but it looks like it's not a completely lost you know on trade\nYeah Hey Don gotta run uh what's your eight hundred numbers\nYou can reach us at a one eight hundred two four seven for Osama bin Laden\nOn rose us commodities wants one wrapping up the big show any what was your cost encore and you say three forty eight\nA average post production on corn three forty eight and nine forty six on beans\nNine forty six on soybeans wow hey I'm ... Thanks Don for for joining us here and we did have a numbers come out\nA new a core number one eighty point seven bushels per acre new soybean number fifty three point one and he's going to get all those numbers up so you can look at it on the big show website as well thanks dug for markets and Jake for keeping us on\nTime for you folks for joining us back tomorrow with another edition fact a twenty two hours away how 'bout that wouldn't be talking more of the big show Rush Limbaugh about five minutes away here on your picture radio stations\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nI don't want to wait Joe ... and I arch radio station and on your age the radio Haiti already ADD\nUse radios and forty doubling you wait Joe\nSimon had you know I've interviewed Newt Gingrich a bunch of times but I can tell you that he's one of our great conservatives mines and there'll be here in Des Moines for one night only on a truck but if you don't get to hear him speak you'll get to ask questions you got to meet him it'll be a special night for a great tools ticket tax deductible\nSupport our American story so weak nice here on WHM radio I'll be that you should check audio tickets at an evening with new dot com that's an evening with new dot com doing right\nNow who has questions like what's my break even on corn what happens if I expand the heard much can I afford for cash rent in these and other financial questions ... with a magnifying the revolutionary management software from farm critter surfaces of America\nMagnify hopes delivered the financial inside you want for the profit you\nLearn more that the FCC is America\nDot com slash magnify that was by far my critic\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news trap began severe weather see news radio ... do you have\nIt's one o'clock on Christian ... the only way to a radio news forty\nBut he certainly was mad because he doesn't know what to do when confronted with abject ignorance like this how do you fight abject ignorance and prejudice and so forth [noise]\n[noise] and you don't you defeat it\nYou don't try to reason with it because it's impossible you defeat it I've got a chart here doesn't go well on the radio but it demonstrates that since Nineteen hundred you can find with all the charted hurricanes since Nineteen hundred you can find you know significant trend in either the frequency\nOr the intensity of major hurricanes striking Florida there simply is no evidence\nThat climate change manmade even exist and there certainly is no evidence that it has anything to do with hurricanes either the number of them are the intensity but that doesn't matter because the New York times and the rest of the drive by as are offered running cause they are hell bent\n\nOn getting people to ... and ... why what is the purpose because this promotes big government it promotes the notion of gigantic autocratic\nTyrannical government control over everything once you are the American citizens are blamed and can be blamed for everything that's wrong then you can be controlled to make sure that you start doing things right and don't keep doing things well that's what they want\nThis but in the process they don't even know\nWhat they're talking about this guy doesn't know hurricanes from thunderstorms he doesn't know cloud tops ... temperatures and it doesn't matter\nI Want to thank Mr surgery for being so sensitive in so concerned about it but I Wonder was surely you that these kinds of things no longer\n[noise] bother me other than the ... I I I Do get concerned it there's so much genuine ignorance existing now in positions that influence the thinking of other people I mean feminist studies\nAt universities I firmly believe has destroyed the futures\nOf way too many women it has just distorted life it's distorted gender differences and has distorted the concept of happiness victim ... it has distorted the whole concept of America the greatest place to live and grow up and seek opportunity in the world\nAnd it's to edit feminism is just one of many elements of liberalism that is doing the same thing too it's other constituency groups for example\nLet me ask a generic question where Eric Holder out there\nWho is campaigning for somebody to be governor of Georgia holders supposedly going to run for president himself and plenty funny or Eric Holder the attorney general for Rocco same\nAll involved in many scandals himself and I'm seeing a lot\nOf people on our side ... so called conservative intelligentsia shocked that Eric Holder was saying what he said you know on the show my bell Obama's out there saying no no my motto is when they go low we go high and holder said screw that when they go low meeting Republicans when they go low we kept them\n\nSo people's mind God these out their inciting violence and he said no no no no I didn't mean it literally\nI was saying that we can't take it anymore we after Scott being a nice guys and stopped taking it and he didn't mean it\nObama met him when he said they bring a knife we bring a gun Obama met at sodas Maxine Waters when they're both encouraging people would get in our faces they mean that\nThey are already inciting violence they inciting violence inside Capitol Hill buildings and elevators\nThey're engaging in bullying tactics my question is why why are the Democrats doing all this why are they inciting violence let's look at the things\nThat they think\nAre supposedly on their side things that are helpful to them we start with the fact that they are convinced that they're going to win control of the house\nIt's already done the blue wave it's just a matter of the day is on the calendar passing by until we got doing Boxing Day where we can confirm that the Democrats already won that remember we had a poll from CNN a sound bite John King couple of weeks ago\nHe resigned in the poll indicated that house races are over there are poll said the Democrats are likely winners of the house of representatives over in their minds they won the house in their minds they almost won the Senate\nThey have the Mueller report and the mother report is going to link Trump to Russia right they know that Mueller's got the goods all they can taste it fall folks\nThey can scratch their bags with it they just camp is aid and all that Mueller has secretly collected the goods they know that Mueller is going to issue a report and it's kind of tight Trump and Russia and it's going to prove the trumps stolen the election from Hillary Hillary shouldn't be president that should make them happy right\nWhy all the desperation CNN\nEngaging in full fledged one thousand percent racism and directed at Kanye West\n\nYeah Kanye West is what happens to one negro when he stops breathing that's what they said on CNN with Don Lemon laughing in New York and get all up wasn't that long ago the cover of time magazine\nWhen was this a\nTwo thousand five the drive by media proclaim Kanye West the smartest man in pop music\nHip hop class act\nThe firing the rules of rap Kanye West goes his own way [noise] so what would that be Thirteen Years ago Kanye West was the future\nKanye West was the hero but now Kanye West is having lunch at the White House than they would Trump as his Jim Brown\nBy the way Trump was funny that Trump Trump does it why did you do that rally why did you do that rally with a hurricane coming and climate change destroying them why they do get Trump said you know what\nYou have a point but there were people that have been a lined up for a day and a half to get into this either I couldn't disappoint them I had to go and it was a great time\nTrump to slam dunk to them on a number of things in a short little press availability at the White House\nSo now\nA CNN panel calls Kanye West a token negro\n\nListened black folks are about to trade Kanye West and the ratio draft okay they've had it with ...\nAll of a sudden cognac because he's put on a ... hat and he is\nHe's an attention horror like the president he's all of a sudden now the model spokesperson he's a token negro and the Trump Administration is ridiculous\nSays the CNN panel wider so mad folks\nWhy all the desperation they're going to win the house are going to win the Senate Muller is going to prove that Trump colluded with Russia\n\nBetween inciting violence is launching a racist attacks we're witnessing an attempt to bully the American population of surrender that is what's happening\nHere they're soft coup failed\nNow it's time for the second phase the soft coup that swear Rosen staying in the rest of the guys are gonna wiretapped Trump and going to wire Trump wear a wire and get Trump indicting himself for certain things he was saying they're going to get rid of Trump the FBI the deal Jay the Clinton Administration the soft coup it didn't work\n\nRemaining silent about the skill lease\nShooting should have been a clue of the Democrats depress the intentions of what I mean by that there was actually a shooting of Republicans and baseball practice in preparation of a joint Republican Democrat baseball game it's a traditional annual thing\nAnd a lunatic deranged Democrat fundraiser donors supporter from Illinois shows up starts firing him almost kills ... and the Democrats didn't say anything about it\nIn the media didn't condemn it there wasn't any condemnation there was there was an overwhelming silence that shouldn't have been and it was to me a clue\n\nTo the Democratic depravity American countries and now we've got Hillary now we've got Maxine Waters Eric Holder it's listed lead directing Democrats\nTo physically attacked\nWith CNN going full racist on a prominent black Trump supporter by the way they can see the polls Trump approval number African American community thirty five percent one year ago it was twenty three percent that's on the upswing\nForty four

Saudi I don't know if he is related to add ... not common ... is as a as a Saudi or Arab name and then they show he was a famous arms runner made famous as a celebrity by a\nA lifestyles are the rich

there are constant battle for power with in the royal family the crown prince is the chosen son is the air\nNow Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he has been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next king\nAs such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying theoretically to reform the ... are they the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol

guys obviously going to vote for the nearest democratic and finding this is how they're being inspired and further evidence that the Democrats are not about ideas and not about inspiring people to vote for them because of the great improvements it'll happen in their lives Nancy Pelosi [noise]\nRight here\nNancy Pelosi Trump's tax returns a top priority if Democrats win the house now how is that going to benefit your average Democrat voter\nWell I'll tell you how the Democrats have so poison their voters\nDemocratic voters want revenge not a job not raise not a bone is they want room ... hey Trump\nAnd so anything that Democrats can do to harm Trump why the Democrats will vote for who ever will promise to make Trump suffer\nYou think that's a majority of people you think that's the kind of stuff that creates a blue wave I don't\n[noise] I don't believe\nThat the country is that they're ... but the Democrats are counting on the fact they think it is\nOkay to the phones men in Fresno Europe first today great to have you with us or hide\nThey rash thanks for having me on Yes sir I so\nI was there I was in the uh for the three days of the nonsense last week I saw the the them screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so what I Know was\nThis is all they have the reason that they continue the reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense she said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan if it's the only game plan they have\nAnd they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this this is an old game we don't find any more\nAnd and they have nothing else to claim there's nothing else for them to but they just keep doing the same market and the book in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that hold on here that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind they do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented\nKavanaugh was confirmed\nEverything they've done to stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing\nAnd you think they're in a fit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing in a new policies to counter Trump's 'cause they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when they're both\nThe right loses when were silent and they it for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away it\nWell that that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters and certainly conservative media uh well ... conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working the rats lying\nYup threats lying all of that\nAnd and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works is if we don't show up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win in a landslide\nBecause they know that if they can to sway does that they can discouraging us enough to make us not go up that's the only way they win but if Republicans conservative stand up\nWhen every single time we just have\nTo show up we have to convince other people to show up you convince them to convince other people to show\nYou say you're in Washington for three days what did you actually see what kind of activities really engaged\nWe had thousands of people lined up by the time I had to make a decision so my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours already\nThat I'm not coming and uh I just thought it would be and we're talking about thousands of people you know when they get there that early and who you know that area obviously is not affected at all by as we had it under the great control I don't think really\nThe grocery hot relative to other things I think it was very minor\nSo president essentially saying look these people are lined up they've expected me to show up I follow through I Do what I say I'm going to do\nThe hurricane was going to do what it did and there's nothing I could have done about it last night when I was in this rally my people are down there working on it we got it covered\nI can do both and I'm following through on the commitment so\nThe next question in from the do somebody who probably is not going to vote for you Eric Holder\nFormer attorney\nGeneral said they go low we kick him and the whole room Mr President started clapping and cheering when he said that what does that say to you about the tenor of politics the better be\nCareful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's way way up to discuss things safe and for him to make your is a very dangerous day for older [noise]\nWhat is held in contempt by Congress colder when after Christians he went after our great evangelicals he went after the Tea Party people you know that they just settled the IRS just settle that case\nA holder is they've got some problems\nNot used to be totally do like this in the old days Eric Holder can say whatever you send them to Republicans at Wimbledon away or not even acknowledge or or they would say something\nWe strongest term oh we'd denounce\nRhetoric go out and buy a attorney general holder or it was about ... but much ... totally totally uncalled for and we we routinely you know you don't like to condemn it\n[laughter] ... [laughter]\nYou better be careful [laughter] he's wishing for [laughter] that I can tell you that I could he'd better be careful\nWhat he's wishing now the stock market's been kind of see song it's been a roller coaster ring\nAnd Trump is suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you something folks there are a number of wealthy\nDemocrat Wall Street types investors people that run hedge funds who I Am convinced would willingly take a bit of a financial hit\nTo their wealth and businesses primarily their business is not that well but they would they would David in person pain if it meant\nLowering economic activity on enough to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there aren't enough looney tunes on the left who would willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said and of course it\nFlies in the face of the Democrats in the media tried\nTo say when it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave it I Believe it looking our polling data people\nObviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried that this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to come up with the Republicans\nIn the midterms and so there is a monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling causing the stock market the roller coaster and here is Trump was pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute so when I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now or a four point two percent\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression that was the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter] don't forget Obama's was playing with zero money so he was playing with funny money he was it was very easy [noise]\nI'm paying interest at a high rate because of our fed and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation he is worried maybe accusing the federal\nReserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well that traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried when the economy's going great\nMy whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why\nAnd let's look at the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy is a great performing and growing economies so frightening\nTo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed do they leak they leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets\nIf these people think defense is going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy at the time totally unnecessary for it right before an election and he's calling them out\nHe's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump from the ... no\nYou may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way\nAnd the Federal Reserve German the odds are that the number of the board of governors are going to be you know a bunch of\nTommy leftists as they are at many financial institutions are not going to pretty strictly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning the cause of drunk\nSo Trump calling them out on it he says there's no reason to start raising rates right now right before the election was why things down so they react to it\nAnd and this rollercoaster stock market day actually ended up being only a one day roller coaster I think there's positive action today I Will I Will check it ah let's see one more thing here do we have yeah\nA ... heart\nSo your wife recently had an interview she said there are people in the White House she doesn't trust people you don't trust that you have to watch your back is that true and if that is the case why are these people you don't trust still in the administration\nWe have great people right now are more kids are there are some that I Am\nA not in love with us and we'll weed them out slowly but surely\nUrban some other embarrassing leaks are you any closer to figuring out who these people are\nWell let me get my legs I think a lot of the lake so not to link that made up by the newspapers the media is very very dishonest beyond anything that anybody can understand\nNow even the letter written to the times that there is a chance there is a very good chance that that was written by the time I wouldn't be that surprised because at times is totally corrupt and dishonest\nWhere did you first hear that right here\nWho was the first or maybe the only person to suggest that the times itself wrote that piece that memo that some pose a memo written by an angry staffer\nIn the Trump Administration claiming their up close and personal things the president doesn't know what he's doing but don't worry there are adults in the room and we're doing everything we can to stop this guy we're conservative they\nWe love business and they started a massive manhunt to find out who did this and

[noise] honors did\nExactly the opposite he was judge jury and not executioner but a probation officer for Hillary jade did it violated all of it so why did he get away with it and nobody else can I don't understand I really don't\nUh who is ... call me you can call me going to go ahead I'm Sorry [noise]\nYeah I'm I made the same point when I heard they don't drunk and ... call me exonerated her before even interviewing her\nJudge jury and probation officer\nRight and and we all know the reason why she was a Democrat nominee their jobs and futures end the shenanigans they had pulled\nRequired her to win for them to stay employed and for the tricks they had pulled on Trump to remain unknown so she had to be exonerated she had to be found not guilty and not even charged\nIn relation to the emails and the ... in the trafficking in classified data and so forth [noise] see I have the same reaction you ... what do you mean it'll come out in collisions\nI under I understand that that you had to get off but he did not have the right to he was not a judge it was never in trial\nIt was oh wait wait wait wait he claimed that he did because\nLoretta Lynch ended up having to her she didn't officially recused but because she met was slick willy\nOn the plane on the tarmac out in Phoenix Coney said she's compromise so he basically took over the gang of a gene for the purposes of exonerated Hillary and he went out there on July fifth did that press conference under the auspices of making the decisions because Loretta Lynch couldn't\nThere why can't we just ... open it and say it didn't have the legal right to make a decision so let's start over from\nWhere he just gave that speech\nI agree with you and this is why you're not the only one Devon newness and a bunch of his other house members that are on the house Judiciary Committee\nAre hell bent on getting to the bottom of this\nAnd not letting these people get away with it they have been on the investigated and that's not the right word they haven't even been invest they haven't been to look that\nYou've got the special counsel what you're saying nor ring the real crimes and criminality that's taken place while spending all of his time trying to find the crime that they can\nLay on Trump and they haven't been able to it's frustrating\nThis is why by the way there isn't cruising frustration at the president for not declassify these documents that will answer\nThe question you're asking don't understand why why the president is protecting Rosen stain the guy who end up meeting suggested wearing a wire in his next meeting with Trump to try to get incriminating evidence that Trump's unfit\nNever got to gather the cabinet after Rosen's dean had\nHad a conversation with Trump which supposedly was going to show that Trump is insane and on and fit and they were going to play that for the cabinet to try to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment Rosen's day and so I'm just kidding I just it was the people in the meeting say he was not getting none of us were\nAnd I believe that I Believe these people back then were hell bent on getting rid of Trump\nI think they still are I I think I think official Washington the political media complex of washing it is still\nInside outing upside down over Trump and I think what every success and every smile on Trump's face with every\nPiece of evidence that Trump is enjoying\nThis I think they go a little further insane each and every time the Trump succeeds is something that Trump has not damaged by saying every effort everything they've done to take Trump out I think they are beyond frustrated that it hasn't worked\nAnd I don't think they are giving up on it I don't think they will give up on it and now they're Rosenstein Rosenstein however pronounces it hurt it both ways [noise]\nThis is really curious Trump had him\nA on air force one people thought that roses you know what he's got to be fired after this after credibly being discovered\nSuggesting wearing a wire to win trap the president if he got to go but Trump says I got a great relationship with the guy I'm not letting them go I'm not doing anything about that now and I'm not declassify those documents yet\nThat people are scratching their heads a as to as to why\n\nSome are saying it's just the election rush ... not going to do any of this still after the midterms
