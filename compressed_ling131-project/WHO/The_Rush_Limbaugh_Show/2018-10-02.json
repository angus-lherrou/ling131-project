H. O. radio news showers moving in from the west they are approaching the Des Moines metro area and moving across North eastern Iowa as well details on the weather forecast coming up our top story this hour\nKnow the question was [laughter] oh no Harry the polls are tightening oh my God no well what does that tell you what what [noise]\nWhat what what's going on\nHere we are so many races that are within the margin of error Missouri Nevada\nTennessee Florida the list goes on and on and on we have all of these close races which means we have a better estimate about what might happen in the Senate come November but it really could be a democratic wave or could be a Republican wave at the polls are often wonder wave in the Senate and the house in the ... not in the house\nRepublican wave in the Senate all know that means no impeachment of Trump means an impeachment of the Democrats get the house don't think so but if they do it would die in the Senate unless there's a bunch of Jeff Flake\nClones in there because they would never vote to what to convict if the Republicans hold a senator even swelled ranks so the panicked host Jim surely couldn't believe when he heard their blue wave red white and\nHe says there was discussion of a blue wave big generic battled advantage for Democrats you'll notice the tightening their as we get closer to the election\nI Will say the generic ballot does seem to be tightening a little bit which is good news for Republicans I think that you know there's a lot of talk all with Brett Kavanaugh on this whole confirmation math that in fact that might hurt Republican but it doesn't actually seem to be so far we're actually seeing some tightening in the Senate races and more than that we're seeing tightening of the house races\nI'm an only get a little ... observation about this but what did I tell ya eastern very ballots\nThe way back last December that's when they first started harping on this\nAnd back then you know nine months ago the\nDemocrats had a twelve point advantage and that's when all the talk of a blue wave began and\nThat's what all the talk of the Democrats winning ... Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of them are Democrats once again broke away and all during it I your host have been doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything me remind you\nOf a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won bill that will check\nPrior to one of the super bowl the patriots were empty might do it frequently I ... I Know of one time\nHe gathered the players for a team meeting and so we're gonna have more fun we're going to watch a horse race he had videotape of a horse race that nobody is saying it was not a big race is that allow the players to make friends leave bats and wages on who was going to win\nSo the players made their bats and Donald ... starts the tape of the race and stops it at the first term it's OK\nLayer about somebody who's gonna win players go nuts making their choices\nTape resumes that much ... stops at at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their bats have the final turn ballot checked stops the tape but the horse racing again asks the players if they want to make an additional ... or get out of ones\nThey've made players do what they do that much ... resumes tape to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known after first turn at the halfway point or at the final turn who is going to win yet look what you want to do what you were making maps you bring guessing somebody you're probably were certain the bottom line is finish\nYou never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you it was a motivational\nTechnique designed to get the players to realize first quarter half time a third quarter\nFinish doing your job\nSame thing here posing January\nIn front of ... election doesn't mean anything\nPolls in June July don't mean anything they're interesting for the media which is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but at the polls do not give any indication the final outcome appalled in July or August would not contained any of the Kavanaugh\nNews so how relevant could've been answered none zilch zero not up\nAnd so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking\nRacist or type thing in the house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot\nThey've had this in in in the in the can that's been in the bank since last December in their minds it's been over it's just a matter of letting the calendar play out now all of a sudden house races\nAre tightening and there could be a blue wave in the Senate\nBut wave red wave and the Republicans could come out of nowhere at about fine old her in and take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August we don't know anything\nAnd we don't know anything now and we won't know what did they get into the day after\nElection day or maybe later that night [noise] now one of the brief observation here once again do you notice Mr engines knock it in there\n\nI think you know there's a lot of talk Brett Kavanaugh this whole confirmation mess that in fact might hurt Republicans it doesn't seem to be so\nLadies and gentlemen high and the reason he saying this and everybody else because of my viral prediction of last week that if Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh as the Democrats are going to win everything that production\nOf mine went by blood drive by is loved it they love it when the leader of the G O P reminds me starts ripping the Republicans when I start predicting Louis that's when I become totally credible that's when they run the sound bites me predicting in all over the world\n\nYou notice how easy it would be to trick them they run with that and they right now all of a sudden it's just being tanked opposite\nIs just the exact opposite why all of this attention on Capitol on what the Republican is actually going to help them how can that the literature on just said they were gonna knows\nThey are totally totally confused\nAnd as I said yesterday what what what is the sense in saying that we have to lose in order to win you know people will lead Kevin I'll go down that are really find them up that will fire buddy up no the way you get on the bandwagon the way you get people on the bandwagon the way you get people wanting to be on your team is when\nIncluding winning\nThe capital nomination now let's go to further news is about to assist some of this from the hill dot com red state Democrats face nightmare scenario on cabinet\n\nThis article shows beyond doubt that Democrats have brought up all of these unfounded sexual allegations announce cabinet you realize the\nLatest defense the New York times has run the

being\nPublished are printed that wasn't enough to that I mean put some ice on that live there that that no news there but Kavanaugh throwing ice allegedly on a buyer patron stop the presses the guy is evil he is not qualify\nSo all these unfounded sexual allegations they hope ultimately what all this has been about hoping to force Kevin ought to drop out that's what they have\nJust just like the mother investigation Mueller investigation was designed to depress Trump's approval numbers on the Trump would have to resign because of total loss of support in Washington by\nRepublicans and they can get his approval numbers down to the twenties because they succeeded make everybody think a Trump treated with the Russians and Trump would lose all support as Nixon did in the Watergate era and have to resign that was the objective\nBecause there's no way they were going to impeach Trump to know where the mother investigation is going to lead the Trump being indicted they only hope they had was to drive public approval for Trump way down the twenties and be done to look at\nWhat they're trying to do here is force Kavanaugh to resign from\nThe nomination withdraw or the force Trump to withdraw that and the way\nThey still hope that they can force capital out\nA second Democrat is from the article here to heal dot com second Democrat Senator said there's widespread disbelief in the

voice on the right in Nineteen Ninety two I was at some local talk shows but\nCNN's the only cable out there is no Fox News there is no blogosphere theres no new alternative media uh aren't really

my never\nEnding quest to have people understand who liberals are how thick and given men did did\nThey are this is what passes for humor on the left\nThis is what passes for comedy this is the kind

bubble has been established as anywhere near true [noise]\nAnd it's just it flies in the face of of decency you know you run out of descriptive adjectives\nWhen trying to describe this kind of thing that's why I have settled on the fact that we're really dealing with a bunch of people who at some\nPoint in their lives have suffered psychological as the events that have led the psychological disorders and they found themselves now as the mainstream of the Democratic\nIn their self esteem related to their power that when they see evidence that people are ignoring what they say it hurts
