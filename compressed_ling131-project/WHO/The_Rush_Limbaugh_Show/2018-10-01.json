H. O. radio news still cloudy and rainy drizzly and foggy day as well we've had some slow down but I thirty five because of the dense fog this morning\nSo where renegotiating NAFTA Canada Canada which said they want to know part of it they ask in the last moment hey don't forget that can we be why did this to\nRob said come on in a reporter just asked Trump what about just meaning into terrorist jumps in hell no I mean the end of tariffs\nIf the European Union continues to send unfair trade deal related products into the United states we're going to slap tariffs on\n\nHow the drive by the Democrats slapping tariffs on Chinese goods was gonna provoke the ... couldn't possibly be good at might mean the end of what ever Rangel or making what the North Korea and it might destroy existing good relations with the dry comes\nUp up breaking news China to cut import tariffs on a wide range of products China\nBut try comes we'll cut import tariffs on textile products and medals including the new products too\nEight for like eight point four percent down from eleven and a half percent effective November first according to the tri calm finance ministry yesterday\nThe track I was a pleasure to take steps to increase imports that means products from us\nThis year amid rising tension with some of its biggest trading partners such as the United states bottom line Trump said he was going to do X Y and Z and a B and C in trade and if we started a B and C I think he's pretty much closing in on see\nHe has rebuilt the economy he has created new jobs his economic policies have uh the elimination of onerous regulations which is an ongoing thing continues to show vast benefits\nFor Amri ordinary American who makes this country work and it's something he said could be done to only he could do and in fact he was the only one that thought it was necessary to do\nAnd it's not done here is the president today at the White House Rose Garden we have three ...\nI have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made\nSince NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars and it's a much higher number than that\nWith Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of money at the last four point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four or do jobs was about twenty five percent of our on our jobs even more than that throughout the campaign promise to renegotiate NAFTA\nAnd today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour the press maybe even longer than maybe forty five minutes I'm In an extended\nStatement\nOnly recently started taking questions will tell you what Trump is doing here which is something that I Belong advocate that he wasn't just announcing the deal got done he was teaching why it was important including the drive by media who for the most part are clueless\nUh don't understand capitalism a think that it's a big bad Mimi\nAnd Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how ... works\nAnd how the United states has been victimized over the course of a many many years because of American leadership believing well you know where the superpower in the world where the richest we can afford to take it in a short now and then if it promotes good relations with our allies\nAnd Trump stood up and said there's no reason that we should have our back pockets\nPicket there's no reason that we should just let people have what ever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy at doesn't mean that because we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not having ... on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trained works why it is important how the United states was getting the shaft\nBut more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs in their careers\nIncluding farmers and a number of other type people about whom Washington thinks\nNot very off and thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question\nThat Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about and he got to run the rings around people in this in discussing the process and in discussing this substance\nAnd the details of this new agreement does it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame everybody that has a chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened and why we benefit and why that is good\nAnd you know teaching as well as announcing is fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it\nMade the mistake of believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country and overnight turned conservative and so when they began to announce this cut that cut this reform that reform a lot of people didn't know what they were talking about I got scared to death\nAt lesson has been learned by none other than a dozen oldest Trump here's the next bite Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with us [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] it's kind of thinking we haven't seen\nWe've seen thinking and but both parties who who believe that that it's up to us\nA ... in the\nRespect of others it's up to us to show them that we don't intend them any harm it's up to us and Trump's turning this a hundred and eighty degrees around so it's a privilege to trade with us we're the world economy\nWhere the future of the world economy where the future of world freedom and liberty to the days of the America as the world's piggy bank are\nOver steel will also imposes new standards requiring at least Seventy five percent of every automobile to be made in North America in order to qualify for the privilege of free access to our markets it's a privilege for them\nTo do business with us and I'm not talking about Mexico ... I'm Talking about everybody everybody\nIs a privilege for China\nTo do business with us it's a privilege for the European Union who is treated us very badly but that's coming along to do business with U.S Japan every country is a privilege for them to come in and attack the piggy bank\nYeah it's a privilege to come down and as I as I say if folks it's it's a new way of seeing ourselves and our country without the need to make excuses without the need to apologize\nWe really we really haven't as you know you can see evidence and scientists on our own culture of the achieved and they accomplished somehow feel the need to apologize\nFor it or to downplay it\nAs some sort of new definition of humility a rather than having used as a teachable moment there's something inspiring\nIs this Trump points out we want every country making that country great we want every country putting their country first we want everybody doing it that way that's the whole point for everybody\nTo do better but not by piggy bank in the United states by doing it on their own these kinds of things are just they're ... they're far in the United nations types diplomatic types here's the final bite\nA don't don't forget who told you this was not possible do not forget it was ... Hussein ... who said none of this could be done\nThe remember the previous administration said we're not going to have manufacturing jobs anymore essentially\nWe're not going to have we're not going to make things anymore now just the opposite going to be a manufacturing powerhouse that allow us to reclaim a supply chain that has been off shored to the world because of ... fair trade issues\nSo there you have it it's um it's not a sexy subject NAFTA never was I mean it was in the command that a lot of attention a it was very controversial when it was ratified in the in the early in the mid Nineteen nineties\nBut in terms of being a subject that if if cable news announcer gonna do it two or three panels tonight on NAFTA trade deal and not going to have a lot of people tune in\nIt's just the way of the world so Trump is making sure with this extended event in the rose garden of the day that people get its importance in terms of its important says that election issue it's crucial\nIt is um I wouldn't say crucial but it's it's very important in terms of Trump being able to say to his voters stick with me I told you I was going to do this I told you it can be done and I told you the United states was\nCome out as the champion in the subject the world trade don't doubt me and in that sense it's a confidence inspiring that Trump left alone in the oval office free and clear it to be who he is will me in a bunch of great things happening\nAre topical story this hour a new agreement will be signed this afternoon at the Iowa State Capitol Taiwan is buying more soybeans from Iowa

tax deductible\nSupport our American story showed weeknight share on WHM radio oh me that you should audience tickets at an evening with new dot com that's an evening with new dot com doing it right now [noise]\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news traffic and severe weather station news radio ten forty\nThere's even a little story this developed about the uh her use of safe way\nThat she shopped in safe way a lot and that was new and the reason the the theory behind that is mark judge wrote a book as part of his therapy for alcohol and drug abuse he was told to write a book\nIt was it was supposed to be a fictional book it was it was a it was a an aide to attempt to help him through his\nProblems it was not a memoir\nAnd in this book it talks about safe way a lot and he works there didn't work there so she automatically places are self at a Safeway where\nHe is Rachel Mitchell found this highly suspicious and like much else that she said impossible to prove\nHer report I mean I printed it out it's like six pages here it it is devastating be inconsistencies in her stories the variables in her story\nThe facts\nNone of the stuff that matters can be proven the fact that the people she set in the room the number kept changing from the original letter to subsequent interviews and then to the\nTestimony she had the idea that she was afraid to fly and yet\nHere she is vacationing all over the world how did you get there the idea that she refused to talk to the committee even in California we learn that she didn't even know the committee had offered to fly out there because of the lawyers didn't tell her\nBy the way a couple of Republicans are not demanding an investigation Tom Cotton says we're going to investigate Feinstein we're going to investigate this leak and we're going to investigate these lawyers who may not have told her to the committee was willing to go out there because they believe that she was afraid to fly none of this was true\n\nSo I ... the idea that she's ... she's the last\nShe's not\nThe least credible witness in all of this and yet there she is automatically\n\nSaid to be credible every leftist supposedly\nReviewing her performance I found or her credible\nBased on what she was in such pain she was so so shaken by what happened all\nThose years ago you could say yeah because she really knew how to make it look like that I don't think for me I don't think any of this has been genuine I think it's all orchestrated I think a lot of its focus group that I think it's scripted\n\nAnd I just I because none of this past is any kind of a smell test anyway back to mark pencil\nVery quickly\nAmericans believe her and most believe Kavanaugh if the FBI finds no corroboration of the charges sixty percent believe Kevin all should be confirmed according to a weekend harbored a Harris Poll of the thousand three hundred and thirty registered voters\nSixty six percent of Americans support the decision to have the FBI investigate that includes eighty percent Democrats sixty nine percent independence with only forty five percent of\nRepublicans who are the smart ones\nHuge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about it forty percent thought she alone was credible\nTwenty three percent fought Kavanaugh was twenty seven percent said both verbally bubble if you combine all that the poll findings indicate sixty seven percent found her credible in fifty percent found him to be\n\nWhat the credibility of their testimony doesn't appear to be the decisive factor in ... the question comes down to collaboration is the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should have some of the high court in terms of the overall needle after the testimony was heard\n\nThirty seven percent say confirmed the nomination forty four percent St rejected Eighteen percent remain undecided Democrats going one way Republicans the other but\nBut but but but the hang on no get depressed\nOnce the voters are told that the named witnesses deny any knowledge of the allegation that ships from forty four percent or fifty seven percent in favor of confirmation meaning\nMeaning the people in this poll do not know did not know many of them did not know that the people she places in the room have denied being there\nAnd when the pollsters told them that in fact the numbers of people who thought he should be confirmed jump from forty to fifty seven percent and then up to sixty percent in a hypothetical question if the FBI\nAfter a wink agrees there is no cooperation for her story and they've already done that\nBut now we've got combing entering the picture now we've got to call me urging the FBI to keep digging the same FBI that's been running a silent coups FBI leaders trying to get rid of Trump\n\nI Want to grab a phone call because this guy has a great point and I want to add something to it this is a ... Jason Muskegon, Michigan Jason thank you so much for waiting I appreciate it how're you doing\nSaying no problem and thanks for letting me be part of the excellent [noise]\nWell I appreciate that you are you are here as part of the excellence by association [laughter]\nYeah I was thinking on that uh there's no better way to um motivate a group by attacking them in by attacking Kevin either basically essentially attacking the entire Republican base\nShowed up and sixteen and voted Trump and I'm part of that reason was for the Supreme Court nomination and here we are Democrats are going to make the midterms about a Supreme Court vacancy and they think that they can last year twenty twenty so they're not really pressing issue as hard as what Republicans could\nAnd knowing that if we want to get our guy in there you know we're going to have to show up and many germs are ...\nGoing to have an adverse effect that they keep the ...\nI've heard people say this I I'm a ... Jason here thinks that all of this is going to backfire on the Democrats and motivate Republicans to show up and vote not just now two thousand Eighteen but again\nFor Trump and twenty twenty or let's go to the audio soundbites on this Jason thank you much we're going to start here this is a boxing\nFriends weekend on Saturday morning Rachel Campos Duffy was one of the hosts\nIs talking to CBS em political corresponded David Brody\nAbout all this\nShe says well we know the Democrats all ready men really energized about the midterms I don't know how much more energized they could get\nBut I'm sensing that Republicans have become very energized this week this hearing has really fired and the Republicans\nUp from my reporting and found that the horrible evangelical base I can tell you they say the Democrats dirty tricks have riled them up like never before and I know Rush Limbaugh has talked about how if Kavanaugh is not confirmed it's gonna be real tough for the Republicans actually if Kavanaugh is not confirmed\nThat would even rile up that deplorable evangelical base in the ... I Believe even more at least the people that I'm hearing from and so\nI think that that's a big part of what's going on here\nNow like you you can't blame David Brody for being fifty percent informed because\nI I pulled back that original production after it had gone viral all over the drive\nBy media that's why it's still prominent in people's minds and my retraction of that production has barely received a whimper because it doesn't serve the drive by is any good when the drive by here me predicting Republican\nDoom they can't help themselves they got to put an all over the world in the media Rush Limbaugh says Republicans are going to lose house of capital not confirmed that production was based at a specific point in time on if the Republicans caved\nIf Republicans didn't fight for Kavanaugh if the Republicans just went bird out I predicted that what happened but once this began to unfold\nI retracted that production and set it could end up being the opposite here but of course that prediction didn't go viral and I want to\nJason in Muskegon I Want to thank you for bringing it up so that I could make the case here is one more a bite on this as a CSPAN Washington Journal Saturday morning Jess Holland is talking to a correspondent at the Weekly Standard\nAnd Andrew Edgar about me\nBeen several conservative including Rush Limbaugh who warned that Republicans could lose their majority if they don't get half a mile from the Supreme Court is that something that Republicans in Congress are really thinking about mid term consequences arguments\nLike the one that Limbaugh makes our little convenient on whether or not Kavanaugh gets through I think the whole situation is really fired up Republican voters\nSo once again somebody else you can't blame 'em folks don't get mad at him because my original production was everywhere I literally all over the world it was an Saudi\nDave ...

misunderstand me here\nShe is by no means the first women have been coming out of the woodwork claiming Hollywood this Hollywood that abuse me this guy or mistreated\nMe raped me what it how about the United uh University of Virginia Rolling Stone story how about Lena Dunham talking about all the horrible things have happened to her having all of the story is caused women to feel a you only emancipated to come forward with their stories and yet\nOn the tail end of the me too movement after Clarence Thomas Anita Hill and so forth Christie\nMostly for goes in testifies on ... and I'm hearing from so many women who\nAre saying well no my point is that I think anybody can say that but we don't know who's calling these people we don't even know if the people calling him or not Democrat activists to begin with just to create the phone traffic Mike intention to you is that the me too movement alone\nHas no doubt inspired a lot of women to courageously step up and accused guys that have mistreated them it's not a new phenomenon it's not\nSomething for which she deserves all kinds of credit because this is it the tail end of this new awareness insensitivity\nAnd yet\nIt's being spoken of Christine mostly for his testimony on her inspiration is being spoken of as though it's a stand alone and it's never happened before and that adds to her credibility though don't you see\nAnd I think we're all being played oh yeah I Do know I'm not accusing I'm not\nSaying women are coming forward I'm saying it's not a new thing that they are\nBelieve me [laughter] talk [laughter]\nGo go ask Harvey Weinstein go ask Matt Lauer and go talk to Les Moonves and asked them if they think that there's something relatively new here and it started happening because Christine forward [noise] it isn't it's all part of\nThe plan to\nMake this particular incident\nRevolutionary new and so important because this brave courageous woman is causing other women to be brave in ways they've never felt like being before and I think that's not right I think the sensitization sensitivity the\nConsciousness raising has been going on since wind staying or even before that but every time there's a\nPublic incident like this involving male abuse or alleged male abuse part and parcel of it and I'm hearing from women all over America who are so thankful to Dr foreign because she has given me the courage to ... did\nThe me too movement not work on um the me too movement not give them courage\n\nJust think we're being played here folks\nUm [noise]\nAnd of course it gives flights covered for what he is not\nYou make yourself out to be a hero yeah we need more information we need more yeah what's wrong with more information\n[noise] what's wrong with more information is not the question why do we need to give the Democrats more time to make up a bunch of other information ought to be the suspicion here okay so the Trump soundbites\nThese are from the oval office was during a an\nAnnouncement ceremony for a new trade deal eliminates ... getting rid of it brand new trade deal the drive by eyes were under orders not to ask questions about Kavanaugh which meant they ask questions about capital and Trump after making sure enough time was spent on NAFTA\nStarted entertaining the are the questions and what we have a one through four of them here\nAnd here is a Trump ... this is this is not actually in response to a question he's just riffing here during the\nCeremony talking about the uh mid term election fake news Kevin ... things\nWe have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago as you know there are a lot of repression polls polls that are on very accurate [noise] we had areas and we had congressional seats to\nWhere I Know it's got to be a positive outcome but you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly had that with my election\nThey were telling me I was you know in trouble in certain states that end up winning like in a landslide and I knew I was going to win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Q and a Cecilia vague go\nABC News the White House correspondent said in a tweet this weekend as you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin ... when your own statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is that\nThis is our seventh investigation\nOf a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that's never had any accusation any he's not a bad statement about him he's led I think he was number one in this class it yeah he was number one in this law school and yeah and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible so\nI Want the FBI this is now the seventh investigation so it's not like you know just starting I Want them to do a very comprehensive investigation\nLet me explain that answer let me let me these soundbite some kind of be yeah number thirty coming okay [noise]\n... this whole FBI investigation started everybody knows we we heard flake\nDemand a week for his vote one week\nSo that's how the committee vote ended eleven to pen and paper Kavanaugh with the provides though that flake was not going to vote well I'm a floor vote for final confirmation silly FBI had spent at least a lot of weight walking into this\nSo that NBC runs a story out of nowhere fake news claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI it was a set up it was a it was a trap\nThey lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI ice go because you see there are things to find and Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump has had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI that's been doing is level best to get Donald Trump thrown out of office somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\nSo Trump person I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at oh OK thank you Mr ... needs to go two weeks to go to waste the southern White Houses now claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was a set up and Trump tweeted out he's not limiting the scope NBC is why course they're lying it was a set up\n\nAnd so now it's out there that we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news at the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped\nUp tomorrow but then the question becomes what to do with that if the FBI has finished talking everybody these talked to\nThat one of the Republicans do with that so they hold on to it till friday and art art art or do they move on it\nWill just tell you if this ends tomorrow if this is all accurate\nAnd the Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing didn't go on till friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged and they knew what was going to be ... and they're going to demand even more time\nTo fix the fact that it was read they're going to do that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday if we let them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday\nUp earlier which over the news arts off local story innovative farmer who authored a delegation from Taiwan yesterday is celebrating a new agreement that will increase soybean exports to that country when\nThere are terrorists

the brothers among the funk brothers of Motown backup banned [noise] bumper rotation here at the ... by being a mom so I just saw it just took a look at the Drudge Report during the break\nAt what am I see what is the only the headline on the Drudge Report let me read it to your White House expands FBI problem is that what the hell is that so I clicked on the link here's what it is [noise]\nRight here my formerly Nick at the same fingers in the New York times working in tandem with NBC News headline of White House tells FBI to interview anyone necessary for Kevin inquiry this is because of what they claimed Trump said\nAt his press conference today where he's now I don't want to limit anything I said guys got that that that they run a fake news story NBC does claiming Trump is limiting the investigations ... not that fake news so then they've got it on record Trump not limiting invest which means you can go on and on and on and on\nAnd now they're broadcasting and everywhere White House tells me I interview when he wasn't necessary [noise] and right on schedule\nCNN reports that the Democrats are submitted a list of twenty four\nPeople they want the FBI to talk to\nThis after Fox News had an earlier today that the FBI is about to ramp up tomorrow\n[noise] this is gonna have to be shut down at some point this cannot go on all this is\nIs delayed delayed delayed delay and I'm going to tell you what needs to happen\nThere is an assumption operating out there that needs to be shut down and that assumption is that the investigation that has taken place since Kavanaugh was named is somehow insufficient\nIf somehow incomplete somebody needs to stand up and say if the exact opposite that this is the seven now Trump has but somebody besides needs to make the point\nThat this has been a thorough investigation that every last minute Jack in the box that's popped up here has been looked into and the effort has been made but there's only so much you can do with a woman who doesn't remember where or when whatever happened to her happen\nAnd there's only so much you can do when the people in the room she says we're their claim they weren't\n\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it somebody needs to stand up and promote it\nIt needs to be spoken for\nThis has got to be stopped because it's not real\nThe Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go submit name as they want the FBI to talk to\nThey dug it investigations don't work that way FBI follows evidence leads at when they don't find anything unlike Bob Mueller they stop\n\nMueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and has been found anybody is still going and that's exactly what this is going to be if somebody doesn't stand up and stop this\nOn the Senate Judiciary committee needs to stand up or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up and start voucher thing for the investigation is taking place there are six separate FBI background checks of bread\nWell somebody needs to speak up for him somebody needs to vouch for um somebody needs to stand up and say they have been thorough and they haven't found anything or you wouldn't be where he is now sitting on the DC circuit court of appeals\nBut that's not happening somehow weren't letting the media get away with the idea that the investigation here in the Kavanaugh has been half baked lukewarm and or incompetent\nBecause of Christine Blasey Ford coming around at the last minute with no evidence no cooperation and nothing yet she's credible cabinet was not\nSomebody look we've got a caller earlier how do you stop a bully you smack them in the face somebody needs to stand up until the Democrats the shut the hell up that they've gotten everything they've asked for this thing and there just isn't anything there and go home\nThe idea of this investigation is not thorough is incompetent is incomplete or has been rendered is absolutely bogus now they're making things up the Trump is going to limit it eat it no such thing\nBut he sure felt for the bait I Am not limiting and the thing I it's totally FBI to take us wherever it takes them properly Democrats well here's Twenty one people we want you to talk to\n\nIf you called the FBI you say there's there's some people in my town here really really screwing approach and I need to get something done about ... years in a while you go talk to them [laughter] doesn't work that way does it\n\nWhat rush rush this is the United States Senate clearly that can happen to know is that\n[noise] and one other thing you know one of the one of the movies I have recommended over the years that people rent they haven't seen that go go watch what's called the lives of others and it's a movie about East Germany during the Cold War essentially\nHow the government literally spied on every citizen\n\nThe German chancellor of the time was rich hunter\nHe's the guy that you know drug ... the East German women Olympic teams anyway it's a it's a frightening a movie in terms of what gigantic police state with the ability", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "01"}
