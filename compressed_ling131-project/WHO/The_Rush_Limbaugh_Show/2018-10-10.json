way that the clean Air Act is written is that there's an exemption in the clean Air Act for ethanol and it sounds like the the e ten is actually written into the law so they need to get that switch to

privilege people live there\nAnd the drive buys are are surprisingly interested in this\nI say surprisingly because there's not a central major population center\nThat can be totally wiped out that they could equate which she she how dangerous global warming is\nBut there is a midterm election coming up and there is going to be a federal response to this and as far as the media is concerned as an opportunity to federal response won't be any good and so they can call this Trump's Katrina don't get mad at me for talking about this because I'm telling you\nRight now is exactly how assignment editors and producers throughout the drive by media are looking at that\nThey're looking at this as a potential political event that they're hoping might be somewhat helpful to them in the mid term elections that are only three weeks away\nThere is a heated governor's race in Florida mayor of Tallahassee Andrew Gillum running against Ron ... and then Rick Scott the current governor is running for the Senate against the incumbent Bill Nelson so there's a lot politically at stake here you can't deny it folks\nAnd you can't you cannot ignore the way the media is preparing a bunch of different scenarios to report on this um it's it's got the global warming component\nThat's number one as a category four hundred and fifty miles an hour lots of destruction a human\nA destruction as well it's it's got all the ingredients there it is the Republican voting stronghold of the state in in the in the views of many [noise] no no\nIf you look you can get mad at me hold you I'm just telling you I Know the media you may think insensitive me\nTo be speaking this way I'm not I'm telling you how to say yeah I'm a drive by maybe our planet and they'll react at some point little Brian spelled or go out there I Can't believe that the strange things were being showed about ... imminent danger of ... I'm just telling it won't be long to find out\nIt's a hurricane kind of came out of nowhere was little tropical storm down off the primary tobacco growing area of western Cuban known as the ...\nThat it sprang a life as a category one and the national Hurricane Center you know this thing is it's looking very bad nobody was paying much attention to it and then all of a sudden it's a cat three and it's making a beam line\nFor Panama City in Panama City beach\nAnd here we are um the media is now focused on this do you think Mr certainly do you think there is I Know it's going to sound crazy but do you think that Dr biased might be looking for a\nBit of a respite from all this Kevin all stuff that you don't think so and you don't think the hurricane is providing them and Terry opportunity for\nAll I Know they hope it turns into Trina for Trump I've just I Am capital all they hope it turns ... and Rick Scott of course they want it to her turn that Katrina for every Republican involved here\nUm you know what Hillary Clinton went out\nThe other day in an interview with Christian among poor and pretty much admitted everything I had been trying to warn people love about the American left and the Democratic party\nShe went out there and hit her best Maxine Waters impersonation was encouraging people to be an civil\nAnd she was saying that it was justified being on civil given the opposition the Republicans and if they win the house then they can go back to being civil if they win the Senate then they can return just civility\nI mean they're making the case they're proving the point and there isn't I don't see you know all of this in all of this\nCrazy they're ranged unhinged behavior of left wing activist I haven't heard\nOne elected Democrat did announce it I haven't heard one the elected Democrats attempt to distance himself or herself or the party from it I haven't heard one\nBe elected Democrats suggest to these ... protesters to dial it back I haven't heard\nOne they're all encouraging it my point is this is who they all are and what Hillary Clinton now advocating this incivility\nWhat did I tell you yesterday were not in a battle of ideas anymore we're not in an argument over ideas they don't they don't they're\nNot even looking at any of this is about ideas\nThey see America today as flawed and illegitimate and therefore in need of a new set of defining values that will serve to unify\nThe people who want to be part of American not anything to do with our founding not the constitution not the declaration that's out the window because all that's tainted all of that was written by a bunch of privileged white guys who were setting up a system for themselves\nAnd their families and their descendants and they didn't care about minorities and they didn't care about transgender where did I see some state I've got it in a stack I'll have to find some stayed on birth certificates is now going to offer a third option third gender option\nOn the birth certificate\nThey're ... they're crazy they're literally not they are at war with clients they're at war with biology they're at war with physics\nAnd they are at war with common sense\n\nHillary Clinton is not helping them with any of this it's okay to be an civil it's okay to outlaw F the doors of the Supreme Court and try to get in to stop the swearing in ceremony of Brett Kavanaugh\nWe've got that we've got some reaction to it coming up as well and all eyes remain fixated once again on hurricane Michael this next forty five minutes to an hour will tell the tale in terms of the actual\nLandfall it's going to be anywhere from ah Mexico beach up to Panama City moving North West along the coastline Mexico's Mexico beach I think is what it is all the way up to Panama City in Panama City beach but this I wall\nAccording to all of that and I've got some fascinating satellite photography here from the guards sixty and satellites it's interesting the way they do this you know how they take the um the radar and they attach different colors to it\nNow what I'm looking at is sheer solid black surrounding me I ... and most of the black is on the south and the west side\nAnd then it gets a little lighter there's some great then\n... then then right and then he yellow and then can and then orange and green and blue on the edges\nOut these colors do not represent rain and intensity they represent cloud tops they represent the temperatures at the cloud tops which determines condensation and can determine the intensity of rainfall but most people watching this have\nNo idea they think oh my God look at that may look it must be raining a hundred miles\nA look at that's black black writer run in a dark right it's\nDesigned to ski area is designed to get your attention it's cloud top temperatures but my point is it solve all around the world the looks like the most intense area of this is due west of the eye wall\nWhich is where the population centers are based on where the eye wall looks like it's going to hit now\nBut even on the east side eastern northeast squadrons are wearing the strongest winds are and those are going to be blowing offshore toward offshore once they hit land on the north eastern side of the wall but it's a solid eye wall and it's a large I wall\nSo it's it's it's a very very intense storm and the next forty five minutes is going to hit land none of them are will nowhere and the speed with which it will continue the amount of rain and storm surge so it's it's gonna be a very very bad\nBunch of days

significant\nBut I'm just a drive by trying to take these things they're so desperate for good news they're desperate\nFor you know for a bunch of people that are brimming with confidence over the fact they're going to be running the world in three weeks I'm finding a lot of evidence in security for example I have a story here what is this is in the hill dot com and it's a column by somebody named Brent Butowsky\nWho sounds like the captain of a bowling team ... says he thinks this\nGuy was a legislative aide who who are using this guy worked for the lord benefit a a former senator in Texas I knew Jack Kennedy Kennedy was a friend of mine and you quail you're no Jack Kennedy that lord Benson right okay [noise]\nWell whether he did or not he still writes pieces for the for the whole dot com Butowsky code red alert to Democrats\nWhat are the Democrats were smoking I bought the Democrats are going to win everything like the he'll got kind of had a story yesterday I mean it looked like two hundred nine seats are going to convert to the Democratic party\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama wildly most popular respected public figures in America should spend the day taping personal endorsements for democratic candidates for the house and Senate\nThis column is a code red alert I'm reading from it by the way\nThis column is a code red alert to Democrats in a call to arms\nAre the most popular in respect to Democrats in America such as Michelle my bell Obama do leading the charge for all hands on deck at a critical moment for America and democracy\nIn my view writes Butowsky there is at twenty five percent chance of Democrats and the mid terms with a nightmare scenario\nWhat twenty five percent chance of a nightmare wife what you guys had it all locked up I thought you're pretty much had the house already done\nAlthough she's already talking about being speaker you guys are already planning to impeach investigate cabin on Trump or verse myself\nNow there's a twenty five percent chance that Democrats\nAnd the midterms in a nightmare scenario\nThat's that's not quite the same\nAs a Ninety three percent chance Hillary wins the presidency at five pm on election night\n... ... why are these people panicking\nMr Butowsky says this is not a moment for complacency or easy talk of blue waves it's a moment for balding maximum action and turnout based on a powerful look urgent sense of opportunity in danger\nSays it's possible the Democrats win the house by a significant number of seats how ever it is also possible a\nDemocrat to gain only ... seats falling short\nOf winning control that would leave the Republicans nominate\nWith a smaller but even more right wing majority of the leading loser is\nIn the house midterms are comparatively moderate GOP house members Democrats could lose one or two Senate seats continuing a Republican Senate there's even further to the right and even more partisan than the GOP majority that day\nBooed ... says it's a ... in this nightmare scenario for Democrats and America if it unfolds a vindictive and\nTriumphant Trump having won a victory for the politics of hatred and fear and don't you love [noise]\nYou people on the left don't understand unity when you see it you don't understand love when you see it you'd do not understand confidence when you see it you'll see love\nYou see hatred use the excitement you think you'll see fear when you see\nThousands and thousands and thousands trying to get into Trump rallies you somehow see division\n\nOf vindictive and triumphant tropical scammed along side Republican leaders of the new Congress feeling he's achieved unstoppable dominance\nOver his party our country in every branch of government with all checks and balances destroyed this code red alert right says Butowsky warns about the danger of so much unchecked power concentrated in the hands of a president who tried to criminalize\nHis opponent [laughter]\nWhat who was who tried to criminalize who\n\nMy point is again\nDo not fall for any of this hype that it is over and that the Republicans have no prayer and that there's going to be this gigantic blue wave because not even the Democrats in their private selves when they talk to each other in private and not even they really\nBelieve that\nThey want you to think they do they want you to be dispiriting hand or depressed\nThey are very alarmed in fact that the latest polls that show the cabinet effect on the Republican side is ... up turnout ... up interest\nAnd they're really flux and ticked off at a bunch of polling\nData there is an NPR poll out there there was a Fox News for a couple of others but show some bourbon Republican women\nAre saying in polling data that they have veil renewed interest and increased energy and intense desire to go vote\nThis is not what we're supposed to happen that's why all of these attacks lately in leftist media ripping in two white conservative\nSuburban women and do we need them or not and we don't they say\nSo this is not as we sit here today this is not developing as they want you to think it is\n\nBack in two thousand six then as you remember any pieces before the presidential race\nAnywhere in democratic media warning people hey hey you know what there is a nightmare scenario here where Trump good when you got to dial it back we've got to be very careful you remember any of that\nThere was none they were so solid sure they were definitely of of uh convinced that they weren't going to win every Hillary was going to win and the biggest landslide\nI mean they had Trump's chances at three percent seven percent ten percent\nBut nobody gave Trump a chance in fact some of the news even said Trump never thought he was gonna win Trump never even wanted to win Trump was the most surprised\nGuy in a lecture in the world when he won he didn't want to when they were all depressed that Trump quarters that's what they want you to believe\n\nNow they started out saying the same thing is no power is the birthright that every American realizes that Democrats have to be put back in power\nEvery American realizes the mistaken voted for Trump every Trump voter can't wait to apologize every Trump voter realizes embarrassed wants to fix the mistake can't wait to vote for the next Democrat on their ballot\nNow all of a sudden it's not just Butowsky by the way either there are others who are\nRaising red flags out there that this might not be developing as they wish also from Fox News the homeland security secretary\nKirstjen Nielsen\nSaid yesterday that the Chinese coms are engaged in an unprecedented influence campaign leading up to the midterms this is the Trump administration's latest warning that the ... attempting to sway American opinion I handled the elections\nOf ... wants a whim [noise]\n... what the Democrats to win ... why do you think that is why why would a bunch of international communist dictators want the Democrat Party that

so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment to white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled and swerved in to a truth\n\nFor a very exceptional election Europe Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination the Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent\nOf the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in the Democratic party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women have been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\n[laughter] ... ... the left has as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\n\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again\nFrom about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not to zero\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties assimilation was key to American immigration policy\n\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plans their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans [noise] and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell\nNineteen sixty five us when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course went to once that happens illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries the Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm poor of CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they had to do\nWas change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night and the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court\nAnd that troubles me greatly Christie on I'm for it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution looking at\nThe judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton and the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded leftist activists\nTo make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this\nOutside of Obamacare practically every liberal\n... the steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture laws in reality today is because Democrats activists judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce\nDecisions roe versus Wade is the most thoroughly example of this but there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her\nBecause our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional guy the ass not by you in fact to Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative state of college so I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability Christianity and for listening to one another working on our differences but\nThat is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again missed characterizing that\nBlue in the face that's a Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices\nDuring vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of\nThis is that Hillary Clinton says it's if it's a time for instability it is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise] who was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton that Republican baseball practice\nCannot believe that Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when the Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\nRun out of restaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton urges Democrats to be even more uncivil what an irresponsible statement every Democrats should announce they're not going to denounce or they privately publicly encourage written by applauded they support it that is who they are\nThis is the party by the way that has been railing against all this and civility for I don't know how long this is why\nI look at average American voters paying attention to this and I don't understand how any of them can want to side with what the Democratic Party is doing how they're doing it\nI Know what happens but it's it's a mystery to me and my hope is my faith is that this ends\nThe ... this insanity this on the ... Democrat behavior is negatively impacting the Democrats that the Kavanaugh effect\nPro Republican I Know that's real the polling data indicates that that's real if you want to believe polling data\nMichael is the first a storm of its magnitude to hit the panhandle in more than one hundred and fifty years\nResidents are being warned of a deadly storm surge in devastating wins and massive power outages and widespread damage our\nTop local story high river levels in the Des Moines area are starting to close the roads parks and trails the city of Des Moines says the raccoon river is expected to crest overnight tonight at Fifteen point eight feet at Flora drive which is about a foot over flood stage\nThe wind river south east sixth street is expected to crest overnight as well at twenty seven feet less than a foot above flood stage\nExpect sections of the following roads to close George like parkway southwest thirtieth and Berlin drive a series of tornado sightings and warnings yesterday and I had emergency phone alerts and outdoor sirens wailing tornado stayed away from\nMore populated areas seem to avoid any towns and cities which is good\nMost of them stayed in rural areas I'm really thankful W.

nearby we have thousands of people going tonight and they've already many of their already\nKnow a lot of people I just got some emails when this stuff happened you know you're falling for Russia just proves what a ... Trump's not doing this for any other reason that he just he wants to brag he's just doing this for PR no\nFriends you may think that and I'm not going to try to just to ... but the president's doing this because if he didn't\nCan you imagine the stories that would be published Trump doesn't care Trump didn't convened a meeting Trump didn't ask very many questions Trump didn't seem curious Trump seemed to have any real entrance since he doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about him\nHe does this for a host of reasons but most importantly\nI Believe Donald Trump likes himself and he's very proud of the job he's doing and he wants to be able to see it and he knows that the primary conveyor as of information in this country do not\nConvey proper information about him is there's so many smart here's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your or hype\nHey it's great to be on Russia I'm not only are you all rushed but but you are the voice of the mainstream media you should have the best stepping on gas\nOr should have the ... and ... [laughter] hey my point is ah today a\nWith Hillary's comments that are basically liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me of a profound quote I came across ... years ago and maybe even you set it\nUh but here's the quote a society is either moving towards civility or barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society and\nIt's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the farmers just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre ... but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society is always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a society barbarism or civilly were trending one where we're not in the middle of either trending towards civility or barbarism\nOff the clocks and the oh it's a constant influx and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it [noise]\nWell uh it seems as if uh the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards law and order\nOr restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism right ah with all of their character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh anti a violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact in most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democrat Party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all button fine and dandy one more to them\nI think it was before the Nineteen forties\nNot all one word or whatnot when what were they what were they like when the Democrats were the Democrat Party over your dad or your grandpa what what they want but I'm doing\nWell um the Democrats\nBut at that time there they seek a\nIssue was a labor laws and a win for what purpose my part of the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted in the modern\nEra in our lifetimes of this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in\nAnti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism in big government they've just now a band in any pre chance of moderation about that and have gone all in\nOn militants and violent socialism to achieve their means my boy they're not that different there just masking less today\nYou know read about it in the paper tomorrow ... be Mitt work\nForty double jammed grant so there's this guy didn't Jordan either healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and he goes to the doctor true story goes to the doctor and he's diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier from medical insurance to medical care where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical\nBills exceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars met a share members shared\nAll our bills and it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you to the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it with a ... year it's\nSo worth looking into there's a reason this is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here has a number for you\nEight five five fifty one Bible that's eight five five five one B.

H. O. radio news talk top story this hour\n[noise] since where they see the campaign see so I think I think Fox is dialing back on the potential you will time claims even though there are Democrats doing rallies like this\nSo my point is that that not as many people are seeing them and and the last night this is such a contrast I have to tell you folks and I this is the kind of thing that you just\nIf you have any observation will powers at all you can't miss this these people at Trump rallies they're non violent\nThey are not threatening their not intimidating and and then they're not dangerous and they don't make anybody feel in danger or threatened these are people having a great time\nThese are people that are up beat him happy they are excited to be where they are\nThey are part of something that matters greatly to them they want to be involved and they are the Congress\nFast to the the makeup of people and their behavior a Trump rally and your average ordinary democratic protest is Dr King\nYou contrast the people at this rally last night it was it was a Council Bluffs Iowa you contrast that with with that on for ... picture to me of these kids are slowing at the front door of the Supreme\nCourt Saturday afternoon\nRight I didn't get banging on the door and clawing at the door\nTrying to get in I didn't know if I was watching the wicked witch of the ... army or what but it was it was\nCertainly nothing that was or promoted wanting to be part of the Trump rallies or the exact opposite and I don't mean that people at Trump rallies or a bunch of nerds and dry balls don't misunderstand or just wholesome people in there and they're having a good time and there's nothing threatening or intimidating and there's a lot of laughter\nAnd just general happiness and you never see that at any Democrat sponsored event and even if you do have some happy people\nIn the Democrat sponsored the audience isn't gonna last long because the Democrat on stage is going to get mad and outrage and get everybody else ticked off\n\nAnd I want you to hear a little bit of a Trump rally last night this is it's about a minute worse the Trump rally crowd has find a way it found a way to recycle and keep lock her up relevant and current\nAbout Senator Feinstein this another [noise]\nUsually the documents wow oh\nGod [noise]\nI don't want to have you ever see no [noise] no no

to an angry left wing mob and that's what the Democrats\n\nYou don't hand mattress do an arsonist you don't give power do an angry oh by the way that word mob the left is is in thin that Trump is calling their supporters the mob and so now there are left wing stories defining the word mob\nBoss or on dictionaries in a wicked PTO and trying to make the case that it's Republican crowds that are the mob and not Democrats they're really a bunch of Democrats elected Democrats are just in dignity and up and did that Trump is daring that call their supporters a mob\n\n[noise] they're just they're so used to having it throw in a ride back at him with the same force they'd dish it out they are so on you used to having their ideas and behavior being criticized and they really can't stand being laughed at\nAll [laughter]\nSo now Dianne Feinstein lock her up I Want to go back to two thousand sixty\nTo two years ago two years exactly October tenth eleventh wherever montage fear of\nPeople from

headline yesterday\nAt the hill dot com the Republican House is in collapse\nThat's the story that I had the headline that if you didn't know how to read it you wouldn't think that two hundred nine house seats are all of a sudden switching to the Democrats' side\n\nAnd that story predicted didn't predict it said we are in the midst of a Republican collapse in the house\nThey do not change everything is so formulaic they are so predictable\nAnd predictably wrong they're doing it all over again and they're doing it on the same basis that everybody hates Trump\nThat whereas in two thousand sixteen it's impossible people are not going to vote for this guy that has become people regret voting for this guy but I Can't believe they voted for this guy and they can't wait to show up and apologize to America for voting for this guy so they're going to do and the only thing they can\nDo and vote Democrat they were wrong in two thousand\nSixteen some of them as we mentioned earlier

not\nWas a as a meteorologist sent me a note a moment ago Nineteen eighties hurricane named Alan that covered two thirds of the Gulf of Mexico and again the sensitivity here is is due to the fact the

Ford or be it for Ramirez or from Amman ... client\nHer name sweat Nick I mean this is a flat\nOut admitting yeah we made up a second story well didn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happened just by writing a story alleging it and of course their buddies in the left one gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it\nYeah we needed to show a pattern here is Krista Smith of Ohio your next I'm Glad you waited high\nHigh right very very cold and talk to you [laughter] thank you um so\nI was just wondering I was concerned and mine to get your thoughts you mentioned that fun of it yesterday but with this novel as it is and Hillary claiming that they're partying neatness civility right now I'm\nI guess get worried when the mom and they left and an accident and then fattening or if they begin to help people\nUm it just hadn't have worried about provoking violent and um you know to the point where we don't do anything Chong firing of it comes to creating an armed guard on our cars", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "10"}
