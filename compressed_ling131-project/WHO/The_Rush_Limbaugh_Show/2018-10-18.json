our part gas ... radio dot com search no big show\nAbout twelve fifty three on the big show why\nWe're talking now with Alan ... on a cell phone line with us wrapping up another edition of the big show out of them were out in the field\nThings are starting to roll lung so we're breathing a little easier um crop progress reports harvest progress reports come out weekly or what what do you think or are we doing out there are you surprised\n[noise] well I think we're going to see a lot of improvement a lot of progress this week if you yeah you were to get in the western corner eastern corn belt was cruising by law though you know hard for us to see 'cause we're sitting out here in the area but\nUh yeah the wheels turning today guys actually we're going for like around but uh the longer this a dry spell continues they'll get down into low grounded I think beans will show pretty rapid progress once they get into\nYeah Alan and you've always been told us this the same thing is don't look out your window and think that the entire world we and we we get that but uh how are things come along in the Dakotas they've had to been rougher whether we maybe even than what we have in mid west\nYeah they've got they've got some reports of beans are flat and on the ground because they got too much though on them but ah I've also got clients up there said no but are you a potential still there uh you know they're they're looking at some record deals in some cases so\nAgain it's it's getting it out but the problem up there of course is the the cage pitcher terrible the basis is horrible because you know get the west coast market just doesn't exist right now without China\nYeah I talk about that that bases map I was watching looking at that the other day and I thought holy cow these basis or a huge cheer you think we're going to see those are narrow down a little bit\nYeah I think you'll see improvement your typical post harvest\nProve meant a nationally you'd expect about Fifteen cents on beans or at least ten to twelve cents on corn\nBetween the October low and and the first of December so uh I I think you'll see that I think the bases will I'm being just going to be worse than you ever go all year just because of the carry over if I mean for looking at twenty percent stocks use ratio\nYou're just not going to see the typical basis uh it'll be fairly regional though the\nThe uh the upper Midwest they'll have to drain down into the Gulf just like everybody else just try to do until we get some kind of resolution on that Asian trait\nWell yeah we're we're draining down I understand going up the Gulf but I think some of those being going out the Gulf maybe back door on their way into China I don't know that for sure like I say I've I've only heard rumors that some of the south American beans\nMay have an awful lot of American taste in them so ah hey what what are we looking at for targets Alan what do you think about the corn going forward here and soybeans\n[noise] well I think the short run a resistance on corners three Seventy seven we we still think that you can see a four in front of the corn sometime this marketing year maybe even for ten or for twenty but\nYou're not going to get their straight out of harvest most of the time wears the support a main supports around three three forty right now three twenty is a is a worst case scenario probably\nBase all we know today or the being inside a November had some key support today and eight sixty three that's the old is your mid line it's also the the old speed line\nIf it breaks that it could go down to eight forty\nWorst case scenario eight ten uh we we think there's a decent chance you get the nine bucks before you're in nine o seven is that there's a chart number but uh again the you have to have fun buying and today they were selling everything it was the grains livestock stock market you name it they're going to ... for some reason they're\nSo ... basically we're we're looking at a and knowing what those bases are we're looking at a lot of stored a lot of storage coming up\nYeah I I think George is going to pay I been discouraging people from from selling occasion by the board that's been a popular idea out there just because the the cash basis is so bad you're basically locked into a lousy sale when you do there might you might improve it but it's not

it and it's up to four thousand people now it's estimated that this is costing somebody Twenty one million dollars\nThese people have to be fed the they have to be transported and they have to use the bathroom they have to be\nAble to drink water and whatever else they can get their hands somebody is making this happen somebody thinks\nThat this is going to watch or gr wells for Democrats were told that George\nSoros money is a is behind this I don't care who's money it is it's a lot of money to make this happen there are a lot of kids by the way and the magic\nOf the camera pan is the children as it always is there are children\nIn the caravan and that it's kind of like the baby on board science I always hated those I even had one made a baby not on board but we're still as valuable as anybody else is inside this guys we had one of those made\nThe most bother you baby on board rush maybe on\nThe exact me we're in a rush maybe on board little inside the yellow side we made it up and it was available at the Rush Limbaugh\nStore but this is the same thing children young children also we must do what we must open\nThe gates we must stand beside we must allow them passage\nSo we've got this we have the ...\nArt as I say more on that in a moment the ... report is just lurking there there isn't anything really in it in fact we now know probably have a sure bet that there's nothing dynamite in it\nBecause of an audio sound but I have coming up uh uh never Trump or anti Trump is Phil Mudd this former intelligence official US government now CNN commentator who is it that would think if you're on the left it think this massive caravan arriving\nIn the United states at our border close to the election who thinks this is going to help Democrats how what helped Democrats\n\nLet's not just Trump separating him as Trump not letting them in\nEither there has to me what it is these people actually are figuring that a massive ... they don't understand that this kind of thing is why Donald Trump was elected\nDonald Trump was elected to stop this kind of thing to stop this invasion and that's what this is this is an organized bought and paid for invasion image growing\nSo obviously the plan is for this group of people including the children to arrive here very close to the election and for Trump just sick I saw them\nAnd the border patrol on them and to deny them entry or\nTo separate the children from the adults so that's a drive by media can then kick into gear with stories that are\nAlready written that are all ready taped\nInterviews with people on the caravan all ready in McCann where these people will say they're shocked that came to America to save their lives were their children and to improve their latest they won't let the man is is unlike anything they ever heard about the cuts of pictures of Trump\nSmiling as people are denied in three Democrats think\nThis\nYou know I I Would think that if somebody politically did this it'd be a conservative group might do this\nTo promote Republican turnout\nThat we don't have anybody on our side who thinks that way but it makes more sense that way\nOr am I missing something somehow a massive group of four thousand people is growing including kids\nMarching toward the United states with no attempt to making patently obvious what it is these are not people fleeing anything these are not people fleeing the Saudi Government they're not fleeing torture not fleeing will they be playing poverty but\nThat happens every day for thousands of illnesses aren't just treated it's planned this morning paper somehow this is supposed to end up making the United states look bad\n\nI'm I'm not ... if that's the way these people are figuring it going to play out now we have the mother report\nThat\nWill not be released before the election but we're being told that it is\nNearing completion and then it is ready to go\nI went through yesterday what the what the hope here is uh the hope here is to revive the Trump colluded with Russia narrative and to make people think that we're just days or weeks away from proof being released\nWhether we can't do it before the election because of regulations and decency so we're not going to influence the outcome\nOf elections but Muller is ready to go at once in a while I've been doing well Mueller has been looking for evidence of Trump colluded with Russia so if monitors ready to go Mahler must have found the but this is what they want everybody to think\n\nAbout the fact of the matter is it's probably the exact opposite I'll let me find the Pacific refined lease sounds I hear [noise]\nThat puts this in perspective hang on and when I look at this won't take long hair folks I as I say I'm having a compressed everything here it is not pretend audio soundbite number tens and this is\nThis is deep state ranking member Phil Mudd he is a former intelligence official now works as a commentator on CNN last night Wolf Blitzer show the situation room he's a counterterrorism\nCenter specials what he is and Blitzer said do you think that Muller is preparing new indictments\nThe really interesting part of this is a potential report a draft report and narrative if you will from all are going over Rosen high let me play this out Washington Rosenstein gets narrative that says not only\nThis is what we found that my violate the law this is my picture of what happened during the investigation there is going to be some dirt and there are so in addition to the indictments I really want us to be within that narrative worst\nCase so this is wearing Mrs going the Muller report is going to be full of supposedly horrible stuff ... none none of which is\nProbably going to be inside all none of which is going to be impeachable although the Democrats win the house they're gonna make moves in that direction anyway um but he says the important point of the smaller report will be the dirt the joint nothing in\nWhich\nThere's nothing for it less they make it up there never has\nBeen any Trump collusion and never has been the evidence or less they make it up [noise] so the smart money is that it's going to be filled with things that are accusatory that blamed Trump's incompetence ineptitude\nEssentially blame Trump for being so in over his head\nThat it looked like the Russians had worked with him to steal the election despite the fact that there is any hard evidence it's hard to refute the idea of going to make it look like Trump is in over his head doesn't know what he's doing threatens the country with his presidency because of his incompetence\nThat's what it's going to be but let's take a look at an alternative view from Sydney Powell\nWhose work we have referenced many times\nOn this program she has written a book chronicling lay deception and the abuse of power but corruption in the department of justice traced all the way back to the Enron task force many of the same lawyers here we're working with Mahler\nAnd our headline she published this up yesterday at the Daily Caller Mahler is Jay ... is up but that's not enough\nMeaning Trump's they'll all the country something here despite the fact Muller hasn't found anything\nThe boiler witch hunt is effectively over writes ms Powell not because Mahler and not plan to drag this out until they could contact the crime against Trump for a member of his family but rather because the ... up\nHave you noticed how long it's been since anybody even suggested that the president's sit down with the special counsel for an interview\nMueller's reason for existing was the outrageous purposefully propagandize prevailing occasion as the Trump campaign and even Trump himself colluded with Russia Iran get\nThe twenty sixteen presidential election against Hillary Clinton the Democrats who perpetrated this fraud or not only masters of projection and deception they took their play book of personal destruction do a whole new

a famous name has been misappropriated\nAnd has been falsely accused of reporting this in order to give it legitimacy in certain Google searches then I started to question a lot of things about this story\nNot very briefly here's why the the apple watch angle this doesn't work\nI Know that most of you don't have apple watches let me just briefly explain to you how they work there are three ways that an apple watch can receive and transmit data and the biggest\nOne the one with the longest range the one that is most capable is not even available in Turkey and that is L. T. E. or cellular signals two years ago\nWhen apple at well actually fourteen months when apple introduced the series three watch they activated L T E cellular service which for the first time made the watch independent of the phone\nYou could take it out of work out you can do anything you can take it away from the phone and have it operated which they'll get emails and messages and their record your workout data and so forth if you could receive a self said well you didn't need your phone nearby\nSo it was the first time that the the watch\nIt failed to do just ceased to be a slave\nIt's to the phone the other two ways or blow to and wife ...\nThose are the three ways that day they can get to watch and data can leave a watch you take out he out of the mix because it doesn't exist in Turkey and there there there's no watch no apple watching the world and that it's an apple watch they claim he was wearing the story\nIs that his fiance has his phone out in a car in the parking lot at the consulate there is only one way that watch could communicate with that phone well there's two ways there'd be why and\nBlow to blow to if you have to blow to it this week by design it doesn't have much rain sixty feet max\nYou get into an embassy the shielding the ... are the protections against other nations being able\nTo monitor and over here and steal signal there's no way that the Bluetooth component of a watch\nWould be able to permeate the protection of an embassy would have to protect itself from just that there's no ... that couldn't happen so the only other way would be why\nBut that one only work if\nThe wife fine network password of the embassy or consulate\nHadn't been answered\nAnd the wife I connection on one\nJust because the phone connects to why when the phone does the watch automatically connects but not the wife I can next to the phone it's a slave to the phone now if the watch knows why fight network because of the phone it's parents who uses it then like if you're at home or your ... your your phone is inside you have to go outside\nTo walk the dogs you'll come back to the wife I network on your property even if your phones out of range if you've entered the password to the wife I network on your watch as well as on your phone I just don't think she'll be did that like he was probably know to do it um I don't\nKnow that they wouldn't give him the password how'd he get the password of the Saudi Saudi console don't want to find out the idea that that watch\nWas recording whatever happened to your show and then somehow transmitted up the cloud\nIs just so outside the realm of possibility has to be next to impossible and yet somebody is still pushing this\nThere are still pushing that that recording exist that it's somewhere in why fire iCloud into Turkish officials\nAre doing everything they can to listen to it and make decisions and the sharing it with the United states\nUnfortunately this meeting ended and another stalemate further concerns without a follow up meeting has not been set despite the u._k. ... at the end of march\nNearly five months from now lastly trade tensions continue to weigh on the markets the latest step in the saga has been the U.S has withdrawn from international postal treaty historically this treaty is offered this kind of postal rates for developing nations to ship small package good but China identified as a developing nation this treaty benefit of the country with lower global shipping rates\nUs his departure from the treaty could result in a significant rise of the cost of small shipments from China to the U.
