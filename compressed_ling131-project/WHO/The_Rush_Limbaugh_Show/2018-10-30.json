I think with this as accessible as Dr seuss was by comparison it'd be a compliment witness things like that easier remembered when you put him in no it is you're you know what I'm saying\nI anyway it was a an attempt at humor that I think kind of felt kind of flat and I apologize\nWell the market has been kind of humor less so thanks for trying to inject some hair done it's just not much of anything going on it seems like\nNo well I think a couple of things you know we still have to wait at the harvest coming at us harvest is very aggressive as you know\nSoybean by the end of the week will be wrapped up in a lot of areas the mid west of it is already the corn harvest is aggressive and I think we're trying to decide and user wants to get covered down here the producer doesn't want to sell here but he doesn't want to pay the storage and the drive down so\nUh the rate right now I think it just kinda leaking lowered we pointed out those seasonal allergies earlier this as a negative time of year for corn and wheat soybeans or more of the\nBut um you know we'll see if the crops get smaller on\nHave a lot of ... estimates coming out here in the next few days [noise] [noise] yeah\nWe're hearing lower numbers or corn and soybeans maybe drop off a little bit too\nYou know I think they will a bit you know just because the yields were sold off before and then we did have that raining and after the rain and those bigger than it seems like for some reason we lost three to five to six bushels an acre in different areas so\nYou know when you hear that when you get those it if it's not a consistent profits are to add bushels to it so I think that the issue so\nI think the key is for this market is don't term negative on break and don't turn to polish on rallies and we're just kind of caught in this trading range with Brazil to remind is off to a record fast planting paste and they're going to have a beams available the end of December hard to believe in to our early January\n[noise] yeah what is it like Seventy four percent complete versus the average forty eight percent or so ridiculously high number that's a that's going on there and do we know acreage wise down they're what they're expecting\nWell yeah they're looking for the ... not as wild expansion as you might think but it was up about two two per se on\nUm the other thing though that did change as they did have a ... a just a new president elected a conservative and it is a a belief that they're going to relax some of these uh acre restrictions and he could he acres the advanced the bit maybe not this year but next year\nThis is talk some livestock here Don a nearby hog trade is a positive the deferred months or a little lower but with a nice little run here so as of late\nWell it's been a very strong front and I think when you look at it the hard market is pretty clear cut it's kind of what we call either a boom bust type of market a because\nIt the supplies are large not only in the airport but the poultry and also the beach so if we don't have these big issues with Africans wine fever that can be to ah that equals out big demand out of China around the world maybe not necessarily from us but take a pork off the world market\nAnd lead to some big buying we're probably inflated remember the government we're about eighty three dollars on June and July hog\nThose are just three dollars off the top that we had last year on a on a log bigger supplies this year and the government's playing for the second quarter fifty four to sixty so we're not even close that eighty three from what the government says so\nIt certainly is one that I'm with all the uncertainties risk management\nWell and speaking of the African wind fever yesterday it was as long as it stays in China doesn't make it here probably not much of an impact on us and then today Robin ... got this report that says imports are up ten percent year over year in the past month so who knows what the heck's going on over there\nWell you know and that's a good question because you know are we getting accurate reporting over there are also picking up that uh that you know they're cutting better scaling back the meal you see the severely trying to bridge the gap get to South America soybeans\nI'm about to crush plants over there doesn't show it shows that they're actually they're crushing more soybeans and they did last year of the month of October so\nIt's a little bit of a cross current and like we always say\nTruth is in in what happens in the real marketplace\nWell yeah and then we saw a story that said that cut back in in soy protein isn't enforceable was never going to happen what should be supported by what you're saying with the crush number so I guess wait and see on that in the meantime how do we get in touch with you done\nYour Beck can reach us that one eight hundred two four seven for all southern one\nDon rose us commodities in West Des Moines

o'clock I'm Christian ... W. H. O. radio news fifty six degrees and partly cloudy skies in Des Moines our top national story this hour fifty two hundred active duty troops are being deployed to the U.S Mexican border\nWe have another caravan this time with people loaded with guns in bombs now that are heading across southern may\nGo with their intention to get to the United states and the drive by me to just is just being ... up that Trump's base that the\n... implication is that you people in Trump's base are just teetering on the verge of sanity and Trump knows that and he's trying to send your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you go vote it's again\nA classic\nExpression or illustration of how they haven't the slightest idea who the people are just voted for Donald Trump who remain supportive of\nDonald Trump [noise] but back we'll get to get more details that I ... back to my little test so I read all these people at the event last night\nIt's going to be a red wave Russia and listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red white but I said I Hope you're right but let\nMe let me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number many of them are\nCommittee chairmen not all but many of them are committee chairmen and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being chunks\nIt'll just regular house\nIt's a it's a big come down so they want to try to parlay their years in the house into private sector success\nI said forty five seats incumbency has has incredible power\nReelection power certainly old back me up on this is a student at the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans will never run before\nNobody knows I mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents are no not as well known so that that makes\nSome of this somewhat iffy I and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party\nThat holds the White House in the first midterms after a presidential election all ways loses seats so forty five seats they have and\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resign and we're still in the house you can count a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now Israel legs and this is what the left in the dry buys are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five will slip\nAnd then you've got a contest of all races are in in other parts Senate of course another thing now I mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're aware of this they knew about the resigned resigning and members of Congress retiring they ... they didn't know the number not all of them did\nBut their attitude was that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh the American people are fed up\nAnd they are sophisticated and the people who are elected Trump to know exactly what's at stake they're not gonna sit home they're not going to win all their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking that job was done when they went and voted in two thousand six day and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion and I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today have a website called American dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on the forecast models\nI'm I'm not familiar with his work by his headline is ran wave coming in the house and the Senate\n\nMy forecast for the twenty eighth congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected to\nOffice and in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr Merrill rights\nAs you remember from my book great news for [laughter]\n... member of my great\nBook grading the presidential election of two thousand sixteen was both an historic and critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era that I called the conservative era long range trans as one of the short range trends came together to cause a fundamental shift\nIn uh in each of our two major political parties in addition the other major changes took places well those were predicted unexplained uh in addition to lower Democrat voter intensity\nAmong democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\n\nAnd it's all being ignored he says by the drive by media these free movements of democratic voters abandoning their party are the walk away movement the reading\nPill movements and the great awakening movement\nAnd he goes on to describe what these what these are I've I'm no I'm unfamiliar with the red peel\nA movement but\nHe says he's got eight productions here that'll happen in the near future and they appear to be happening as we approach the mid term elections\nWe've witnessed a series of fall surprises including the capital hearings October surprises caravan of crisis mail bombs to some Democrats synagogue mass shooting we've seen outstanding economy tempered by considerable volatility a Wall Street we have seen extreme by it but that's another thing you know what the consumer confidence numbers are over the top\n\nConference board consumer confidence numbers over the top these numbers are not the kind of numbers you see in the ... electorate thats unhappy and angry and looking for radical change\nAt least that has been the case\nOr in in the past question comes down to just how important a factor is\n\nThe economy in elections of um [noise] candidates in this in this climate or the drive buys would like you to believe the economy doesn't matter hill of beans but they always say that when the economy is going great with Republican administrations\nUh the effort to give credit to Obama the attempt by Obama to take credit for the economy however would argue that Democrats in the media think it\nIs a problem\nThere's talk all over the winter that Hollywood leftist are promising blood in the streets if Democrats do not win the house\n\nAnyway back to our production here from this doctor Dr Gerard Francisco la marrow what has been the impact of these false surprises and the other events this is his personal thinking and again these these events these falls surprises\nHe calls them we call them October surprises that Kavanaugh hearings that was that we know what that was no I mean that was totally trumped up made up charges to derail Trump's Supreme Court nominee along the way it toward the railing Trump\nOr we have the October surprises the usual the caravan of crisis mail bombs or some Democrats synagogue mass shooting what's what's been the impact of\nThese calls for prizes and other events while intended to hurt President Trump and keep Republicans were holding the house all of the above surprises and events have worked to enhance the conservative\nRed wave according to this guy instead of creating a building and blue wave and a red wave continues Republican voter intensity exceeds the much heralded blue wave you by the way this is your what a blue wave would be what we need to properly defined a blue wave would\nMean the Democrats win everything they take back the Senate they'd take back the house by a large number if the Democrats win the house by two or three seats for and it's not that's not a blue\nWave a blue wave means a massive massive realignment and it doesn't look possible they are going to they're going to win the Senate if they don't win the Senate there isn't any blue wave I'm Talking about unreality not in terms of media lingo they'll call it whatever they want\nIf they emerge victorious\nBut all of these events were designed to cause this blue wave weren't designed to create this massive voter intensity and the turnout\nBy Democrats and even now in the early voting Republican turnout is much larger than democratic turnout unheralded that's unprecedented\nRepublicans seldom show up this while in early voting it's hard to explain it away but the conclusion is it there has been no blue way if there is not even been a blue ripple that you might even say there hasn't been a blue drip\nSome blow bubbles are bursting recall the blue bubbles are areas of blue support last time blue congressional districts and major coastal cities so this\nRadio news fifty seven degrees and cloudy in Des Moines our top national story this

with all the rest of us it's simply a law and order issue we have laws defining legal and illegal immigration we have a political party that is pushing illegal immigration\nAnd actually both parties

I I have at times I marveled that this country is held together the way it has for many years as it has\nGiven the only thing that really holds us altogether as a piece of paper or a series of pieces of paper the U.S constitution the honor system and the reverence the respect for that document is what's held us together\nIn all of our years we have never elected a desperate or a tyrant who want to literally rip it up throw it away and establishes on tyrannical dictatorship it's amazing but we're getting dangerously close to the same thing happening when one of our ...\nThe party's refuses to accept\nElection results for whatever reason it make it up well it was stolen the Russians this or that if it doesn't matter when they refused to accept\nIt means that there really isn't any unity around the premise of our country\nAnd we may not unify issue to issue the issue but we always have been unified about the premise of America as founded that's what's under assault today and that is what is in my mind\nA profoundly dangerous and we are raising him haven't been since the seventies generation after generation of students who have been taught things that have nothing\nIn common with the founding of the country we have not taught children we've ... we've ... you go back to the days when we learned that I'm In junior high intramural football in softball nobody won\nThat there were no outs in a baseball just nope no kid ever struck out the kidney hit until they hit the ball put it in play there were no losers there were no winners\n\nOutcome based education two plus two is five if you thought it was by we weren't going to humiliate people were wrong the people who are really smart and scoring a slow them down we're not going to service their superior ability to learn or going to slow them down so it was not to offend anybody else\nAnd we have now gotten to this point where kids have been raised cobbled\nThey had been taught phony notions of self esteem self esteem today does not derived from achievement an accomplishment it derives from I have a right to help self esteem parents have been\nTeaching little kids your perfect little Johnny you're perfect little Suzie I'm In it and not prepared for adversity and so when nobody has been raised to deal with adversity which in this case is losing an election we have temper tantrums and we have a child light snowflake behavior on college campuses\nAnd we have a political party that's behind all of this\n\nAnd right now it's rooted in the failure to accept the results of an election\nThat is on going\nAnd now on Twitter as I said you can find posts Hollywood people promising that there will be blood if the Democrats do not when\nThe house back there will be blood so people are being threatened if not directly but in a generic sense all of it is designed to limit turn out\nI think it's having the exact opposite impact on people I think the left and the drive by media continue to understand misunderstand\nWho Democrats are Trump voters are why they are Trump voters and why they aren't going anywhere [noise] uh let's see if we were also here being being told that we need a new kinds of civility that the Trump\nPresidency and all of his supporters are promoting all this in ... and the violence and so forth\nWhen it could be said that it's the exact opposite I ...\nI think reasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are and it's a large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do\nAnd it's ... refusal to accept this not just because Trump one is not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't and so they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy don't feel good and when they feel bad then something's not right and that's also been part of the education system\n[noise]\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ...

all of this is Dan in Manchester, Connecticut welcome sir great to have you here\nThat get rash I wanted to thank you for telling people about the truth intent of sexual on an amendment fourteen because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people aren't in the midst impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's um\nYeah ... ... it it's ... we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taking place on a lot of things in this country and that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet because what's causing this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens\nI've told everybody that this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night Eighteen sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth amendment that about slavery well the southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are closed that were so restrictive the blacks that it's actually made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game\nThat we're going to formally recognize former slaves as citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays per article for section two claws one\nSo after that the ... were polished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment if you're a few years later and you can find that in a house report number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth\nSo it all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be upholding the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he should do this and that's his point\nPeople have looked into this may have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who were involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors or foreign agents it was expressly\nWritten looking first citizenship on slams and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back\nThe Nineteen sixties when this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them that as a nation we suspended for the most part I mean ... there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass immigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties\nPretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate that's what immigration\nWas people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't have to they they settled in uh in in neighborhoods\nAre Irish had their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians ... ditto but they wanted to become Americans they learned English uh and they became part of American culture at ... of which there is a distinct and unique American culture which is rooted in\nWestern civilization that's what's different now there is no interest in that\n[noise] we don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan icing\nIf they use this term tribal but we're Balkan icing our population because modern arrivals don't all seek\nTo become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are but this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it\nThen for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be reestablishing the constitution to re asserting it so\nYeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points but the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the Senate God surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we got to come together and we got to do this we've got to do that\nAnd if it's being set up as being said in the media you know it's all aimed at Trump and his supporters appreciate the call again Southampton in New York build your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you Russian thanks for all that you do for us yes you ... ... with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually so that they can decide oh it'll be their language says it'll get there and I'll get there okay yeah it'll\nIt'll have to get there that no Senator Graham is going to offer legislation that in the Senate ah [laughter] look we're way way far away from this\nWe're just getting the conversation started here which has to happen there there there needs to be a pretty big re education of the American population in general on the whole subject\nUm maybe long term a economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but there isn't the political climate for that and many of these countries there their dictatorships one degree or another\nAnd this is an immediate problem that's going to have to be done because if it's not they're just going to keep coming\nAnd it's ... we're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones nominees nations where American companies can relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here\n'cause that's these people aren't capable being hired anywhere yet\nBut I understand that if you want to talk of political theory and economic theory it makes sense in the world and otherwise you know quote unquote normal circumstances but this is a short term political movement here this caravan [noise]\nI Know a wise or George Soros I think George Soros his name has become a like a bogeyman for everything people mean far left wing radicals when they mentioned George Soros I don't know who's behind somebody is and their\nPurpose is to destabilize the United states the purpose is not to improve life from these people\nThis caravan whoever's behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives better this is being done\nTo invoke damage on the United states particularly Trump and to advance the political advantages and notions of a particular political party which wants to welcome these people in as dependent voters a\nJam in Madison, Virginia great to have you with us You're next on the E R B network high\nAh yes fresh uh two years ago my husband and I adopted for Hispanics sisters\nWho were in foster

know even Hispanic girls that Trump was horrible that he was still send all these people that they realize now that he is doing what the country\nWell we'll take them or whatever they realize this is a is is is fine with me of course it's it's\nA once you understand what's going on it's impossible to support it's it's just it's impossible support on a little less you have particular political no

out an attack\nWe always ask what radicalized from what inspired him to go to violence we have to ask the same thing about right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now

there are a lot more in this country right now than there are Islamic terrorists\nYou can't divorce the actions of the sick people from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nSo what he's talking about is you have in a jihadi who walked into a mosque one day was a perfectly innocent young guy had no ill intent toward any buddy walks into a mosque starts listening to the among preaching and

there's always you know what it's rooted in folks it's rooted in the belief that not a single conservative can make up his or her mind but what about anything one of the first criticisms of this

mind on your own\nI'm telling you what to think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you want to go that has been the criticism and what does that rooted is rooted in the presumption of superior intellect to people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood and they made no effort to understand that and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his voters is what's largely doing them in\nThey never understood that you already believe what you

H. O. three day weather forecasts I'm channel Thirteen year I'll just make and sell off\nMid term analysis that talking about this blue wave fan reaction could be a red wave a news radio for civil law the only way to do [noise]\n\nThey'll let me explain what I meant I'm suffering here I'm In the last two callers have been speaking a mile a minute and I've been unable to hear enough of what they were saying [noise] to comprehend so I had to put it together after they hung up the most recent\nCaller I lost her when she was how families will gas light a the weakest number of the family I've I've never seen that\nSo I'm rolling it back and forth on my head but then I finally heard what she was talking about her definition gas light a I got an ... her point was that the Democrats the media can get to define everything\nThey get to define that get to decide everything and what they say is is what is it anybody isn't that then of course as abnormal or what happened and that\nThat that has been my point that's just a different way of saying that\nIt irritates the hell out of me too I watch the media ... my my favorite example of it and I'm Sorry for being redundant here Indiana and there are countless examples here Indiana passed a religious freedom Restoration Act\nThe media hated it it was in\nResponse to people not being allowed to tell gay couples no I'm not going to make a cake for your reception I my religion doesn't allow me to do that so these gay couples but then they would target these places hoping for that reaction and file lawsuits trying to put these bakeries and photo shop businesses out of business\nAnd the media would come right along and act like that was entirely justified\nThat these big it would refuse to bake a cake or take photos at a gay wedding reception or what have you uh so when someone when when Indiana passes along Pence has the governor the media was outraged and they began\nTo report on this as though the whole country was outraged that Indiana was somehow a loan out post of racism and bigotry and homophobia\nAnd it's this this this attitude\nAnd all things that they do wear what they report in the way they report it what they say is what is normal and they get to decide who the big it's are and who the uh the racist are and once that happens your tag you're it and then they ran around and they started knocking on doors\nAsking businesses\nWould you make a pitch so when you when you make a pizza for ... and they found a little girl Twenty one year old woman a running a pizza shop for her family you know we wouldn't it would be against them so they zeroed in on this Twenty one year old woman and they wanted to make her out\nTo be the typical Indiana ... and she was just answering their questions naively and innocently she was just trying to be honest with them she bought that they were really interested in what\nThey were asking about they were looking for a victim they were looking for a target and she fit the bill and so for however long the reporting it went on Indiana was odd the people in it are odd weird racist beget sexist ...\nI Know exactly what the caller ... Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks not true anymore\nThat may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against that the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand maybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral seats at federal state local level and there's a reason for this they are being rejected\nAnd the media is being rejected as as well and so gas if if if what the media did to the state of Indiana is gas lighting is if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse\nIt and ah and accepted and it's this arrogance and this is the primacy of superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's\nYou have a synagogue shooting while they're the obvious the obvious explanation\nIs that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody thinks this is crucial for the media the weather report these things to make it look like\nThey are the majority and they are what's normal went increasingly they aren't and what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition [noise] spent numbers normal\nAre trying to turned everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media is right in their facilitating this I'm telling you\nIt isn't it used to work like a charm\nAnd on many people still does we still have a lot of people in our side still want to couch how the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding\nBy virtue of one of the media as being nice to 'em or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there but the\nElectoral results just in the past two years ah indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that\nUh to see what [noise]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday on Sunday but apparently Chris ...
