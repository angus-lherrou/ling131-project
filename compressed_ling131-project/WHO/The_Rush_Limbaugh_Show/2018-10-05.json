some\nOther factors coming in also watch whether down south America looks like we do have an El Nino for me and typically those years and we have an El Nino for me to not get ill or production out of South America\nAnd right now we're seeing record for ... for the crop size of South America I think twenty percent more corn there last year twelve percent more soybeans my experience watching itself for crop is when you get everybody that gun ho about the crop shy this early on inevitably something bad happens\nHistorically El Nino ... have been pretty good for growing crops if it stays employees who the growing season\n[noise] yeah it does give us a milder winter in North America in pretty good crops in the U.S but it does have a history of causing problems in Australia Brazil and Argentina

they're not buying any this year show that's causing the whole basis area to walk back up\nA lot of the elevators are trying to figure out a way to get at St Louis and so they can wreck the spur of

think you could see some very significant basis improvement by sometime in the first or second quarter of Nineteen I'm I'm not real optimistic short term\nOf the month of October quite often it's when

Ford and the pressure came from a former FBI agent again who's one of the beach\nOf Dr Ford's if this is a witness tampering and somebody needs to tell me what it is\nCharles Grassley was on Fox by Grassley as I mentioned at the end of the yesterday's program Grassley has been on fire some thing has really set him off\nI Would think that it would have happened ... years and years and years ago but whatever something has really set him off now\nHe's going after the press accusing them face to face of out right by us he's accusing the Democrats are being insincere\nDoing great harm to the Senate want a grass leaves points is ... and John Cornyn two if we're going to get rid of somebody on the basis of an allegation with no proof what are we doing for every future nominated comes before this committee\nIf the new standard is is it all the nominee has to be is accused of something and that kills the nomination then where\nAre we hadn't we're headed exactly where the Democrats want\n\nJust to refresh remembered bossy foreign and leaving Kaiser worm worm ... some of them are some say best friends at the time of the alleged attack by Kavanaugh\nWhen Kaiser's denial was brought up during the hearing before the Senate Judiciary committee balls the Ford attempted to just credits her by saying what she's got health\nProblems can't ...\nI don't know but she was not well I I felt really bad for her\n\nTurns out that Leland Kaiser is a former pro golfer she does have back and neck problems but not mental health issues ... Monica McLean again ... lifelong best friend\nAnd the woman boldly forward allegedly coached prior to taking a polygraph test is Monica Monica McLean is all over the story we only learned her name in the past week or so\n\nAnd according to reports Monica ... plan was it bowls the foreign side and the hearing room before she testifies she was I have now seeing photos anyway Grassley said on Fox and friends this morning if there is evidence in the FBI report than other witnesses were leaned on by allies of Baltimore and as well not just leaving\nKaiser other witnesses ... that means every senator has seen that every senator this read the report has seen this\n\nAnd that apparently isn't changing any votes of the vote was fifty one to forty nine mansion\nFlight and Collins all voting yes but the final vote cannot happen by Senate rule before for\nForty two pm eastern time tomorrow has to be thirty hours after this vote was taken\nNow I Want to\nSay I'm not surprised by Murkowski who voted no a lot of people are asking is the vote now gonna not going to change I mean if we have the cloture vote and we got the procedural vote fifty one forty nine you know folks because I'm going to tell you what's happening out there\nI have I have been made privy to some of the comment and it's not just on social media but so the officers that\nSo many Republican senators are getting their being Daewoo used their entire families are being threatened\nTheir grandchildren are being threatened their wives or their husbands bar made everybody they know being threatened it's enormous it\nIs never ending the phones don't stop bringing a threatening emails and tweets do not stop arriving in is on the ... it is vile and it is evil and it's not just like\nAn columns and mansion it's all the Republicans are hearing it is one of the most disgusting things many of these people say they've ever seen\nIn that regard Jeff Flake and Susan Collins\nI think\nThey have to be credited for doing the right thing they are both facing enormous\nPressures flake as getting pressure like you can't believe for not only members of the pain\nProfessional mob squad on the left but other Democrats are in the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee\nAnd\nI don't think for for as far as flake is concerned he voted today for\nKavanaugh in us it's not technically a vote for Kavanaugh to vote to go to a final vote\nAnd the rule of thumb always is that as these procedural votes goes so goes the final vote but but but you can't make book on that simply because of the abject real frightening threats these people are getting\nAnd I think the vote for flake today was really hard\nI'll tell you why he went from being a yes vote to being harassed on the elevator\nTo becoming a yes vote with the FBI investigation he got what he wanted there still leaning on him he's leaving the Senate\nThis is his final term uh the easy thing to do here would be able to vote against Kavanaugh and received the praise of the mob and receive the praise of the Democrats that he went ahead and he voted\nIn what many of us think is the right way he did the right thing is going to be attacked vicious wave\nHe is going to be a cost and by the left all the way through the rest of the day tonight and tomorrow the same thing with Susan Collins a senator from Maine\nI Can't describe for you you might have an idea you're probably know the things that are being sent to these people the from rats that they are getting\n\nBeing alive and notion that we live in a civilized society\nIt's unhinged\nMuch of it is is insane and deranged and is made up of the psychological disorders that I Believe constitute and how the mainstream of the Democrat Party the protestors are paid their signs are all identically manufactured in the same phrases all over them\n\nAnd these people I don't know if you've received threats and I don't know if you've been ...\nBy them but if you have an if you believe them they can on a nerve you and yet flake\nAnd Collins did the right thing here I only hope that they're able to maintain their positions not Collins has announced that she's going to make a statement after three o'clock today\n\nAnd of course everybody's on pins and needles wondering what that's going to be now the thinking on this goes that that there is no way she wouldn't vote yes on the procedural vote this morning\nIf her intention is to vote no down the road if you're going to kill the nomination do it now not tomorrow I don't think any of these theories or traditions can be hoisted up\nAnd used and ... and I think we're in we're in brand new territory here for a number of reasons\nI don't think you can say that just because Susan Collins and voted yes this morning means that guarantees she's going to vote yes tomorrow and then why make a statement at three o'clock why why make some ... wife three o'clock and why make some statement\nI Try to keep my ego out of this as much as I can tell when I see somebody is going to make a statement a three o'clock first thing I realize this I'm not going to be here to comment on it\nRadio news our top story this hour the vote has been taken in the

objectives of the modern American leftist to transform America I'm away from its intentions and it's designed this founded and in many ways this was one of the agenda objectives of the Obama administration will look to do it in a stealth white Obama couldn't come out and\nSay beyond that his policies were transformative uh it couldn't define what that meant\nA there would've been a revolt that he wouldn't have been elected to have you been honest about what transferring America meant so why did he claimed it meant was taking on issues like climate change and health care for everybody and all this transform America but what they really want to do with transfer America away from\nOur unique sounding\nConverted to a socialist democracy some of the radicals even want to go further and and and have this country become totally communist\nBack looking as a poll out here today this from the Daily Caller Jay Paul is a buzzfeed news thirty one percent of millennials identify as democratic socialist according to a study that has been taking a [noise]\nYou know you'd like to not believe this but the facts on the grounds as to what you see\nEven though maybe anecdotal evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial men were far more likely to identify as some kind of socialist and women a total of forty percent responding affirmative late to the question now how would that help can that be\n'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't jibe with socialism you know what it is self reliance\nSelf reliance taking yourself seriously standing up for yourself believing in yourself relying on yourself\nBeing a man just does not jibe with socialism socialism does not work well with self reliant people socialism and communism attempt to her race self reliant people self reliant people people that do not need do not depend\nOn anybody but themselves their immediate circle are a huge threat the socialist in Congress or how the hell is this happened how is it forty percent of millennial men have become socialist more than women it ought to be the exact opposite\n\nWell hello modern era feminism\nWhich has had as one of its targets but the masculine as they should have men and they've been very open and honest about that they've even conjure up terms for it toxic masculinity\nDangerous masculinity they are doing their best to erase mailed natural male characteristics\nFor as many young guys as they can and since guys want to pal around with women whatever women want is what many end up doing on balance I mean you have individual exceptions of course you got Clint Eastwood's or you've got James ...\nDoes it tell everybody to go to hell when they're told how to live and how to act but on balance men do what women want him to do if the big book as famous and hot women did get men are going to go say they're reading it or try to become\nConversant and it just the nature of things and so they're being highly highly successful\nAnd targeting America and its founding not just targeting capitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept that government is the institution that needs to be limited most\nIn a representative republic that the emphasis of government the getting government out of people's lives just the exact opposite with communist socialist so I have an evidence base here\nNot just slapping my gums there's a New Yorker story by Michael lift up a guy\nPublished yesterday the cheers of Brett Kavanaugh is its title [noise]\nIt is a horrible peace and it does exactly that which I had been warning people it goes all the way back to the founding of America the trash white men that reminds me hang on here you need a grab an audio soundbite\nHere it's a bit of that but I Do but it would you be every bit of six and seven [noise]\n\nPoke quote Kavanaugh has no avenue of appeal do except his own hurt feelings he's in touch with them as he was taught to be and so he seemingly weaponized crying the way a little boy does when he's in trouble\nAnother poll quote But Kevin last performance last Thursday was something entirely different distinctly contemporary if combined the post war attitude that men should be in touch with their feelings to the point that they make crime with the intrinsic American ideal of white male privilege\nBecause Kevin is accused of sexual assault and may be denied the career elevation he has long ... he blah burned like\nA newborn he has plot ... his career you see\nHe hasn't had a series of goals in a gym them all know that guy is a dangerous\nSchemer he has plot to get on the Supreme Court\nWhere he can a rule against minorities and women and Latino sent this band aches and gays lesbians transgendered now it's you know this has been a lifelong ... strategy of Brett Kavanaugh and when there was\nThat she's going to do this after this program and is mean it means rush it can't be anything you're going to like I'm getting emails that say you think that's right too\nCertainly has absolutely thinks that's right as well well we'll we'll see I'm not I'm not going to withdraw my uh acknowledgement that I think she did the right thing [noise]\nBut I'm going to get to the phones because I've um I've gone to many first hours this week without getting to the phones that changes today especially being open line friday so we'll go to Pleasanton, California first with Chris hello\nNow however that rush a good to talk with you\nI'm this Monica McClain who you were just speaking of the person that contacted Amish Kaiser on and trying to get her to possibly change your testimony yeah uh she she used the same person that the boyfriend or Dr Ford mentioned in the letter he sent him talking about how\nAre those coaching going on but Dr Ford on trying to get somebody to handle a polygraph\nProbably yeah that's another story by the way the boyfriends letter has yet to be reported in\nMainstream media nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring we wouldn't Kaiser to change your test of those two stories have not been reported ABC CBS NBC Washington Post New York times Associated Press people have not heard even though that\nAnd there's other things like for example a Dr Ford mentioned in her Senate and the testimony she gave she mentioned ... Delaware was where she was at and that's the last known address of of this Monica McLean\nCorrect yes as a ... absolutely that's when they wrote a letter when when when balls the Ford wrote the letter that's where she was she was in ... ... ... a Delaware with my client yet\nSo here's my question there's there's an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on but beyond that behind the scenes here that hasn't come out yet I I'm Wondering is not is it is the Democrats oddly enough or not better off holding this vote now for more of this comes out\nIt's\nGoing to go through at the last minute change one of the people that things are going to vote changes it suddenly it goes down and a quarter and then because all of this is about to come out\nNext not about to come out that's the whole point you know it but it's not going to come out it hasn't come out yet it's not going to come out now one thing it has the lead when Kaiser a pressure to change your testimony that is in the FBI report the Democrats have seen that Grassley reference that and Grassley said there's a lot more\nThere are many more examples of balls before the witnesses being pressure to change your test them on the Democrats have seen all that it doesn't change and it's not gonna change anything this is not\nAbout the evidence it never has been about the evidence and if those two stories miraculously made the front page of the New York times website in five minutes and it baby CBS NBC began to report on this day but wouldn't change one Democrat Senate vote\n\nDemocratic delayed about anyway that's up to McConnell a turtle\n... well the question is why when Republicans make make a greater effort for it to come out\nWhy really ever to uh\nUh [noise]\nUh it's in the FBI reporting to Republicans and Democrats can see it if the the the Monica McLean aspect is in the FBI report they discovered ...\nCombined knowledge none of the center to grassroots so forth they are not mentioned what we were just talking about\nNo no they're not I can't tell you why they're not mentioning\nOkay thank you you bet I'm Wondering myself [laughter] um well\nI Know your questions are entirely legitimate and they're rooted in pure commonsense you're sitting there thinking if the world know this it would change everything it shows that the Boise foreign side is willing\nTo commit perjury supporting perjury pressure witnesses to change their stories which then couldn't be standing to conclude that there's not anything that Boise Ford is saying it's reliable\nBut those two stories have not been seen by the American public at large they've not showed up at Yahoo News Associated Press New York Times CBS NBC CNN and they want\nFor ... reason the stories are being suppressed but the Democrats in the Senate no it doesn't matter it's about the seriousness of the charge is not about the nature of the yeah but\nI never see Russia as Mickey I met were\nIowa live news\nWhen you put a safe and you're home what will you put in it\nWhat are your most valuable possessions well there's just one random safe you should trust to put in your home and that's right oh saves\nThe craftsmanship of their iron works apes which are made in America one of the main issue it takes skills sweat and talent to produce the most beautiful and secure or safe in the world and that's what rhino saves are\nBeautiful creations that help keep your possessions secured parts art part furniture and one hundred percent security rhino saves are built to protect you and your family from the uncertainties of this world now\nHow do you get your own rhino metal safe well check out their extensive dealer network on line at rhino safe dot com veteran owned and veteran operated for over Twenty years that's our H.

her warriors did and that that she had seen a therapist\nAnd the grass when he's been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused to produce this and in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr forge allegations she passed away in fact we want to see it\nThey won't let him see it\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations wiped away you have claimed\nSome reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not a lie detector that she passed the lie detector that she told all these details tour therapist well let's see that stuff and they won't produce it\nAnd Grassley said you must you must have something to hide then he writes I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over to therapy now it's the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or her representatives and and I am following one US Senators are their staffs particularly the offices of Feinstein and Hirono\nNumber two the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge Patrick PJ ... my ... and fried W Ramirez Julie sweating representative what what what Grassley is getting at here how much consultation if you had with his witness\n\nSenator Feinstein senator her own owes them how how much time spent with this witness discussing her testimony\nOr coaching hard whatever\nI mean you loaded for bear that's just the kind of college out of the violation and I shouldn't call it that these are this is the kind of decorum that you you don't see broken senators don't challenge each other they don't call each other out that's almost the Senate rules\nAnd and Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conference he kept running back to the microphones and then to the Senate or are they the\nMedia people as [noise] using by us and so forth in fact grab one of the aisle soundbite number five\nThis was [noise] I don't know if this was at a press conference or not it may not be exactly what I saw but it is an example of a grass with his finger on the pulse here this is I'm not it's not what I've seen this this\nMorning and washed but let's listen to what we have learned is the reason is that has existed since the day after the November twenty sixteen the election\nIs centered right here on Capitol Hill they have encouraged Marlboro\nWhen you hear things about get in their face bother people at every restaurant where you can find a cabinet member theater coming from public service that ought to set an example of civility in American society and it's been made worse by what has happened to judge Kavanaugh I Hope we can say\nNo to a mob rule by voting to confirm judge Kevin on the floor that\nWas during his a southern for remarks today in favor of capital he was he was singling out by the way Maxine Waters\nFor promoting this as he called the resistance but he's he's calling them out here\nAnd\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule\nAnd the the resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right the leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party the resistance is over the Democratic National Committee and in various Senate\nOffices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth he I've I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats like this\nFit to be tied now I think I have some might relate to it I got\nAn email last night from Salinas Ito who has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaign season of two thousand sixteen she went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned everything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously\nShe went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there that the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns\nMedium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it if the Democrats in the media wanted to know who voted for Donald Trump all they'd have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo ah never Trump or his or anti Trump presents an amazing display of arrogance\nAnd by the way the same can be said of Republican political consultant so they don't care who the Trump voters are all that matters is that they are left at impugn didn't made fun of so I get a known for her last night\nAnd she is explaining to me what the Kavanaugh hearings have meant\nAnd what has happened out there in these areas she has studied and she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump to gather\nNow a lot of us of assumed that if people voted for Trump in two thousand six day that they did sell for very specific reasons among them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back\nAgainst Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom\nAnd then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six days that they would not forget that and that they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way\nSadly\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\n\nAnd that is the capital\nCircumstance in her mind the conservative populist coalition\nAbout Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh she has not officially said she's going to vote for or against him but she began by expressing her frustration about the entire process citing judge Kavanaugh's detractors\nSaying that they began expressing their opposition before his name was ever known and saying special interest groups have whipped their supporters into a frenzy spreading false alerts about cabin off producing headlines which were a bunch she says but then spread on social media senator Collins is going through several points at this hour raised by opponents of\nJudge Kavanaugh she's defending the nominee including his stance on roe versus Wade quoting Kavanaugh saying that it is settled law and it's important to honor legal precedents\nAs they continue to be many protesters in Capitol Hill a on the un Washington following the events of this nominee some interrupted proceedings on the Senate floor\nThe for senator Collins began speaking as she is among some that are being very closely watched her vote that is ahead of what's expected to be closed confirmation vote on Brett Kavanaugh Alaska's Lisa Murkowski has said she's leaning no meantime Arizona's Jeff Flake says he plans to vote in favor of Kevin not tomorrow\nAnd what's been happening today is procedural the official vote is expected to take place tomorrow\nI'm sue Daniel send our

[noise] oh yeah or doing\n[noise] another interesting thing hand other new develop it here but hang on just a second there is a second tweet from Kimberly Russell\n\nLisa Murkowski Republican Alaska\nToday voted to abandon due process and the presumption of innocence\nShe voted to potentially if the Supreme Court and a four Ford that block which puts loaning Ninth Circuit court of appeals in control of everything that matters to Alaska her state development property rights gun rights environmental rules\nLisa Murkowski has made quite the statement\n\nThese are tune devastating tweets

and a number of other things just just\n[noise] not much redeeming there but more importantly\nLisa Murkowski has voted to leave Kavanaugh subject to claims of perjury and impeachment and then\nLeaving the court if he's not confirmed accord stays uh for for a deadlock what the ... the reason that matters is that in a ... ... if the court votes for four on any case then the decision prior to the court hearing it is affirmed nothing changes\nAnd that means that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals would be the highest ranking court\nThat could make decisions regarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska her own home state\nIt is it would be like to put the night if you're a Republican and by the way she does believe in property rights and development and gun rights and to put the Ninth Circuit court of appeals in a bunch of a leftist in charge of those issues in her state there's this shooting herself in the foot\nAll just supposedly be in unison with me too movement

has a hand look on her face Feinstein that looks like she is\nWell the picture speaks for itself it it it would that hand up she got a cornered she got her hand up on the wall framing Murkowski\nIt's an aggressive move it allows Feinstein's leaning in to Murkowski\nNow let's switch to the close up of that photo for those will be watching on the dental camp do you see\nThe pain expression on the face of Murkowski and the ... of in hand seriousness and you better be listening to me\nOn the face of diet for\nNow we'll have these photos up at Rush Limbaugh dot com to I'm not trying to leave

Feinstein is running this relationship it looks like Feinstein is giving her what for [noise]\n[noise] I don't know when the picture was taken and I will acknowledge that our interpretation could be wrong we we have no context here other than the hearings and the way this has been going well I wouldn't call that romantic I take that back ah one\nOf these is from California and romance there has

I Know what to Tennessee and it's deep red that'll just wants to win and so forth but this\nHe expects this to pay off for him in his campaign this is obviously a reaction and reflection\nOf public sentiment for Kavanaugh in this state of Tennessee\nPhil Bredesen is by the way we're starting to lose ground to Marsha Blackburn in polling data this this record ... seats And Corker by the way has also tweeted today that it is outrageous\nTo punish somebody who hasn't done anything to anybody\nOf these ... pose the actions other men have engaged in against women but his point is we have no
