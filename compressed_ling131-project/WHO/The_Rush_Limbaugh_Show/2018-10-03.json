family safe get your own maximum security ...\nSays no big show [noise]\nA lot about twelve if one of the one on the show ... or ... when the big\nShowdown Cooper Andy Petersen we're talking insurance right now fellows and uh yeah first shot out of the gun you would think why you guys talking about insurance a lot of folks cell that well here's a bit of background or talking about today is health insurance\nAnd a member of back to the legislative session the farm bureau was working with the state legislature on a health care program there would be available to a members that so little bit different a lot of the farm folks have been\nTalking about the need for a health insurance and reasonably priced health insurance and so legislature said yeah well you can go ahead and put together a plan and we've been waiting for that plan to come out and now it's it's out\nAnd that's what we're talking about today so that's the background that's where all the big hubbub is about here talking health insurance on the big show\nSteve campfires with us and Steve you have been\nA working this morning training or some of the agents is going to be selling this product so I I guess we're going to hear from from the guy who's explaining it and I want you to explain that to us so what what is it that we're talking about and uh the farm bureau members are going to have a ... offered to him here to kind of starts off\nShoring up up I'd be happy to do that yeah they're all they just got about a hundred and twenty eight and a kind of a special place for me 'cause it's about thirty miles from our family farm so it kind of make the trip up here today but\nWhat we're talking about is the ... and ... and the legislature passed a bill back in the twenty eight legislative session which was signed into law in April\nWhich allowed ... to develop the health benefits plan for its members the you know the Affordable CARE Act created some things in the marketplace that helped a lot of people be able to obtain health insurance but were unable to paint it before but it created some unintended\nConsequences and one of those consequences is there some folks now that that is because they don't qualify for the tax credits or subsidies underneath the boardwalk Iraq\nHad been priced out of the market so this plan is really designed to help those folks or be able to have a a comprehensive renewable benefit plan that that they can afford\nNow or you're talking about affordable do you have a prices figured in there so if we we called our Farm Bureau guys they can they can quote prices to us\nWell I tell you why can't I Can't give you back right obviously that's going to make a difference on how old you are white and black and all the other thing that\nBut I can tell you that are the folks that are out there that don't qualify for a for a group plan and therefore they have to buy their own insurance and if they don't qualify for those who do we think these these rate will be much more cost effective for them than uh\nThan in ... when a frankly those folks that are on the the plans that are eating stuff the subsidies they're probably in the best plan they can possibly be and they should probably stay there but this was really going to appeal to those that don't qualify for those tax credits\nNow one thing one requirement is is you have to be a foreign bureau member\nBrecht and ... ... go ahead I'm Sorry\nAnd I was I was just asking you that one go ahead\nNo you are correct the legislation basically allowed a offer a plan to our members of the legislation requires that um we do require you to be a member to apply that hurdle is not ... and you can certainly work with your agent\nWork with your local county Farm Bureau and they can get that set up for you the fairly easy process to do and we certainly encourage folks to do that it had a\nWho who's going to be administering this this plan\nThis plan will actually be administered by all while mark administrators and it was very at Walmart Blue Cross and Blue Shield during the state of Iowa we or Walmart or decade actually deliver a health plans to our numbers and this is kind of a continuation of that partnership\nNow do you have kind of a a cafe programmer I can pick off a different things that I Need or or do you have different levels or do you have different uh uh you know a deductible price points things like that\nYeah absolutely we will have read different plans available for applicants to look at and make a select from two of them will look kind of like your traditional health insurance plans there used to with co pays for doctor visits and prescription drugs and then secondly or\nThirdly I guess we'll have a what's called a high deductible health plan and that allows folks to ah basically contribute to an age if they don't use those eight to eight dollars to pay for some of that care that they receive so we will react out there in in that way the member and select what makes sense for them or their family\nAnd I know we we don't have the details here in front of us but it is it ... is available and all Ninety nine counties and have service there and all my nine counties all hospitals you know things like that I mean that's one of the things we we\nUh care a lot about out in the countryside is that sometimes we're you know we're not near a big city\nAbsolutely and yet it will be available and all night nine counties we're using the Walmart blue HMO network\nHas access every hospital in the state and probably Ninety seven or Ninety eight percent of all the providers in the state you know we know that a health care is the number one priority that our members have pulled us was important I Know the old way over the weekend and kind of said the same thing\nIn the individual health insurance or health care market\nIs only about five to seven percent of the overall population but it just ... fortunately affect those farm families than a lot of those folks don't have access to those plans do we think this is going to be a good opportunity for to help that group people get coverage that they needed\nNow one final question here we're we're gonna let you go we're up against clock too so uh do do you have to sign up at any certain time period eyes got notice here uh we're we're we are that you have a ... what what do they call the open enrollment period I mean is that a part of this to\nKnow it does not the open enrollment period or the or Iraq plan starts on November one that we ah coincidentally are opening our enrollment up on November one as well wherever the plans are available for at any point during the year\nSo if folks need something come next February next June whatever it might be they would have the opportunity to purchase that plan then\nWell Steve you've been a world of help to us thank you so much for us spent some time with us today\n... thanks Bob\nAnd we and we'd like to get you out in the field a little bit a maybe a so hopefully things will start drying up for a round there as well\nAbout it and you bet Steve cam are with us or he knew it was in training or fellows on the folks going to be selling this new uh insurance program new health insurance program like I said the reason we're talking about on big shows there was a big deal\nThat uh we had been talking about uh that uh uh then

I think they've been caught big time and I Rachel Mitchell if I have the time I I just got enough data on this right before the program again I didn't have time to assemble it\nBut the questioning that we all thought was a waste of time has exposed potentially Dr Ford just so many lives that if it ever came became necessary to use them she can be destroyed or the credibility credibility can be destroyed\nA and I think everybody is going to try to get past this or through this with out any any\nChallenging or Dr Ford because she's a eliciting such sympathy and one of the way she did that was with her speech pattern which I Am one of the only people in the media that I Know of a pointed out her speech pattern I look I'm a professional and highly trained broadcast specialist\nVocal work a voice\nCapabilities voice talents [laughter] excuse me again art ... gotten it out there that time we'll see\nAre especially of mine I recognize speech patterns I Am able to attach speech patterns to personality types you can definitely do this\nWell a voice actress even how they\nDecided to post on Twitter her impersonation of Dr Ford afterwards and the Twitter universe came down on this woman on mercilessly [noise]\nSo we have not mentioned her name it's out there but I Want to protect her or at least here\nFrom any further assaults taking place but here is what she posted and it is so spot on\n... anybody personal ... tiny about fat ... ball\nThat's how I found an hour it even ...\nI talk to them and my pockets arms up then I found out about tobacco gr policy [noise]\nHow how her as far as ... even now I'm back on ... [noise] yes that's correct a ... by ... or ...\nYou can read like how many [noise] [noise] I plan running down about bumped up laughing my ...\nAnd ... that that speech pattern what does it make you think you're dealing with a child here the elite up talking at the end of every sentence has its vulnerability\n... is its fragility almost in a way or maybe even somebody nervous in traumatized and scared and that is exactly\nThe a personality that I think she wanted the FX and she succeeded\nWith it and it's because of that but I think I don't no matter what has learned about her and how much she has lived if you will\nA which again Rachel Mitchell has if necessary [laughter] could blow this woman out of a water that's what I had nobody else has put this together by the way that I've seen I've just in random show prep Reno a story here story there I've been noticing things\n\nWill be a little reference to what Rachel literal asked her about subject a and her answer it and you read another story and there's one more reference to Rachel but you can put all these together\nAnd it\nIt it's almost as though Rachel Mitchell knew going in\nThat\nShe knew a lot more about balls the Ford than anybody has a little bit too she knew about Monica McLean she knew about the polygraph you imagine why she asked\nHim this\nWhy why are you this is not what this is about Canada why are you asking her details chicken farm about her story instead this prosecutor was asking all about seemingly unrelated or not really important\nThings so we will just have to say again Monica McLean retired FBI and this by the way brings up or conjures up FBI\nFord has a best friend in the FBI who read resigned retired in two thousand sixteen\nA wonder how many people working on the Trump case the FBI trying to establish collusion that Dr Ford and ... McLean no you know what kind of a possible connection here is there maybe\nSo it's it's it's I'm fascinated as this letter from the from the ex boyfriend\nAnd the primary reason the ex boyfriend says he broke up with her is how she lied about using his credit card he took her name off the credit card when they broke up and she can tend to use that she ... about six hundred bucks on\nA\nFord was asked directly in the hearing if she had given tips on how to pass a polygraph she said\nNever never\nRachel ... have you ever given tips your advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test never remember when that question was asked I Do think what the hell was this\nNow Senator Grassley has been busy refuting claims made by ... and others Grassley is on fire by the way Grassley is doing such a bang up job as is his staff here\nAt Grassley sent a letter to foreigners attorneys telling them about the ex boyfriend seeing her coach somebody on how to pass a lie detector test\nAnd has again we ask\nFor the therapists notes and the polygraph the audio visual they want to see it rationally and the committee want to see the notes of her meetings with her therapist and they want to see the polygraph test that Ford took and Ford's lawyer's have returned that reviews attorney any of that over\n\nSo they're not being forthcoming with things that that are a crucial now Dianne Feinstein is made a move to steal the FBI investigation I think they think the case is collapsing and you know what I think\nEvidence of the case collapsing is this New York times story on Trump's taxes that's the first\nThing I thought when I saw that's New York times story because they've been sitting on this so long that Showtime hasn't been able to prepare a TV documentary on it\nSo Showtime which is owned by CBS\nHas been working with the New York times on this documentary on the supposedly explosives details of Trump's taxes and what do we know about Trump's taxes\n\nWell it's a blockbuster story of the day the times reports that Trump's father may have left him more money than anybody knew about\nForty years ago\nAnd the Trump and his siblings set up shell corporations and phony this isn't bad style high and the money from the I.

I I understand\nRepublican senators saying what they're saying oh my God this is on except I don't know why president that\nHe did it for some reason everybody's pointing out that the Trump just\nLast week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he set it\nTo everybody has to\nBefore all this is a investigated and put your but you can't run out there and start ripping on her\nEven if it's deserve even if it's warranted last week you could not read up on Christine Blasey Ford there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying to her teeth and you can demonstrate a last week was not the time to do it so Trump joined the chorus\nI find a compelling I find her very credible will now\nShe's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible is all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed amount all Trump did is playing out the flaws in her story which should have happened\nThe hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there they were not going to challenge or because it just wasn't smart especially with that voice that she was affecting to go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe it\nWhat did not been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearings committee hearing her allegations wouldn't be challenged in tests that they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or the ... or the difference is the ... she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's all they did Republican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't\nSo Trump's Kevin I'm covered Trump's writing shade for them and let them go out and rip him for doing it if they want to understand that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't\nStep in it it may look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big takeaway for me as this one you know the New York times has been investigating that Trump's for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what is not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump guess what one word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess\nWhat I often just say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hint it was the sole\nReason the left I wanted to get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia ah ten for that yet they want to Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said\nWould prove Trump colluded because his money came from Russia because his wealth was be causing due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced was true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and then not able to find any Russian mommy\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\n\nThey're the ones who said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN and go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was they put in storage\nTrump wasn't totally Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents the first thing they did\nI was actually or whatever or somebody somebody to change our own thing mostly are too young to remember\nA bottom line is I Know what had happened to a woman for political\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people to audiences don't remember the Clinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy all at Johns\nEh you never know what you know when you got to be able to walk with what you're going to come up with what you're not gonna you're gonna come up with women like New Hampshire aren't great but it's not as\nBill Clinton and that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring to these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial than it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down a memory hall\nNow I have a transcript and anti Kevin all protester was confronted and I'm a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall\nOr any Kevin all protesters of flooded Capitol Hill and they've been allowed to get into the hallways of the offices\nIn Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know that what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin all where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back he asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there Senate didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're going to you're going to believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there\nHer best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it her best friend said she didn't remember it\nProtester so you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy wait a second are you OK as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIt would destroy your wife your son's life or your husband's wait a second answer my question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated when you write that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy push back but it's a lost cause on the protester\nThe protesters not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words in what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCast that you know no would you like and on corroborated charged destroy I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk so the protester\nHold on wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up ... you know it's unfair protest I Would fight it would make sure women or heard clearly you're all care for rape is goes on the Supreme Court castle you know I'm not [noise]\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protester no there is evidence looking at a standard how many people are in jail for ...\n[noise] so what this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript something like this and help people understand if it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\nYeah I I've told the story when I was first at this\nVery young Web behind me years naive and the media would want to talk I thought there too they're really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard\nOf me a radio shows taken off I thought they were legitimately curious\nAnd that's how I went into early interviews I found out that not at all they were curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts\nIt took me longer than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you can't change their minds and debate it's why I say the only option is to defeat them politically and that's happened\n[noise] that somebody has to have to say rush probably by being met

Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time\nWe were all kind of curious what what's the purpose was\nUm all Trump is doing is reminding everybody what she said she doesn't she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can't poke holes in obvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention\nOf the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is it is it is not mocking Christine ball the Ford\nNow Trump has a lot of people saying but this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling I have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways\nEventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything\nAnd he may not do that out of the batter's box I have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump will the necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers or in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head and they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left the Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later\nTo be critical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found her compelling them as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially when he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph experts and has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did it gives him a credibility later to be critical step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything it's\nWhy I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there have been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned that Trump\nWill tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... the ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at the moon to the right\nTo oh he's on record as being open about that later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what he thinks\nReally thinks it's a pattern it's a technique you get paid trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans habits Trump has Trump has a ... that after\nHe makes an initial statement on somebody and he can make fun\nOf things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell us how he'd be able to teach them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper in triumph I cannot tell you how ... insane\nIt has made the with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off Trump\nHasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did just three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know Murkowski\nIn Collins or shorter ringing cowering in the corner with the vapors\n[laughter] oh my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said it's true\nIt was not mocking her\nThe actress video audio we played mocked mostly for Trump didn't\nHe just said boy she she can't backup she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why you're not relevant\nWhy does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accuse any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me two were all women can join the can you imagine if there was something going on there can you imagine a man organized\nFor the express purpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine that can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\nWell\nRush or a million women or nor do there should we be\nWell it yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and have been ridiculed and made fun of the rest of his wife ... could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not\nUh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump did\nWell say what everybody following this knows even the Democrats Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he needed Trump said guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous\nOur local story this hour west of my police say two suspected purse Snatchers racked up more than five thousand dollars in charges\nOn a woman's

in the morning on October [noise] presented by burning the selection was to America's going when he\nBreathing so welcome back Rush Limbaugh but yeah I mean I've worked for the areas the there's the James of the gym and\nGuarantee quote from a National Review um\nThe more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activist or not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them\nOnto the world of politics mango I've been searching for that description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together as one of the rare moments I was unable to this is exactly right\nWe're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the river bend is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that that are the individual that did something could\nBe made to pay a price for it that's what the ... this this um [noise] well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the um [noise]\nOccupy Wall street movement looking black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people who for some reason I think they haven't been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims\nAnd then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\n\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debates about whether\nBoys\nWant to pretend to be girl so they can go on a girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\nThat's sick ... ... in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating movement\nThat has\nBeen constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is\nAmerican Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who've been abused whether she's telling the truth\nOr not it doesn't matter because it did happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case me Kevin ... that's how they're going to be heard rather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them\nIt's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white cop as a rape every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in bias and discrimination in racism all of this\nThe Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints\nDemocrat parties happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the raging angered never ends if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly\nWhat I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats there to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... ... email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocks she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine walls before\nAnd here it is that there's this they didn't even the Connecticut Senator who himself has been a target up attacks from Trump the target of attacks from the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target\nOf attacks from Trump Trump didn't attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and\nIt was all about do you think that maybe the president should have done it marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski ended me in the way they bowed means or what do you think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was gaining the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was dating facts that were given during Dr Ford's testimony and it's and it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said has been faked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits an outrageous\nExactly right ya can't challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have to go ... to do it Trump did it in yeah he's providing the little shade for some of these people hide under\n[noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish he hadn't done a Dutch outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately\nSomebody has to say it\nIt's the freaking truth\nOkay back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old ever among glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again\nA right to have your back\nYeah great to be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into normal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them or come an old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know you had to draw on CNN or like a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number [noise]\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me\nTo kind of white ... ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe\nShe thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for a man you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant capturing the Kennan this was back in the nineties\nShe was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the all sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today\nYou have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from that the cause of what she's been taught\nAnd heard on the news and talking to her but she may literally believe that men don't have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believe it\nWill rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped\nThe ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sects\nHave you\nEver um uh you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to the white hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhether it's their idea then everything's fine you\nKnow God if not better I by the way here's this ... you're\nAlso random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly include all women women on across America who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will\nIt's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media or making I think every measure young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to be real careful about it just

B. I. D. O. J. people that were doing this\nAnd I think the objective of Christine lousy for this whole thing not her specific maybe I look I think she's an activist and then on it but that's neither here to there the objective of this was to get Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination or to have Trump pull it\nNow that that hasn't happened\nThis case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media about how all this so called evidence just isn't there they thought that the mere allegation that the cabinet with not sit there and let his life me destroyed like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there\nAnd let his nominee need be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego is such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they fought there would be a giant cave on this and there hasn't been\nSo now it is panic and scramble time\nSo the zero in on flake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christie and Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story and the media is all over the place now saying\nWell you know there's just many screwed it Murkowski and Collins they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh\nOkay well ladies and gentleman I told you some things yesterday but I'm sure people have forgotten but there are no different today than they were yesterday\nDemocrats senators in red states are in heat being ... reelection trouble in fact there was news yesterday polling data late polling that we may be looking at a red wave and the Senate not a blue wave\nIn North Dakota which Trump carried by thirty six points Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo doo after having come out against capital of the latest poll\nTaken after the Democrats began smearing Kavanaugh but before the committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer to Republican opponent to hike camp has opened a ten point lead\nOver hype camp\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana is similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing her challenger Josh\nHawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that McConnell when women out\nOr that some Republican senators wouldn't wimp out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to\nKnow the words these three Heitkamp Donnelly my cat what's actually for Donnelly McCaskill mansion in Heitkamp have all been hoping that Collins caves\nThat maybe even McConnell would cave and that Murkowski would cave and that flake will continue to flake and cave\n\nBut in their states they're held to pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed in fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven\nPolling has been gun heading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski\nBut if they if if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night\nWell\nThat would be embarrassing for them [noise] [noise] now\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford I Want to share something with you I found today power line Scott Johnson one of the contributors a power line writes that a reader of theirs\nNoted the changes in the timeline that Dr Ford herself presented the power line\nReader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with a specialty in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic he created a chart in essence\nBased on public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents and it\nIs the dates to varying dates the different dates of the sword did invent Dr ... says happened\n\nAnd the dates float she's not even consistent with the ... so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story changed correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second his question why the sudden\nChange within a few weeks after July six of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat or bits of Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists\nAs they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\nSalt\nThe charge here and try not try to serve a difficult to convey but this is a text charge there is some uh some bars in this thing but it isn't titled Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged incidents\nIn the therapists notes the incident is said to have occurred and the men the Nineteen eighties when she was in couples therapy\nThe therapists notes from when she was an individual therapy say that the story occur in not in the mid eighties but the late eighties in her text message to the Washington Post she's back to saying that it happened in the\nMid eighties\nIn her letter to Dianne Feinstein she said the incident happened in the early eighties in the hand written statement at the time she took her polygraph high school all summer in the eighties and early is crossed out\n\nEarly eighties could've been eighty eighty one\nIf the Senate Judiciary committee hearings she said it happened in the summer I'm Nineteen eighty two she had never said that before\nShe had said mid eighties late eighties mid eighties\nEarly eighties highschool summer early eighties she specified summer Nineteen eighty to these changes occur as she is in consultation with all these Democrat activists the staff of Feinstein and an Anna Eshoo and Deborah cats the the lawyer\n\nAnd hurt changing story leaves her short on credibility put aside her emotional performance\nHer testimony reveals her as a witness was memories change at her convenience\n\nThe problem for Dr Ford is not that she doesn't remember everything if the everything she remembers changes that her convenience first Ford's testimony the assault occurred in the summer of any two when she would just Fifteen conflicted with both her therapist notes and the text message\nHere is that President alert or your phones and ... yeah I forgot to warn people about this
