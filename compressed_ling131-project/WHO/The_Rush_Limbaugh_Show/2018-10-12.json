you feeling kind it will\nBe always reading follow legal instructions that Iran is restricted use pesticides\nBut because while this guy is jumping all in my chili listened to this story this is from the federalist papers liberal professors says hurricane victims deserve to what thank God because they support Republicans\nNow do you think these clowns in Boston with zero in on something genuinely get range like this no they're going to make up the fact that a bunch of people like me who know oh that climate change and man made climate change is a hoax\nAre somehow responsible for people having lost everything and floating risking their lives\nDoes University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota verbal and fluids science is ...\nSo Dr John Abraham he's a professor\nActually believe the Florida Panhandle residents deserve to get hit by a catastrophic hurricane because\nThey elected climate deniers\nHere's the headline and an article written by this guy was published in the guardian not some obscure little rag\nOr a penny saver this was published in the guardian on Thursday victims of hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers elections have consequences denying science has consequences and we are reaping what are we so\n\nPeople just like this are teaching your kids and they're being paid a lot of money to do it\nThis is the wide chicken the reasoning that he is teaching any engineering school the guy is still range this is this is hyper political partisanship disguised as science\nHe thinks that voting for Republicans causes hurricanes to hit red states and the people in red states\nWho voted Republicans deserved to get wiped out by hurricanes for voting for Republicans and his name is Dr John Abraham a University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota\n\nDespite the lack of science to support his case Dr Abraham blames Michael's intensity on manmade global warming there isn't any evidence for it it's not the most intense hurricane to ever hit the panhandle\n\nYet he blames the intensity or manmade global warming are needing to his subsequent claimed that southern voters brought this upon themselves\nBy voting Republicans into office\nIt's a wonder that a state like Florida which will get pummeled by Michael couldn't vote for somebody that denies climate change this doctor wrote\nPointing to governor Rick Scott andme to Senator Marco Rubio on the his argument is that in the last Republican climate deniers or voted out of office that more hurricanes will bring more death and destruction of the south is so\nThis clown who is disguised as a as an engineering professor literally is saying that if you want to stop\nDestructive hurricanes striking where you live vote Democrat he literally this one is what he said\nIn an unrelated story a bunch of which is somewhere are putting a tax on Brett Kavanaugh this week and I'm not making that up and they are disguised as Democratic Party activists are hacks on Capitol I'd I'd I don't know what the nature of the heck is\n\nI mean this [laughter] if if it if it weren't so irresponsible that would be funny meanwhile\nYou have the entire left now attempting to destroy Kanye West and what Kanye West Dan is simply venture off the liberal Democrats\nPlantation that is a no no if you're an African American you venture off the Democrat plantation they are going to destroy your meanwhile idiots like this professor\nA professor of engineering literally tells people\nThat if you want to stop hurricanes from blowing up where you live vote Democrat it's because you're voting Republican and and denying climate change that these hurricanes are coming after you know do you remember after Hurricane Katrina you people might have thought that I was joking there were people\nIn the leftist medium\nWho literally we're trying to tell people in New Orleans that George Bush wanted that hurricane to strike Louisiana\nHe wanted it specifically the strike New Orleans this is why there weren't any warnings it wanted it to strike New Orleans because Bush knew that residents of New Orleans would have to abandon the city\nAnd go to Texas where as\nDemocrats they wouldn't be absorbed and wouldn't affect any political outcomes but in Louisiana you can turn the state Republican if you can get rid of a bunch of New Orleans Democrats and sort of people out there saying that Bush actually wanted to hurricane to wipe out New Orleans so that residents will have to leave\nWould have to go to Houston\nThere were some even saying that Bush was doing what he couldn't just steer the hurricane that Bush was responsible for it because Bush told the weather service to downplay the warnings\nWell I didn't want to mention it but I'll go ahead and mentioned there were some now these were not mainstream media people but they did repeat this there were people out there talking on a tax on the Internet Hoover claiming that Bush was steering the hurricane\nRemember that that Bush was steering that hurricane Bush himself the president was fearing the hurry and and what this guy\nIs professor at the University of St Thomas's no different by claiming\nThat simply the way people vote determines where a hurricane goes how strong a hurricane's going to be\nAnd whether or not the hurricanes gonna wipe you out and he doesn't know\nYeah it's the redneck Riviera and yeah traditionally the panhandle of Florida blow both Republican but he doesn't know there might have been some democratic voters have got wiped out the odds\nAre there were because so many people didn't get wiped out you know we we we look at these events are these people do as one off political events [noise] some of these people\nWho had been wiped out you you look at that devastation and usually how are they ever gonna come back\nThey didn't have much to begin with I mean it's just some of these photos that you see from that area do look like they have been leveled with explosives or it is it's just heartbreaking\nTo see what happens and the only upside as it was not you know a densely populated area but that doesn't change the impact on the people who live there anyhow there were some who didn't evacuate and they made up\nTheir minds themselves to the media found them talk to them they want to stay they wanted to hang in a wanted to see what it was all\nLike every hurricane has those people\nWho are hell bent they even want to protect the homestead or they're curious\nTo hear how devastating and how big it how rock is the Starman storms I Want to see it and they roll the dice thinking that they'll survive it or what have you\n[noise] takes all kinds of people but this one I when I saw this today I thought it had to make sure this is not you know some satire sight and it isn't\nClimate deniers making these storms worse by stopping action on climate change so see\nIf we hadn't just not gotten out of the Paris climate accord and if if Trump would stop at ... on trumpet stop making fun of the UN's ... plant and dental whatever it is on climate change\nThen the hurricanes and get their message in a hurricane to go somewhere else they're hurricanes wouldn't get so strong but the hurricanes no hurricanes know that they're attacking Republican voters who therefore don't believe in climate change their hurricanes are targeting people for destruction of wiping them out\nAnd these people need to know that they're making it happen because of the way they vote\nHow absurd how stupidity how utterly politically\nPartisan by the way it was it was getting ... book on it like clockwork\nJust today here come more intense report suddenly UN's inter governmental panel on\nClimate change we've only got eleven years this was it\nFolks we've

Young lied to voters about health care the comments came during a debate between the two candidates last night on Iowa public television\nHe voted to dismantle the Affordable CARE Act which covers people with preexisting conditions have voted for the disastrous Republican health care bill that he actually lied to Iowans that said that he would not vote for and then turned around in the middle of the night and voted for it\nWhen the Republican health care bill first came out\nI didn't support it and I said I cannot support this until their changes that are made and I use my vote as leverage

[noise] but she put it up and of course the media around with it and they've had to withdraw too because she had to withdraw because it wasn't true and it it's fairly common that these people on the left [noise] engage in this kind of story telling\nInsult mongering here it is John ... never Trump or John ... the Democrats and blue wave is drying up oh that's not to be a disappointment\nDon't count your elections before they're hatch that's the lesson of the past couple of weeks or so called fundamentals that supposedly govern the twenty eighth team in terms\nStill point to a good a great night for Democrats they are the out party the out party generally does better than the party in power\nBut\nTo generic polling question this week have Democrats up twelve and Thirteen points respectively that would suggest a so called blue wave in which most house and Senate seats in play will likely he'll Democrat and it's in line with the twenty ten of Republican numbers around now\nYet yet now we've\nPointed out that all of these national generic polls show this gigantic wave what if you go race by race\nIf you go into the state's district by district you don't see this way if you don't see the evidence in the polling\nAnd people have been asking how can this how can this disparity be how can you have a generic ballots that shows that Democrats plus proper plus Thirteen but then you don't find any single congressional race that shows Democrats plus twelve or Thirteen well it must mean the generic ballot doesn't mean much Muslims is\nHow could it generic ballot dilemma name on it by this time when you start pulling people a month three weeks away from the election you start asking questions about how they're going to vote without a name and the question what do you think the result is going to be\n\nState level polls over the past two weeks showed no blue wave certainly not in the Senate\nThey suggested Democrats appear to have almost no serious chance of winning the ... in the Senate that would require them to pick up three Republican seats and the whole ... every other seats if they have\nThey held by incumbents at at this moment it's far more likely Republicans are going to pick up\nOne of their seats so [noise] it's [noise]\nAnd they go state by state to show her and this is all happening and then the evidence against a blue wave is primarily in the Senate\nBut\nThe conventional wisdom here is not rooted in specifics but conventional wisdom is rooted in just that conventional wisdom and hope\nThe left hopes that this is a\nTraditional here party out of power wins big that's what they're hoping they've\nGot their generic ballot polls would say that's exactly what's gonna happen but then you're going to the states state by state race by race and you don't see it see why to close races some that can go either way\n\nBut they're still hanging on to hope they are reporting the hope they're reporting hoping hoping that reporting the hope will turn the hope into reality\nNow before we get too much in the hour I Need to tell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening tonight it probably has opened in some cities all reading of certain theatres it's God's Nell\nThe trial of America's biggest\nSerial killer now ... is an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the wanting murder\nOf thousands\nNobody can get the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that climate guys now\nWhat's the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion thought\nOf and categorized as something other than what it is the media wouldn't cover it and nor the trial very much\nThere have been a lot of people who didn't covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at that like ed Morsi of hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they wrote over a hundred\nAnd sixty different articles so that trend has been how do you do a movie about this how do you get it made me in\nMovie equals Hollywood how do you get stars had to get people to start at how do you get money to finance that how do you get it made and how do you get a distributed it how do you find the theaters\nThat will exhibits that thing how do you do or and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine but they persisted and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of ... guys now it's it's it's a\nIt's a procedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula\nIt doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie has a rating of PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder there is not a lot\nOf hardly any abhorrent Gore and violence\nIn the movie at its depicted in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things in movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten maybe informed it's not the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can't avoid the politics but it is exceptionally\nWell done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happen to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened a mass murder\nHe was a mass murderer of people in the womb\nThat nobody on the left wanted anybody to know about\nWhat he did Kermit guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging\nSmile and laugh and even and his trial it was said that he was\nCharming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy directed this and\nI don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message\nTo be delivered but you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that and so the\nWay I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy use a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up\nThe story itself is all anybody needs to know the number one mass murder in America which he was never referred to as as because of course the left abortion is\nNot even human and
