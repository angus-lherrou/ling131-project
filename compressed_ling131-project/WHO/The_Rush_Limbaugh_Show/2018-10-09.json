rose is on the cell phone line with us\nA non for we get started here in the marketplace or we've been talking about these ruins these renewable identification numbers and we're talking about that we might get an announcement today that uh could affect either availability or how they're traded guys trade in the renewable fuel numbers there where you are\nNo we don't but I you know I think the issue with them is the fact that you have some a war refiners are them from using ran and I think the other issue is that some of them are being driven up and people are holding them so the rents are too high so\nI think that the the real issue and hopefully it looks like we're going to get enough but on a Fifteen and hopefully we see some kind of an announcement on Iran's also so that we get a true level playing field across the board I think that issue\nWell ... and and what's going to level the playing field I mean what what do you think we're going to have to hear on that that ... side\nWell I think number one I think that we don't have a any exemptions by some of these large refiners that they don't have to use rent so I think that's probably the uh the number one\nThing that uh you know we'll be looking for at least to start with 'em and so we don't have these exemptions so um I think that is it ...\nWell again that announcement is expected and the next a hour and a half or so and then the president will be following up with more information more news on that I'm sure when he visits accounts was a little bit later on this afternoon Andy is standing by there\nAnd he's going to be bringing us so all the inside an insight on that list jump back into the marketplace Don rose us ... with us\nDon um what are you looking at is as far as targets I mean we have big report or or maybe I don't know maybe it's not such a big report coming up this week\nNo it is a big report by because you know what you're going to have in this report a little everything you this is a report that we usually see acre adjustments if we're going to we probably do it's also going to carry the ending stocks from last year into this report they were larger remember that\nIt's also going to have to update on the field and then also it's going to give us a better look on what the demand is also going forward so it's got a lot of moving parts in this one\nAnd you can get some surprises here over all the traits going in with a negative view but at the end users are hoping for a negative reports that they can get covered on something that they're a a supplies are at fault harvest though are in short term I think that's really the fear that keep the weight on soybeans\nAlong with the hope that the weather clears out here we get back to harvest\nSo negative report what kind of numbers you are you looking for\nWell I think the yield uh first of all I mean on a corn and soybeans both a half a Bush one acre dialed into the market now so if it would be happened to be over that as you approach a bushel an acre um and I think on the ending stock\nIf uh you know right now are looking for the ending stock to go up about fifty million on corn and beans so if they'd be closer to a Seventy five hundred um that would be an issue on the demand side I think what we're looking for is the government gonna jump and push the ethanol use each up anticipating that eat Fifteen\nOr change we will see that's probably fifty to a hundred million bushels of a more demand\nThen look at the world's supply and the once a year for Russia's corn crop uh comes down\nAnd a a an adjustment on some of those things\nWill ... got about a minute here Don or less what what what did you see in the um harbors report here yesterday\nWell on the harvest a you know we think it's going to be somewhere around that thirty to thirty three percent done on both corn and soybean um you know so not that\nFar behind a but the average pay but I'm a you know what you would like to get done yeah yeah hey what's your eight hundred numbers on\nYour bed it the one eight hundred two four seven ... seven\nDon rose us commodity joined us to wrap up the big show today Thanks down we'll talk to you

forth whatsoever you radio\nW also heads up here I'm\nGoing to continue today my him [noise] and\nExplaining the divide that exist in the country specifically by\nJust who the left is what they've become what we're up against\nA to me it is the seminal issue that we all face we're talking about nothing less than the survival of the country as we know it I mean America is always going to be here don't misunderstand but this country's surviving as founded we're under a solved it has never been worse\nOr they made the civil war but but those were different circumstances that was a specific arguments about cultural things regarding slavery that any and nobody\nOf any\nReason to attitude could ever support we find ourselves here in a multi layered multi faceted all out assault on the entire concept\nOf America has found some people's sense it\nSome people are not aware of it and I I I've uh just sort of evolved here into a\nPosition where I feel compelled to try to explain this sounds some warning ... and it may be present some\nAre solutions but after I have to be very careful I don't over do this I don't want to I don't want to you know me I'm In the nation's number one natural optimist and I don't want to sound overly pessimistic but at the same time\nI I'm I'm Still searching for the best way perfect way to explain to everybody what I think the real threats that we face are so that's coming up as the program unfolds\nBack however to the ceremony at the White House last night with the president first off apologizing to the nation\n\nApologizing the cabin all on behalf of everybody in America for what was done to him for what happened to him\nAnd they have an episode caught a size exactly what I think we're up against and it illustrates something else that I think a lot of people are having trouble understanding we're not in a battle\nOf ideas the left is not\nIn our ideas we're up again we're battling people who do not want us to exist they have no desire to coexist with us they have no desire for the ongoing political arguments over the best way to do things for the majority of people that's not there\nThat's their interest is the elimination of opposition\nHowever it can happen they have no limits\nOn how low they will go on how the brave didn't perverted they will be in seeking their reality it all I Am convinced started on America's college campuses well tracing where it started I mean to go back to the twenties and Soviet influence communist influence but\nFor the purposes of my being able to explain this the most recent starting point\nWould be the most compelling I think was the best way to get people's attention with it because most people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born\nOr and so ancient history is if they've not been taught it or they don't do it so the the closer to the president you can trace the beginnings of current problems the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on this my thoughts [noise]\nBut they don't ... folks we are not legitimate in their eyes ideas are not legitimate our existence is not legitimate and not even worthy of discussion or acknowledge\n\nThat they don't even look at the United states the way we do they don't accept the founding of the country the principles in our founding documents they accept none of that none of that is relevant ... all of that is part of the discrimination\nThat was founded as part of this country as far as they're concerned\nAnd it was all on display in a capital hearings everything that we are up against the absence a presumption of innocence cabinet was guilty because he's a conservative Kavanaugh was guilty not because they had any evidence cabinet was guilty because in their minds he's got no business being a judge\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required\nIf you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do if you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable staying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\n\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up with this\nThat and that's what we'll do\nIt has nothing to do with anything other than Kavanaugh isn't them and he therefore doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court the rest of it the history onyx the child like wailing immaturity is the result of the\nHe told me to take ... has

initial nine percent of the nine seed advantage even after the worst happens all that that's getting into the into the new show I'm I'm just talking about over all the national\nAttitude um and I look I'll be honest I'm always having to dial myself back um I I'm One of these people you probably are too I'm only ... people to get everybody agreed with me we would have the best country in the history

ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour\nBill and Hillary won again in a while to get in on all of this Trump action\n\nNow I I'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party tried this\nTrump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign\n\nAnd do not doubt me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly\nActed on concerned on interest in\nAnd would always say a variation of you can't judge voter interest on the basis of rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nHe's Trump rallies they're not telling us that it yeah it does it mean anything he's or just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all the people out of the country they don't like it's not saying it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally privately\n\nDo not doubt me privately they were jealous as they can be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do what ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw

Joe [noise]\nHey welcome back Rush Limbaugh half my brain tied behind my back as always made interests of fairness and they probably [noise] sorry\nLast caller Sean from Philadelphia what's gonna happen rush they're all expecting a blue wave what happens if they lose it well let me share with you a headline from political Josh just today political story ready for this\nPolitical race ratings than GOP house is crumbling here is the sub the headline Mr ...\nThere are now two hundred nine seats either firmly or leaning in the Democratic column only nine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control this is what you were just telling me right and it you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe this\nOkay so political says the GOP house is crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine seats\nFirmly order wing Democrat I guess this is according to polling data to hundred eight team is the number of seats you need for\nThe majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority so\nNine seats familiar leading Democrat I mean this is the Democrats [laughter] nine seats with this this is a white\nBy the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of it all gets worse\nFor this that and yet they believe it now\nFolks I don't have an insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans I don't I don't really pay attention to that I never have but the people who are watching it live and die by this stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling data it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything\nAnd if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that to nine seats are leading their weight and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's going to be an ounce of sanity anywhere to be found on the Democrats' side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine seats firmly or leaning in the Democratic column let me ask you a question what\nWouldn't be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me what it is anything one thing a series of things that have\nAmerican voters [noise] so so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat\nSo that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of the nation wide ... with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer to that question as Trump that the\nPeople of this country despise Donald Trump has a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since the election night\nTwo thousand sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it has to vote against Republicans\nAll right well\nAs I say we're hypothetically protesting this is true what has Trump done to generate that kind\nOf disgust other than the alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want to take it\nAll started Lee said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching this this last week was premier awake for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in ... yeah law and order and you're asking will be or something and and\nUh the show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage and the FDU\nCops are running around trying to prove this guy's a rubber band of the first order and\nYou know officer you know\nOur government money is separating the two that are born or and I am having them\nAnd the cops we fought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch this uh well that's it for the show\nThe level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there people ought to be more educated more informants smarter but\nThat's gone we have replaced\nInformed people educated people learn to people what am so load block cab idiots\nParties at her and Bradley's house\nAnd she was on Anderson Cooper twenty nine last night\nNow Sally Quinn alleges that former Texas Senator John tower that's how his name was his name was John Tower he was a short little guy five four pockmarked face acne greasy hair and this guy was apparently [noise]\nDon Juan running around the Senate and just that everybody that got a new way this guy had more allegations I'm literally\nI remember one of these allegations all kinds of senators came forward to defend them while telling him he needed to resign one of them was a [noise] Sam Nunn of Georgia I'll never forget is attempt saving the reputation of John Tower\nI knew John Powell I think John Tower actually was forced to resign and because of one of these things was let me but I'm not kidding I mean this this guy was a ...\nBy reputation\nCocoa get a picture that guy put him on put him on Rush Limbaugh got caught on trying to find one here in pushing them little camera I mean we're not we're not talking about George Clooney here\n[noise] [noise]\nWell anyway Sally Quinn says John Powell\nOnce assaulted her but she didn't come forward\nAnd here's what she says Anders ... says look in your memoir you talk about an experience for a sitting Senator John toddler basically try to sexually assault you in the back of a tax folks\nJohn Tower would never be in a taxi that would be such a demeaning kind of car to be in the Senate or you don't drive around and yellow cabs [noise] you have a car service a limo driver ... well anyway she search it happened in a cab that John Powell\nTried to sexually assault you in the back of the tax it you didn't come forward them and you didn't come forward when the senator was nominated for ... that's what it was they nominated the guy for secretary of defense and that's when all\nThis came out but Sally Quinn didn't didn't Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn't say anything he\nDrag now where did this nightclub and ordered brandy and wouldn't let go of may and finally I got away and rat out and gotten a cab and he came out and jumped in the cabin jumped on top of me\nAnd basically I tried to call me and the poor cab driver was desperate 'cause I was screaming and pounding Adam senator stop and\nI was living at Fort Myer Virginia where my father was station he was in general and the army at the time and the cab driver was going about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the carbon screech to a halt in front of our corners and I think then tower got scared because he thought maybe the general would come out with a shotgun\nBut I went in the house at night I cried all night long I was absolutely traumatized I never told my parents are very\nUntil much later several years later because I was so ashamed and so guilty\nSo Sally Quinn the assaulted by John Tower um but\nBut you know she doesn't want to hear yeah there's one more bite we got Times Square here here's another reason why\nNumber forty three when\nI think about it I thought I'm so glad I didn't do it because I could have been Anita Hill and Anita Hill's life has been completely ruined destroyed and then going to be the person who was in that hearing having to talk about is disgusting thing with Christian ...\nWhat's the name came out against her well she didn't want to be there what I think is that if I had been Anita Hill and I'd known better I wouldn't have done it if I've done Christine Blasey Ford she didn't expect it to go public but I Would have not done it\nBecause their lives have been ruined it posted buzzy for just got an all won the award from UNC Chapel Hill for this and you're going to get movies like life is I've been ruined or destroyed Sally world are you looking at\n'em
