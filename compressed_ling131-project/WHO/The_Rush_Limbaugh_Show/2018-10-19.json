the United states\nThe Saudis are the number one buyers of American weapons number one they spend more money by young American arms than any other nation\nThat might surprise you but it happens to be true the Saudis have also become recent allies with us and Israel against Iran\nNow don't laugh at this\nMaybe go back and look at Iraq Hussein oh who the drive by media loves\nWell Obama loved Iran and to Obama paying Iran one point eight billion dollars in power loaded cash\nObama signed the nuclear deal with Iran was essentially a half way for them to achieve nuclear weapons Trump has since torn met up that\nPicked him off that's that's another re wind up with Obama policy\nSo if Obama loved Iran or thought it was okay at least to have\nAnd allied relationship where the less adversarial then so does the drive by media\nBut\nNone of this about ... is designed it not not intend to do they deserve to die don't misunderstand this just folks were were were between a rock and a hard place

the American people might want that\nI understand I agree with him completely doesn't make any sense of Democratic Party doesn't deserve to be winning anything just on the basis of the way they can portray themselves in Kavanaugh situation but that's just the latest the Democratic party has become the home of the mentally unstable\nWho have used the political system to fix\nWhatever problems they have ... or their grievances that they think they have it all revolves around the age old argument for the\nPurpose of government it really is is you take all of this that's happening domestically and when you're synthesize it now when you boil it all down to its essence it's about the role of government\nAnd it's about the fact that the Democrats do not want to promote self reliance they don't want to promote rug in individual lives and they don't want to promote people dealing with life\nFixing situations dealing in facing adversity and overcoming it becoming better people they want people to remain inept incompetent dependents grown up in a mass thinking the government is the solution and the solution is not really a solution\nThe solution at the Democratic

dangerous lead childish an immature Trump is\nHow unprepared how ill equipped how you competed how\nAt risk we all are but then we were assured by whoever wrote this thing\nDon't worry there are adults like us that are protecting this country from President Trump and you can count on us to commit well everybody who is this who wrote this and they began circulating names do you notice we don't have an identity yet\n\nNot possible not possible that whoever wrote this has not been out after all this many weeks not possible not possible that the person who wrote it has an out of him or herself\nFor the fame alone for the media accolades alone another thing why has it been forgotten\nI mean it's still a pretty damn big deal that there's that kind of a traitor inside the west wing why is it been forgotten because it didn't work that's why they're on the other things have you noticed there's no news about Russian collusion\nYou notice that why is that 'cause it's not\nA big deal to people getting ready to vote it's not an issue on which people's votes will turn that's why the media dropped it\nThey try to make it the issue they did everything they could to make Russian collusion and Trump did it the issue for two and a half years here we are already in the mid terms or just a little over two weeks away not worried about other than this Mueller report supposedly being out there\nBut now Valerie Jarrett daughter who is a reporter at at CNN no bias there Valerie\nJarrett daughters is going to get this calmed down the Mueller investigation is not over it's going to be going on long after the midterms\nReally\nWell then why a leak that Mueller has about wrapped it up and his reports ready to go because\nAs somebody pointed out yesterday or maybe it was not as it was something else somebody ...\nWhat are the odds\nThat between now and election day the New York times is going to have some story supposedly containing nuts and bolts details of the smaller report\nIt

I think many of the Republicans have blocked the idea that Trump was not to be a garner a before now\nI I they\nAre so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the media targets I I think first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd it it\nThat's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected and it's been a slow\nReversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side well we'll see if this story on the caravan turning around Pompeo is there a palm payroll left Saudi Arabia after having met when king Solomon and Mohammed bin saw him on the crown prince either floated may call\nAnd they have to know the Trump is not going to put up with this and I think that was the messenger ... talk\nLast year's winner army captain Robert forty of Ohio is loving here's my handwritten you could be next\nTo nominate somebody who is active duty or a veteran of the U.S military and to get official rules\nIs it Rush Limbaugh dot com and look for them a hindrance military salute give away\nThanks to my hindered the makers of the toughest utility vehicles on earth and God Bless all of you who protect our freedom\nTake advantage of rock bottom prices and test drive a hindrance today at mobility sales and service in ... in Des Moines or visit mobility sales dot com that's mobility sales dot com\nPrices for peace building's only you're not a good windows doors ... attention on business owners who rent or at least space including storage space stop wasting your money paying someone else for your space you can now save a\nTon of money and own your own building with the incredible sale prices from general steel it's right now you can save as much as half the time and cost of conventional construction and stop renting space from others just go eight eight eight forty one steal to see how general steel can help you save money our fifty years structural warranty buildings are custom designed for your needs you can get a forty\nBy sixty foot building for less than twenty five thousand dollars for a fifty by one hundred clear spanned building under forty thousand dollars there isn't a wasted space and construction takes half\nThe time ... eighty eight forty one steel strong construction spending in high demand this special pricing will not last long coat eight eight eight forty one steel and get your options pricing package on\nDozens of building options ... eighty eight forty one steel and see how general still can save your money ... eight eight forty one steal that eight eight one seven eighty three thirty five eighty eight for one seven eighty three thirty five\nI run a ban and Bonnie here for our friends at zero ... boy can they help you and your house they've help both of us cause you were raised with our patented empowered water getting your carpet cleaning shouldn't make it your dirty again early but that's exactly what traditional soaps and shampoos can do can power water on the other hand leaves no sticky residue behind\nYour carpet bleak clean bloody and fresh\nAnd your carpet let's say clean air longer and even though it's green in power and water is able to tackle tough problems like accidents\nDidn't drink sounds and everything in between ... and get your home clean with a great deal from zero rats reruns pre treated cleaned and sanitize starting at one hundred twenty nine dollars can forget they also do tile and grout they'll make it look like new taken fresh in your upholstery and bring area runs back\nTo live on five one five three seven nine thousand that's three to seven nine thousand or the reds dimly dot coms ... the same problem than backwards and they served in more than ... than central Iowa again five one five three to seven nine thousand pound anti buy anything you think\nIn the morning and the last thing and I did the news trafficking whether you need from Alexis [noise] to say electric play ten forty W.

intervention of pain management providers and if as I address all dedicated to finding a solution to combat the source severe pain so what kind of paint that we're talking about\nAnd I think that's a pretty good theory\nAnd then you add in the chaos that will happen then you throw in the possibilities if they do get to the border and do cross but they wouldn't be separated and that's the one of all those issues that I went through the last hour that came and went and didn't have any glue or have any legs that wouldn't dead\n\nI'll never forget I was out in California I I I got so frustrated I was playing golf with a friend of mine is one of us\nAnd it was during the time to drive ... and the Democrats are making all this noise about how Trump separating families children mothers\nAnd this guy who's up to speed on this stuff's as\nRussia's pictures look past come on you know the pictures are made up this is ... the pictures look bad it looks really bad you don't you're not really fallen for just rushed the pictures look bad we've got to do some pictures Louis oh my gosh\n\nThis guy was smart enough to know that he was falling for a media trick\nBut at the pictures with what he was telling me was I Can't defend this I have people\nComplained to me about Trump's separating ... I can defend the pictures rushed the pictures so that's the one thing that has had legs\nOkay so the audio somebody's if you're on hold if you're on the phone just be patient were coming to you ill quick oh this is the sound back in the hands of the interview last night uh that Fox has been playing all day long to get people's reaction\nI still say that I think there are things that have yet to happen and then I'm going to determine\nHow comes in some races the we don't know so it's still very hard to predict Kavanaugh feedback reaction was one hundred percent positive for Republicans and Democrats really blew them\nFor four hundred and thirty five of these things I don't know I just rely on hope which is again naive I don't have survey data I don't trust the it hasn't been rights\nConsistently enough for me the people doing these surveys desperately wants Trump goal and I don't know how they can take that out of their work I don't believe in pure objectivity is like this ... if I put on the spot production but we hold the house and we increase the Senate because I think that's just ... I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose\nIn the single biggest the electoral landslide defeats in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that bite and bite\nLit up the Fox news channel the day our first stop is America's Newsroom bill hammer a advantages Julie ... out there talking to fame and Republicans strategic wrist and Rollins\nAbout my comment\nThan deserve to lose like he's bar act on that front half right on the other front I think will lead some Senate cities I think the house is very very much in jeopardy\nSo you are not buying into those are the hold it Rush Limbaugh said they'd hold if they don't tell those flights I Do I rent a congressional committee I've been doing it a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those are the open seats has another twenty five to thirty that our our seats that are in play only about two or three Democrats seats are in place totally on defense everything has to go our way to basically break even\n[noise] let me run through them and say this is the stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is wrong or stuff\nAnd to me this is totally absent uh any any what what's the word personality or\nI mean there's just raw numbers are based on data that is the result of polling and I know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just sat in the bite\nI'm just suspicious\nOf of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired\nOutcome out of their work and we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand sixty and I mean that those people were all literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\n\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win at ras my son was one neighbor ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here see what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since ... rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten\nIncluding the midterms in two thousand twelve and the midterms in two thousand fourteen ... election or two thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost one hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama's there that\nCould be a factor Obama's gone so maybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there because I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party but\nThen I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make people all of a sudden you want to elect Democrats again\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone Raj Senate yeah we're probably pick up look up the house is gone\nAnd then they said because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar will not true if these races are being nationalized by the various\nCandidates in them [noise] but anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop\nRejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done at one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that make people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow support their promoting rage in anger there promoting\nInsanity and the lunatic behavior\nSo then okay maybe as a Trump is there's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago\nHas the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump\nSentiment in a mid term turnout profile of voters well\nThat would have to be what it is because the Democrats are not when the Democrats say the justice associated with the Democrats are doing his landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country\nAnd they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried on Obama out remember Obama's trying to say the economy was his\nWell that went over like a land balloon and they died with it so they abandoned Matt and\nOutside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey have in ... dad continued\nTo try and portray America as this unfair\nOn just on deserve\nExceptional superpower\nThat discriminates that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative so I'm just\nSo where is this body of evidence that suggest the trend of voting against Democrats is reversed again I acknowledge house races are\nNot the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance Shannon dream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim a wonders what my strategy was\nIn predicting what I predict\nAlmost no calling so that the Republicans are going to hold onto the house so where do you think this is coming from with Rush Limbaugh what's the status of\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the phenomena ... the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy from voted to the shy breakfast votes is the kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve sheltered and who has a weekend show on Fox and he was instrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a\nWhy what was Limbaugh getting this I mean there's not a single pulled out of the shows this happening precisely my point it's not a single poll not a single poll shows it's offered this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you\nTo Daniel in W.

Limbaugh\nRhetoric and residents from coast to coast we're going to Dover\nNew Hampshire this is George welcome it's great to have you with us George how're you doing\nGreat thanks for taking my call um I was calling I just wanted their show the ... um that you did years and years ago that I thought was was just great to be probably one of the best shows that you ever hacked and we're really simple\nAnd you basically had a roll call and people just called in with their you know start a business is you know small businesses and talk about\nHow they're doing you know when we're there are\nSo yeah yeah you don't ... you don't want that was you know you you what you remember there was a a it was it was a period of time it was the early nineties folks and white collar employees were being laid off\nExecutives and magazines and newspapers like USA Today we're happy\nThey were running stories how wonderful it was that if people are getting laid off it's finally executive it's finally white collar people and not blue collar people [laughter] and so I decided we did three days of this we took calls\nA ... as as best we can manage it from people who had been laid off in their forties white collar managerial people laid off in their forties or earlier and asked what they were doing about it right and that's what you remember hearing was all these people calling saying\nOne version or another of this is maybe the best thing that ever happened to me because I'm finally focused on doing things I Love I finally have because of necessity I'm I'm I'm looking at at the kind of job I've always wanted to have starting a business or what have you\nAnd they were they were all amazingly upbeat and positive about what had happened to them not depressed and down the dumpster angry or any of that\nRight now it was it was just it was just I mean with my my second year in business so I remember I remember it well because there was working in January ... or ... or at least one maybe with another a rip off from that other\nThree day things that are right I just I just think it would be a good a good thing to try you know what I mean just maybe on a friday instead of doing you know Republican good Democrats that stuff I mean which people ... people would buy 'em\nWell don't don't were downplayed a Republican or Democrat bad thing because there's still a whole slew of people who don't get how bad the Democrats are but let me ask you something to do you think that people need to hear business people calling in describing how great the economy as before they'll believe it\nIs that why you want them to hear it so that they'll believe it or you ask what are you thinking some people don't believe it or to doubt it\nNo I just I just think it's a Brotherhood and I think that it's a way to support one another that run an operator own businesses and I don't think that we get enough credit for what we do because you know like most people I work a lot of hours and I'm I'm I'm grateful for what I make and what I can provide for my family but\nUm it's just it's a good inspiration for the people who do it and we're the people that make this country work\nYou know so that's all I mean it's it's it's a it's a simple as that way I see\nWell small business smarts\nBut there's no question that small business is uh the vast majority of\nOf employment in the country in some concerning the backbone well okay\nI I Do remember we've we've done a couple of instances of this and it is inspiring to listen to individual stories of people describe how they started their businesses and why and how they're working and\nWhy they they are working so I appreciate the suggestion I really do other hosts would maybe get a complex and think GMI failing if the audience is telling me what I but I'm not that week and I'm not I don't have any self doubt\nSo I can take any kind of criticism for anyone and not take it personally\nSo don't ever fear folks telling me how you think I ought to do this because everybody else does too here is George thinking this is Lloyd in in in\n... lost in Wisconsin It's your turn Hi\nHow're you doing their young man why not just fine thank you [laughter]\nAnyway and I was listening to a guy named Donald Trump he was an Iowa discussing how he has done over three billion dollars on the wall so they have been breaking the law you had a caller earlier that did not know that\nWell yeah but there's not a brick that's been all aimed at stopping anybody crossing is the point his his point was that the Democrats may be trying to illustrate the Trump hasn't gotten that done isn't going to get it done\nMaybe doesn't really care about getting it I remember these people are focused on trying to demonstrate that Trump is a phony is not who he says he is and they want to distance Trump's voters from it but that's all the callers theory was\nHell I don't think that could happen these done too much into little\nTime no I don't either get at the leaders but it was it was his theory as to what the purpose of this\nCaravan is uh I I Know that there have been in a little incremental appropriations aimed at building the wall but his point was how many\nContinuing resolutions if we have independent budget deals if we had and then there's not and we have control of the house and control of the Senate and there isn't any money in the wall for it", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "19"}
