have now gone all in in total now they they're unified liberty don't misunderstand I'm not I'm not\nI'm not\nIgnorant about this I Know they're unified every day I'm told they have a theme that they have all unified behind today and I think for the remainder of the time\nFor these next two weeks and that is Trump's spreads lives and stalks fears head of election I fought when I got in here and saw that\nOne time I figured it was just you know a graphic Cairo's graphic to represent what they were doing at that time but every time I looked up at the TV over the next three hours I saw that that that matter\nIt didn't matter what else was being discussed it didn't matter who the guests were then I saw the Washington Post thing and so I checked the New York times and there it is spreading fear telling lies\nA head of election this caravan thing you know I [laughter]\nContinue to study this and try to pick it apart bill analyze it in and make sense of it\nFrom a political standpoint and I still can't find anywhere in the media any concern about it\nI Can't find anybody concerned are worrying or thinking that it's anything abnormal about it in fact what you find in the drive by media isn't tired total miss characterizations these are desperately poor\nPeople wonderful people fleeing poverty in their homeland\nAnd that's not at all what they are they are part of an organized mob\nThere is no question about this it is an organized mob and like everything else in the left is behind some point in the future we're going to learn exactly how this thing was pulled off we're going to learn who did it we're going to learn who paying for it we're going to learn who scripted it\nJust like we've learned how they did the Kavanaugh thing with Dr balls the Ford how that was structured how that was planned how it was kept in reserve\nPart is that nothing that appears spontaneous or organic where it benefits the left\nIs spontaneous or organic and he's all structured it's all planned it's all scripted it's all paying for it it's\nAll focus grouped it's poll tested from their perspective\nAnd the the obvious you know there there there's no you look at this you look at this caravan and it is\nYou know scare everybody is exactly the ... this country has faced for years we now have a focused concentrated microcosm up\nWith seven thousand people that maybe a thousand or ten thousand if they get here by election day there's still a thousand\nMiles away yet vowing to get here by election day at the drive by claiming they're walking there not walking they can't they'll never cover a thousand miles in\nTwo weeks if they're walking it's physically not possible so when the cameras aren't there some of these people have to be being driven\nBut it is all orchestrated\nNone of this is organic none of it is real from the standpoint that individual totaling eight thousand people decided on the same day or in the same week or even in the same month to start walking\nFrom Honduras to the United states that just didn't happen and it doesn't happen somebody is making this happen somebody set this up\nIt obviously is a bunch of left is to set this up and when you look at that and examine it from that standpoint you've you've got to wonder what it is that makes them think they are going to win massive elections and it is clear to me\nNot only examining the caravan the mob see there I go I even got caught up calling it what it is it's not a caravan it's a mob it's bought and paid for and structured scripted mob\n\nThe Democrats clearly believe and they have believed since the two thousand sixteen election\nThat the way\nTo win back their power is to stoke and create Trump hatred that they think organically natural really exists in either a majority of Americans or close to it and that's what they're trying to capitalize on is massive Trump hatred massive Trump resentments\nThey're not doing it by talking about issues in an individual campaigns you'll hear Democrats promise to repeal the tax cuts and roll back things that have led to economic prosperity but in terms of the national message from the Democratic party you're not getting one you're getting\nTrump fear Trump hatred promoting it [laughter] and exacerbating it or what have you and it's\nIt's silly it's not the way you build a movement now let me share with you a couple of\nStories today on the polling leading up to the mid term because it is all over the place and it is contradictory as it can be five thirty eight as soon as the adored do and the indispensable and the eagerly anticipated Nate Silver\nWho has now said the Democrats have an eighty five percent chance of winning control\nOf the house of representatives the Republicans have only a four team and a half percent chance of keeping the house\nThis is almost identical to five thirty it's forecasting two weeks before the presidential election in two thousand six Dan where\nHillary Clinton had anywhere from an eighty eight percent Ninety two percent chance of winning the presidency and Trump pan\nWhat twelve percent to ... percent chance of winning which was effectively zero and even on election day throughout the day and that is how five thirty eight and the New York times reported and we all know what happened Charlie Cook considered the dean of political analysts\nAnd this company\nAnalyzes races individual house races and Senate races hand reports on which way they're going to go the cook Political Report\nToday has shifted eight house racist toward Democrats and two in favor of Republicans with fourteen days to go before the midterm elections the non partisan election forecast and there is no such thing\nAnd Charlie Cook is not nonpartisan Charlie Cook cares about the outcome of this stuff Charlie Cook is not nonpartisan but that's how this stuff gets reported\nThe non partisan election forecaster Charlie Cook Political Report rejected Democrats will have an edge in key swing districts\nFollowing the party's massive\nFund raising hall in the third quarter of this year\n[noise] so those are the two stories but then\nIf you turn to NBC News and the wall Street Journal bloom wave collapsing early voting shows geo pie out pacing Democrats in key\nStates in this story\nIs even is even prepared in a written as another sign that this so called blue way am eagerly anticipated blue wave could end up disappointing people next month if it arrives at all NBC News\nHas looked at early voting day and it provided by a company called target smart in eight states\nAnd found that GOP affiliated voters are out pacing democratic voters in seven of those including North Carolina GOP affiliated voters have surpassed Democrat voters in early voting in Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee Texas also North Carolina\nOnly in Nevada have\nDemocrat affiliated voters exceeded Republican affiliated voters so far in the early voting the latest data from NBC\nSuggest robust in ... among colonel eight Republican voters that couldn't put a dent in Democrat hopes for a blue wave Republicans typically dominate early voting by absentee ballots while Democrats tend to have the advantage with it in person early voting\nSo for example the entire early voting patriot in Florida which is you have to begin in person voting is complete\nNow that that's somewhat of a important point there because it's it's not just that the Republicans are doing better than Democrats in the states\nIt is that early voting almost always favors Democrats the usual pattern for all this stuff is there for Democrats are drawn up in the early ... because of early voting and the Republicans have to then make up for a bat\nOn election day itself with us\nNot what we're seeing here and they gave us was NBC News\nSo the question here ... hard to apply this to actual election outcomes too much we don't know but one thing we do know this is not this is not

Ramos or whatever it is it is what does it tell among do ... what what what does it tell tell them no but what is it ... right\nAnd he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob where packs of three and four or walking by and by the way\nFolks [laughter] they don't look like the kind of people you don't want to run in to [noise] you know on the street I mean they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at 'em they're behind him and then they walk past him on over his left shoulder\nAnd he's now gene for he's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that they're decent people and all they want is a better life and we as Americans we owe it to these people don't let them in all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I ask myself how in the world can this guy vouch for whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching him\nThat these are ... these are the prince and Princeton says in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nAnd he doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and is doing everything he can to advocate for this bunch which intends to be disruptive and destructive\nThen these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye to the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats book\nAsked about the timing worry them and national Democrats strategist ed in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what [noise]\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this even before the caravan most congressional Democrats immigration as a loser for them\nA memo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win on emigration vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most direct Kony in the Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focused statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador which she has doubled down on by the way\nSo this is a story tried to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him\nBecause it's going to help him with immigration well\n[noise] [noise] who they think is behind this some of the stuff\nIn the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan and being allowed the lead in the country because they are everyday anyway whether people show up in the group to tour a five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nThat are worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat's [noise]\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind this and the reason I say this it may make no sense it may as well because this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do this smoke they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media the Democrat Party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so\nPoisoned with hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone you gotta put\nYourselves in their shoes every day they've gotten up for two years and I've read in the New York times how Trump's toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's ... loaded with food is going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mahler has been goods so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies get bigger they get happier they get more raucous the Democrats get more panic\nThe thing they do to try to take dropped out or to stop drop in his tracks like the capital is backfiring on the ... out there promising subpoena power saying yeah we're going to investigate drop are going to investigate everybody's administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality and their perplexed\nBecause none of what they have done his work in a white has worked at the it's it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're just\n... to be

notion that doctors and scientists abandoned long ago as oversimplified and often medically\nMeaningless are you kidding me determining whether somebody's male or female determined by a person's genitals is old fashioned is no longer applicable\nAnd needs to be abandoned because it has been abandoned long ago by\nSensible scientists so this is the party of science a Democratic Party science consensus of scientists and climate change\n\nResearchers who studied gender issues and provided health care to people who do not fit the typical\nMale female pigeon holed said that the Trump administration's latest plan to define gender goes beyond the limits of scientific knowledge quote\nDr Josh it was safer and in droves endocrinologist and executive director of the center for transgender medicine and surgery at Mount Sinai health system in New York says the idea that a person sex is determined by their anatomy at birth is simply not true and we've known that it's not true for\nDecades [noise] so you have a baby and your baby has male genitalia but we've known for a long time that you're a baby is not male ... not necessarily\nThe same thing when you have a baby that has female genital yet but no it's not necessarily female as we've known this for decades\n\nAre anatomy does not say what it says\nSo then the New York times asked well then what does determine gender identity a person's powerful core knowledge of who they are is not so clear\nHere again as the doctor from\nMount Sinai in New York we know that there are a and there is a significant durable biological underpinning to gender identity what we don't know are all of the biological factors at play that explained gender identity\nAs far as we in the mainstream biological medical community understand that in two thousand eighty and it is hard wired it is biological is not entirely hormonal and we don't have\nIdentified pain so we cannot specifically say that it is genetic genetics plays
