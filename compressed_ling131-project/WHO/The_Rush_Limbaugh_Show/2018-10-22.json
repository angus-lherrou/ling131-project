have registered investment advisor not affiliated with any governmental agency\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news traffic and severe weather stations on the news radio ten forty do you\nAnd here's what I found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent middle ... even if it's just sixty percent of their time on your show ... they're not focusing on the care of him\nThat tells me\nThat if the caravan wore a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they wouldn't be\nCovering it and building it up\nAnd with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America to and that may yet happen down the road but CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly\nOn the show gave and of course whenever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look at sea wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now and there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms of the same point as president\nThe after two years there just beside themselves none of this is happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known weather's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence that couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election hasn't happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm\nOf what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats if\nThey're behind that was one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they have rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated\nFamilies the border and how Trump didn't like that where they didn't want it to last and so he did what he couldn't to change it I\nI Do know this despite\nEverything that you think you wouldn't know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still there are so you're about peace yes they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject of illegal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got to show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them at their not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gamut is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya\nIf Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump\nThere's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to\nI don't no doubt is the right word but they would be my only disappointing particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get it\nIf if if if some Republicans are behind this than it is obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking with we we've got how many\nTwo thousand miles stop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day just decided to start walking to the United states two thousand miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what can their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because the money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so you've got seven thousand people\nWho all of a sudden it aside all of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people decided to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people killing things I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see and are they just urinating and rivers and streams what would the environmental wackos thinking about that if that's happening\n\nWell I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially they ... into the street and they get maps and San Francisco for tourists can blame the piles of human feces\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing to get her I just hit the southern border may go they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk it enough to know how many miles a day\nYou could walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest\nFor the next day that people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if it makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest a hundred days for those are real Linda that's over for three months\n[noise] and the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day so if they had been walking for what two and a half months have we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may become ten thousand\n[noise] and then of\nCourse ah ladies and gentlemen the caravan now has been joined by a second the caravan than we are just hearing about Fox News and the a P report that the second the caravan of illegal immigrants has formed in Honduras\nHas already crossed into Guatemala\nThere are hoping they catch up to the main group\nAs the massive my grand caravan Bush's during the southern us border a second group of about one thousand people from Honduras\nIs rushing to join the main group which reportedly and swelled the ranks with several people who've already been the port in the caravan which has around five thousand seven thousand members\nWas on the move again on Monday morning departing the southern may cause city of ... the smaller group trailing entered walk them my love from Honduras late Sunday according to be a pay\nSome in the second the caravan are said to have experience in getting across\nThe border it includes a number of deportations have some of whom have been sent home multiple times\nEight twenty nine year old the amateur Anthony ... is reportedly was deported for the six time from the U.S five months ago said they catch you up and you try to get back he has a son and the U.S\nCitizen girlfriend living

to eight eight to [noise] one more with Louie\nGohmert he is from Texas who is on with the bill hammer and Sandra Smith this morning bill hemorrhage says Mike Pompeo was in Mexico city can send we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who what exploit them we're also deeply concerned with the violence provoked by some members of the group as well\nAs the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of it by the way the [noise] the details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants invaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the day\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night\nHow was it raising mistake especially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and the party that believes in open borders they will never report\nAnything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who in their\nRight mind would want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this didn't want this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world wouldn't want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\n\nWhat ever motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what's cakes\n\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president\nWent on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intended across the border illegally they're all criminals\nBut at the world is so damn hard to understand about this\nI think it's a classic illustration of how tough this country is getting in one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's best\nAre being driven solely by emotion govern stolen by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd Kirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help the benefits from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a mess the bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun and this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and said to the world\nCome on in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democrat Party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party has calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers and so the Democrat Party is siding with\nThe people around the world who have nothing who thinks that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as an entitlement\nWe have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning\nAny thing in the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it defies common sense to support this\n\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nSixteen zero six for all things based many Taliban about anything you\n\nWe have a special secretary of agriculture candidate forum coming up this Tuesday from eleven to one sponsored by Iowa corn here ah new videos that forty W. H. O. [noise] CNN playing an impartial ... invited me to make it look like I was trying to make the case that\nCan show you deserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said the fact the exact opposite so yeah\nYeah a lot of people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it a ... same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here is the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOut we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned ah there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and it's called an invasion\nAnd thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but under our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops just stopping invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say\nWell you can use the military because a positive comments out is look that normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so\nThere was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what Woodrow Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you you\nHe may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman government says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis is what is one of seven thousand Russians were about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way for the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections\nWhat if we can make that case what do you think that people will be demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking what if it's seven thousand Russian communists think guys trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're a militarized just the border they if they\nBomb rushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's on military supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and do a national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean I think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the optical that if Trump soon as a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where he can try to deal with this on his own she needs to put everybody else's but um\nI get um um bond film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a hell of a dangerous situation but it is in a whole lot of different ways\nWill be back my friends that we will continue as we always\nLike to get off\nTo Russian by be Mitt work\nYou found

minds but this is what they ask us to believe and that's why I Do this polling nine months\nI was eight months out which doesn't mean anything other than a you know interesting talking points at the time so still lots to get to as the program on falls before you're very eyes and ears up back to the caravan story 'cause we're not quite through with this\n... the the the the thing that that argues again for this being a Democrat Party operation or an operation intended to benefit the Democrat Party\nThe Associated Press has changed headlines about the caravan after a bunch of liberals complained about an original headlined describing the illegal caravan as an army of migrants\nThat is the original a pie story on this that in range and a bunch of leftists so the a P yesterday change the headline after a backlash\nFrom liberals furious at them for describing a caravan of illegal immigrants heading toward the U.S as an army of migrants a rag getting\nGrowing army of migrants resumed march toward us read the original headline on the a P story a ragged growing army of migrants\n... changed the headline to replace the word army with caravan\nWell let's not a caravan either it's a mob it is an invading army might away not all of them are walking I mean you've seen the vehicles they're on a flatbed trucks there in pick up there are many of our whoever is paid for this is paying a pretty penny\nI've seen estimates of seven thousand dollars a person for this but I [noise] seven thousand dollars a person's eyes I say I've seen estimates I've seen estimates is this is costing upwards of twenty million dollars and I don't know about that\nBut I Know it's it's not cheap you have to feed\nSeven thousand people you have to provide fuel for those vehicles that are being used transport them now the cartels have that kind of money so the Democrat donors have that kinda money some of them are walking a lot of them are walking\nAnd now there's a second caravan that has sprung up in ah in Honduras another a pie headline I'm Sorry to\nLos Angeles times stretching from ... seven thousand strong migrant caravan trucks through is\n... each in southern Mexico [noise] you know I often break out a map and I know my geography\nI Know where things are in fact you know the what's fast Apple TV the Apple TV for cake in the latest software and they have these ... screening service screens servers savers\nAnd they have added as the most recent software update four cave video of the world from the international space station as it orbits\nAnd it's fun when they pop up and you can you can make them topic we don't have to wait for the screens server to automatically load it's fun to try to figure out where the international space station is what it is flying over because it doesn't just go east to west\nUh for ... I saw one recently flying over California north to south\nAnd you were gonna find straight down the coast in North Carolina of California in to the bar hopping that saw and then the Mexico and it it's fun just to figure out\nAt the Knight views you can see Ireland and the u._k. you can see a North Korea is just dark as it can be but because it's not a standard map view it's fun to figure out what's what\nAs as a space stations were two hundred miles high if these are fascinating for Cape use I often\nKrakow to map we're talking here about Costa Rica ... Guatemala El Salvador Panama and according to the map that I\nCracked Costa Rica in Panama are much closer to Honduras than the u._s. is\nCosta Rica's only four hundred miles from Honduras Panama is five hundred Ninety miles away\nThe United states is twenty five hundred miles from Honduras [noise]\nSome people say it's two thousand miles from to goose ... to a Tempe er Phoenix in Arizona but take your pick\nTwenty five hundred in two thousand miles versus four hundred miles or five hundred if you're a scraping\nAbsolute filth in harbour if you're a scraping poverty if you're a scraping holders from all you've got to do is get your neighbors and stop or maybe southern Mexico but they're not stopping anywhere they are heading right to the United states\nThey're blowing past Mexican police they're blowing past immigration officials it's a microcosm of what's happening every day in this country this invasion of people end up becoming illegal immigrants\n[noise] there's a lot of money behind this\nWater Marla remember this Trump said that if Guatemala and Honduras and el ... did not do their part in stopping this that we were going to severely cut off or reduce massive foreign aid that we give them Trump has tweeted\nGuatemala Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country in the coming illegal to be us we will now began cutting off or substantially reducing\nThe massive foreign aid routinely given to them when they grab a\nPhone call quickly this is Steven Gorman, California and that that that that uh [noise] after this I Want to go off the line to Steve great great to have you how you doing sir\nDoing good how are you sir\nFine and dandy great to have you on the program today\nIf I talk to your call screener and what I see is probably Democrat Party strategically because they had a problem in twenty sixteen spandex came out and voted for Trump wanted them to do [noise]\nI've seen some stories they aren't going to do it this time because the pocketbook issues and making good money taxes are lower jobs so if you park a whole thousands and thousands of people on that border and start buying the storage we're talking about where\nThe suffering there's whole foods is is is that you're looking at people who are the Ken banger country man may be extended nephews\nOr wall you go to the polls that week beforehand and look at it was to always worried about the oil level I think is there a guilt them with their strong sense of family I daddy didn't you come back to the party even though they know their own interest the vote Republican\nOkay All right so let's let's let's walk through this\nIf I understood correctly you think that this is a Democratic Party operation because the Democrats are having problems with Hispanic turnout that happens to be true\nIt happens to be that more and this is this is a presidential approval polling numbers Hispanics and African Americans are rating Trump's performance higher than anybody ever in their wildest dreams imagined it would be\nAnd in pre election polls the span of vote is trending Republican more than anybody ever thought it would be the Democrats are panicking over this\nAnd so if your rights than what they've done is put together this caravan\nOf Hispanics and Latinos hoping to show how they are mistreated and so that the Hispanics trending for Republicans will change their mind and not vote reports\nWhat can because these people will not be allowed in where is it ... and the other but I go into where is it written that every Hispanic thinks like every other Hispanic\nSeventies technology that is currently in use\nOur traffic signal controller and in the brains behind the signals that older Nineteen seventies

video fit to be in a size they could email it to me they had to run it at twice normal speed\nAnd it's still thirty five seconds long it never ends and then there's a note\nThis ... this doesn't even show that people ... through the parking lots to get in there was a mile long line of people to get him to see Trump in Mesa, Arizona the media is not reporting this aspect of the Trump rallies\nThe media is not telling you how many people want to get in are trying to get in how many people are showing up and standing in line because if they did\nLocal media may I don't know national media CNN PMS NBC ABC NBC CBS are not showing this because if they did it would put the lie to the notion of all the energy is on the Democratic side\nThere's not a single Democrat drawing anywhere near these kinds of rallies these ... these kinds of ...\nPeople what the Democrats are doing is continuing to show up where Republicans are having dinner and harassed them the turtle and his wife are at a

deal with this kind of in decency which is what we're up against the on the Democratic side whatever you want to call a lack of civility in decency whatever it is it is not the things you associate with winning\nIt's not the kind of behavior you associate with good times good vibes\nPositive outlook\nThese are people enraged an angry disappointed depressed what have you\n\nThe the contrast here is striking and that's why you do not see any news coverage of the size of let me tell you something\n\nThe ... the number of people the size of crowds to get into a Donald Trump rally\nIs ten times the size of this mob that is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you've seen those pictures of the media is happy to show your those pictures\nThe media can't wait to show you this so called caravan of seven thousand people soon to be a thousand people and they claim might end up being ten thousand they'll show your pictures those people all day well here's what you need to do when you see that picture a seven\nThousand people or what is said to be seven thousand people multiply that times can that's the number of people trying to get into a Donald Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona and even more than that at a rally in Texas\n\nI Wish they'd use AT and T. stadium is Jerry Jones palace where the cowboys play put a hundred thousand people in there\n\nSo you think that

very good a lot of things we are not good\nAt basically civilian type a non lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it since Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one saying throughout the years we not be good at so this situation and look I I'm One hundred percent for putting the military before but this one is perilous and we have to be careful\nWell\nWhen when you say the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about this is not a military invasion of talking about I'm a human way of uh invasion of people that are largely are going to be thought of is starving thirsty poverty stricken this kind of things simply demanding\nLife well my dad let it play\nIn the military is not used the standing up to people like that certainly not inflict thing and the harm on them is that what you're saying\nYeah I think the difference is you know when it comes to locality we're very good when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we are the individual you're sort of very good at it but that wouldn't be enough\nTo okay what about this what about just the presence here is the U.S military standing at the border you will not cross okay what happens then if they do and whether or\nNot the problem that's the peril is part of the problem\nWe're about you know you and your like your your ears bullet you use a one of the dummy is called I forgot that the use use some kind of force but not lethal\nWe have a quality of the things you but you know all it takes one person going down and squeal and like a pig and then as you know we we just have to follow up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the presence would be tremendous\nBut the presence would be okay so there's ... ... you think the military showing up is let me just put words in your\nMouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong in interpreting you you think the military showing up as a lose lose proposition\nNo I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next step\nWell but you say we can't take your next step because the next step is not what they're good that they're not used to it I don't know how to do it\nNow that still terrible you know I ... I think we should but we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily\nWell then what is it what's the preparation for you to have to be prepared to use deadly force off like\nOkay well let's let's let's let me give you a scenario then okay I'm just doing this in the interest of time I'm not that may it may sound\nIn since I don't mean that they hold the line I hold the line\nProvide a visual presidents a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome do not cross there will be constant warnings but somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens that\nWe'd have to shoot one I'll tell you I think you see a lot of people fall in line at probably with Bush or I'm Talking about members of the immigrants illegal aliens but we'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two got hit that it would storm that caused the mob in rain storm the military just in and and and it it essentially stormed the bullet storm that guns do you think they would cease and desist\nI think they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you guys have a tendency to fold up when they are met with equal strength and we just have to\nBut even if there is a casually or to the drive buys have their story Trump Terry fires on harmless unarmed hopeless people\nOkay so the alternative is to let them\nKnow know after a whole lot of Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to tell you one of the legal it's unfortunate but what they what they take it all but it can just\nYour own okay right so the responsibility for what happens to them has to be on them you think the media is going to allow that this is um [noise] a left I I look I Can't start another thought because I couldn't finish it we've got to take a break\nRush Limbaugh making radio and again you are listening to the yard work\nThis is news radio voting W white jokes\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there is ...\nHome advisor helped me find them back home pros in my area to handle any kind of project you can read reviews of the pro check their bail ability even book appointments on line and when my wife love most is that home advisor is completely free to you\nGo to home ec visor dot com or download the ... to get started\nIt's people we believe investment advice is about more than helping you manage your well our investment advice is about it's about providing your kids with opportunities for a head start in life viewing secure and your retirement in ... in your dreams just may become a reality because you have a plan\nWe believe in\nThe bathroom investment advice starts with your people financial advisor find your new steeple financial advisor rich people dot com that's S C I F ... people make wasn't company incorporated member S.

lot of you know rush don't get sucked into this they're just doing a rope a dope they're trying to make you think that they've lost count but they haven't this is just I don't believe this folks\nThese people are not rational right now\nThey haven't been rational for a long time and their irrationality really was jammed up\nAfter Trump won but there's a companion story all of the people showing up for Trump and that is not up for the people showing up providing the Democrats are sending Joe Biden out to try to draw crowds for various Democrat candidate and it isn't working\nNow by showed up to do a rally for the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he'd debated rounds of Santa's last night on CNN\nUp this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he seems attractive to some of you in an Obama like way\nA would be the first African American governor uh is is supposedly just filled with love and compassion that guy is a full fledged\nLeftist Marxist that really makes no bones about evil just talking about Florida as a collective that's communist ... she was talking about Florida as law or all collective\nHe hit it would be a disaster for Florida right now to elect anybody like this guy\nBecause of what he will do\nIn racking a growing economy do you know the Florida and Texas economies are growing like gang busters and you and it's not just because of of senior citizens moving here from other areas of the country it's about tax policy\nFlorida and Texas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves and businesses in Florida are growing left and right and this guy wants to shut it down\nThis is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is a classic classic modern day Democrats leftist who doesn't want there to be in the private sector success\nBecause the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate I and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally and so forth this guy wants government in charge of virtually everything\nFor his express purpose of determining outcomes based on what he thinks is equality in fairness\nHe doesn't know about running businesses like every other Democrat in the world that's never run one has want an open criticism for them and the people around them and the people who found them and the people who start them has a deep resentment he's part of the Elizabeth Warren Obama crowd\nYou didn't build that you didn't look that up a\nWould just be just bad news horrible news the thing that worst time for anybody like this guy to be elected governor or in in Florida\nRick Scott the outgoing governor gosh I Hope this guy beats Bill Nelson he's running for the Senate down here and here Rick Scott\nIs one of these guys self made and as as a has gotten become very successful and as governor he tackled a whole bunch of emergencies and disasters in just came through with flying colors and and and Nelson has become a\nJust a static flat line just a ... a walking echo chamber for whatever left his leadership and the Senate wants done whether it's a benefit to Florida or not but\nThe Santa would be great defense is is a is a Reagan night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with Trump\nA but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing here and it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least in surveys then they have expressed in quite a while\nThe trend is constantly upward people have have are exceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing me\nExtreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\nIt would constitute rolling back every achievement that has been made in the past two if you want to go back to flat line the economics of decline where the president tells you this is as good as it gets and you get a better get\nUsed to it because America's greatness in the past really wasn't deserved we wave stole a lot of what we have we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats I\nCan't I Can't imagine people\nWho are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved when ... in any way want to put the brakes on this\nAnd for what reason because they don't like Trump tweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\nTrump is supported because he's in the last line to hold off\nOn this attempt transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by\nLike this this mob seven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they're deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to beat you got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democrat Party of today wants to happen successful American needs to be punished whatever else is going on it's still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nAre you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democrat Party believes your not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can\nThey don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content on your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish\nThe Democratic party has become a party of groups\nOf victims and these victims have turned over to their own futures to the Democratic party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me in and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference\nAnd so more and more what they want by voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful\nOr anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness\nThe Democratic party has become a party of mean spirited extremism the Democratic party has become the home of people sadly with psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders\nAnd normalize them and that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't succeed anyway\nI mean this is just hands down at this Andrew Gillum personified eyes personify the exact total wrong direction to take at any time but especially now let me go to these photos put but one of these up\nThe digital camera if you're watching this is Joe Biden at a rally for Andrew Gillum the media is trying to hide the fact that nobody is showing up\nThat is one view of a ...
