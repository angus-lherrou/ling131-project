that he was um I'm from Evan ... and a member of the Green Party but what I don't see anything on here that says he is all there it is about political party Green Party birthday march seventeenth Nineteen sixty two\nAh income information pending what does this site can't tell what the site is it it's um [noise]\nAny weight identifies it as a member of the Green Party a yeah he's got pictures of Trump and he's got GOP stickers all over the uh\nThe window so law enforcement has a press conference waited for two thirty this afternoon they don't know if any more pipe bombs out there or if he has sent everything that he had the latest to recipients by the way our\nCory Booker in New Jersey senator and the former director of national intelligence James Clapper ruby recipients that I also Fox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them\nThat some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated\nBecause they were judged to be so unstable that they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab\nThe study them they had to go ahead and detonate of a blow 'em up because they might have blown up in transit although none of them have gone off\nNone of them if they were ever intended to then there's still a lot that isn't known here and a lot of people are rushing in trying to fill in blanks\nAnd this is typical during events like this isn't everybody becomes a journalist and everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on and until a law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation our law enforcement so I'm definitely going to be leaking\nBetween now and two thirty to various members of the media that they light trust or what have you so there's going to be a daily use of information of what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to believe\nThe first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concerned that the media without waiting just went ahead and signed this guy as a pro Trump anti democratic guy identifying the\nThe people as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomber the mad go bomber\nBecause it creates first impressions it it's created this worldwide presumption that the bomber was an angry Trump supporter set up at the people Trump is that this is this is the uh\nThe narrative if you will drive buys attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions are\nWhat a matters\nThat same thing is happening today with the economic news we ever GDP report today the growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected and so that Dr buys are reporting that economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression\nAmong the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy there's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic growth is\nIt didn't come into the into predicting three point eight to four percent is guess what the tech stock sector is taking a bath specifically\nGoogle also notice alphabet and Amazon have reported earnings and every and they're they're stunningly disappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in\nAnd saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections\nAnd what better time for the drive biased reports that the economy is slowing down even though it's shocking to ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama\nWe didn't see that much before Obama wait and see it very often this economy still struggling right along with the drive wise are reporting the day\nThat it has a slowing down there could be trouble on\nThe horizon and then there is this from the media light\nA headline Trump unfortunate the bombs stuff is slowing Republican momentum going into the midterms are we talking about this yesterday this was a I fought a left wing media narrative that had been created\nBut apparently Trump has signed onto what President Trump today\nComplained about the pipe bombs being sent a prominent Democrats lamenting the the scare has distracted\nFrom news about the midterms and even Sloan Republican momentum said Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens in the momentum greatly swallows news is not talking politics very unfortunate\nWhat's going on Republicans to go out and vote that's his tweets\nI did my own little informal survey and I asked people if they've seen any signs of slow down or loss of momentum or all that and then nobody nobody has\nYou know like this is I sadly I Wish it weren't the case I think Trump is half right here I think it is a reflection of what's in the news\nAnd what is it\nAnd if there isn't any news about the Republican early voting dwarfing Democrats than the perception is that it isn't happening or none of this stopped\nOr it's not newsworthy enough anymore so the bomb thing has come along I mean it dwarfs the caravan that news stopped being reported but more and more importantly all of the news about\nThe heavy Republican turnout dwarfing the Democrats late Republicans pulling ... I've got a pool here today from strategic good strategic strategic\nIn the poll Ron ... than the U.S has pulled ahead of Andrew Gillum by a point it's a respectable Paul it's a big deal\nAnd so ... this is the kind of news that is not being widely reported and therefore people in Florida are not being told this and it's one of these I'm sad reality is that the daily reporting the news does affect what people think\nTheir perceptions of ah of what's going on and I think that's what Trump is ah is talking about here complains that bombs have slowed Republican momentum\nUm\nIn fact here's another as I say as a media story I don't know who wrote this but listen to the next paragraph Trump's tweet while somewhat nonsensical\nSuggests the president might be falling from a false flag theory being pushed on Fox News this week that the bombs or a Democrat operation to get out the vote for the midterms is tweet comes moments after police intercepted two more devices sent to Cory Booker and James Clapper what\nTrump's tweet well someone nonsensical really help to know who wrote this suggests the president might be falling for the false flag theory being pushed on Fox News the bombs or a Democrat operation to get out the vote\nIf the bombs or a false flag operation they're designed to ... to to cover up in the news of anything good maybe have favorable the Republicans are Trump for being reported\n\nIt's a false flag operation it'd be designed to to um it'll make it make it appear like the Democrats are behind this it will just have to let time unfold on this is a little frustrating to try to get all this information coming in and not be able to share it with you because I Can't confirm it myself\nAnd I don't want to be out on a limb so we're just going to be patient was just going to wait and as I\nLearn things that I can personally confirming vouch for and what have no trouble explaining if somebody question about that I'll pass subtlety let's take a brief time out we will continue after\nThe rash of me he I mean were\nYou found in\nThere is still a college in America where students can debate ideas openly and honestly where they can work with their professors and respectful ways it's Hillsdale College every student in Hillsdale lives by an honor code and it's not a list of do's and don'ts it's a simple pledge and this is it\nA Hillsdale College student as honorable and conduct honest and word indeed do that for instance in service and respectful of the rights of others\nThrough education the student rises to solve government that tip every incoming freshmen commits to follow that code and throughout their Hillsdale education their character is built to be true in good you don't find grievance list safe spaces or identity politics\nHillsdale graduates go on to serve our country is teachers doctors stay at home moms lawyer\nI Am plays to inform you that law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody\n[noise] President Trump\nTalking about the arrest of Cesar ... the Leadership Conference at the White House that is the big news today or that Justice Department news briefing will be taking place at one thirty this afternoon and we're standing by to take you straight to it once they get underway\nOr top local story a man accused of going down a two brothers in Fort Dodge last weekend just interested by police\nTwenty eight year old died Tanner king was arrested last night he's accused in the shooting deaths of thirty seven year old Mary Ann roads and thirty four year old el Dominic roads it's a one thirty one time now to take a look those foreign markets with a Cooper\n\nThe top stories at the top and bottom up every hour news radio ten forty\nDon't wait 'til [noise]\nSimon Conway live loud and local this afternoon ... news radio ten forty ... don't you wait Joe [noise]\nGet a grand in your hand you're going to try to trick or treating\nThere you go that's right and the best they got to be a very good staff should not get catch a game\nYou can try to take didn't win a thousand dollars to sixteen times a day every weekday\nWow that's a scary Hillary as though you were to ... the same thing belly you listening\nWhich will be ... a lot of weight ... news radio ten forty W.

I think they know they're in trouble with these elections\nI honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to gain seats in the house or or you are not nearly going to lose as many as people are thinking they are and I think it's all goes back to what like Jordan saying about that ... you know and this and this whole cover up\nBut if they don't we take that house once the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward on that face a document and that dot CA and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen\nAnd I think the I think this package bombs are means of disrupting these elections to the point where they can then say between ... between these crazy right these these national strike group\nPlanting bombs on the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in the selection for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing into turmoil I really do\nI so you think that as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're gonna lose they're not going to win the house back Democrats in the in the deep state thing not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result of Democrats in the deep state loses and they can say election invalid too much was going on we can't we get our democracy can't function this way you ... and you really think that the\nThe deep state here set this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and have the left when in fact they orchestrated you think that\n[noise] do you do for the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent they'd been corrupted over the past four or five years\nThis is the central feature of our system of government you advocate for your beliefs enthusiastically but we peaceably unlawfully comply with the results\nPlease know that from the beginning this investigative team has made this matter a top priority focusing their great talents and expertise on neutralizing this threat they moved swiftly and professionally\nUsing extraordinary technical expertise to apprehend the one alleged responsible [noise] this is a demonstration of the skill capability and determination of our American law enforcement best in the world\nSo I Am pleased to participate in this announcement now they suspect is in the custody of the FBI\nI Want to remind everyone that the defendant in this case as in every case is innocent until proven guilty he's been charged to die\nWith five federal crimes including interstate transportation I'm an explosive illegal mailing of explosives threats against former presidents and certain other person's threatening interstate communications and assaulting current\nAnd former federal officers for these charges a defendant faces up to fifty eight years in prison\nThese charges may a change or expand as the investigation proceeds\nList is law and order administration we will not tolerate such lawlessness especially not political violence\nAnd so I Want to thank FBI Director ray and his team all about law enforcement partners who are here eighty yeah Secret Service postal inspectors Capitol police\nAre on in New York City police department and the United states attorney Berman on the southern district of New York and us attorney for the southern district of Alabama already on a or some\nFederal state and local law enforcement officers from across this country responded immediately to the cause pain contributed to this effort we are proud of each one of them\nI Want to read or write to defend it in this case is innocent until proven guilty\nBut let this be a lesson to anyone regardless of their political beliefs that we will bring the full force of law against anyone who attempts to use threats intimidation and outright violence to further and agenda\nWe will find you we will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law and now director right or who's done an incredible job leading this effort over the last few days he will give us the details of today's important ... frisk [noise]\n\nThe attorney general as confirmed we have arrested sees are say off\nIn connection with this investigation\nAs our investigation is still ongoing I may not be able to answer questions about his background or or about his motive what I can say is that this was a nationwide investigation of enormous scope of the greatest importance our investigation ranged from New York\nTo Delaware to Maryland to the district of Columbia to Florida to California\nAnd as it always does the FBI responded with every resource we've got including our joint terrorism task forces are counterterrorism division in our world renowned experts at the FBI lab in Quantico [noise]\nBut but and I really can't underscore this enough we did not act alone as you can see\nYou're from the agencies and departments represented up here today [noise] a threat of this go out of this magnitude requires all of us working shoulder to shoulder at today's arrest is a testament to the strength of our partnerships and what we can do when we all work together [noise]\nI Want to acknowledge the many partners who helped in recovering and transporting these ... these two are lab\nIn Quantico this is dangerous and highly skilled specialized work requires great care and were incredibly grateful to all those who helped us in that effort in getting those devices to our lab\nFrom around the country and we can come from that\nThirteen Days for sensitive areas individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe\nA small clock a battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives and material they give off sheet an energy through a reaction to heat shock or friction\nSo we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory fleas are not hoax devices\nI Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work of art folks at the guy left based on their initial analysis they uncovered relating fingerprints from one of the envelope containing an ID that had been sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters\nWe have confirmed this fingerprint is that ... or say\nThere is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected from pieces of two different high eighties mailed in separate envelopes and a sample previously collected from say Iraq in connection with an earlier arrest down in Florida\nThis is phenomenal work with the greatest pressure\nUnder an incredibly tight timeframe\nWe see unbelievable work like this on TV and an Hollywood but to see it up close in reality is something to behold and we are so proud of our team at the lab for their work and keeping people safe and helping us to find the individual responsible [noise]\nLate last night we also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation of this DNA connection and we want to thank them in particular for they're very quick work\nAlso want to thank the men and women of the FBI's counterterrorism division who remain on high alert\nEvery to try to keep the American people safe from harm\nAnd who move quickly and efficiently into action every single time today's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages and transit now and other packages on [noise] so we need\nThe help of everyone out there every citizen everyone in law enforcement everyone we've got\nTo help with this investigation in the days to come if you got any information please call us our tip line that wanted hundred call FBI or our email line tips the FBI dot Gov\nNo piece of information is too small every tip could be the one that leads to something very important and of course if you see something suspicious suspicious activity please call your local authorities we need all hands on deck we need to stay vigilant\nFinally I Want to thank our partners too many to name from across the country because we cannot do this work alone everyone up here today understands that and we take that to heart every single day as we do the hard work together\nFor protecting three hundred and twenty five million Americans love to turn the podium over the commissioner O'Neill from in what it is [noise]\n\nThat Chris ... and every one of the men and women are\nThe NYPD quite frankly all the people in New York City I Want to commend to thank all of our local state and federal law enforcement partners in this effort including the attorney general's office and us attorney's office for the southern district of New York\nOr in YPG detectives along with FBI and ATF agents postal inspectors New York state police and many others they are one team on our joint terrorists task force\nThe J to hear from New York was the first of its kind in the nation it's been in business since Nineteen eighty three there are three hundred investigators from fifty six agencies hundred and Thirteen of them are in New York City cops\nWhen it comes to terrorism in New York City there might be doesn't do anything without the FBI and the FBI doesn't do anything without the NYPD\nThat's a partnership that was forged and fire in my thirty six years in policing our relationship has never been stronger\nFish case told that story again Munich city cops for a side by side with FBI agents many other agencies in Florida this morning together they brought justice as they always do\nThe wide experience of our agencies coupled with the individual expertise the members of the NYPD bomb squad are highly trained emergency service unit foreign fell bureau or kind of

story was that Republican voters were\n[noise] somehow\nLosing their enthusiasm to I don't know what early vote a registered to vote was too late for that but whatever it was ... and now Trump has joined that parade President Trump today\nComplained about the pipe bombs being sent the prominent Democrats lamenting that this scare\nHas distracted from news about the mid terms and even slowed Republican momentum you said Republicans are doing so well in early voting in at the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens\nAnd the momentum greatly slows news not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans to go out and vote that was Trump's tweet\nNow\nThere are some who believe that this was another example of Trump pacing\nJust like when he made his original statements about Christine balls the Ford being credible and compelling and then later\nSort of lowering the boom on her at a rally pointing out that she really had no evidence and no way to back up what she was alleging so some people think that he's some during the same thing here uh basically tampering expectations\nWith the bombers suppression of state but the trumps out they're lowering expectations setting people up so I asked to be able to say we overcame the bomber and we did great\nAnyway and there's some people think that this is very very artful of Trump that he's getting really really good at this lowering expectations\nWhile he knows things are going to go well and then when they do go well he can go back and look at what we had to overcome looked at the obstacles that we that we came through\nAnd we try out so we will see Charlie Kirk a turning point you asked a\nSweet and uh let's see there'll be yesterday that the presidential approval rating have hit forty seven percent of his highest yet I don't need a despite the poll I'll guarantee you it's not a CNN\nPoll and it probably is it an ABC Washington Post poll or even NBC Wall Street Journal maybe

wisdom is the party out of power makes big gains in the house and Senate primarily the house in the first election after a president is inaugurated\nWell that's what we have coming up here but but kirks point is that Obama was sitting at forty four forty five percent back then trumpet forty seven percent and rising and therefore we uh we could be looking here have to have a bit of an upset [noise]\nThere's also polling data here in Florida and let me let me find this\nIt is yeah Syrian golf barely two days after Democrat Andrew Gillum was leading in most polls for governor of Florida a

a cotton is thing operate and do you I Am reading\nBy the way that it is possible that the FBI is going to indict Gillum at some ... regardless of the election that he's going to be indicted for some of the corrupt practices have been investigated\nAnd formed a we have the news that he had he paid an Under Cover\n...\nThe money to buy handled and tickets in New York\nBeyond that emails in tax

um no my friends I'm not holding back I'm waiting\nTo hear what is said at the upcoming press conference of the media eagerly anticipating and its upcoming we're seated at the department of justice waiting for whoever's going to conduct is to\nExplain how they found the guy who the guy is if they've found anybody else working with\nThe guys are their co conspirators ... says there's somebody

know how credible what we're going to be told is despite\nAll of that there is enough information to glean simply by exposing yourself to that which is reported so far today\nAnd you add that\nTo what you know or think you know about all of the various political players involved here and do you think for example that the\nThe deep state not ... the Democratic party [noise] see I Can't ever put out of my head what has been done these past two years\nOn this totally bogus investigation to prove Trump colluded with Russia that is so big that is so outrageous what has been\nDone in these past two years ignoring the real collusion and the real criminality and not even investigating\nPlanting spies in the Trump campaign why the president about whether he's a target or not literally trying to set up Trump employees\nStaffers and so forth sets them up so that they behave in certain ways as to give the impression that Trump was colluding with Russia Russia was involved it somehow that election was illegitimate that project is still\nOngoing it's ongoing in the form of the Mueller investigation\nAnd all along that line George Papadopoulos who at one time was the guy the FBI told us was the reason this investigation began\nGeorge Papadopoulos is now claiming that what he has learned it in these past two years he's thinking of withdrawing his plea agreement with Waller\nJust briefly to recall Papadopoulos was a young eager beaver so called foreign policy advisor\nOn the Trump campaign you never met dropping never gave him any advice but he was hired early on because the media was how many dropper or your advisors obviously\nGoes out these positions Papadopoulos was set up he was invited to London by one of the spies the FBI embedded the Trump campaign a guy name stuff and help her\nHe was in it or just a professor from Walter named Joseph ... who planted in his mind the idea he drove to you know this you know the Russians have a whole lotta Hillary\nThis email well I Know that Stephanopoulos twenty four year old kid he thinks he's being told something really big so they tell him this then he finds himself having adult beverages were the ambassador from Australia at a bar in London and the ambassador\nIs stepping options you know I told the we we know that the Russians have a lot of Hillary emails\nSo this ambassador goes back and reports to the FBI what Papadopoulos told them well they planted it in his head\nHe didn't know what independently because it probably isn't even true so Papadopoulos spreading the word that the Trump campaign knew that the Russians have Hillary emails at one point that's what they told us was the starting point for the investigation they'll get the ... orange what's all bogus\nThat was not when the investigation started it started way before that my point\nIs how much the deep state wants their government back we don't even really understand we think we do but we don't have any idea\nThese people have and entitlements to our government the strings the levers of power their positions in it to you and I cannot relate to\nWe can do our best to try to understand it but they think they own it if there's\nThey are scared to death that the actions that I just described the mother but this whole two years silent who\nThey are hell bent that none of what they've done it ever really see the light of day that nobody ever find out and the fastest way to making sure\nThat nobody ever find out is to make sure the Democrats win control of the house and eventually get to the Senate and the White House back and then everything's cool\nThe cover up well continue nobody will ever know what really happened\nThese people who might be facing jail time or other serious criminal problems will be spared that's another reason why Hillary had the wedding and the Mueller investigation I Believe is an attempt to distract everybody and and be a cover up\nFor the real conspiracy and the real ... and
