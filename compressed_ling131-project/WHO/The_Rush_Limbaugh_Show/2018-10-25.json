all of that stuff is gone none of that stuff is being reported or talked about at all\nAnd those were the things that we're talking\nThe talk of Republican enthusiasm\nNot to mention all the polls and not to mention the story is on the on the slippery away blew away all of those stories are gone now every story that dealt with them in terms and those stories had shifted toward Republican momentum all those stories are gone now\nAnd pretty much every story has to do with the show he\nAnd the Turks and the Saudis or the bombs\nAnd how Trump's not Trump's gotta learn to shut up Trump's got us these gotta stop stoking emotion like this I mean they're blaming Trump for this from beginning to end but if you're in the drive by media and all those other stories\nThe caravan slash invasion that Kavanaugh aftermath the economy which is a fabulous story and the Trump rallies if they are not news\n\nAnd the only thing that is news is the bombs these mailed devices\nThey've taken all of that other stuff\nOff the radar so that Dr buys reporting this stuff may feel like\nThat the enthusiasm for the midterm elections particular why only on the Republican side by the way\nWhy only Republican and threw it must be because that's where the enthusiasm was I mean if there is a significant sea change in voter enthusiasm and the drivers are going to report that itch Republican enthusiasm that is happening down\nThen it must have been Republican enthusiasm that was very high on ratcheting up so now they're saying enthusiasm has waned it's Republican enthusiasm\n\nSo they are in their media capitals are in New York and there in Washington there in Los Angeles they're reporting this stuff\nAnd in their world the midterms are off the radar in their world anything to do with them in terms of ... well not off\nThe radar it's a very important point the enthusiasm on the Republican side\nThey see us having vantage why because there aren't any stories about well yeah they determine what

exploded yet\nAnd bill hammer\nStarts off I go into came back in any case I mean what are you what you've been watching what you've been observing over the past six hours what do you see\nWhat I've observed is a president who didn't leadership he condemned the attack he called for unity and then you had a response from the liberal media to then ... the president\nNation instead of blaming the president to take a cue from the president\nAnd leadership yesterday called for this country and come together instead of attacking one another with partisan politics time to stand behind the president is shameful that the New York times today tends to publish an article that depicted their fascination and the president of the United states we're twenty four hours from the thigh convened delivered and how painful and the New York times\nI now I mentioned that through your toward the tail end of the hour they actually did they published a fiction piece by a writer fantasizing over a secret service agent\nHanding a Russian agent his gun to assassinate Donald Trump not the president not just the president I don't know named Donald Trump you've got a Russian agent trying to assassinate his\nGun doesn't go off\nAnd so a nearby Secret Service agent hands the Russian assassin his gun says here use\nMine the times runs this story and they excuses by saying well we must published stories that relate to react to live with the Mueller investigation of Trump threatened put what does that got to do with Trump being assassinated anyway even if there was something to it which there's not\nAnd and then they're preaching to us why publishing that story they're preaching to everybody about civility and why you need to dial back what Donald Trump is saying into Donald Trump needs to dial it back in Donald Trump needs the training to Donald Trump\nDidn't meanwhile they can call him and not sitting call him Hitler they can lie about the things he says and does all day long with no recourse that's what Mac and then he's talking about here now is Natasha on a top response\nI think that the president controls ten thousandth ethic I'd laugh at it has rally that he was\nPoking fun at the whole idea of all I'm not going to talk about the things I'm going to be presidential which is essentially saying to his audience you know what I'm thinking and then this morning we'll trade and that it was CNN fall which basically is a ... a woman gets actually thought that was her fault for wearing a short skirt has been completely\n... saying that CNN and was responsible for that to get the fake news that they're spreading listen ... that is sending us\nBy by hope of all let me just add a van and that's why they want to be on the record that Hey Matt and then a python showed up and not culpable\nFor the python culpable for the rhetoric that we're seeing back and forth and then you had an anchor on that network endorsed the play and Central Park depicting the assassination and the president saying that\nThe leader right now you heard Natasha on a top\nThere say you really you you want to be on the record\nSaying that when a pipe bomb showed up how about her analogy that Trump blaming CNN is akin to because they got about never see is like blaming\nA I'm a ... a woman who sexually assaulted blaming her for the assault\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nI mean that's that's that's the logic that's the analogy she used okay so so um the conversation continues here now you'll hear the senior writer for Washington Free beacon lose Harrington or join the conversation at resumed here by by Natasha on atop\nThe kind of rhetoric at the pride that happen if out things for years he recently commanded that Congress men about body slamming the reporter he has called the ... the enemy that people have to say that can have a legal for anyone in guiding fellow at about\n... what about the language is\nAn outlet and I have tons and tons of ... kind of heroin Brennan\nAnd CNN had a choice yesterday he always thought the president come out saying is Korean American stand for what he had if I Want to see an end to tell complain that from the president can blame it on Sarah Sanders John Brennan echoing that how\nTo move forward forward and I find it helped the low road President Trump at the highlights what Clinton said last week they cannot have civility\nRight we cannot have civility so what your hand here yet on a top actually trying to blame all all of this on Trump and of course using this\nI'm from the high road and I'm I'm from uh I'm from propriety and so just simply because she's on the on the left now before we go to the break we're going to we're going to we're\nGoing to switch gears river just a bit to talk about the caravan 'cause I saw this coming up right after I saw the soundbite that\nYou just heard and I switched over to see it and I caught the governor of Ohio there John\nCase it and he is being\nInterviewed I I don't know who the reporter was at the CNN another matter being interviewed about the caravan and America and how to deal with I just I just want you to hear this we have to buy your number one\nWe have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border and there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would check those who are legitimately in need of asylum could be vetted before they even get to the border\nBut you know what we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter deal if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's not a drug meal\nNow that they're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nAll right so what is the rule is here or the technique here is a moral equivalence there but for the grace of God go watch Phil Donahue used to this all the time Phil Donahue and hosts the show and when the subject of illegal immigration would come up he wouldn't be start preaching\nAbout the accident of his birth\nYou know I was born just a few miles inside the U.S border and it's it's look the difference it's made for me it if they started a stolen the guilt if he felt over how the accident of his birth resulted in him being an American how basically on there that was\nTo watch other people in the world as though being born into a country of prosperity and decency is something to feel guilty about\nAnd\nIt may be something to feel very grateful for I have no quarrel with that but it's how you deal\nWith this that matters we simply can't take and everybody in the world they answered the solution is to spread our area of dominant influence\nAnd to get rid of tyrannical regimes and dictatorships which treat their people like dirt\nAnd condemn that and do our best to spread our way of life around on the belief that it's good and decent but there are way too many people don't think we're the good guys and they think that the American way of life is an imposition\nTo others and that we don't have the right to impose our\nViews on people but somehow we ought to stay on the side and let everybody who wants him in\nBecause of our guilt and he\nSays uh you know it did their Marjorie north it could easily have been all of us that we're in\nTara ban that we're marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nBut it isn't\nYou know you can deal with what ifs and couldn't be ... and all of that but but it isn't unless you're trying to accomplish something else so here's here's governor cases now continuing his\nAt the FBI about\nThe investigation into this suspicious packages sent a multiple high profile Democrats recently and actor Robert De Niro his restaurant in New York\nWe do plan to break into our regular programming when the news conference begins and listen in what investigators have to say about this issue is expected to start any moment now investigators say at least some of the bombs delivered seemed to be incapable of exploding\nAt this point in their review investigators say that their initial analysis shows that some of the explosive devices contain substantial flaws\nAnd would not have exploded they say it's too soon to tell if the deficiencies were intentional or simply a result of bad design or construction and there's up to eight of these devices in suspicious packages that have turned up into numerous locations\nAnd we do have a news conference it's going to start soon we understand uh from New York City\nAnd can just a status update on the investigation we thought we tune in and listen to what they have to say\nAt least for a short time and then go back to regular programming our top local story is a teen was shot and showed up at a Des Moines hospital last night

getting ready to start a news briefing about the bomb investigation and multiple suspicious packages found versus the New York city's police commissioner who is beginning to comment\nOf ... or a law enforcement partners joined us here today bill sway assistant director in charge of the New York FBI office ... special agent in charge of it is a New York field division and a villa Bartlett inspector in charge of the u._s. postal inspection services\nNew York division in a moment we'll hear from mayor de Blasio and you and I hear from bill and then uh from John Miller [noise]\nTrial provide you with an update on a suspicious package investigations are conducting here in New York City first and foremost for most of my message today is that New Yorkers are safe\nThere are no current credible threats twenty individuals organizations or locations here in New York City New Yorkers are safe but everyone all eight point six million residents in the millions of visitors who come here every year should always remain vigilant\nAnd aware of their surroundings as always I urge people to alert us to anything that might seem strange route a place or anything that makes them feel uncomfortable like if I got a cop call nine one one or ... toll free counterterrorism number which is one eight eight eight New York city safe\nAnd that's where anything new or if someone as information about any of the incidents this week in New York\nWe don't underestimate the difference even one person can make George our collective safety and neither should the people of New York city I Want to reiterate as I did yesterday as I Do any time we talk about for reaching investigations of this nature or any other kind of nothing we do and law enforcement we'd do alone\nFor a joint terrorism task force comprised of professionals and the agencies you see here today and others were investigating all of this with great precision but I can say with certainty\nThat we will identifying the rest of the person or people responsible for these acts make no mistake\n[noise] New York city's intelligence and counterterrorism terrorism capabilities are second it on every day they are not just this week or detectives and analysts are constantly poring over the bridge dream as we proactively deploy or resources around the city as needed\nAnd you're seeing that today too out of an abundance of caution I'll tell you that when we look at the events of yesterday and today I have a much pride in incredible work the men and women are the NYPD through reaching everyday expression involves partnering with the organization's representative here today\nOr concluded by reminding everyone but more force from professionals do not care about the politics behind these acts but we do care about is keeping the public reserves safe\nThat's it that's the job fighting crime and keeping people safe and through the fall and willing partnership of everyone who lives and works in a visit to New York city who make the safe as large city the United states even safer Mr Mayor [noise]\nYou're very very much commissioner I Want to express my appreciation to all the men and women and YPG who've done an outstanding job yesterday and today addressing this situation and to all of our partners federal and state partners everyone has been working together\nTo address this forthrightly now look one of the things that we emphasize the moment like this is that you're going to see a lot of police presence it's important that we proactively take steps to protect those who have come under attack\nClearly what we've seen in the last few days is an attack on media outlets an attack on the prominence of public figures\nOr we're going to make sure there's expanded the president's as long as we needed to show very vividly that New York city takes these issues seriously that we are defending\nPeople who are coming under attack that part of how we protect the Democratic process is to show the threats like this are not taken lightly so that they expect that presence and I know that for those who have gone through this or in the last few days that the president said they appreciate greatly\nWant to say that uh everyday New Yorkers have responded to the situation with the kind of strength and the kind of resiliency that this city is famous for that makes me very very proud of all eight point six million New Yorkers as they have handled the situation\nA with a real sense of resolve a they're not going to let an act of terror intimidate them and that's a really important in this moment to say whatever the motives of the individuals involved\nAh the people in this city or are not being thrown off the game are not having their values undermined or the way of life undermined New Yorkers are standing strong right now\nAnd the last thing I Want to say is you know it in a moment like this there's a lot of concern there's a lot of fear\nA clearly it's upsetting time it's a time when there's been too much hatred in too much division in the air\nAnd in that context people can feel powerless I Want to remind people that everyone has an opportunity to play a positive and constructive role here\nUh first of all helping law enforcement this is something that everyone can do if you have any information at all that you think could help law enforcement to address the situation to share it with law enforcement immediately uh let them be the judges of the value of the information don't hold back\nA so many times and I agree with the commissioner law enforcement that ultimately has proven they will find the perpetrators but so many times it's because uh an individual citizens step forward with information that really led to the key breakthrough if you have information sharing\nIf you're concerned about uh packages that could arrive at your home or your workplace you see something that worries you reach out to the police and get a their involvement to address the situation\nPeople can be part of solving this immediate challenge but finally we all can be a part of solving the bigger situation that we're facing as a society as a nation a tone of civility a tone of mutual respect is something we all can create\n[noise] um he disassembled a radio shack clock\n\nHe was trying to make his brief case look like a bomb which he
