stories from Des Moines news traffic and severe weather station news radio ten forty Donald you\nAny kind of uprising any kind of ... the first instinct as a drive by\nMedia has\nAnd I what I say drive by media may as well be selling it saying a Democrat part of the first thing I think they have is to try to find a way\nTo link who ever committed the bad deed to the Republican Party or\nThe so called conservative movement\nAnd of course now it's blamed Trump everything everything at all what ever it is blame Donald Trump blame me blame you blame anybody that's supported Donald Trump and frankly\nI'm worn out with this reaction I have had it I Am fed up with it's been this way for years there were showed up during the Obama administration there were mass murders and at no time did the drive by media ever try to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten wasn't inflammatory\nJust said that Republicans were going to be responsible for millions of death if Obamacare was not passed\nA law anybody remember that because I sure as hell do because I was set up one is that we're trying to oppose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world are trying to take them to prevent a bunch of incompetence\nA bunch of government bureaucrats and left wing politicians from taking over the American health\nSystem meanwhile Obama\nLying to everybody about it claiming that they liked her doctor keep their plan they get get get to and that their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie after lie after lie not called out not reported\nAnd then the Republicans come along and try to oppose it on subsidies grounds and the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not\nHow many years have average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens that Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets ...\nIt's why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stops in other words you have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years [laughter] excuse me\nThen decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the fault of the political party or it's the fault of a president's and and so predictable 'cause they hate the president will do\nAnd then they can to get rid of him they spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him they're fit to be tied over their failure they're ratcheting up this this anger and if it were getting so far away from the notion that whoever did it is the person it did it\nWe're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do whatever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative movement\nAs far as the drive by meeting is concerned it's not because somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives I mean he doesn't care about that except to the extent they can link the Trump\nWell I've I for one am am fed up with it I Am sick of this reaction to every freaking event\nEven\nThough whether we can even get away from it from the women are extreme weather happens it's our fault it's the problem of the Republicans or Trump because we don't sign on to this asinine manmade global warming theory so we ended up being responsible for deaths in print Domenico\n[noise]\nAnd then when we stand up and defend ourselves against then all of a sudden we're attacked in we're assaulted for being anti war many anti anti black anti minority what have you\nBecause they politicized literally everything [noise] and you know what if I have gotten to the point I Can't tune it out it is by your man to pay attention to it it is my\nMan to come here and pay attention to tell you what I think about\nHow many people you think are fed up with this by now\nYou would think this is going to affect the midterm elections Democrats and maybe I got I got a clue for ya neither of these events that you are hyping are going to ... change significantly in the mid term elections as much as you would like them to and as much as you're trying to make them change the mid term elections you must be worried how the midterms are going you pretend the rats at\nLeast two things up to try to get people to somehow vote against Donald Trump may you must not believe like Nate Silver says eighty five percent chance that you're going to take the house\n\nNo you have to take these too sad unfortunate events in and build them up into somehow they are Donald Trump's fault and this is why you should vote against Republicans in the midterms\nI can tell you right now but I ... do not know it from a ... hands on knowledge I'm just telling my gut is that there are millions of Americans wants this stuff's cards they tuned out they're fed up with being blamed\nThey're fed up with the people they love and support being blamed\nThey're fed up with their country being blamed\nAnd so they just they just tune it out they think about all of the mass shootings have cops\nBack during the Obama those and those were supported\nYou had the support those you have the support black lives matter and they weren't condemned there weren't any consequences for that\nProtesters could roll into Ferguson, Missouri and and literally tear up a town on why they create a lie about\nThe shooter in that in that ... the Mike Brown ... one of his first name was\nWho was held up a convenience store and so whatever they just totally make it up turn it inside out\nAll for the express purpose of blaming Donald Trump\nNow it it it it gets it gets to the point that if if the media wonders why they're in such ill distribute right now because of this\nNobody believes what'd you say nobody\nTrusts what you're saying it's so obviously politically charged it so obviously you're you're passionate about this\nIs what you're going to do with this politically\nThe guy that shot up the synagogue and Pittsburgh squirrel hill section of ... I Know this place well I Lived there not squirrel hill but I Know where it is\nThe guy that shot this place up Hey David\nDonald Trump Donald Trump was too big and Jewish supporter his daughter converted to Judaism before marrying questioner he more into the American embassy to Jerusalem this guy thinks Trump is part of the sellout\nTo worldwide and Jewish people and yet the media is blaming\nTrump is saying well a lot of that that is a rock and all that just that that that's just a disguise you know that that that that they just did that the\nCover up Trump's real anti Semitism

the Koch\nBrothers they're re Wichita energy from and family\nAnd David Koch and his wife Julia donated won the five million dollars to some New York hospital the nurses association and other organizations at the hospital told the hospital's not doing except the donation\nBecause David Koch is nothing more than a yellow ballet and white privilege racist and the only reason for his donation wants to cover his racism and hide it so people didn't really see\nThis is who the left is so they even reject acts of charity as ill motivated why does somebody think that way\nWhat wouldn't make those nurses thinks that way I submit to you that it is the drive by media\nI submit to you that it is their union leaders and maybe instructors teachers they have in school\nWere not even a

how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take you sit there and you take it\nAnd you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh don't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we can't let you on the Supreme Court and you're gonna have to sit there and that's the price you're gonna have to pay for this guy being elected and

I got\nThis ... that's exactly right and this is where this is all headed this is all headed towards atheism anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are\nThe trend is toward atheism and no God or at least agnostic ... because that removes Emmy judgmental ism right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else it bears no\nUltimate power that can meet out approve or disapprove or for once accidental one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I I just I'm so you have this of this event in Pittsburgh given everything else that you say that you are\nAll the liberalism to creep in to Judaism and a rising anti Semitism your writers it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about it it's rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so\nThis event in Pittsburgh did it did it adds to any of the uh discomfort or on is you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah I I I don't I don't feel like that there's a ... million people out there targeting\nA Jews and the way that they would want to go she got the thing that I think that this is these

that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that\nOK well there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat [noise] and then the second event happens on Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people that politicize everything\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American left ... people look politicized
