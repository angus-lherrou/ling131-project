H. O. radio news wow sunny what a difference a few hours makes ... blew me this morning now fifty five degrees at the Des Moines airport are topical stories that were detectives continuing to work trying to identify suspects after a man was shot in a home invasion early this morning on the east side of Des Moines Iowa [laughter]\nHospital staff and personnel gave the president first Lenny a standing ovation have you heard about this no oh you're hearing about is the protesters outside wherever the president goes you're hearing about forty four thousand people who signed some petition saying we don't want you here Mr President\nWe don't want you we don't want your wife we don't want your Jewish pretend daughter we don't want your joints son in law we don't want any of you here go away but\nTrump goes to the hospital where the professionals treated the wounded and it gets very very warm welcome you don't see that report it\n[noise] [noise] um\nThey continue to try to lay the blame on Trump for this\nAnd it just wears you out I Know people are telling me it just wears you out every day you get at the same thing different degrees of intensity different details in the story but it's the same thing\nAnd people say Russia's gonna win them in terms folks there is a soul out there who knows who's going to win the midterms\nThere isn't a single person out there who has the slightest idea I don't care what Paul you look at I don't care what professional you talk to I don't care what great really an analyst there is there isn't anybody who knows\nWho's going to win the midterms you have all kinds of people who want to impress you and how smart they are and how analytical they are but it's like anything else in the future nobody knows and that's because there are so many races according to the polling data can break either way\nThere are so many that are so close but then when you say that okay do we trust the polling day though the polling data versus two thousand sixteen not all that hot dry nobody knows\nLine\nNate Silver or given exam Nate Silver is considered a good word you know why I think it was was it two thousand fourteen two thousand twelve\nWas one of those two elections were Nate Silver lucked into calling every state on the money\nAnd that seat won the election of go in the past whenever it was gave him this reputation that he's in the tunnel since that won election where he was infallible he hasn't come close\nDoesn't matter because he came closer was dead on the money when Democrats were victorious he's become a guru he's become a shrink he's become a psychiatrist or psychologist Democrats tuned to Nate Silver distaste than when the information they're hearing doesn't go the way they want it to go\nHeard ... that was said packet us in the silver guy nice guy but he's never run a campaign he's never taken a single poll all he does his analyze\nThem he's never participated in a poke either the polling company he's never run a campaign as a ... point was you need to temper all these so called experts with some reality\nThat guy hits it on one election that happened to be exactly what the Democrats wanted to hear turned out to be\nTrue and so it becomes a girl wrote and the media continues to cite this was like Nate Silver is out there saying eighty six percent now chances Democrats when the house nobody knows\n\nSo you can't you can't talk come to the temptation here to go blonde vi\nAnd become flat line and it's hard I I look I Will admit it's hard as I say the human emotional reservoir can only hold so much\nAnd at some point it's going to get depleted and maintaining fever pitch energy becomes a challenging thing to do precisely when the news every day is Ninety eight percent slanted Ninety two percent slanted against you and what you believe in and what you want to happen\n\nThe Trump ... and the er the birthright citizenship today the Dems are still mad about it\nAll kinds of experts being trotted out it's unconstitutional no it's certainly constitution no it isn't and you've got Republican leaders that we don't want to go down this road is a silly we're all in favor of as many people getting in the countries that can Democrats saying the same thing but it's out there it's a conversation starter\nNothing is going to happen anytime soon the leftist saying yeah conversation starter is all it is Trump doesn't really mean it is trying to rile up the base that's where you're wrong Trump does made it\nIt is about time this was changed we have a crisis brewing\nWe have a crisis growing in terms of what kind of country we're going to be what kind of culture is going to dominate in this country and we are under assault by people who don't like the United states of America the way it was founded in the snow complicated mysteries and this is just what it is that's who the opponents are\nVery hell bent\nAnd they're not going to stop until they until they went and now the Mueller investigation looking at all of us in the lower investigation trying to come\nBack to life remember had told yesterday how many leftist were convinced that Muller by now was going to have issued a report proving trumping colluded with Russia\nYou know how many people on the left believed that\nAnd how many have been thinking all this time that Mahler was timing this release for right before the election and it was going to happen and if it didn't happen to that would be a leak wanted there would be some kind of indication and yet ... zeroes not at the latest from Muller is it somebody is running a scam on him a sex scandal of some time that they\nSo boring to me I haven't even delved into the details but Muller is saying that people are trying to run a sex scam on him up some kind or tried to or what have you all all I Know is that that's the last thing that the left was counting on Robert Mueller having to say\nIn the days and weeks leading up to election there's a big deal psychologically I'm telling you these people really fought you you wouldn't be amazed at how many people\nThat drive by media the American leftist propagandize significant portion of this population they have believed from the first day that Trump the first day they herded the Trump stole the election they have believed that Mueller has found they believe Mahler was going to find it and didn't find it and it's holding it and it's going to release of the most opportune time\nDespite the fact that in any evidence right there never has been any evidence for because it didn't happen\nIt did happen in between Hillary the Democrats but it didn't happen with Trump there isn't a shred there will not be a shred of evidence and yet they're still holding out hope\nMueller and his people trying to remain relevant\nRising from the dead looking like Trump may answer some questions after the election remember the news stories about that\nHow many months maybe over a year now have there been stories about Trump will or won't submit the questioning by Mahler lawyers thinking showed lawyers make you shouldn't Trump wants to set the story is but his lawyers say no way\n\nMe and while the conversations never happen from never met with mother never answered written questions they weren't submitted a total non story that both sides were participating in\nThe news now is the Trump might speak with smaller after the election might answer some questions after the election\nThat take away is that the primary weapon the Democrats thought they had to get rid of Trump and when the house and Senate has fizzled\nIt's not there so they're turning they always do to other things\nWe also have the usual parade of celebrities\nBrain dead idiots celebrities vomiting their opinions throwing away their money we have proven that we really are not motivated to do anything celebrities advise\nIt has been a long established the celebrities do not move public opinion when nobody is worried about celebrities think or do in that sense because they don't and yet they persist\n\nWe now have the Oprah were told they offer is going to go into Georgia and campaign for the Democratic governor for Georgia Stacey what his name ... what is the last time the Oprah was a factor in an election can anybody telling me\nYou think Obama's first victory was was when was time to to to the Oprah\n\nYou think she was helpful why ...\nI Will admit that she didn't hurt me you think if Oprah hadn't been out there doing what the offer was doing an Obama would not have won okay Obama what is still won despite what the offer was hounded Barbra Streisand Barbra Streisand's out so she's trying to gin up anti Republican vote by promising people to move to Canada\nIf the Republicans hold the house ... anybody cares about that other than the people say go hip move it's going to motivate me to vote Republican\nAnd how many people on the Democrat oh my God we can't lose bathrooms oh no we can't ... remember to Canada we got to vote number it how many people think that\nThat's going to be the way people take their vote and yet it makes the news\nIt's a big deal that Barbara Streisand who nobody cares about might move to Canada how many Democrats over the years of threatened to leave the United states if they lose the next election and after they lose the next election\nThey say and nobody ever does this story\nIt's flooding thirty I'm Wendy Wild W.

H. O. three day weather forecast I'm channel Thirteen year old and just make and sell off [noise]\nOkay listen to and again this is Monday Night on CNN steak in a couple of days for this to reach the mainstream [noise]\nNon lemon lemon says it on Monday Night on CNN and\nIts noticed today and again he's talking the freight Cuomo\nAbout all the recent shootings in mailed pipe bombs and ... says there was another have filled criminal just last week in Kentucky another white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover it\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy van\nOut John Lennon uh what is your reaction to this I mean the pumps I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean the specifics of a white guy ban them that that may be something that he individually holds the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned as white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's not on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view the Americans left it as white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here that is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the ... days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been\nTo transform America away\nFrom the traditions and institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery\nAs the primary evidence the primary example or exhibits\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair of course pay no attention to the steps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets no mention whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism in slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan in immigration policy\nYou name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and filled of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo ah to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins now it covers much more grounded in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using victim allergy and victimhood to a tea\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be a white men or continue to be the majority\nAnd they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it I think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching media response\nAll the way to the actions of people even notice how quickly they want to do bad notice how quickly on the left ... people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always the result of environmental things\nAnd so on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things I think it's day\nIf you're going to if we're going to go down that road and if we're going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is it that didn't raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can't you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nAnd since these people are the vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon said this is a Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics you mean Don like the followers of black lives matter aren't Republicans in that group looking\nNumber of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders have\nBeen defended and explained away by people like you\nIn the sense well they're cops and they mistreat their racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me that Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shut up the Republican baseball practice I think he was intending to wound to people Steve squeeze almost did die it's amazing these people the way they talk and the things they conveniently forget or don't even register maybe in the first place\nFive cops in Dallas two thousand sixteen\nOr the Muslims in this country who have committed murder or vey Republicans nope many of them are very loyal Democrat voting bloc Muslim Americans\nRush thank you so much time listening or from the days of David thank you [laughter]\nOr a general General David Dinkins ... that are fifty four where are you parity yes indeed that was\nGreat longer hear it again someday but I just wonder are your thoughts on why we haven't seen or heard of any reporting on this airline that went down two days ago and I recall that last plane went down in Malaysia\nCNN was all over for about a month and a half a non stop the and we haven't seen anything about this this brand new plane that went that\nYeah where did I go down\nIn ... Taiwan there about a hundred and eighty nine people died it was a brand new I Believe it's going I'm not exactly sure\nWell there's no way to Lincoln Trump good point\nThere is no way to link it to the mid term elections there's no way to use that crash to gin up anti Republican anti Trump no I'm not joking the hell I'm not sure I'm not joking and they don't care about it because it has no impact it has no usage they can see in\nAffecting the outcome they want in the mid term elections don't worry they'll get to it when it's time to time to attack a corporation\nLike bowling or whoever made the plane they'll get to it after they've done what they can do on the midterms\nMuch appreciate it\nYou do you do you do you do doubt me on this\nPersonally no but uh just gonna remember seeing them go when wall to wall on that last plane that went down\nWell of course because that's CNN CNN neighbors there were there was there was sucking hot or they were in last place out there\nAnd uh this was that was pre Trump and the belief in media is that airline airplane crashes airliner crashed as a lot of passengers is light blue eye balls are below the T. V. so they believe and then they had a mystery where it is a damn thing\nWhere is it Don Lemon even ask the former director of National Transportation Safety Board caught it had been swallowed by a black hole\nRemembered that you remember that\n... percent we remember that not going to ...\n... ... but they they had a mystery on their hands and indeed you're right they went wall to wall with it and it became\nA standing joke you know that the the best way to make anything you're doing it success\nIs to lose it and and have CNN try to find it for you\nI just haven't seen it on any media outlet whether it's Yahoo Google CNN NBC none of the nightly news show one picture from what a what a wait a minute how do you know about it then\nWell I saw it on a headline\nNews maybe where Monday morning morning the headline news\nHeadline news they just announced they're getting out of the news headline news just announced they're going to go eighty percent\nUh uh uh advertising or something like what do you ever uh forget what you call that program it but\nI just wanted to kill your that that was not one little usually anytime the plane goes to kill him that many people especially it was a brand new planning that I don't\nKnow whether you such a brand new playing what kind of play it was a boy you remember the model number\nBut since it's brand new it's got to be one of the dumb or somewhat but uh and that's what made me think even more that we would see news Stewart Brand new plan going on is unusual and ah we went out\nTo sea salt in it and I'll tell you what it was a bowling seven thirty seven max which is the latest um upgrade of the seven ... seven thirty seven is a debate wide body\nAnd not\nAs widely courses a jumbo jet wide body but a study and they have a mix of the damn thing to try to make a whole more passengers went down\nBut it didn't go down in America a Donald Trump has nothing to do with it going down that they could they make a case uh they they could not say that the pilot was angry at Trump and decided to take everybody out in his ... and so\nThere's no way to link this I'm not I'm not joking\nI Wish I was there is no way to link that crash to

I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth than there's evidence of it everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidates an individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweets and his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\nAs one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd and people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why let me ask you\nSome people it's horrible what Trump said about Paul why\nIs it why is it why isn't it\nA problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had to disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America as you know it\nWhich is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway as a great piece today [noise] speaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question\nDuring the Kavanaugh hearings remember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the forward with her allegations of whatever capital I did that led to the fact that capital spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward\nClaiming they had evidence of it none of them ever present at any but the media and the\nDemocratic Party were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh was named to the Supreme Court he is he passes it gets ... get the confirmation vote and isn't sworn in why did the media drop it\nIf Kavanaugh was such a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I Would have Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get rid of those guys are represented serial rapist where is all that just it's gone is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway if the media and other democratic leaders wanted to have any credibility in all that the post hearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political\nStunt for which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kavanaugh if all of that was legit if if\nEverything Kavanaugh was accused of being was actually true as they would not have stopped at him being confirmed on the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice\nThey would be out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why are they doing that there is a big campaign going camping all of us have been rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion if Kavanaugh did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeach in Canada where are these questions\nThe reason those questions are being asked of the reason why the media isn't doing is is because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every day I'm One of these is\nNone of what they were saying about Kevin all of a stir it was all manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the very end as a Hail Mary if balls the Ford were actually telling the truth she would have been one of the first witnesses\nShe would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats sought to get rid of Kavanaugh but they had this little requests from her not Jimmy make bumbling I'm terrified do here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was convenient\nHis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nYour Republicans running for office if you have these debates left you need to start asking the Democrat opponents they still oppose Kevin all don't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kavanaugh or oppose Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win reelection or election\nIf this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up either in campaign and we've got a week it's not to wait to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nNot too late to cut some new ads and re inserted\nPeople need to be reminded let's pretend that some of the momentum was lost and okay we've got plenty of time\nWe got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh who did it what its purpose was and the proof that it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost\nIn their effort to destroy Kevin ... they lost in their attempt to use Kavanaugh to hurt Democrat hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\nHere's another one if the cabinet confirmations circus\nWe're about justice for his alleged victims the women instead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be getting updates on the story when we I mean if it was really the purpose\nAbout getting justice if it was to make sure that these women that were sold in Seoul abused in Seoul raped by Kevin ...\nOn to them than W.
