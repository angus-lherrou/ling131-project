hostility\nI mean there's so many teachable moments of the thing I've read the transcripts it's I Know what I'm discussing I haven't heard of where we are going to listen to these uh together but back to back to focus on us now\nJim Messina the Obama campaign very disappointed that she would try to steal the news cycle this close to the election\nAnd not that he says they have to win the house and Senate to save\nAmerica no they have to win the house and Senate to transform and change America against the will of the American people what the Democrats in the American left and want to do to America is not what most Americans want America to be\n\nThey don't care about that they are willing to for\nWhat they think America should be America's transformation on everybody but\nThankfully they still have to win elections I still maintain that I don't know when but somewhere down the road they are going to realize that winning elections is the lone remaining obstacle to them getting what they want and at some point they're going to suggest that elections are not worth it\nBecause they don't win and\nCome up with some kind of alternative I Know it sounds like a long shot but don't doubt me I Know these people but only a Democrat folks\nWould think about reports from scientists saying\nThat she might be one one thousand twenty fourth\nUnity and would make their claim a minority status valid\nOne one thousand twenty four\nIn the\nElizabeth Warren possibly that that would be point zero nine but that's not even one\nTenth of one percent fault that's how little Indian heritage and Pocahontas has now scientists said that the average European American is zero point eight team percent\nNative Americans zero point one eight she is point zero nine she is last Native American than the average European American is either New York times numbers by the way Elizabeth Warren last\nNative American than the average European American and let's see what else we have here a than it did it that if Mollie Hemingway favorite part of Warren possibly being one one thousand twenty four Native American is\n\n... is that her twenty twenty campaign is rolling it out as if it's not a complete self own how do they think this was a good idea\nI'll tell you how they think it's a good idea they think they're naming Trump wouldn't they think they're embarrassing Trump remember Trump offered to donate a million dollars to focus hottest his favorite charity if she can\nProve that she were Native American so she's come out today and she is according to her doctor and sciences and so far\nShe's established that she is maybe the American and now she's asking Trump to pay off the the the indigenous\nPeople circumcision for America group or whatever it is an indigenous peoples uh circumcision information resource that or some such thing\nAnd if Trump gives Trump's denying that he made the pledge even though we [laughter]\nWhy not denying it like ... or ... you had never had sex with that woman not a single time ever and that's what Clinton was ... I I Do you need to go back and look what I said I did not say that at most Trump owns a oh it was one\n\nOne thousand twenty fourth of one million I run that number he always maybe most of the thousand dollars\nIf he's going to pay a percentage\nOf the million dollars that equals her percentage of Native American that means he just a little over a thousand dollars if he wants to pay let's go to the audio soundbites we have we have Elizabeth Warren herself this morning\nUh let's see this is on her website she released a video in titled Elizabeth Warren's family's story\nIsn't that queen\nElizabeth Warren's family story in one part of the video poker hottest here talks to Stanford University professor of genetics Dr Carlos\nBustamante and here is a portion of their conversation\nDr tomorrow can please\nHundreds genome did fine vibes segment of the Native American ancestry with very high confidence or we believe the rain is less than one\nLike to call my mom a liar what is the fact\nThat we have a Native American ancestry and you're\n\nNeeded for the nation like violence from generation I'm ... I can say whatever he wants to mocking Native Americans or any in order to try to\nGet now I understand why Jim Messina and the rest of the gang of the left are all in a Twitter here because she is making about her on a\nBasically non story I mean this is the election coming up isn't there is a a single vote that has anything to do with her\nShe hasn't even announce for the presidency in fact she said just the opposite she says she's not going to run so given that why is she intruding here I'll tell you she thinks\nLike all the others on the left do they think if they can be the one to destroy Trump if they can be the one to illustrate that whatever they think of Trump is true that they will be heroes heroines are heroes they think they will be loves adored that's\nThere are so Trump focused their so Trump obsessed\nThat it is taking them off of their game again reminder New York times Elizabeth Warren is only possibly one one thousand twenty fourth point zero nine percent Indian the average European American is zero point one of a person that I don't words\nShe is less than half\nAs much Native American is your average European American is\n[noise]\nSo here's Moore this is a again on her website she was released this new video and titled Elizabeth Warren's family's story in another part of this exciting video\nWe have a number of university professors talking

from the same place dug the lake Koch\nPeople's names fascinated me\nDoug lake Koch Harvard law school professor Randy Kennedy a University of Houston law professor John mix and and the University of Pennsylvania law professor Hank Gutman All right and so here they are currently\nHas no bearing on our higher period I was turning the committee that you're if you've been part of the discussion I

they're here is this is kind of funny to see it as new day to day they co host Jon Berman they co host at Allison ... talking about Warren's video which\nShe says shows that she does have high cheekbones because she is Native American\nA scientist or whose name is Carlos ... both my day from Stanford University says she somewhere between one thirty second Native American and won five hundred and twelve Native American interests ways in there somewhere they believe that it's her great great great grandmother was Native American\nGreat great great great grandmother they got the percentage wrong it's double the\nWon five hundred and twelve it's it's one one thousand\nTwenty fourth [noise] anyway\nThis my friends will not be settled until of course we get to the Democratic

I think one of the most effective ways\nOf getting people to think about this\nHow many people have you heard people say this is the most important election in our lives and that's why\nIt's not it's just not the most important election of our lives to thousands sixteen was\nIf Hillary had one in two thousand six that that's what we need to focus that the kinds of stuff we need to ask people to consider what would be happening in America right now and the past two years of Hillary had one\nWho wouldn't be running various cabinet posts and agencies what do we know today that we would not know if Hillary had one\nIncluding names of people and what they've been doing\nIf you have people between the eyes with what would America be today if Hillary had one\nIt's a different way of getting people to focus on the importance\nOf the elections of ... the the drive by us have their formula and it's rooted in the desire they habit everybody hate Trump and so that desire becomes narrative and then that narrative\nBecomes the result of polling data\nAnd says the media so have strong they want everybody else to therefore the trend is pro Democrat in the mid terms in their polling data because people have awaken realize what a mistake they made voted for Trump none of that is true\nExcept on the hard left where it's always been true there is nothing new about it and it's not confined to Trump patronage hatred of everybody that isn't them\nLike I said just based on the last two weeks of the Capitol hearing the Democrat Party\nToday as constant deserves to lose in the biggest landslide in a history of landslides a Democrat Party deserves to get ...\nFor the tactics they have engaged in from the actions taken by their lunatic and paid supporters\nAnd it just outrageous the kinds of things that they are engaging in and then the decent world and in a sand society they wouldn't be punished greatly\nIn the midterms I still hold out hope that they could be my point is we will get to all of this as the day is unfold\nIn this weekend in coming weeks but here we go with Donald Trump and Leslie stall on sixty minutes provide providers that are soundbites work I'm not confident now so the only way to know is to give it a shot the first one is Leslie stall\nTalking to Trump about the supposedly the hostility that he has created between the European Union allies and us\nWell I I mean what's ally we have wonderful relationships with a lot of people but we don't want to teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union on line was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done is hot and yet they it's not hostile sounds hot sauce on the way they treat us\nWe're not how somebody can in daily went in with her in this country for so many years I knew willing to get rid of that\nWestern alliance now I like they don't ...\nBut you know why we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect your and then on top of that they take advantage of us on trade and not going to do that anymore they understand okay\n[noise] so what once again we have here the concept but just so hostile the hostility it sounds so hostile it sounds so mean eight pounds so it sounds so it's this it's confrontational and of course in the eyes of the left we\nWant to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be western\nSocialists they think still functioning at a\nDemocracy but but that's that's what they want us so we shouldn't be forthcoming and tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves and this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nWhich say\nWhat you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in the history combined\nIn the morning and the last thing and I get the news trafficking whether you need from Alexis say electric play ten forty W. H. O. five diehard radio getting news radio ten forty W H in my heart radium\nHave like a minor correction it's a it's a variety in which the effort\nBy Lesley Stahl is ripped to shreds not Vanity Fair it's six one and a half dozen varieties not so much a celebrity focused ran against Vanity Fair is a but they are both left wing entertainment oriented and they do comment on left wing entertainers actors\nActresses TV so called journalist and so forth and and it it's just a little minor correction I get them confused occasionally here is just another sample from last night Trump\nAnd Leslie stall\nIs it you know General Mattis said to you the reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances in St prevent World War three no it's not true my frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you one more time\nOkay I Know unless you're not to try it again [laughter] I Know that how and why has the answer is this\nI Will always be there with NATO but\nThey have to pay their way I'm fully in favor of NATO [noise] but I don't want to be taken advantage of\nWind general manager so I think I Know more about it than he does I Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you\nHe's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way he's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and potent for natural gas shipments\nExplosively into Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice a sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her why she is undermining NATO\nTrump already called her out on it for doing this the Trump supposedly in the pockets of the of the Russians but Trump knows what sixty minutes or less ... trying to do here that's what they don't get\nThey can sneak up on people anymore particularly Trump he knows he in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we've got on the roster coming up probably do\nBut he said something to her that is as as honest and true as anything he's ever said because I Know Donald Trump I've known him a long time I play golf and I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I think he didn't agree\nEspecially when discussions in the media came up\nHe thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerating in some of the things I Would tell him but my opinion is that the media he said to her\nI had no idea and I'm being really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest media is until I ran for president I had no idea I being really serious with you he said\nAnd I I think that's probably true as a New Yorker\nAnd immersed in New York media where he was a star\nWhen he wasn't running for office it was a local New York's by you know he made fun of him and they laugh but but he was a big get he appeared everywhere and they loved him and he was great front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news in the post\nWhen he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about Trump there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved praised coverage but it all vanished when he ran\nAnd he was surprised in a white kind of like McCain was\n\nWhen he said to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked I was really surprised about this on us\nThat's the word he uses instead of biased\nAnd I can tell you that that is true now what else have you learned that he didn't know but he knew before he ran for office and I think\nA lot about the left a lot about Democrats particularly liberal Democrats that he hadn't thought of in ways you an idea but now since he suffered the treatment he fully\nRush Limbaugh is um [noise]\nI'm lucky I feed network\nAlive\nThey folks

Elizabeth Warren is resurrecting the one drop rule or an antebellum a a rule created by a southern plantation owners Democrats say if you have one drop\nBlood was black you're black or this was this was a grotesque cruel her her percentage is so small\nThey don't have to excuse me second hasn't really been a de opted by civil rights activists now that that that if if you have one drop your going to be called black\nWhat that's exactly right intersection analogy requires quantification yeah\nAnd so when we need to know how much of a percentage of pressure you are versus oppressed\nThis ... this this rulers is grotesque widely discredited used by the KKK in the thirties use can Nazi Germany it against the Jews\nHere she comes again this is actually a dog whistle to her face it's not meant for Republicans not meant for conservatives is about her future run she needs to tell her base I'm On board with intersection analogy look how much of an oppressed ram and let's find out your percentage of a pressure to\nWould you define the intersection out of it is a relatively new leftist activists\nConcept that I find that most people to whom I mentioned that have no idea what it is how would you define that\nLet glad to thanks for the opportunity to\nDo so much more than walk and that's why I'm a good host I've I have ever that no one little thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that look a intersection out it comes straight out of Marxism Marx said that at every one is either on a presser or oppressed they're either bourgeois or proliferated\nAt its later it's now being adopted the idea of being able to declare percentages of what you are how oppressed and how much of a pressure you are it's called intersection nowadays because instead of just being one camp or the other\nIt spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay that's it intersection Natalie for me\nGreat on wash your you're talking you're you're\nIn language of ah people formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful um yes any intersection out I mean actually has basically something that has been constructed by these marches\nJust saying that all of these different leftist organizations Meek somewhere they all intersect with each other the feminist having this strain about them that that that uh\nCohabitation it's with that with militant I'm a Islamic feasts that then with illegal immigrants and their activists and we're all of these people intersect is where they unified\nWell yes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those and they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this and there was a recent white privilege stuff pops up some absolutely\nSo now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ... has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now or the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that she is an old press she's asked them anyway she's a woman therefore she's impressed by the patriarchy and now as a one thousand twenty fourth Indian she is oppressed by the white man\nWhich is a a again a resurrection of the one drop rule this percentage is so low as to be a joke you know I if I could say you know I took a DNA test about four years ago and of course you don't normally you'd never see me but believe me I'm whites\nHowever when I discovered was zero point eight percent sub Saharan Africa\nWell that doesn't mean I'm going to Harvard and going to claim a professorship in African American studies but I have what is that almost eight times more a sub Saharan African black heritage and me and she does Native American just\nPray just admitted sub Saharan is not automatically quote unquote black\nWell that that's right in in this instance because we've identified the ancestor for the Afrikaners are not black uh I well I I I understand what you're saying I Am referring to blacks than okay All right\nI just want to best because a sub Saharan this is somebody what ... what is it what it was it and then you start talking to the sub continent than some people really get confused you're coming from from India or over to sub Saharan Africa is below the arid desert a which is where most of the population of Africa is most of it\nThere is some north of this arid desert as well now I get I I I get your point a and her reason for doing this all of that not withstanding\nThe accuracy of it not withstanding the left is pretty upset that she chose this particular time to do this because they think it is totally self serving it does not do anything but distract\nFrom the mid term elections which are three weeks from tomorrow
