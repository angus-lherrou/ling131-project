know and yeah good afternoon I think so I mean you know it's all about the Africans wind a very it's all about it's not under control a as of yet and still trying to figure out how widespread it kind of a\nUm ... limit up on the February ... dog well certainly with the uncertainty ah we've been going up and down that this is a place that you do some catch up risk management of course diseases the great equalizer but you have to be careful that demand doesn't kick over to the U.S and uh\nRight now we still have a sixty two percent tariff on Chinese pork\nWell and that's something to keep in mind too with um even Canada and Mexico the agreement is you know been decided in principle but the tariffs remain there until it actually ratified\nYeah exactly and you know I think that's one of the reasons that you look at risk management you know you just change the tools that you have to use\nA for example in ... window contract maybe because it is an uncertain environment you know the supplies are cute there's no doubt about it and the meat complex that demand has been equally a huge and the domestic market the export market you know is is if you hear so far on the pork so\nAre there some uncertainties and that means risk management\nOr corn and bean wise dime a what do we do with the maybe some extra bushels if the storage becomes an issue\nWell if you don't really want to participate in and the story bill\nUm you know and that's a question mark because you have it carries in the market white faces historically white faces so you know the only way you can get a basic improvement is to have the case\nBut if you're selling the case because of all these other issues you don't like story and dry down go in and look at some really ownership with them call call window contract in March on the up front months because of the big carry in the market\nThat sounds like really complicated as it is it is it that way or is it just something that's different\nNo I think what it is is a you know you spend in than something like that or an opportunity for thirty cents at the applied\nAnd you know the wording sometimes it's complicated but I think they implicate a ...

H. O. radio\nAs though anybody had to be told but I just I I Want to join everybody here uh uh people stature all over America\nAre issuing statements today condemning the use of bombs for any purpose whatsoever and we here at the E R B network heartily\nAnd energetically endorsed the premise that we oppose bombs for any purpose whatsoever [noise] ah in domestic politics or what have you on time we support bombs is during warfare\nA declared hostilities warfare but bombs in politics or caravan Joel we hardly\nWe hardly condemn this dastardly action\nAnd what isn't no way encourage it or support so just to have it on the record that's my official statement yesterday released this in writing\nTo um [noise]\nGet it to make sure that we here at the number are included in the list of people will condemn 'cause I don't want to be\nOn the list of people who support or are there any is there a list of people's support moms that that is going out there yeah I think the list is only people who condemn them right uh we want to make sure we are on their ... that list we don't want there to be any doubt [noise]\nThat we condemn the mom okay so suspicious packages slash bombs that did not go off have been censored Democrats before the mid term elections is it real or is it a political set\nUp is it a political stunt and if it is who's behind if it's a political stunt who's behind it and for what purpose I've seen some people today who think the Republicans are behind this to try to scare Democrats away from going to the polls\nThat's a new one on me that just doesn't compute that that's not the kind of thing Republicans do\nIn fact you remember when Steve ... got shot by a deranged Democrat at congressional baseball practice you know what our side said\nWe did not make a political the Republicans in Congress said this speaks to all of us we join everybody in condemning this the Republicans did not attempt to make that part is in any way or to try to make hay out of it I'm not kidding go back and look at it if you've forgotten is\nThe Republicans did not make a point of singling out the guy as a Democrat and condemning the Democrats are this actually said that this is about all of us\nRepublicans just don't have a behavioral history\nLife is so it's a political stunts who is behind it and for what purpose\nWhile the cabinet thing was a set up but it looked real for a while the Kevin was saying was a set up from the get go we of course here at the E R B network knew that\nAbout a lot of people thought it was real on ... it was exposed as a fraud the Democrats couldn't covered their bases long enough\nTo what to pull that off Hillary Clinton rumored to run for president just before her certain them to be poor my intended national tour with her husband\nWe have a massive land force invasion heading toward our southern border meant for a confrontation just before election day\nWhat if there are leaks from Mueller about his report before the elections political stunts or not [noise] would Mahler in the media really do that look\nWhat happened to the FBI in two thousand sixteen they tried to fix it election for a Democrat they tried to screw a Republican out of the election and to me these are all things don't we know and it wasn't just a handful of rogue FBI agents involved it was the top tier leadership\n\nThe one thing that we know to be true that Democrats are pulling out all the stops they see this election as their last best chance to take down Trump and his agenda\n\nIt's October [noise] another way of looking at this\nFor the last few weeks the Democrats have had all of that horrible PR\nAll of these angry mobs\nAnd I don't care what anybody thinks those angry moms are not good for the Democratic party those angry mobs are not going to stop turnout those angry mobs are not sending a signal joined us\nMuch as the media would like to portray about her was and much of the Democrats would like to portray otherwise the people of this country do not want to spend all day and all night every day enraged and angry\nThat's not what life is to most people and they don't want it to be that but that's what life is for your average Democrat today enraged angry upset certainly unhappy\nNot content\nAnd they were hoping to win elections based on that there hasn't been a single that I've heard a single statement of condemnation for any of these acts\nCommitted against Republicans by Democrats mobs people who have been caught on tape threatening Republicans' in restaurants\nPeople who have been caught on tape for rent and Republicans at airports\nRepublican offices that had been vandalized rocks thrown for windows Kevin McCarthy the most recent angry mobs sending packages that claimed to be ... rice and to a Republican Senator Susan Collins at her house\nWe have seen these angry mobs in the halls of the Senate during the capital hearings we have seen these angry bombs at political rallies we have seen these angry mobs come from\nPeople in public in restaurants doesn't matter where and they have all been\nDemocrats angry mobs and there has not been a single condemnation from any Democrat like everybody today is condemning these bombs there hasn't been a single condemnation by any Democrat for these mob actions taking place\nThat have been going on since even before that Kavanaugh hearings\nReally focused and got synthesized when it began to appear that Kavanaugh was gonna make it and at this balls the foreign tactic was going to fall apart the mobs went nuts approaching Jeff Flake in\nThe elevator approaching Republicans in the halls Lindsey Graham is ... ... we saw that\n\nThis cannot be good these angry mobs I don't care what Democrats think they can now see it isn't working the Republicans are pulling ahead in the Senate and when we get into the discussion of the latest\nRegarding mid term elections as the program unfold today I've got a couple of pieces today from people who think that not only if they're not going to be a blue wave that if there were it would be cresting right now and it is and\nI got a couple of people been analyzing things who think that there could very well\nBe a red wave not just in the Senate but in the house the point is the mob actions that have been sponsored by ... undertaken by Democrats and their activists again have not been condemned and they haven't worked\n\nTheir purpose they're mob purpose was to engender author anger at Republicans and therefore in gender angry democratic turnout but look\nRepublican turnout in early voting is dwarfing the Democrats in some places it isn't even close and it's a hundred and eighty degrees out of phase\nNothing like what the political experts and scientists told us what happened in an off year election this was going to be the Democrats election never going to show up in droves energized\nThey were going to be so excited they were going to be so motivated Republican early voting is dwarfing there's nothing out there other than Nate Silver and a couple of our polling units that suggest\nA blue wave and what kind of blue wave going to be if it doesn't include the Senate\nIf some people now that things are Republicans might end up uh fifty seven fifty eight seats in the Senate it's all a toss up I mean nobody really knows right now but the point is that conventional wisdom is not settled on what the Democrats always thought it would have been telling us it would be and that is Republican massive landslide defeat\nThat does it look to be in the car so if you're a Democrat operative\n[noise] and the mob tactics\nHaven't worked\nFact if you're a reasonable Democrat operative and you're looking at this objectively you might be including this mob action could be\nHer seeing it could be really firing up Republican turnout as in the post Kavanaugh period there is a cabinet affected it's going one way pro Republican documented\nThis our

Democrats [noise] an end to Hillary Clinton Philippe Reines\nSaid Mr Trump this is on this guy ranges is [noise] I mean [noise]\nThe elevator doesn't go to the top floor [noise] like to say is an order of fries short of a Happy Meal\nWhy would someone smart enough to make a functioning mailed mom's actually believe they would be open to buy the Clinton or Obama or George Soros\nAnd ... and and so close to win the election what kind of food do something like this\n\nIf a smart bomb maker [laughter]\nIf somebody really really good at making bombs hates the left this much\nDoes he think this is going to help Republicans in the mid term elections this doesn't pass the smell test\n[noise]\nUm I actually think and all candor to what's going on barring a the revelation of what really this is about if we ever learn mad I think I'll just put it this way if you're a Democrat operative\nAnd you've watched everything blow up on you you watch Kavanaugh blow up you have watched um the effort to harass and bullied Jeff Flake and Susan Collins blow up on you if all of these mobs of people crashing Republicans in airports in at restaurants at all that's blowing up on you\nAnd it is by the way it's not working what could have been the objective of that stuff what could be the objective of having a bunch of public mobs storm restaurants and harass\nAnd threaten and bully Republicans what couldn't you'll be trying to ... what would be the Democrat objective there and I can tell you there's only one thing that really makes any sense to show so much hatred for Trump to try to overwhelm the system with so much apparent hatred for Trump and Republicans\nThat other people joined up other people decide they've got to join up and vote against Republicans to other words the politics of hate and anger and the attempt just brandy hate and anger because the Democrats have nothing else on which to run all they've got\nIs we hate Trump Trump socks Trump's dangerous Trump's an embarrassment that's all they've got and so if none of that work if all of that backfired and bullied me and has\nEspecially the Kavanaugh stuff that has blown up in their ... bad choice of words that has backfired on them like you can not believe\n[noise] so what would you do\nYou might want to do something to make it look like the insane lunatics are not just on your side you might want to do something to make it look likely in saying lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact of lunacy\nOn your side as average American voters perceive it\nOkay let's get some of the election analysis the midterms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives\nA political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics that was among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there and do something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so Tom them and cofounder of this place was on ah the Fox\nBusiness Network today he said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point Mimi it'd be building ... we'd be seeing the top\nOf it here and Tom ... all the polling data that they have it real clear politics and analyzing it's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave\nIf a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the Democrats\nAre not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage that ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way and that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of seven day competitive races\nAnd the range of pick up as they look at polling data now is anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number earning above that Democrats have an advantage in the house the range of the pickup according to polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project a pick up a twenty five states twenty five an absolute two and a half seats more than they need but with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house [noise]\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and it went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave there isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising and all of her on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans and gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past week cause of Trump neutralizing much of it\n[noise]\nAnd Trump is the great unknown as these rallies continue now another retired historian\nAnd political analyst sent an email\nThat I received a lawsuit but I've been able to have it there was just this morning and I'm going to identify who this is doesn't matter I don't know you've heard of them but I just want to share with just some of the things I get some of the is by the way it legitimate some of it is obviously tried influenced me\nA into promoting whatever it is that says I have to be very very careful about I'm just I'm I'm gonna relate this to you this passionately\nThis guy who is it a story and who has studied\nAmerican politics and congressional races along the lines of of Michael Barone\nJust not as well known as he looks things\nHe usually is an absolute red wave and he did not believe this until last night he's been seeing trends the past two weeks but he has been reluctant to convert into these trends are there with actual prediction until now\nI'm Dave sprout up all your

question seriously [noise]\nMany Republicans right now in the midst of this political campaigns on a\nTwo thousand sixteen midterms how many how many Republicans [noise] because they have the Clintons or Obama on their radar [noise]\n\nNo no I mean how are the are the Clintons an obstacle to the upcoming mid terms of the ... no ... is Obama an obstacle in the no I mean what the Clintons and Obama are not even on the radar except they are today\nI mean the Clintons announced yet this at Clinton's announced this nationwide Katie I'm sure\nThird team locations stadium tour they're gonna charge admission for people that come in and spend some time listening to bill and Hillary reminisce and talk about politics what\nWhat if there isn't a whole lot of interest in math [noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet\nBuying tickets\nI don't know that they're on sale with every venue yet but I mean the Clinton sucked on anybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state and Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft Trump on his phone in collusion story to lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now and Obama certainly is and\nI don't know I ... and and now with so many leftist tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much change in so much anger the wife and a mirror here's not sick I just it's just to pet it it's just\nIt's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what\nIn form ... and a educated suspicion about this would tell you that it is a we'll see we'll let time on\nThe phone here in the meantime we go back to the phones Andrew in Cleveland it's great to have you with us or hello\nHey Russia or if there was a kid a riding around in the car with my father it's a pleasure speaking\nWell thank you I appreciate that you very much\nRussia you know it's you're talking about this passing the smell test I'm I'm sure the drive by spin on this will be that uh we have a dangerous dreams right we're out here putting\nThese bombs in the mail you know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be on by the media where do they go about getting the mailing address is George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYou know that that information out there for the masses to obtain you know there was never any attempt for these devices to make their way through their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right or a to point fingers at certain D. but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen wanted for them to be discovered the\nDemocrats they've proven time and time again there's simply no load that they want to do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and muggy video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do\nSomething to do is tell\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it\nThat way it doesn't make any sense\nFor a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\n\nThis is gonna be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip that\nFlip that around what does it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or a Democrat\nIn cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I've spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have a short us\nFor the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the pollsters tell them there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are back firing they are not achieving their objectives\n[noise] so if you flipped this around and you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the sweet here it's really strange ah ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously a set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then lose [noise]\nNegative does Russia a truly an honor to speak with you so well I was holding for you a couple of things popped in my head and I'll get to the point two seconds\nThese are all deep state leaders that these quote unquote bombs are going to Hillary and and you know and and Cuomo and all these guys and then Brennan the deep state\nAnd this is right out of the play the Clinton playbook if you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts folks started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOr yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to tell about Hillary\n... yeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nOr tell people what it was ... ... cars I stepped on it tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the ... um there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight\nWith signs saying iron my shirts or you're in my shirt of course because of you know can't have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nRight and we'll watch or we're going to do Hillary and be a domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts didn't fix dinner and get my slippers that kind of thing right\nYeah it was a point it was a plant in it and it was all it was all nonsense to garner apathy and\n... it was already planning to go to waste their was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing that\nRight correct that's another time telling you I gave them the idea but anyway I don't want to step on keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle milk and came up with a good teeth and basically quit it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan\nAnd it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons a great professor called the ... rush she taught me one time with the ... there are no coincidences and there are no\nAh you there's nothing that's set in stone with these people not everything is manufactured everything is made off\nAnd so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami\nFor someone who was quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was taking her time walking down the stairs or somebody who's open the door for her while she's being shouted that I Believe that's a set up I don't want to sound like can conspiracy theorist here but take a look at it it's a bunch of nonsense\nAnd I don't trust the Democrats never have never let a good conspiracy theory go the way I could never let a good crisis\nGo exactly rush no you're you're you're right about the Clintons there are no coincidence is with them\nThis is a this is a philosophy\nThat I have a stone for four years on this program asking people to never forget there are no coincidence and ... and the fact you know you say that Israel deep state players a Soros bill and Hillary a Obama and so forth\nUm if it is curious they're they're they're not even on the radar in in the mid term when you get down to it other than they're trying to get themselves on the radar but see that's I think they're trying to get noticed the Clintons desperately\nNeed to be noticed all the time and Obama is trying to recapture some Gloria trying to show everybody he can still move the needle isn't working now the reason I think I'm responsible for the\nWhat was it iron my shirt I used to the rush to excellent store open up you know some funny jokes line stories and so forth and I would tell people that I just met Mrs Clinton a week before\nAnd it was the strangest strangest thing and we ended up in an elevator together and just the two of us she says you know I could never say this outside this elevator but I\nI have for everything you've done to my family I Can't help but I find you the most compelling\nMost interesting guy that I haven't run across I wanted to meet you for I don't know how

Mr Limbaugh has been type I Need to feel like a woman I haven't been made to feel like you know why I'm not I'm Sorry I understand [noise] could you make me feel like a woman well here in the elevator\nAnd I said I can give it a shot take off your clothes\nSo she began to just robe and not quite on the way where she got I said okay now falls on\nThe left doesn't want you to hear rush from the beams or\nIf you suffer from E.

Dave proudly wage already a news our top story a suspicious package found in Washington DC has a Southern California lawmakers out at NBC News is reporting wanted ... founded\nWhich had been made a major issue by his Republican rival Ron dissent\n... campaign has maintained and continue to do so yesterday after the records were released the Gillum brother Marcus handed him the ticket the night of the show but text messages at the time of the trip show that\nGillum was told the tickets came from Mike Miller\nFBI ... looking in the city corruption who was posing as a developer they've been looking into ... Andrew Gillum corruption as mayor of Tallahassee for years\nAnd there were a lot of Democrats are very worried that this was going to come out if he did indeed win the primary fights\nBecome a democratic nominee which has happened the dissenters campaign pounds to see Republicans always pounds in the media Republicans towns Democrats David but Republicans ... ...\nIt's now abundantly clear goes to the Santa statement that the Andrew Gillum\nHas repeatedly lied about taking free gift and trips from lobbyists to feel lie about these gifts and trips in lobbyists on national TV what else\nIs he lying about once a close friend of ... this Corey Feldman is at the center of the FBI's long running investigation into corruption in Tallahassee\nNo one's been charged with anything and Gillum has said that agents assured him he was neither a target and or a focus of the probe just like call me told Trump\nGillum has repeatedly given vague answers to questions about who paid for the New York city trip his avoidance of a direct answer became pronounce during Sunday debate on CNN with the census and Gail I'm just saying this essay multiple you pay for the Hamilton take it's not\nA lot of people want is a big deal okay a trip to New York Hamilton tickets big\nGuy won't tell the truth about it is the big ... up\nBut I think this is chump change compared to what's really at stake here I I think it chump change was wrong thing to say because it is a window into he'll Gillum is and he is somebody that wants to parlay his positions of power\nInto positive influential goodies for himself\nHe is a classic a politician in that regard who believes the holding high office equals an entitlement to perks and er and other things is willingly a desirous of seeking them\nAnd it's a [noise]\nIn in this in this era where everybody feels the need to denounce the special interests and not being beholden to them a Gillum can't make that statement now let's look at the polling data Quinnipiac University poll yesterday\nShowed that Andrew Gillum is ahead of just ... fifty two to forty six among the light ... voters and he has a double digit lead among women Hispanics and independence\nAnd it's the third such poll in about a week ten days to show Gillum with this clear to lead as is overall edge in public polling why didn't do its largest level since October first [noise]\nOkay so Gillum is a character he is a person with cloud of suspicion\nThat are hanging all over him in addition to that he is a hard left wing activist tack who refers to Florida as his collecting he looks things in the white communists and Marxist do\nHe does not believe in the power of the individual because that leads the inequality an unfairness\n\nHe wants everybody to get free health care here and free medical care over their Medicare for all he believes in a guaranteed national income these these kinds of things that\nIf ever implemented would bring to a screeching halt in Florida everything that's happening nationwide that is building the economy\nBut who is this ... this you know a lot of people may not know much about Ron's Santa's so let me step in here and tell\nThose of you in this vast and wide audience in Florida who he is ...\nAnd Harvard graduate who was a decorated jag officer in the navy judge advocate general\nHe has a solid record of winning achievements as a representative from Florida he has resigned his house seat\nIn order to devote all of his time exclusively to his campaign has got a great family is wife uh is is all in for this got the young kid is just the\n[laughter] the epitome of a decent solid American citizen who has achieved tremendous great things\nNow on TV I think it was this morning he was on on Fox\nAnd he very calmly and very simply outlined a pattern or corruption by Andrew Gillum he pointed out the FBI as had yellow monitor radar for years as they said an undercover agents to catch him for breaking all kinds of laws and accepting bribes in return for development deals pay to play so to speak\n\n... graduated from college was given awards by socialist organizations which propelled him of the young age to get elected to the city commission in Tallahassee then he became mayor for three years he's been under some kind of cloud or investigation ever since\nHe wants to Florida to be a sanctuary state\nHe wants to Florida to be open borders for any and all illegal immigrants he ends the classic American socialist to believes America is the problem in the world and the poverty in Central America and the southern hemisphere is our fault\nBecause we have all been stolen too many and too much of the world's resources and we imported at all and we have denied it to our neighbors\nWe have stolen America from the Native Americans and so forth there's nothing decent about the American founding the constitution is all out David now and the guy is a classic throwback she is\nA walking talking Iraq Hussein Obama on steroids if that's even possible\n\nAny if you compare the current crop of Democrats can get Andrew Gillum is not unusual among the dead the Democrats are putting people like him up all over this country\nAnd in many places they're finding the blame you heard what's happening to Heidi Heitkamp did you hear what she did\nShe just [noise] I'll tell you in a minute as time unfolds here she is down third teams in her Senate race she voted against Kavanaugh\nAnd then thought she'd be able to recover some Republicans that got mad at her but she has blown that sky high she's\nJust missed judge things terribly details are coming up I don't want to get through sidetracked here the point is\nThat the Democrats are nominating quasar eyes socialists\nAnd and and people have problems with America all over this country people think America is flawed that there is no such thing as American exceptionalism or greatness and people think that our our unfairly biased and
