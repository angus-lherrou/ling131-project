you have your numbers ready I\nWonder what's going on in the marketplace I Want to hear these\nYou'll find out what sold what's coming up you know what we can expect because I Know you have your crystal ball would you do I do he didn't bring it right I did okay good good then the other folks from absolute insurance will be any or do they do I got a couple insurance questions when I talked to Chris saying announce them again not the biggest news out when it comes to a world of finance Dominic\nA stupid we hit five percent are we there we were there back down and\nYou can think the stock market and some of the numbers are coming in um in regards to earnings from the third quarter so we sell rates drop in the stock market drop and so that's been a good thing were still\nUp a little bit from where we've been in the past for for ... some fire as low as four point seven five hundred thirty year on Fifteen or as a four point three seven five\nYou see more people going conventional right now uh yeah ... absolutely a benefit there is there a benefit a well a couple of benefits are going conventional it'd be a lower mortgage insurance um rate wise I Can't say it's going to be lower it might be exactly we're effigy rates are however\nGo look at it also the forever ha lower credit score it's way more attractive product and the conventional loan and you can do three percent unconventional Mitchell three percent were up at chase three and a half ass yeah in a down payment or assistance programs out there with the iPhone which we do a lot of loans and we've had them in here before but yeah the ... great products out there to be used\nStill out of them still just that one way to avoid the mortgage they are well yeah well there's a couple of ways mortgage insurance you can actually there's buyer paid mortgage insurance premiums are there if I don't have a twenty percent to put down how could I avoid\nUm well let's let's just say what they hire credit score and let's say a three percent down you know we would want to look at a what they call a buyer a bar where a paid mortgage insurance option which means you\nKnow including ... and then you pay the full premium up front Jim most of the ... so yeah against a higher rate but your payments or less and that's one thing we really have to drill the people's heads is it just look at your payment not so much the rate gotcha um but for those have a lower credit score\nWe look at the monthly mortgage insurance can because it's it's more attractive for doing a lot of investment lumps oh we were doing a ton of investment loans right now believe it or not but you do more now than usual it absolutely is and why is that he was a good question for you because I look and say you would think those\nInvestment properties are these flips would be going up middle right yeah it's a white male and there's a little harder to come by\nWhich I'm I'm assuming so at the number buyers I've seen that there lately so it's a question for you guys why are we getting so many of these so somebody want to get into the market thing I get people all the time you might\nNot back me up on this list is oh I Want to be a an investor I Want to do I want to flip homes because it looks so easy they do it they do it on TV and they make it look so easy it's not real life he's thirty now but the financing it's available the finance available yeah we ... we do have one investor it will go eighty five percent\nOr so Fifteen Percent down on investment property you got to do in your mortgage insurance can you do without Fifteen Percent\nUm you know that the lowest lowest we have I don't know if anybody else out there has higher\nI Would like go less day I should say um but the majority of people as there are twenty percent down a twenty five percent now gives you a probably a quarter of three to veteran rate oh there you go if you put extra five percent down so there's a lot of options out there just again call\nHow many ... are we still have all now we have a hundred percent eighty twenty along in internal unity and more of those I I did now it'd be popping up a little bit more not seen as many were still we once we start running numbers for people\nIt's still better do it three percent down option even going again I'm going to tell I\nWould go Iowa fans at thirty there no am Irish sharing with the twenty five hundred dollar downpayment assistance you're getting close to a hundred percent depending on your ... do you tell the first time homebuyers that hey if they do qualify look there's a chance you get\nTwenty five hundred dollars we run the numbers yeah we'll run the numbers and we do it quite often is that rate changed your right to know that the fixed rate but yes they do their race do fluctuate they just don't fluctuate daily as ours would there are a little different than the way you can find a link and savings bank during the front page\nOf a moving Iowa dot com and I'm I'm just kind of curious and how many listings I may have and moving I when I Am I'm waiting that's why I'm hearing a less will know that when we ask hoping so there's\nLots of options has a lot of options in the world of finance yeah you have an inhouse programs that the\n... program we're talking about the hunter pronounce program which what people say why do you have a hundred percent well when there's F ha or I'm Sorry there's BA that's a hundred percent there's USDA's a hundred percent but\nThere if you don't have the ability you can't use that obviously I'm a USDA had income restriction and location\nRestriction so you can't buy within the city of Des Moines ... using us they do have a map that's available to you again look ahead the website you change a lot of notice is communities continued to groom they keep extending their uh ineligible area so you know right now car while it's still eligible and you know still eligible but\nFor those people who don't start in those eligible area than a hundred percent financing we have a hundred percent product available ... that that bill who gets one hundred percent finance oh it's great for people who need it and in it\nYou have to have a good to have a seven twenty credit score German and that's why we're not looking for six forty is is that can happen but those\nPeople just save up a little money I that's why I called ... what's the best way to reach us or you can reach me at five one five three to seven nine nine to zero All right so a Halloween is right around the corner\nYes governor Idaho It's Wednesday napkins was\nJust a few days till we shouldn't be scared of the rates just yet and yet to watch the stock market watch all these uh earnings for the companies coming out so you'd be surprised if it was six percent by this time next year I'd be very surprised that fat yeah going up fast yeah that that that I think that would be really bad hair over a point and\nLook what primes doing right now how they keep increasing the primary so that causes the till the money that these companies are are borrowing the cost of that going up so at what point they're going to say okay we can't borrow any job issues it's a big trickled down thing and so on the job hurts rate dropped the ball there we go\nHave you heard of anybody saying well I'm going to put my house buying in the back burner just because the rates of trickled up a little bit I'm just going to weigh the what they do have not heard that but I have heard a lot\nMore people remodeling rather than a buying a new home are selling\nWe never encourage that sale never vote on who want to do that\nI think it was remodeling way limited made less than I thought that was house yeah yeah All right so Dominic again you guys on
