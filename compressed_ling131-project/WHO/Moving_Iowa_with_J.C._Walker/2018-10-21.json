Joe [noise]\nAnd he's on hiatus a Dominic Black I think he's on hiatus do\nIn the you know I'm I'm not really lonely today thank you Don Fergus and appreciate that hey thanks for inviting me Don practicing from vibe or consulting he's ah in the house today I thought you know what\nIf they didn't talk to myself for half an hour I could have some folks joined me and we got things going on things are happening in the world a real estate and if you do that or not then you don't do work as much in the world of real estate you do some things but you know there's four thousand homes on the market finally while taking long enough to get there hasn't it's taken a while I mean\nGoodness when we hit that recession back there in two thousand and eight and they messed with the rates in a little bit and\nYou know things started selling and when we got down to under three thousand homes on the market and all this crazy now we're up to four I remember when there was like six or seven when I got into the business Fifteen Years ago and uh you know what forty percent of that is new construction\nWow we're the building oh over the darn place yeah the place that matters the most is Norwalk though okay door with a great schools and stuff right all they got phenomenal schools you know we got a lot of great schools around here in the metro but I only say that because I have some stuff down there in Norwalk okay new construction you're thinking about building a home now to get done\nOn the ever have a bad time I don't know if you heard about the rates this past week or they're still inching up five percent Don\nI remember my first loan Jaycee was twelve percent we thought that was really good now\nWill be a loan so let's talk about that so this is probably eighties I'm guessing yup okay\nAnd you thought what then that was like a good deal that was awesome deal now you get these kids that are worrying about five percent do you think they're spoiled or they're totally spoiled they are a little spoiled yep five percent still a great right sure is it's a phenomenal right\nAnd I was going to continue to go up it sounds like they might that's what I've heard that still talking about raising the rates a little bit more you know the key interest rate which um I guess they can do that if they want to\nWell it's still a good ... when I bought my first house ... percent five percent I think the five percent any day yeah no kidding and egg and five is\nAh there's definitely nothing wrong with that and so the big question is what's it going to do to the the mentality of the first time by or are they going to be more motivated to get out there and buy a home before they go with the higher I Will they put them off a little bit going you know maybe I'll just sit back and watch and see what happens I think\nPersonally rents are going up rent yeah I think that you can still buy a house a lot of houses cheaper than you could own I mean they they you can rent I absolutely\nKnow there's so many rent rental properties going up to ... they still slow down with that either another don't and it's of 'em are starting to Fifteen hundred two thousand dollars you could end up when you really see what you need a really nice house for that ... a really nice house for that\nEven at five percent at five percent there you go and you know Dominic was here we'd probably tell you about all the different loan programs that they have over at the Lincoln savings bank you've been by Lincoln savings bank or have they make the best little a specialist they give out\nI wait a minute I've been working with Don are not Don but er Dominic on this radio show for them to I've never got a bachelor of a special thing you know it may oh man that's awesome how does that happen you know the right people\nAre going to get right down spatula yeah it was so great about these bachelor's well it's like you know when you're making cookies or whatever pending could relate to this um you just swipe your do right on out of there at very chocolate or whatever you know I don't know why I'm Upset now but I'm going to ask about them do I think you've been left out I think I have many ways I lean savings bank they're what they're up to the university\nIn a ... big Ole building they do everything there and I think they're going to work on a drive\nThrough closings oh get out here when you buy what you mean by drive through closing well you know they got to drive through there right well okay they're not working on it it was my suggestion oh okay okay 'cause you know any more the ... the closings for real is it that goes so quickly they do something 'cause everybody's and read everything\nYou've ever been in one of those closing for somebody actually read every little word every little where I get up go well done you know they're going so fast the more things are changing I thought you know let's just do a drive through closing everybody stays in their car pool right up\nI Would I Would you be surprised that it came to that no not at all I I imagine one of these days is going to be a phone closing where you just pressure phone your your finger on your phone and oh yeah that will be your signature there'll be an app yeah we didn't work on that'd be awesome an app for closing I really liked that idea anyways but I Know Dominic Dunn\nI'm guessing he's working or doing something today\nWell it's nice day you know what we've been having so much rain and cloudy sunshine and went oh no no I don't think I Know\nIt personally it's helped me out a lot I've been spending a little bit more time in the yard as of late ... when I started doing as a hobby no metal detecting what yeah and that poison ivy as just started to clear up [laughter] you should see me last week I was dancing around here because I had so much poison ivy on me\nBut since it you know we got down to the freezing mark earlier in the week it all died off okay but uh I've been finding some old old stuff in my yard was the coolest thing you've found so far are so far I'm finding a lot of tools from the Eighteen hundreds a lot of horse shoes\nSo I'm just trying to figure out why I Am finding I mean it's just tons and tons of metal in my yard ... so I don't know if it's like a a a dumping ground for back in the day there used to be able to remain because my friend Chinese if he's argued and with me on this one\nAnd I and my theory is that it was a dump spot because all the melt tools and stuff that I'm finding are broken okay the metals broken half whatever it may be and my thing is I I'm assuming they would have to put that stuff that we are because they couldn't burning right right\nHis theory as they would never do that with metal because it was so valuable back then it was such a a commodity a necessity that they would take it to a blacksmith to have it melt down again right though he doesn't believe that they would just toss it out so I Am trying to figure out why I have so much of this stuff\nWell you know this area's big for coal mines which I didn't know until I moved here oh you didn't know had no clue especially a walkie they had the typical money museums you know that I yeah I didn't hear that it's pretty cool actually I knew a coal miner daughter one time oh did you I did okay I did anyways going back to the uh the metal detector thing so I did the research\nOn my home and my property ... and I went back or all the way to where the state of Iowa sold the ground that I live on an Eighteen fifty two\nBefore he got ... to a gentleman by the name of Cyrus gate Cyrus gates came from Ohio if on the news articles everything and it says in his article he brought with him all of his woodworking tools\nSo now a majority of the things I find about six or seven inches under my want our woodworking tools that crazy so I just have been trying to ...\nI just want the proof ... you know I mean I don't I don't know back in the day they used to put an initial ... initials on a lot of stuff that I don't know if they would do that on a tool of some sort\nSo if I could find Cyrus is initials CGI\nOn one of those tools I think that would make me happy what would you do you frame it then no I wouldn't frame it\nI don't think I Would frame it was pretty cool so I and I'm finding stuff every time I go out I don't get how often at all but I usually find one significant peace and I think if I keep looking I even got a new metal detector the other day I don't quite understand it it goes crazy\nI think I have so much metal in my yard might detector you it's hard to use that makes sense\nWhat can I ask you this and I didn't know you were in the middle of the ... I was in a moment ago what got you into this because I found something that my I found a horseshoe okay a old old horse you that uh I dated did some research it's definitely for like Eighteen Seventeen Eighteen eighties [laughter] there's one or how much other stuff is here\nGot the metal detector and boom it just went off like crazy there's so many things that\nI Need to probably dig up in my yard but I don't know you just taken the lead on taking a beating I'll tell you that you never know what you're fine if you never it's funny I talked about this before and there's metal detecting clubs around here they listen\nOh wow yeah got an invitation to be part of the club so maybe I'll meet up with those guys I'm sure they know a lot more about it than I Do because there is definitely a learning curve to it I bet definitely a learning curve but anyway for a little bit more and you want to know about me but you guys get a chance moving Iowa dot com still they're done\nIt's a good site do learn people come to a donor they do they um what here's what are your it very user friendly it is in this day and age people love user\nFriendly we got all kinds of information on there that anybody can use you don't have to go from site to site to find all those things that are available you wanna find all four thousand they're right there mhm and moving Iowa dot com it'll even save your criteria for you it'll ask if you'd like to be um included on a", "city": "Des Moines"}
