GDP doing so well it's a ... in the markets like we've talked about for the deal with the supposed to do that that's what happens when the economy to really good it's when the economy economy doing well this is what happens at rates\nYou remember what happened in nine that we rate started dropping it's when they really don't know we really want to go back to that no one will be handed a four
