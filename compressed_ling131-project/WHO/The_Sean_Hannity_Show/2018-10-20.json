I'm telling you I Am the people are Texas are not going to put up with this\nI Know the people of Texas they're not you know you have what I think they start early voting on Monday in Texas\nUm so that's coming to to a head I mean barring a disaster I mean it only is is it's like the winds me of Obama in the sense that he's cool oh beta or Rourke\nIt's it it is they out side Texas\nPhenomenon not attack it only by the way this is the New York the the thing this is the San Francisco LA thing he gets a full hour\nOn fake news CNN he can't even gone to a million viewers that's all that's not just taxes that's the whole country you know we could have put it on short wave radio and TV\nHe could have done a Facebook wife short Twitter live show and done better than a million anyway so you know then your taxes by the way we have some examples there\nOf people asking non citizens to register to vote that's now becoming a big problem down in Texas oh by the way even MSNBC held paid or rock as a rock star it can be the twenty twenty nominate\nA you try and get through Ted Cruz first good luck with that but we're following all these races let me tell you where I think we are right now I think the Republicans\nI think between the caravan that we now have coming towards us four thousand people strong that want to get to the southern border or the United states from Central America I Know that the secretary of homeland security secretary Nielsen\nI I had an opportunity to call her office earlier today because I actually do real reporting on this show and get an update uh apparently as of now there's full cooperation with the Mexican government\nThat that's not gonna happen\nBut four thousand people still four thousand people and what did Democrats what did they were just that they don't want a solution\nFor the board our problem we have with the opioids crossover human trafficking is occurring you know we they now are using these drug cartels you can't say they're stupid they're evil but they're not stupid they've been using in this I Can't even believe this is true you know these drones that they fly with cameras above him\nSo they'll fly from Mexico into the United states along our southern border they fly drones with cameras on them and what they do is they map out where the border patrol\nWhere agents aren't so then they give like the perfect entry way where it's they're most likely to succeed in bringing in their heroin and their fat and all and drugs that are really being targeted towards your kids your town your cities\nThat's how evil these drug cartels are and how desperate they are to be successful or the president\nWhile he offered now we spent three and a half billion dollars so far that's the only amount of money that has been allocated towards the wall these pens every penny\nBut we need twenty five billion dollars total to get the whole job done that in part is what this election is about it's also about a party that has given up any sense of honor and any sense of constitutional or authority let the rule of law that is based on our constitution that would mean due process\nThat would mean equal or access on there are laws equal application of our laws\nAnd we know that they gave that up any sense of due process with judge Kavanaugh that wouldn't even give him the honor of the presumption of innocence even after an FBI investigation the eighth one that he's had in his like well now they want a nine to one\nBut the way I see it Eighteen days out is that we've got the Senate is looking better Rick Scott has a slight lead now in Florida but it's not big enough\nDo you want if you want rex where Scott has killed himself and done such a great job for the state of Florida look at how this man is all hands on deck doesn't sleep every hurricane he's prepared to help out those that are victims\nAmazing I maybe it doesn't have the most charisma in the world will be the first to tell you that but you know one thing I'm a little sick of\nA lot of politicians with a lot of hot air and be yes the talk a good game and just are lying to us which is part of the whole democratic strategy that's why project very

important midterm elections\nAnd what do we see we see that Brett is and has now been exposed this week in Tennessee is somebody that is purposely lying to the people of Tennessee the same with Claire McCaskill we say that Christian cinema is falling apart\nI mean literally ... you know she she says oh it's fine to be a fine to join you know radicals um and the Taliban actually said oh and by the way this is the meth capital of the world Arizona oh by the way you're crazy and she has anti war rallies while her opponent Republican Martha mix Sally\nIs that we're fighting for a country that's not playing well very very well right now in the state of Arizona and you see that Heidi Heitkamp totally out of touch with the people of North Dakota so it seems a lot of pickups in the making there for the Senate for the Republicans\nTight race though in Florida vote for governor and for Rick Scott is always does an amazing job for the people of Florida are anyway joining us to analyze where we are Eighteen days out is our good friends welcome back to the program John McLaughlin Doug showed pollsters both of them\nJohn Eighteen days out what do you see happening\n[noise] uh well the the house is still in play and the Republicans are a without a doubt are fighting back to have gotten more aggressive but still it needs to do a lot more and and what's really amazing to me is the focus of\nYou know you're exposing the Democrats are and what their agenda is all the time but the focus of the Republicans really needs to be to expose Nancy Pelosi when she tends to do I think you played a clip earlier about Schumer in the Senate and he wasn't very ...\nTo figure out where they're going up in the polls because the Republicans post Kavanaugh uh have have really done a lot better at ... in a in the Senate polls that have come up I mean when you talked about uh Arizona ... now hit by a little in Tennessee Republicans leading now decisively or some ... some of the\n... the Democrat opportunities to pick on the Senate looked like they are going off the table and on the other hand it looks like the Republicans are ahead in Missouri they're they're they're running close races and in Montana Indiana\nNow West Virginia I mean even in New Jersey uh it's it's turning into a competitor\nWhat is really looking like New Jersey might be a dog fight for Bob Menendez and the people in New Jersey of had\nIt with him and you know now that his association with this Chilean Epstein guy uh that has now become an absolute verbal war between ... and his Republican opponent of opponent and now showing up at the polls\nAre dug so where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell I think where America's fans and John and you are right on fortunately I might add is that the Senate has moved pretty decisively\nRepublican I don't think that New Jersey will go all the way because it is a operationally democratic state but the other states you cite showing I think are moving in with I think are the wrong direction I\nStill have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona but both of those have deteriorated above it from my perspective and the last\nWeek and I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican\nWas ... it was a to point raised a week ago Donald Trump goes in and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell look at it yeah I was gonna say I I've seen the same numbers John please go ahead\nThen sent an absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace up because a nationally when he won he had sixty three million voters\nAnd when the the uh uh uh when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty sixteen\nSo if you can get the sixty three million Trump voters motivated that they're coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did and it appears to have backfired\nParticular Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate or if you can motivate those Republicans to come out\nThose Trump voters those independents and Democrats has supported them they have a very good shot at getting Senate seats and it's probably the only shot they have of winning the house that that and going after Nancy Pelosi the idea of stopping Nancy Pelosi the most popular\nFor let me tell you what I'm saying I Am radio and TV if you vote I don't care what congressional district here and there were four hundred and thirty five congressional districts in this country in any of those districts\nIf you vote for any Democrat you're voting for pillow see if you stay home it's a half a vote for below sea and the same in the Senate if you're going to vote for tester and McCaskill and send them on against Dean Heller in Donnelly and you're going to vote for you know breast and it was just a phony fraud to the people of\nGetting caught on tape being it uh and and not put more Marsha Blackburn in you know you'll get the government you deserve but you're really electing and voting for Schumer because they're going to they're going to tow the line with pillows the in the house into the line with humor in the Senate that's\nYou know and what do we know that they want they want to impeach the president they want endless investigations\nThey want to raise taxes they're actually saying that they're hiding the impeachment begging Maxine Waters not to say it anymore John Podesta Center for American Progress and saying all Democrats had not talk about immigration for for this they want to open borders sanctuary cities\nSanctuary states that elimination of ice and they want to keep Obamacare that's not that that didn't work for eight years dug and\nWhy why do we we sold him to a bit of a leading Indiana is say\nOh keep ice you say go the wall and he's saying oh impeachment which\nWhen he was the only reason he surviving and not down by five or six now is because you've got a libertarian in that race that is polling at nine percent you take a libertarian out of the Donnelly is history in Indiana\nWell I wouldn't be so sure on but he is running where Democrats need to be in the center and if we were a centrist party rather than a leftist party with new leadership from top to bottom I think we would go in a lot better I think you're probably agree with that Sean\nHow is it possible the Democrats hold on to below sea and Schumer how was it ... it is a phenomenon to me ...\nAll one word answers on Snowden's money so so you know raising enough money yeah ... that's what it's\nAll about and and and and he's absolutely right because Shawn that when we asked in September and the national poll that there were packed it out when we ask voters if the Democrats took over Congress do you want to ask you close your speaker again only twenty three percent of all voters said yes fifty six percent said no\nBut then when we asked them about the fact that you know if you know that they're trapped in that these candidates are accepting millions of dollars to raise them for their campaigns from Nancy Pelosi or will they all their votes to her fifty percent agreed with that statement only twenty nine percent disagreed of all voters so think\nNancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer hold the mortgage on these candidates and let me tell you a for for ... for someone who's involved in congressional races right now trying to defend Republicans the Democrats are pouring millions of dollars into the race is right now\nWhat in the patio and he's behaving Republicans\nProject very toss released to tapes and they are stunningly\nYou know revealing in terms of the willingness of campaigns to purposely organized a campaign\nTo lie to the people at Tennessee in the case of Brett us than to lie to the people of Missouri in the in the case of Claire McCaskill to say one thing privately another thing publicly\nIt tells me Democrats too when they have to they can expose who they are if they can't talk about impeachment which they want\nThey can't talk about immigration and being told not to talk about that they can't talk about raising taxes even though they want that they can't talk about Obamacare even though they want that I mean what kind of people are they if they have zero sense of honor honesty character and integrity I Hope\nYou are exempt me from the uh person\nWhat am I I like them to you but you know nobody's been listening to you because if they were listening to you have a whole entirely different slate of candidates and frankly the Republicans wouldn't have a shot this year\nWell thank you take that as a real well it's the fact that I mean notes on sale radical left\nOr center right\nListen I your your style a Democrat listen this is a party that kicked out Joe Lieberman Lieberman is one of the most decent man ever you know very\nVery top of his great on on national security issues horrible on social issues nicest person in the world but he's not left enough for the Democrats and they threw him out and he came back and won but I mean it says everything you need to know about the modern radical Democratic Party of Schumer and Pelosi\nAnd and the guy that Democrats
