[noise]\nA small clock a battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives in material they give off sheet and energy through a reaction to heat shock or friction [noise]\nSo we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices [noise]\nI Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work of our folks at the FBI law based

just see it up close in reality is something to behold and we are so proud of our team at the lab for their work and keeping people safe and helping us to find the individual responsible\nLate last night we also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation of this DNA connection and we want to thank them in particular for they're very quick work\nAlso want to thank the men and women of the FBI's counterterrorism division who remain on high alert every\nDay to try to keep the American people safe from harm and who move quickly and efficiently into action

Americans like to turn the podium over the commissioner O'Neill from Iraq\nTo re are confirming that they believe they have the main suspect they're worried that there might still be some that have been recently mailed there on the lookout for that but it looks like they have DNA evidence now that ties to this one guy\nAnd uh they have analyzed it confirmed it and you know these guys are amazing what they do every day\nYou know the sad thing about all of this ... you know I Want to remind you\nBecause you know I've lived through some of this myself at all explained that the minute but\nYou don't remember when Bernie Sanders it one of his supporters shot Steve ... shut up all these Republicans at a ball field a nearly killed Steve ... says the fact is he's a walking miracle and I know because I knew what was what he was really going through all the time it was far worse than was reported\nAnd uh people wanted to blame Bernie Sanders says you can't blame Bernie Sanders for what one does listen\nNow I I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here All right and I believe him\nAnd I said that and just like I said in the years gone by remember when the one guy\nBroke into the White House when Obama was president\nAnd as it did they came up a number of times I have a number of tape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but protecting our elected president is is job one for all of us\nAs Americans is our elected leader whether you like it or not and here's what I said Mr Speaker you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House\nNot only did he get in the door but he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms or the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas\nThat is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah I mean ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect the president that that represents the free world\nSo they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and any time any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile and and if we're not protecting our president we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching this\nSo I said that many many times you know and I said this only because um there's this idiot on fake news CNN his name I ... what's his name John Avalon\nSomebody who's taken cheap shots of me a number of times over the years and I want to play for you what he said because he basically links the bombs sent to De Niro to me let's just played that part but when he but basically blaming me listen to this\nBut Sean Hannity says had a direct language may we don't we don't know who it is we don't know the motive but what was fascinating is you see a direct patterns between the president's attacks on Twitter and and the stage in big echo an amplified by Fox News and other folks in the control projects here which is not like the others right why Robert De Niro\nWell one of things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blasting deniro for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things which you said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden becomes ... Robert De Niro calling the president devil an a devil worshippers it affect you know\nI'm used to play the victim card but at the top of mind ten days ago and the ... can be said what is that when we find out who this is um because some of these figures are are more prominent on the on the campaign has been ...\nMe because the Niro got one of these packages well let's listen to De Niro and the things that I've been critical of De Niro about let's listen to what maybe I was talking about\nI mean he's so blatantly stupid he's a punk his dog he's a pig is a con\nArtist a mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework doesn't care fix these gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster he's an embarrassment to this country\nIt makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool disposal has wound up where he has he talks how he wants to punch people in the face well\nI'd like to punch him in the face today the world is suffering from the real Donald\nTrump [noise] I'm On\nWhat are we talking about [noise] idiot as the president [laughter]\n\nWow wow that's a scary Hillary as though you're in ...\n... news I enjoy the the [noise]\nThe horrors of President Trump chanting their opposition for CNN at a rally in Charlotte North Carolina it's the same phrase on a bumper sticker seen on the ... either stay on the man accused of sending explosive devices to Democrats and critics of the president but the president also telling the crowd that political violence of any kind will not be tolerated\nIn recent days we've added a broader conversation about the tone and civility of our national dialogue everyone will benefit if we can and the politics of personal destruction\nAuthorities say say Iraq has a prior criminal history and could get nearly fifty years in prison if convicted he's accused of sending at least Thirteen explosive package is a lawyer for family claims he's mentally ill this is talk yeah\nNo no we here at northern light speed that believe in the YMCA supportive housing campus they're leading the way and eliminating homelessness in Des Moines they're the only housing program of its kind in America there not an emergency shelter or a revolving door to provide temporary help\nThe why as permanent housing for residents transitioning from homelessness to stay home with dignity health and supportive services they give a hand up and out of hand out the situation in real danger how to get your time or make a donation go to YMCA dot org slash housing\nDaughter being Sandy I'm Kerry we're now might be and we invite you to give it to try today at northern might be the dot com northern light one of a kind delivery people ... on a passionate pursuit of pizza protection you up and have The Cosby sat and the bread pick you crave peace real quality every time\nBorder now and nor there might be the dot com it's delicious delivered one he's try it you'll say that'd be\nNice\n[noise]\n\nFive times the most iconic branded a booming cannabis industry just went public joined me I peeled now by the time in\nPolitical building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find you the loan them in writing or\nCalls today in orange\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nMaryland or terrifying attractions in one location designed to scale\n[noise]\nTemperatures and very little chance range than I open I vote for him to forty Greek\nMoral partly cloudy and a very like\nWind but it'll be out of the south west we'll get into some sunshine a ticket to sixty four degrees for the high\nMuch cooler with a high wind factor on Sunday we're going to be around fifty five degrees but that wind speed will be up to thirty to forty miles per hour that is the news radio ten forty W.

majority and plough sees a speaker and that's like a a Speaker Gingrich\nHas got those odds and those are scary odds because of policy takes over the house you know she's going to have open borders you know she's going to want to raise taxes you know she'll kill jobs she'll put back and regulations and guess what they're going to try to impeach the president so\nYou've really got just over a week to try to stop pull a few of the Democrats from winning and the Republicans really need to have a laser focus on that and run a very very hard contrast campaign and the worst thing is right now in Ninety percent there's a story I think Ninety percent of the congressional districts that are competitive\nThe Democrats are raising the Republicans and it's not by little amounts it's by big amounts so you have a tick rational race where the Democrats are spending a other Republican two million to one million in in Virginia ten were barber concerts running for reelection people were saying all your polls were wrong because you have a point that had\nAll the Democrats last friday put in for a million dollars in the last two weeks versus are two million between the Republican or groups in a center account I mean Congress on contract so the Democrats are playing for keeps and the Republicans need to have that\nLooks like the Democrats have just seeded the Senate than in other words they're putting all their money into house races just to get the one chamber absolute ... so let's say that that that what you're saying is true if the Democrats afloat Z become speaker and the Republicans hold on to the Senate and they pick up seats in the Senate so that would sort of be a split decision by it I guess any measure right\nJust split decision except that the Democrats will have a focused they will control the house I think of the committees that are going to change\nI think of think of the intelligence committee and set of newness running it you'll have Adam Schiff gets what's gonna happen with the\nWith the with all these investigations et cetera guess what's going to happen with the Judiciary Committee and their their there'll be relentless investigations of President Trump that he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go they'll\nGo check his taxes the leak all this stuff and it'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know us\nPollsters we get calls before the elections from hedge fund guys for major Wall Street guys what are you seeing in the in the election all you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means to the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think Doug Jones you in the same area you said is getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see it between twenty five and thirty see I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house that that is correct time could jak thing ... whenever they are saying the Democrats could win by little as two seats\nI Am saying that I said on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same range I think John's analysis is very very rare\nAnd I think he is right to say that the Democrats are mobilized and focus on the um on the house exclusion of the Senate but the amount of money that's being spent on really the thirty races I think Sean butter on your website cannot be underestimated and\nYou know mid term elections tend to be referenda on the president and the incumbent party and there's one little dirty secret\nIt's not so much Donald Trump is at risk the Republicans in the house and Senate will have much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nAt one of the weaknesses as it relates also to the Republican House is there's so many retirements what are their forty by a separate retirements incumbents and name recognition for a lot of people and a lot of these races is negligible zero it takes years to build the name recognition\nIn a district John absolutely and by the way that that ... top thirty most important races that you put on your website\nThose are critical ... sets of Republicans really need to win and and Doug is it is I mean granted the Democrats should be listening to them but fortunately for us they don't listen to him too much for one Democrat that does listen to them is former Mayor Bloomberg in New York City\nWas a big superPAC as putting the resources into electing Democrats in the house now that he's gone back to being a registered Democrat and the Democrats really\nDug understands it they they\nThey're very smart they really understand how to how to win races and how to take power and the Republicans need to wake up I mean those of us who are older I remembered delivering a survey that Haley Barbour helped pay for Nineteen Ninety\nFour and September that have we have the generic Republicans up seven and that was to the house leadership and there was a soon to be Speaker Gingrich with Bob Michel was presenting the numbers to him saying you're going to be the next speaker and\nWe just need to not compromise on Clinton care well Haley Barbour\nBarred ten million dollars to help when more seats and win that election the Republicans are raising record some save the orange she has out raised a has out raise the uh\nDemocrats their National Committee to to want the ... that money needs to find his way into the into these top thirty races that you've outlined where the Democrats are spending has virtually two to one and all those races this week\nAnd you've got to be able to put money into those races weather's digital LEDs a\nTV ads even nationally and saying stop polo see\nWe've got to have an equal voice with the Democrats\nAnd uh uh ... they've really they really are focused on trying to take over the house and it's and it's their their shot at power\nThey're shot a power but remember you know those that have been saying the investigations into the deep state in I don't believe that's true because we have Senate committees that are just as capable of doing that as well and similarly if the Republicans were able to ...\nThe majority in the Senate any legislation that Nancy Pelosi and company wants to pass that is going to be against what the Republicans want in the Senate is never going to get through it'll die there\nAnd we'll have divided government but I think you're most right and the fact that it's going to be basically two more years like we've had and that is endless you know ridiculous absurd obscene investigations show trials by Adam Schiff Maxine Waters Gerald Gerald Nadler and company and\nIn other words the progress will will slow down dramatically a there is also the hope that Republicans in the lame duck session could actually get in there and pass the funding for the border wall and maybe repeal and replace Obamacare in the meantime\nLuck I think Sean that if that is John and I think folks that are suggesting that more likely than not the Democrats when the house what we are looking at almost great certain date is ... come gridlock for two years\nI make a slightly different when I look I'm a patriot before but I Know John is certainly you're shot I just hope we stop demonizing doing what Maxine Waters that say\nPrompts responsible for ... for a set of

anyone votes for the libertarian in Indiana you're just basically a giving a half a vote to Joe Donnelly but Joe Donnelly is in trouble I think the biggest polling surprised that we saw in the last

you\nKnow I call them I guess a spacious devices 'cause we don't really know if they were actually bombs but it got\nMe thinking I'm sure that that's been confirmed 'cause they when they said they had

more about this guy short of the van that had a CNN sucks picture on it in a picture of Donald Trump but doesn't mean a thing and\nYou know by the way I remember when I when Bernie Sanders when one of his supporters shot up that baseball field I said at the time boy if this I'm not blaming Bernie nobody should blame Bernie Sanders he's not responsible for what one does and I said but boy if it was some supporter of Trump or any Republican oh they'd blame everybody\nWe know what I mean I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here I and I believe him\nWell it's a different tact than you hear from the media today right\nRight and you know what what concerns me and thank you for correcting me about the update on me I'm that bomb threats what concerned about as\n... as he mentioned the van with all this stickers okay perhaps it is somebody from the far right but I'm noticing what I'm hearing is the the sticky jury as far as how they were placed how they with no\nYou know issue with the ... south but the other thing I thought about was William Clyde Arlen who\nThreaten people with rice and a couple of weeks ago and he
