they're all important\nEvery ... every one of you listening to my vote I don't care if you think your congressman as safe or not you better get out and vote\nBecause otherwise if you don't vote that's pretty much a vote for Nancy Pelosi and if you have a Senate race going on in your state that's vote for Chuck Schumer\nThe second potential outcome is a split decision\nSplit decision would be Republicans hang on to the Senate gain a couple seats and Nancy Pelosi them become speaker and Maxine Waters is a chairwoman Adam shift as a chairwoman and let's say Gerald ... chairman\nElijah Cummings the chairman and it's endless investigations\nInto one of the most unbelievable things that we're watching unfold here\nIs what we got this desperation factor of the Democrats I mean even when I think even when I warn you\nOf what they do every two and four years racist or sexist besides your nose Gina phobic Islamic phobic homophobic you know dirty air dirty water kill children throw granny over the cliff just one you think it can't get worse it gets worse\nAnd the echo chamber if you've ever doubted ever doubted who the media in this country has pulling for just just watch any so called cable news channel besides Fox\nFor thirty seconds because it's every second every minute of every day hate Trump destroy Trump help the Democrats\nAnd if it means falsely accusing the president of being responsible\nFor the synagogue shooting over the weekend and not even tell the people there viewers that well the shooter this mad man power hated Trump because of Trump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel\nAnd the same people you know St Trump cause this promise responsible for this you know it's a it's it's a sense of madness but it also does show a desperation that has now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate\nYou know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about polls a little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand seems like I'm Talking to both sides of my face I'm really not\nI'm I'm gonna tell you to just ignore the polls at this point doesn't matter you still have a job to do and if you want to to keep the progress that we've had you want to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight\nAnd one day after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results if you don't want to hear the words speaker elect Pelosi Senate majority elects sure then you're going to have to do something about it\nThe worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home\nThat the reason I'll tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often\nJust two years ago the exit polls showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he won it that he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan Wisconsin anyone both of them\nAnd the media nobody they weren't candy because they read these results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else\nI remember my first break at at the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in in about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate\nAnd he goes why do you believe that and then I told them the story about two thousand and four where the median again the polls came back\nAnd George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio Pennsylvania and it was over\nAnd Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still had time to vote because he read the same information that I just read that John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know if you go back and you know other polls where they've been wrong twenty fourteen you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house by a painfully slim margin\nOne of the reasons is look if you look at real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics as the Democrats are two hundred and five seats locked solid\nOr leaning Democrat and it has leaning Republican lock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seat difference but because Republicans have\nThe majority of ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend is like thirty seats that they call toss ups that can swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you can check it out for yourself and\nThe only thing that can make a difference is if you want the progress of the last two years to continue\nYou get to decide how you're gonna feel a week from tonight I mean when the when you watch called back the media in twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were getting well it's pretty clear Hillary I think is going to the next president Frank Luntz was reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen\nAnd I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening turned out not to be true turned out the polls were wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data I had read the same data\nSo if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen\nBecause they've had a Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBut it's not only were they wrong in twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election member Republicans have been set up because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen\nOne year before the twenty four team in terms of media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival that goes in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the get government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nExperts such a short us a hundred percent certainty in twenty four team Republicans are going to pay huge price when the twenty four team midterms rolled around Thirteen months later the G O P not only won back the Senate they did it with a ... seat Senate\nLandslide now remembers the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to give away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but ah yeah to get a little tighter than we thought isn't it\nAnd then I turned into a all out melt down depression collectively by the media and they couldn't believe it because you we the people shocked the world\nWhat happened to know for it's happened in fourteen and it happened in sixteen no reason it can happen in a tea you should do it\nFor no other reason because you want to keep America on the great growth growth trajectory we're on and maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party they're going to lose it\nIf the house remains in Republican hands and Republicans picked up a number of Senate seats they will lose it just like they did in twenty six the this is a this is a white flash CNN was reporting that night\nAnyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that none of them thought in twenty fourteen no very few of us saw that we could wait\nGive you the let's go to twenty fourteen final Wall Street journal NBC News survey before balloting and twenty fourteen had forty six percent of likely voters favor Congress led by Republicans forty five prefer democratic control\nKind of similar where they are now the G O P claimed a similar one point advantage lead\nIn ten states where Senate races where the most competitive with a balance of power in the chamber would be decided those results suggested narrower advantage for Republicans in in the latest mid term\nAnd you know still they claimed oh Republicans pick up nine seats that's a hell of a field goal\nAnd prosperity and a strong national defense and build a border wall and it'll be a boat for any democratic senator you just voting for Schumer it'd be a vote for reticence McCaskill Nelson ...

frankly the there's there's gotta be some legal standard at some point that you ought to be able to sue for such slander and libel those comments like this anyway Jeffrey Myers the pits Pittsburgh rabbi\nWho watched eleven of his congregants gun down during their Saturday services saying he's now become the political targeted in he's receiving hate\nMail for saying he would welcome the president to his place of prayer it's unbelievable anyway you had all these wonderful people they're going to praise God at a temple and their gun down\nAnyway the organization told reporters they now

race let's talk about the FBI investigator buying what thousand dollar Hamilton tickets for Andrew Gillum and you're saying that there was a quid pro quo involves while\nThis guy was posing as a developer a he went and he\nPaid for Andrew at least a thousand dollars for that ticket that's an illegal gift ended up itself Andrew never ordered it this developer\nWanted a zoning change in Tallahassee and sure enough later he got that there were text messages release where that an FBI agent is a tax thing that the main lobby its body of Andrew saying really appreciated mayor coming through ah\nWhy wasn't he got arrested isn't that buying influence and corruption\nWell there's an ongoing investigation I mean that's the thing I think that um uh we don't know what's going to happen because this has been going on for quite some time\nThey've been gathering a lot of evidence Andrew also the same lobbyists that arranged that New York junk get paid for for night stay in a luxury Costa Rica villa for Andrew Gillum\nAnswered and pay a dime at that and then Andrew turned around and gave that lobby is a two million dollar contract to do a restaurant in the city of Tallahassee now we know in addition to that thousand dollar ticket\nThat the agent gave to go on the FBI agent also under wrote a forty three hundred dollar dinner for Andrews campaign nine twenty sixteen I was never reported which it needs to be and so the question is\nAnd you have reported after the fact that just basically cover in your tracks CYA so it only interested in report\nIt at all the only reason we know about it\nIs because there's an ethics commission investigation of Gillum and and and a response to those subpoenas uh one of the lobbyist attorneys release that for the public so forty three hundred dollars and then at least a thousand dollars for Hamilton Andrew says he's not under investigation\nBut Sean you tell me what other reads and what an undercover agent have to do those things if he wasn't investigating mayor Andrew Gillum\nWell let me ask you to two days ago\nIt was the political reported that apparently his running mate you know claimed that quote Jews nailed him to the cross and read the text message to you know apparently it's now out there many you know people in in South Florida apparently are pretty angry at this remark\nAnd er which seems pretty anti Semitic to me as he's standing by this\nBook I think it's reprehensible Andrew Gillum picked this guy knowing that he had done that but here's the thing about Andrew Gillum\nHe is aligned himself with some of the most anti Israel and anti Semitic groups in Florida including this radical group called the dream defenders\nWhich is a leader and the boycott divest and sanctioned movement targeting Israel they actually say Israel the genocidal apartheid state and so that's one of the Andrew strongest supporters Andrew to this day\nOpposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nAnd when a Israel fought back against the Moffett fats and may ah Gillum blamed Israel he said oh they just use those attacks as a pre tax to be able to do a disproportionate response of\nWhat what is in a relief endurance organization that he won't disavow\nThey're one of the most radical organizations in Florida uh they they believe that the police and prisons have no place in justice\nAnd that the police needs to be funded they paid they said to us as the biggest bully in the history of the world that our military needs to be caught\nThey if they favor or replacing what they consider disaster capitalism is their word with socialists principles that are so radical it'd make Nicolas Maduro flush so key sign their candidate alleged gang that he would support a this radical manifest there so that just who he is he believes and what they're doing\nIs endorse them personally and uh it would\nLose a tape of him I guess that was discovered in June saying that he's pleased I'm proud to sneak food to dream defender\nActivists during a thirty day sleeping protested the Florida State Capitol referring to the twenty Thirteen month long anti gun protest or after the Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case and I hope you keep at it and he supported them but you're saying that there are radical group\nWithout question I mean they they are anti law enforcement they're anti free enterprise there in the military um they're anti Israel uh I don't know I mean like that may be a group you would want to be aligned with if you're running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip but not for governor of Florida\nWow well let's go over a little bit of his his background and the proposals that he's making but he's I think it's fairly extreme a number one he was endorsed by Bernie Sanders that speaks volumes to me\nThere's a lot of outside money uh reports that he's getting money from the left wing billionaires like George Soros the George Soros really spend one point two million in this race in Florida to help him\nOh yeah I'm probably much more than that at this point you know\nHe says that he supports Medicare for all I Am a champion of treaty health care and as a right not a privilege so he wants what nationalized health care\nHe is the bill he supports what abolish Medicare and Medicare Advantage for seniors enforce them on a single payer government plan it would eliminate everybody's employer based coverage and force them on a government single plan so it really a fan the arrangements have millions and millions of idiots\nHe thinks it's appropriate for government to take away health benefits that people are burned into force them to be on the single payer plan I think that'd be a disaster\nHe wants to raise the corporate tax rate forty percent of forty percent increase ... what's that going to what's the impact that is going to have on Florida businesses and Florida workers if the businesses pack up and leave\nWe will lose jobs we will lose business it and we're also I mean you know shock because everyone who works in high tax states they're always thinking about relocating to Florida we have a historic opportunity to really capitalize on that when I'm governor buddy Andrew has his way\nHe'll stop the flow of investment coming in to Florida because people are going to end that if you have the highest tax rate in the south east and actually he would raise it to be higher than New York\nYeah and they also was the first democratic candidate Nash nationwide I read to call for the abolish men a vice is that true\nHe supports abolishing ice and impeaching President Trump\nAnd he wants to eliminate Florida's Stand your ground law\nYes he wants to impose on law abiding already in the duty to retreat so somebody up a criminal is attacking you you have to run and try to hide rather than fight back\nAlso support legalizing drugs in Florida like marijuana and others yes he does\nWell I mean it you're it looks like he is Bernie Sanders on steroids down there I mean I've got to believe with this controversial background that looks like a almost a phenomenon that the media's just pushing for him and pushing for him\nAnd you know his record I I only spent about a half hour and I was able to dig it up it wasn't that hard to find and it seems like most of the media is ignoring who he really is\nA without actually having a day he won the primary particularly the national media you know they've tried to elevate him and tried to make him in this great candidate a they do not like the scrutinize his record uh the fact that those ... you know get relief after he lied and the debate last Sunday\nOr the media kind of had to cover that but at the end of the day he has\nBeen given very kid glove treatment so really falls to me and other folks to go out and make the case and let people know and the good news is already and figure that out or they definitely don't want to know their governor and so we're going to keep making the case for the next week\nI'm worried about our friends not only the recovery I'd uh thoughts and prayers go to all our friends in the panhandle\nUm but but the panhandle to so many people whose lives have been up ended and disrupted and some people losing pretty much everything they own and they now moved out the panhandle happens to be one of the most conservative areas of Florida are you concerned that people\nFrom the panhandle of going to be able to get their hands on a ballad maps and tea or otherwise would maybe be part of early voting is Florida doing anything to us is that an help those people that have been displaced would want to vote in this election because Florida is their home\nThey're doing a lot ah everything from mobile voting sites to\nAccommodations for absentee ballot you know the bad news is that you said it was a terrific stormed the good news is I think all but about Fifteen thousand homes are going to have power by the weekend\nA which we weren't sure could happen that quickly I mean I Know the rest of the folks there is a combination is being made so are they are resilient people I understand them at city area I mean I Know a lot of them do want to vote and so they'll have the opportunity to do it\nYeah I'm I'm at the devastation once again to the people there how long do you look at rebuilding not part of Florida and some people I looked like a tornado is wiped it out\nYeah look I mean it it got to take time I say with me coming in as governor I'm gonna have to deal with it and take off our request off I Will say though um had that gone forty miles west population would have been much bigger I'm so there is damage and its extensive damage\nBut I think it's damage in a relatively limited area is there's a couple area that got hit pretty good so we know what we got to do and I think we'll be able to go in and do what we are the president has committed to doing any repairs necessary for ten do air force base outright isn't important not active duty site right so I'm really pleased that that is going to be fixed\nIt's just I mean quite frankly Michael watched I'm a bit\nUm you know out and so it's not as bad as it was for sure but it really yeah there was a two month stretch there in South Florida where\nPeople were just getting hammered it was not extensive or fish kill it hurt our economy and tourism so are we need to do whatever weekend but a lot of it as a fault you know the federal government are discharging you know all this water in the river\nA round the Santa is running for governor the great state of Florida a Rick Scott running for senator down there a it is one of the most important states has Florida always is a forty percent business tax by Andrew Gillum would be a disaster economically but Florida\nI Hope people are waking up to the fact um and you are you how you're in the middle of early voting now and absentee voting obviously goes on and a one week from today we'll find out hopefully that you're the next governor of Florida\nOtherwise I think I'm On packing up my bags and I'm going to pull out of Florida and I'll go looking at Texas no offense but my friends and I got\nAnd I look I mean we're we're going to be squandering\nEven angry business taxes forty percent forget it I'm Out\nNow I Know now that's exactly right so we're going to get it done I think the folk to understand that and uh you know when I'm governor will be able to do about it I got an old track record year\nRound the Centers for governor of Florida thank you for

the mass exit is out of California will even continue\nAt a greater clip and a greater pace you know so now what's happened is somehow we forgot that what eight years of Obamacare Americans slowly beginning to forget that their premiums are have gone up three four hundred percent in some cases\nForgetting that they only have one choice of a health care provider forgetting that they lost their doctor from long ago that they really liked and wanted\nAnd they forget that people with a pre existing conditions well with Obamacare you pay more higher premiums than any other plant\nRate hikes that nobody ever expected and they lie to you about\nPeople losing their doctors that was a lie you like your doctor keep your doctor people losing their plans with no choice anymore and\nThis has now become and the final week of the election this is their talking points all across the country they're saying well we're we're going to where we support healthcare preexisting conditions although
