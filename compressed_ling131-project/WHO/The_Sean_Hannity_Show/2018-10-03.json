{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WHO", "content": "That our government structure allows one company to lobby for a regulation that hurts them less than it does their competitors so it represents a net advantage\nOK I'm so Amazon is going to start doing this last ah last holiday season they hide or a hundred and twenty thousand temporary workers are they going to raise the minimum wage in time for those people\nYeah the uh they're starting wage I think the important way to look at it is not as if the minimum wage or Amazon has increased their starting wage calling it a minimum wage which is a combination a media today is kind of a confusion of concepts\nNow my to section and you may know better than me Michael ... is ... ... is the only company that's really taken it to Amazon and I'm trying to compete with them on line while having this a network of ... at the same time\n... that's my perception I could be completely wrong but my perception is that the ... a big retailer that's a that's trying to compete with Amazon right now\n[noise] yes that is my perception as well that are essentially Amazon and and Walmart are gearing up for it to be the big ... competitors in the retail space I actually just personally bought something on Walmart dot com and the other day 'cause I found it for a better price and it was listed on Amazon\nAnd I see that's interesting because I don't know how many people are looking at both I think\nPeople you know it's like well you know I've already got my account point hey do I really need to set up an account appoint me and I'm Wondering if that is that how much of that's going on\n[noise] yeah there's a ... economists call that sort of thing path dependency because you've already started down one path a you tend not to look over at the other path meaning the other retailers that you might go to um uh and and so you end up with a being stuck with your initial choice\nIt's not just a nice way of saying I'm lazy [noise] you said a ...\n[laughter] it's it's interesting you know cause I resisted this whole on line thing I didn't get it for the longest period of time I did not get it and uh and I resisted it until one Sunday\nAnd uh I have a very nice ... on my deck at my house and and I I couldn't find\nA cover for it which is pretty important in Iowa particularly when it's not as common so even though there's a cover over the the ... comes out of water still finds its way and unless you have a ...\n... for the whole thing so I went I spent a Sunday afternoon and I went to five different stores and no one had the right thing and I go home and other I'm wonder so I went on to Amazon I'm not exaggerating in thirty seconds I had ordered the exact thing that I needed and it arrived on the Tuesday\nI completely believe that that is a an amazing innovation that\nAmazon has offered not only in a having access to the exact thing that you need but having access to other people's uh reviews of that thing and getting more information\nAnd in five minutes then you could possibly get and or five hours of a walking round to retail stores and and talking with people there\nI literally I literally in such box on Amazon put in a bio pic cover and I don't remember the dime mentions but you know ... by why and she is such\nAn age thirty seconds I ... I ... that ... seconds he's a real number I'm not making it up it's a and and it changed a lot for me and now I'm not stunned asshole that a retail uh is suffering with the bricks and mortar stores that suffering\n... absolutely and the you make the point that bricks and mortar stores and that calls to mind\nSmaller mom and pop type organizations that so we're not Amazon doesn't just compete against Wal Mart or Home Depot or or big box stores like that they also compete against the smaller local stores and the smaller local store the advantage that they have\nIs that they offer you the in person service you can go in and if you're not a handyman and and I like to think I'm a handyman but I'm definitely not as good as the guys at the local hardware store so I Will go down and I will talk to them and buy something there\nBecause they have the knowledge base that I Need to access but I Can't access on Amazon but\nA federal minimum wage is going to hurt those stores that are offering that personalized service much more than it's going to hurt Amazon\nYeah absolutely I see I Do have a theory that uh the mom and pop stores like that\nCould lead to the revitalization of a\nA small town downtowns\nAre not be as opposed to you know like the the targets and the uh the came out ... go now or you know Toys R us is gone now these big places going but I can see a a revitalization of small town downtowns with these mom and pop stores and that expertise that you speak up\nA and a postal service I think that they offer something that ah you know ... for example come off or even with the bricks and mortar store\n[noise] absolutely it just matters what you need at that point and the fact that we have a variety of choices is a good thing the fact that you can go on in thirty seconds find your fire pit lead\nAnd uh and then have it shipped to you the next day a ready for your a patio party\nIs is perfect and but sometimes you need a better information you need expertise the problem is is a one size doesn't fit so fit all we need an economy that's open to everyone a level playing field with rules that are good for everyone\nAnd are the kind of weapon icing of regulations that the minimum wage allows is a is a major problem to actually having that kind of economy\nSo uh and Amazon both say a a good player and a bass player here because they're paying their own people more uh but the weaponized sing the minimum wage\nAbsolutely high on now that\nThat's great I think that's a good point to a grand leave at a Michael\nMichael fire and if people want to find out more about what are the kind of thing you have\nTo say where did they go [noise] go to mark ... dot org my scholar pages there with all of my work and my commentary on Amazon

four and I'm thinking if this is what it now has come down to because the three big cases they want investigated in every case there's no ... at all\nNone and and multiple changes in stories\nAt least two of the three cases and yet this this goes on and this lander and the I mean I just described the story about what Julie sweat Nick was claiming and now she has backtracked\nI don't even know why NBC whatever run an interview like this but they did run it\nEven saying that well she gave U.S foreign names to investigate one's dead and the other one has no idea who she is and the other two people never got back to us so they can't corroborate any of this but they say they can and the lawyer keeps saying they can but she backtrack center story at what point does the man\nYou know how does Brett Kavanaugh to quote\nYou know infamously rate Donovan one saying how do I get my good name back or famously saying you know how does this go off a civil discourse in this country\n... ...

in slander and and destroy a Kavanaugh and his family\nAnd had the audacity to suggest that he shouldn't stand that independence out and that his dealings with passion indicate\nThat he doesn't have the requisite judicial temperament this are on the United States Supreme court ... hair is righteous indignation his his to our a rant which was totally justifiable than necessary in fact to preserve his position\nRight to they compare that to the twelve years on the vents when he had exemplary judicial temperament which is universally acclaimed I find their uh I find their analysis\nAbsurd on its face and shouldn't even be taken seriously this guy has grand judicial Deborah I Would hate to have that kind of\nInvestment guy how was somebody supposed how was somebody supposed to act if they're accused of being a serial gang rapists who drugs ... drug young girls as a matter of course on weekends in high school how I mean what is the proper response he's supposed to go there and the guys I just didn't do that\nYeah Pete in ...\nWho were falsely accused react exactly the way that Brett Kavanaugh did\nAh when you're ... wrong you're angry and he expressed the appropriate to righteous indignation of an innocent man uh but the most important thing he said was I don't question that ah\nChristine Blasey Ford was it some time and at some place sexually assaulted it just wasn't me\nSo he's he's not calling her a liar or what is essentially doing is saying she is mistaken for a variety of reasons she may have conflated to different\nOr individuals or she may be projecting based on you know some uh for some reason that we don't understand a but this was a man who sounded like he was being falsely accused into can damn him for being angry\nIs to ignore human emotion\nOver ... garden\nAt ... and contrast that with his response on the market in the column interview and I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat aspect he was very much to restrain and I said to myself\nAnd robotic if he doesn't quit holding himself that nobody's gonna blade and then I'm telling you nobody would've believed him if he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them by coaching somebody told him quit holding back or he called himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said\nWhy she was ... she was initially blade all she was credible\nThey they believe that I can in multiples when he testified in he totally indicated itself it was a match or because I think it was thought that it\nBut what ... where does it go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up the Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said when Dianne Feinstein did is unfair to everybody in the process and\nThen you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions\nYou know I to me there's only one to answer the answer is thirty five days from now and that's when the American people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida\nI'm from Arizona Nevada and but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no faith\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's life as been bludgeoned his family has been bludgeoned then there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens in the FBI's report if the investigation finds nope plausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large\nBut it will also give a valid reason to senators like Murkowski and Collins a and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe mansion and and perhaps a couple of others are who are Democrats to vote in favor of cabinet but I find it amazing to me\nOr that we're holding Kavanaugh to an unfair\nA standard of his behavior in high school and college as alleged I doubt very many Democrats in the United States Senate could could meet\nThat standard and some of these allegations Julie sweat Nick are preposterous on their faces you point out she's now backtracking NBC issued a statement\nSaying that we can't confirm any of what she's saying and in fact she's deviated now from her sworn affidavit or in her most recent interview with NBC News so you know that a claim\nWhat do you think are the view which again this statement only come out a week prior and multiple mold I mean she backtracked dramatically on very key points\nAnd when you think of the seriousness of drug in girls and gang raping them and how she well he was near the punch bowl and while he wasn't lined up for the I saw him in the hall and nobody else I mean she was saying this was done as a matter of course on weekends at the time\nWe believe that no girl that was raped no boys that saw the drug gang of girls ever told the teacher a parent a law enforcement officer nobody told them\nI find that go ahead Greg answer that you're still no no go ahead David well I I I find that again absurd on its face as you said this is I Do uh the the sweating like while the other sweating allegations that just doesn't hold true and I\nThe following up on what you said and it doesn't comport with human nature just wouldn't have happened that way but it was truly right there would have been held up eight after one and it for sure after multiple times just doesn't hold true but in response to something you said earlier\nWhat we do taking this in the mid term if the FBI I'm something really damning which I truly that nothing will change the fact that the Democrats have acted in bad thing\nEither way and the people know what they've done is way except that I and ...\nAnd I think the public is is outraged and I think they're going to punish the Democrat and in the mid term what I Do think though is we'd be much better off with a victory\nAnd and the Democrats having acted the way they have then a lot and then having acted the way they have because what Trump stands for it's fighting and ultimately winning and we\nWe always blame our losses in the Senate on these ... these are moderates in these questions and they traders I don't wanna say trade literally track but these

there's NBC News going forward with\nNothing at all this was was absolute how\nDoes this past for a news story when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago you would think she can stay consistent in a week and the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here\nThat there was a ... a systemic party culture where almost every weekend that women girls young girls were being drugged\nWith ... and and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then line up outside the room waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that does happen thirty six years ago\nAnd nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement and she gives the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote\nCorroborate this story and it's not corroborate adjust the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that than we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does that how do you where is the news standard in any capacity here to put this on the air\nByron York is joining us he's been running a lot of columns about there is not the

think everybody's got to be in two minds\nA war on on the basis of the lack of evidence and ah there's no way the story should ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have done but it was given in part a due to the news networks um thing about Michael I have an Audi her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that if he sees has reported this is probably a good corrective or at least where you can see what I think what it was a parent to a lot of people\nAre just there was nothing to this story [noise] um and when she offered a witnesses who could corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was\nAnother was deceased and ... answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already gotten the damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know floods investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work\nBut if we start with

I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct as so here with the agreement or with our colleagues and Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware L like Chris but he was never part of the third grade meant what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no\nHe's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about it as drinking habits so Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and mystery Maris and the fall and incredibly incredible\nLead within a week I think the FBI's about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and see if it's changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalposts Jeff voted yes in committee with the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopeful and get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited and the scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii who wants to men by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator\nHirono now is saying she wants an F. FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we are so my dad owns a bar\nAnd so a throw in ice is like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is that solve bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted ... she's the one that said the goal was to lay\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was the three witnesses that Dr Ford named\nMess for ... isn't there any a credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped a huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this\nI have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do or they are your colleagues maybe you have some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but we're supposed to be limited in scope is now expanded out into\nOther allegations but it'd be a full one vote short you up with a pretty interesting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh delete legitimize the\nWay he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kevin ... the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man's been abused on not given up on hand less having an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly ... he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact yeah most Democrats will know no matter who Donald Trump s ride they've already against Gore sick yeah All right so now what's going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and\nHeidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and\nWell a smart question Martha ... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... towards claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they wanting the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota once a highly had camp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict that the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country in November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh [laughter]\nSo you mean you're you're communicating hand I don't I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers beyond that\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary the states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know\nIt's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ... and eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box and about thirty something days\nThirty five we can find yeah find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have the lights salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight the people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nWell it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for Kavanaugh it's only an election year conversion and there were only doing it because they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to be in a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\n[laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care is like you know I'm a ... I don't care how you found Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh as highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point this has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and that's saying a lot it changed the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's not a complicated issue for me if we follow votes short\nA west take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm a pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves I think ...\n[noise] yes no I think they handled it properly because these are serious allegations but she identified and and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to reach try this case I made I don't and you made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about Cabot off\nBut they have on them is that this is the environment we live in senator and I warn those audience on radio and TV every two and four years\nIf you're a Republican or conservative and you're running for office you're going to be called a racist or sexist appoint a massage witness to homophobic Xena pope Islamophobia you're going to be accused of wanting dirty air and water you're going to be accused of wanting to kill children and it's going to be all look alike of youth throwing a grandma over a cliff\nIs as predictable as the day is long and now which Supreme Court nominees\nThirty nine it's about an American things who are you in a restaurant\nDestroying you fine\nGet your ticket now go to an evening with due to the dot com that's an evening when you don't go [noise]\nFox News radio I'm Carmen Robert I start by saying that twenty twenty is looking really easy president\nTrump continues to make America great again to her this time campaigning for a GOP candidate in South haven Mississippi he used the rallies you directly mock judge Kavanaugh's accuser\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't know\nLast week the president took the opposite stance saying Dr Christine Blasey Ford was a good witness the FBI is expected to wrap up its probe into the allegations by weeks and the Dow closes at record high on strong economic growth\nThe blue chip index recorded his whole team ... closer the air the closing bell the doubt up a hundred and twenty two points that close to twenty six thousand seven hundred and Seventy three\nFox Business network Ashley Webster Fox News we report you the time [noise]\nIt's the biggest music festival of the year and it's coming to the cw already all you\nYou'll miss the iconic performances young\nThe biggest\nA while [noise]\n\nI books banned here you know I took it down and with technology how many amazing ways you can listen to WHM radio the classic ten forty AM streaming WHM radio dot com\nThe heart radio app on your smart speaker and on crystal clear HD Radio WHM radios being broadcast in digital sound\nOn the H.
