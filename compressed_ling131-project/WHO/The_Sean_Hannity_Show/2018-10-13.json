James O'Keefe is going to join us\nAnd the Democrat reticent who's running against Marsha Blackburn who's now began to pull away in the polls a little bit they're\nEmitted his campaign of his campaign staff caught on tape absolutely saying he's lying to the people of tendency\nBut the very purpose of getting elected and they say it not once but they say over and over and over and over again I don't play view later in the program today but I mean it is in his mind numbing that people have hero\nTruth or or ability or character that they can be honest with who they are and what they believe\nAnd the problem for Brett us in just like the problem for people like Claire McCaskill or Heidi Heitkamp for Joe Donnelly a or send them all oh why do we get to the tape on cinema today or you know some of these other Democrats that are running Jon Tester is they can't be honest\nWith who they are and be honest with their voters of what they're going to do when they get to Washington if they get to Washington but go when they get their here's what they're going to do\nEven though they're in red states that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump they're going to get to Washington and they're going to vote for Chuck Schumer that's the first vote and then they're going to vote\nWith Chuck Schumer Ninety eight percent of the time because that's what Democrats do there is no voice of moderation in the modern Democratic Party I got to get one little tip has a hat to Joe Manchin of West Virginia frankly why he stays a Democrat in this day and age I have no idea\nWhat Republicans also offering\nSolutions and answers and solving problems and the numbers Barrett out all across the board which is why you know historically in mid term elections people don't like to show up but if you don't show up all of the progress that we've made in the next two years is in jeopardy\nAnd you're going to get endless investigation possible impeachment they have stated publicly they want their crumbs back they have stated publicly in other words they want to raise taxes well that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama\nWhich put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty and he became the only president in history ever\nTo never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on manufacturing jobs of post jobs are never coming back\nWell in less than two years Trump's brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nHalf the time he brings it back not only by ending burdensome regulation and asking businesses\nWell what do we what can we do to help facilitate you working here and building here in grading factories manufacturing centers here and when I tell them well you know it's costing us you know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... because of that regulation\nOr the president's wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that is created a tax incentive for business to build in America and then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just walls humiliate publicly any company that is not building in America\nAnd then on top of that he challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years and he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out\nAnd we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico\nHave you don't fight for a better deal you're never gonna get a better deal pretty amazing\nI Know everybody is that all hyped up about Kanye being in the White House listen very closely what country it was saying and I'm like well I Do think we need some prison reform or give me an example\nWhen the president ... commuted the sentence of Alice marine Johnson remembers a woman at a given like a life sentence one of the fence drug a fence\nA grandmother apparently should run in a horrible economic difficulties there's like there's no new ones sometimes in our criminal justice system\nAnyway spent Twenty one twenty two years in jail and an opportunity to interview or\nI absolutely fell in love with this woman she comes rushing out of prison after President Trump does this for her\nRight into the arms of her loving family I've got to meet her sister and I got to meet somebody a lawyer that was working for her pro bono and helped make this happen and then she goes to the microphones and she says to America thank you\nThank you for giving me a second chance I'm not going to let you down\nWell I Want to find all the Alice Murray Johnson's imprisoned that or like car with that attitude that deserve a second chance and you know that would that maybe have been given heavy sentences for reasons for whatever the reason happens to be I agree with you we can find those people\nYou also talked about saving neighborhoods we need safe neighborhoods I disagree with him on stop and frisk only because the murder rate in New York well I've been hearing the Rudy Giuliani went from about twenty five hundred a year down to three hundred\nThree or four hundred Bernie ... was a big part of the success of that program\nIt just works unfortunately got to go into the neighborhoods where the crimes are being committed with the shots being fired wherever it happens to be and you have a grasp of resources and policing of those areas so every man woman and child can go to sleep at night\nAnd not worry the bullets are going to be flying through their windows and the next hour it's unbelievable that nothing is ever been done\nAt this point to pick Chicago\nI mean it's it's sad it's unnecessary our our human or human family in talent or being literally you know are literally evaporating before a rice\nIt's unbelievable we can do better we ought to do we owe it to people to do better and then he's talking about bringing jobs making with things in America and creating jobs in America\nYou know they shouldn't be about conservative liberal Republican Democrat but liberalism fails socialism redistribution has failed and we see it we had eight years of it and width hasn't done a thing\nAnd white as a any African American conservative that speaks out is just beaten up and excoriated on a level that his downright racist and disgusting\nWhy is it matter if somebody happens to be African American and a conservative and it happens all the time and somehow in this era of\nPolitical correctness it's acceptable to say the most disgusting and atrocious and obnoxious vicious viral thing you can listen to some of the things said about Kanye\nWest is what happens when they grow don't read flat phone turns out he just praying tiny west in the race on draft now the sudden ... because he put on a mad hats and he's an attention more like the president he's all of a sudden now that the the model folks person he's he's the token negro of the of the Trump administration's this\nWas an embarrassment ... mother is rolling over in her grave\nI think you had there man has clearly not okay to president who's willing to look boy that was a combination of famous consciousness I felt like I was sitting in on a psychiatric ...\nAnd a commercial for Donald Trump on the question of of of mental health and the question as other cleaning ham I felt very point and to me that was something very fragile valid and sad about tiny pulling out of the phone and France like Titanic as colorfully outside I think for their own somewhere picture of a ... I mean\nJust to expand on that it seems like an important point I haven't\nHeard anyone else on television at that but I think we're all\nA thoughtful play by play and political and now you're not thinking is that with his hall on our life\nI'm just going to be honest I may get a lot of trouble for it I feel actually for bad for him what I saw was a menstrual show today him in front of all of these white people mostly white people embarrassing himself\n[laughter] this is white supremacy by ring true of course I'm a black mouth is moving but white racist ideals are are flowing from Kanye West smiled\nKanye West is engaging in one of the most nefarious practices and yet how black body and brain power the warehouse for the articulation and the expression of anti black sentiments that have been shown check by people with far more rigorous credentials\nIt is so vicious and vile I don't even know where to begin\nHow was that acceptable to anybody this I don't know Kanye except I talked to him twice in my life\nAnd we talked about safer cities like the city of Chicago we talked about economic empowerment and opportunity for people for everybody in this country he's a billionaire\nAnd he is a pack on that vicious horrible level\nI don't even know what to say\nMy friend Heisman Trophy winning football great Herschel Walker he's called out CNN's Don Lemon for allowing all all of those insults to go out against Kanye West and the questions is on their behavior and as a guest or a referring to them is quote the or even want to repeat what you just heard\nRational elections mentor deceived historic\nThe thing is at stake count down\nTo the time for information right\nTo use radio forward and forty W.

year the mask came off yeah\nI think it is I I I I think what's interesting\nI don't know I I definitely feel momentum the polls are showing momentum we now have if we go through all the states is a very tight race how old is up by two out in Arizona Mick Sally believe it or not is now what by six this was before the release of these tapes which I Believe is definitely going to hurt\nIn the case of of course in cinema\nMarsha Blackburn is up by eight in Tennessee that it's such an important race Ted Cruz's rebounded in spite of all the hype of the bed or working all the money that prone against Ted Cruz that is such an important seat Claire McCaskill is down Heidi Heitkamp is down Joe Donnelly is down\nAnd I think tester is vulnerable in Manhattan I think there's a lot of Senate races\nThat are age ... really winnable in this atmosphere where we just watched the Senate all stand in line but for Joe Manchin and follow Chuck Schumer is lead\nAnd remember if if you have that happening and that many states you're not going to get a blue wave in the house\nI mean that they're the same voters at the same people and and the tide is not there but but there's something else or you just said that I think's really important and again I'm I'm thinking out loud you so because you you trigger the reporting you're doing is triggered this in my own thinking I think our folks so to start shifting towards humor\nI think I I really mean is I think you could take you know I mean here I Am I'm I'm throwing is hard to punch is like yeah I'm I'm fighting as hard as I Know how to fight

don't don't be ashamed of it it's\nAll right\nFor it to you really are and and again I think I think it's just something I learned this in part from from ... great coverage oh John F.

James okay you've found or project beret toss it's up on Hannity dot com project baritone dot com oh we got to take a quick break here when we come back\nOr news round up information overload hour we're going to look at the polls and all the major races with our pollster John McLaughlin and dug shown and believe it or not the Republican candidate for governor in California has a shot these within five points is it possible ... can we really shocked the world will get into that more as we continue [noise]\nAnd that's before the release of the tape that we showed last night\nOf cinema in twenty eleven calling the people of Arizona that she wants to vote for her\nCrazy I don't think that's going to go over well nor do I think it's going to go over well that she invited this this radical attorney to Arizona State university ... a university a lawyer convicted of aiding and abetting an Islamic terror organization and its leader\nThe lawyer in question represented someone who was one sentence to life in prison\nOr sent a sentence for in the nineties for blowing up a plotting to blow up the UN and an FBI building so I think cinemas going to see a dramatic drop in the polls there and I think things will look up for Martha ... he was a rock star a person that has served her country with incredible distinction\nUm and here to go through all these latest numbers and what it means and whether or not to this is gonna be the blue wave or is it going to be a shock the world twenty sixteen Donald Trump all over\nRedux a we have our good friends John McLaughlin and dug shown is with us welcome both the back to the program\nThank you thank you get cable I don't think there's any doubt the cabinet\nOverreach and the loss of due process and and even simple principles like the presumption of innocence has now definitely hurt the Democratic party I think these tapes of bread a sin and in Tennessee and send them out in Arizona are going to hurt those candidacies\nAnd when you have thirty two house seats really you know going to tip the balance one way or the other which way does it go John McLaughlin\nWhile I ... I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you've got a notice this week you noticed the market went down its up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rate stuff but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and\nThey would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done on regulations have businesses with the economy and they would want to raise taxes again\nAnd that would cost jobs that were slow down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing it about four percent higher than any of the expectations\nAnd what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened with the backlash\nOf about the whole having a hearing in how unfair it was and you can see we had a poll this week where I'm McCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I also Joe Donnelly is now down write and write and Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nWe have polls there because of the ... the energy sector is so important to the state\nThat you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls\nUm you know people want shops\nAnd what Gary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is if you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your paltry to raise taxes take what you got to take away the job to take away the pay raises and the vast majority of Americans\nDon't want to go back to that I mean we have holes in September with were Nancy Pelosi has fifty five unfair will among all voters she has she has the fifty three percent unfavorable among independent women\nThat the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and part of the drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country so these house races you're talking about\nOverwhelmingly most of the ones in play or Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those ...\nSeats they're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where you know the smart money on Wall street saying hold it if she's if she's going to be speaker and they're going to oppose the president's agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoes shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house but I think the Senate you have to admit is looking very good for Republican pickups\nI think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort because as somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know it then they want to get rid of ice they won't fund a border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear average is gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively andme interaction\nKavanaugh had a lot to do with it\nYeah I Do I think they are really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of their country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I'm kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the value of a New York I have\nNoticed yeah which is a pretty hard core left wing said even in a Governor Cuomo doesn't even want me in the state did you know that\nI Know but if I got I got\nTaken it no he actually said those conservative\nThat their problems not me stem cells are they really\nMade it that are that are conservatives who says he knows that it's not because it's\nSimple no one is Hans within a rifle no one can\nA um right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I don't I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nUm so but there's no place for me in the state of New York you said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be a governor and everything you love and vote for once me out of town\nSo am I speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think that you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannon in New York or to promote Hannity\nOffice would like to run for I think my friend John and I can\n... the ... well you disabuse our friend Doug of any notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I think look you're still the kid for Franklin square you're still you're still am with your working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because New York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers of New York state\nWe send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no no income tax and no state income tax and they have jobs but by the way it does hold an ad on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg\n... I heard it Oh yes I don't I ... I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid of him because he's moving so far left\nChat it's unbelievable he's gonna get whiplash\nBut but I don't even think I don't think they'll make to get through Mayor Bloomberg could get through a Democrat primary these days because they're so radical\nAnd that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing and the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as Sean says the most important in midterms in our lifetime because you really have a clear choice from a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back\nWhere the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world are we we we're basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them that the swamp is being put back in its place that that the average person might have something to say about how their lives are going to be governed have control of their own healthcare\nFor but if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next speaker she will be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country she'll be the national face and voice of the Democratic party and that is just frightening\n'cause it let me tell you something we're not just fighting is a frightening Republicans Doug shown does not want this do you do oh\nI Want democratic candidate at all levels in the house to say I will vote against her because that's the way to get votes in these marginal races absolutely thought she should go period\nStyle absolutely and and does point about in previous times we've been on the radio is you know you know what the president's message was when he ran for president was making America great again what's the message of the house Republicans to get re elected this time\nWhat should it be it should be better stop Nancy Pelosi from getting\nOh I think it's got to do this or not I I think look if you if you like the success of the last two years\nIf you want your tax cuts to go permanent if you\nIf you believe in secure borders if you believe in energy independence if you believe in health care plan and the free independent market healthcare plan\nThat actually would work for the American people like the concierge care for blue collar workers that we talk about all the time with our buddy Dr Josh over all of those messages and constitutional originalists on the fourth I think those are all winning issues\nYeah you can put all those issues and one vessel and personalize it because Nancy Pelosi will take away all those things show reverse it will have fewer jobs show raise taxes you'll have open borders you won't have security\nNow let me tell you if they if they would listen to that which they never will because they're not a moderate party that would absolutely pretty much wrap it up by the house in my opinion\nI agree Sean where I'm the same page John do I have your support to work with Sean when we find a state or nation for him to run in for the highest\nCould operate we can go now to yes or no he could run out and I got when they're\nOn like your ... your way by the way we're checking out your high school yearbook\nRight now [laughter] I've never looked at it I didn't know freaking idea what the hell my God\nI Know you're not exactly run for the Supreme Court but if if the check out\nThose are the half of my junior
