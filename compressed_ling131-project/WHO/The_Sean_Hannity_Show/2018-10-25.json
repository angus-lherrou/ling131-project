Maxine Waters repeatedly you know create a crowd confront them in restaurants department stores gas stations and I wanted anywhere anymore\nAnd now today the media as quick as well let's talk Radio's fault it's Fox News's Paul this is Trump's fault no it would be you know the rhetoric from the left and all these incidents I Know you're a single person speak out ever\n... you know here's a fact nobody right now knows anything about who's responsible for and whether or not these were actual bombs that's not even been confirmed yet\nMaybe they meant to look like bombs maybe it's the white powder was meant to look like rice and or or some type of other you know poison we don't know yet we did we do know three weeks ago rice and letters were sent to President Trump\nSecretary of defense Mattis FBI Director race CIA director Gina Haspel that we know anyway former NYPD Commissioner a Bernie carry it gets where there's a book by the way it's phenomenal\nThe grave above the grave commissioner of the police department of New York I call him commission\nA dam bond Gino former Secret Service agent his best selling book is out now is called Spygate welcome both of you to the program today the president condemning whoever is responsible for sending these items and even then he's getting criticized you know you would think listening to the media that it was him who sent them\nAnd meanwhile they've been silent with all these public confrontations Bernie look\nI've lived in New York a long time um it's been a while I don't get mail anymore but I've had the white powder scare and how to an assistant a mind quarantine for about nine hours while they were testing out whether anthrax spores were in the package it turned out thankfully that was not the case we saw that a lot after nine eleven\n[noise] you know was shown it this kind of reminds me of that because the after nine eleven I think it was the first month anniversary a after nine eleven we actually got anthrax or at city hall\nWe got it at a B. C. N. D. C. I remember getting a call from Tom Brokaw she's producers I'm In and this is what that reminds me of however uh people have to keep in mind right now we don't know if these\nThese devices are real um we don't know who sent them what the purpose was\nUm we're going to hear about a lot of false alarms and the next two days perhaps um but I Would and and I think Dan may agree with me here [noise] I Would predict given that they found these devices says and they got that without detonating than\nUh I predict they're going to have somebody they're going to have a target suspect with the next two or three days\nWhat makes you think that Bernie well listen when you detonate to stuff or you know you blow up the pieces gets harder to collect the evidence that you could send who uh who runs took a machine right so\nNow you have a package itself or the mail or the the stamps were writing the device little side they're going to break this stuff down\nWherever how long it took to find the Unabomber remember that case\nYeah but you know what Sean tons of different times of different technologies get sprint know mailing list of those different areas and there are so many packages ... who's a this is a benefit to law enforcement right now\nIn other words they have more packages and and look on the surface it would look like the Amazon gene okay it's going to Democrats it's going to a liberal CNN that might people might think well this might be right off the top of their head that first suspect would be well might be some\nRadical conservative but we don't know that we don't know anything right now\nYou know and and there's\nA lot of the way I wouldn't even call them they wouldn't be a conservative they'd be an anarchist if they were\nYeah I mean this is going to be condemned as it should be by everybody I mean no one is set devices are no don't when with a straight face acceptable in polite conversation and sent the vices violence on public officials and anyone who does\nUm is a moron and Savage I think there's a period full stop there but with regard to the Unabomber thing show and you're right it it it takes them a long time but remember what the Unabomber he was a little more tactically a strategically devious he would send those bombs and it'd be an extended period of time between each one where he actually develop\nA new kind of a ... let's say ways to put those in construct those bombs together is very difficult with this they're basically you know ... ... nations whoever this was you may have done this\nSo it's going to be really hard for them not to have left behind in any of these multiple devices\nAny clues but there's a part of me that believes Sean that\nThis person or persons um wanted to be caught I mean some of the stuff is amateurish Sean I'll give you a quick example I mean one of these devices sent the CNN was addressed the John Brennan\nWho doesn't work at the end I mean it's not hard to figure out you just go to the Internet and you could figure out to John Brennan and you know an NBC comedies not a CNN country of this is just basic stuff I mean think about if you were a enough of the Savage in an animal to want to hurt someone or hurt someone in the mail processing facility\nYou think you do like basic homework like that so it's very amateurish the construction of it um from my experience and this is amateurish as well and\nYou know I agree with the a former commissioner that I I think it'll be a matter of a few days before someone or or a group of people are caught I Hope they are but\nEverybody hopes they are um and you know usually these things come in rapid succession a commissioner and I would expect that that might be the case here although it seems to slow down so down at least for today\nWell listen you started on Monday was Soros right when you had a number of these things come in today we'll see what happens to borrow\nA like I said we're also going to hear a lot of false alarms in the aftermath of the anthrax attacks in New York City when he got ... just in New York city\nThere were hundreds and hundreds of false alarms of the next two weeks\nSo we'll hear about that but um you know I I agree with that I think within a couple of days um they're going to have a target or at least you know somebody there to look at because there's just way too much here um that's been captured\nWouldn't you first be looking for some radical fringe we often after these for example school shootings find that people telegraph what they're going to do ahead of time and\nI've got to assume here that maybe that would be the case as well that this was some type of radical extremists that that maybe doesn't like certain politicians or could it be and were Harris I mean you just don't know right\nNow given the right one your your analysis of the school shooting is absolutely correct the secret service did an exhaustive study on that Sean and that is exactly what they discovered that a lot of these people engaged in this targeted violence even political violence political assassination that's why the secret service ironically\nGot into analyzing school shootings through the national threat assessment center they found very similar patterns of behavior that telegraphing which you just described directly so\nSo it wouldn't surprise me again given what I see paste I going to have an obviously haven't analyze these devices but having seen what the press has put out and what's in the media they seem to be a very amateurish devices as if almost somewhat either\nDidn't know what they were doing in March sophisticated enough thankfully I'm to successfully pull this off again thank God war\nThey somehow wanted to get caught like we saw on that bombing in ... in Austin but you seem to be so ridiculously amateurish that they that they almost weren't even trying to hide it and it's just a very bizarre uh this whole cases very bizarre even looked Sean even look at something like the packaging\nI notice the oversized typing and the pictures the media is put out about these devices I mean you're basically telegraphing to anyone who's done this kind of stuff like me and the commissioner who has some experience in the space\nBook this package just suspicion here's this big oversized hyping it there's\nSomething about this\nWhere in orange commissioner where where would you where would you start\nWell this is there's one other thing that that we haven't mentioned and that is uh what if it's a hoax when it's not one of these devices will what if they're not real at all in this person lunatic wherever it is I'm just wondering Mr commotion and intimidate\nA lot is a good possibility given uh what what Dan saying the the amateur hour a look of the packages I Would uh you know I'd be skeptical and uh I'd wait on the ah the outcome of the forensics\nAnd the the ... the people to see what they flying in the devices themselves\nSo we really saying is what we should do in all cases it never rush to judgment that's what you're saying I agree with what I agree with you\nMm this is a non via some on I played football for the

three British send the phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal\nBut she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project very toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you [noise]\nHey Sean great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the sameness Heidi Heitkamp director and her Washington DC campaign office\nAt speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in the battleground states to get elected what's\nSo amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never say publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of Brett is an even calling the people of Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be\nA a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video\nA there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... have the same using everything but quote people just can't know that well in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nAnd Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office and we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those uh Obama looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster but then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take your bar poster down and the staffer says well\nBecause the presses here and and we take it down and when the press comes as what Heidi Heitkamp staff say so it's more it's basically the same thing and each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to moderate voters and play to the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be settled liberate once you get selected that her staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse Overton says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again social just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that her party's told or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five\n... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that ... that's what we do it very costly confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known to be true but my point is just have integrity\nIs it's not really a left or right thing\nI was at this first them in conference with all these big hon chosen media who were ... you know very cheering and and ... and I just have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie\nTo the moderates they have to work with the moderates and that and they could only make one choice one\nFor this is not a choice it's lying is this a purposeful misinformation propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well they\nDo it's so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I've never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talked to anybody in his staff but McCaskill asked to be a special prosecutor to investigate project\nVera ties to investigate hair on camera speaking her own words or are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone none it it it it her way back to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated his like someone telling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's\nIt's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri they're just Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something else Sean if it's wrong for me to go Under Cover and record these folks\nThen how wrong is it for them to mislead the voters if it's ... it's not fraud for me to record people\nBut it's certainly approaches fraud for her to misrepresent in such an awful way\nAnd and thank you Claire McCaskill for doing that and asking for me to be prosecuted because now every TV station in Missouri every single one has covered these videos and I think the same things that happen in North Dakota this week you\nP.\nAs\nWe continue with James O'Keefe project very top dot com now it is Heidi Heitkamp joining the British citizen and Claire McCaskill art anybody else on tape coming\nOh yeah now Sean I think with the thing that's happened in New York City that's that's you know we've got to monitor the media closely here because they're not talking about violence against Democrats are but we do have a number of other states next week I I I'm Wondering if I should say the names of the states I don't know\nI think yeah I I I think you should give it a little man I\nI you know we've got we got something happened in the southwest in the southeast and the thing that's remarkable about these states we've already have them are getting a little bit more we still have undercover\nPeople in play is the ... in it this is the theme there's supposed to represent their states their constituencies but they say they don't they say it's all about Schumer it's all about the national wave we don't care about our own people in the states that they're going to see next week\nAll right great work project ... dot com James O'Keefe quick break right back a lot more news to get to\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nThink ...
