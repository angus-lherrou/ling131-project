I think as we sit here right now it's easy to to feel like that is going to because you know when when we talk about going ten and two it's going to feel like I was the better team in every game this this season you know up until maybe Indianapolis or the ball game right ... or ... or given that they play the way they played it in the next few weeks\nThat being said I mean if we're sitting in Indianapolis attending to playing for a big tent title is going to be hard to to look back and say it was a hollow season that it wasn't a successful season even if you lose that game and go to a ball game even even if you lose a ball game I mean think about twenty Fifteen that didn't end well\nBut that wasn't a bad season there was nothing hollow about that right like\nThere's an extent to which we all just need to enjoy the ride and as we sit here a couple of hours after another heartbreaking loss that we feel like I should have won the game or could very well could have won the game it's easy to say well no matter what happens we're always going to look back but think about oh too\nIs that a hollow season because we should've beat Iowa State and gone undefeated no absolutely not then went to the Orange Bowl that was fantastic right now it's easy to feel hollow and it does feel that way and it feels like no matter what happens we're going to look back and say or what could have been what should've been I I really don't think in December we're going to feel that way\nTyler probably should have prepared you for this okay yeah expectations of fans are\nAre different yeah they're they're just very different that when I hear that when I hear a fans say man if we finished the season ten and two and lose to Ohio State of Michigan a potential national championship team and we're ten in three going to a ball game is that an empty\nSeason hell no I can ... and I can promise Iowa fans that\nBefore we even get there if we win next week and we win the week after that this is going to start to go away right now it hurts it hurts deals like your six and six on the year ... and it hurt so bad it hurts bad because I ... in fans' eyes and it's\nHard to describe this from a from a player's perspective to fans for about ... perspective but I'm In fans' eyes it feels like the only two games that mattered this year we've lost a hundred percent forget I was I promise that those six wins matter um\n[noise] it's you know especially as you mentioned before Purdue is not going to be an easy game right westerns not going to be an easy game if we're if we get to ten and two we're going to be ... we're we're going to be feeling good and if we are sitting in a big tent championship\nOr we haven't lost in at that point for five weeks Hawkeye fans are going to be very happy\nAnd I don't want to fit like Joe I don't want you sitting at home if this team does in nine and three that's still a really good season yeah ... it's not special you know we're not talking about going to a Rose Bowl or something like that it's still a nine seats and yeah which is better than a lot of experts thought this would be at the beginning of the year\nYeah right now it's easy to talk about the what is absolutely that's what we what we want to do yeah and and there's another side that people don't talk about which is that the ... the fans of Penn State are also talking about the what ifs fans of Penn State right now are are saying wow we could have won that game by three touchdowns\nYou know how often do we snap it out in the end zone twice how often\nIt you know so they have a bunch of what ifs on that side as well and so it's not just a one sided what if game um which which a lot of people forget\n... going back quickly to something we're just talking about a Hawkeye headquarters once winter it's ad hoc I H queue\nHas a video of the the the side judge the field judge in the in the end zone on that killer interception and he actually takes two steps out into the field and begin to raise his hands he's either going to call a uh a timeout or delay of game of according to this sweet but you see very clearly he's about to stop that play\nAnd then write as he's about to they snap the ball\nIt's a trigger warnings because I mean right now I don't want to watch that again it's it's like watching a car accident [noise]\nMost of the time we're talking to

million in ah my four oh one K. retirement\nAnd I'm currently at Seventy five twenty five but I'm look I'm actually thinking about going if the I'm about five years out from retirement\nAnd what are the options that we have in our fond of wondering if you could help me is a it's an income on it says it is a stable value fun but it is not a mutual fund\nOn it provides to seek a secure rate of return with low risk to invest in print and what other things when I look at the portfolio analysis\nIt says it's Seventy percent made up of synthetic kicks and thirty percent of traditional kicks could you explain those two to ...\nYeah um [noise] the thirty percent of traditional kicks a gift being a ... a generally\nUnused acronym for guaranteed investment contracts I prefer the letter\nBut ah the thirty percent in guarantee an investment contracts means that they have contracts in place to earn a specified rate of interest over a specified term\nFor thirty percent of the portfolio the Seventy percent of synthetic guaranteed investment contracts means that these are contracts that have been constructed I'm probably using various forms of the resident derivatives\nThat's what scares me [noise] All right\nNow what kind of ... what kind of a yield discipline to right now\nAre currently three point five percent\nAnd the other thing that concerns me Bob is when I look at the top ten holdings\nBasically it's three insurance companies they're all well known you know a a great and I am ... ratings um but you know I Know you're for protests when I only see three in the top and\nIt just kind of scares me\nTo impossible or impossible to analyze it on the radio given the fact that they've already told you that Seventy percent of the fund is synthetic\nGuaranteed investment contracts that becomes very very difficult to analyze when they express it that way that might explain though\n[noise] the reason that as shielding three and a half percent\nAnd so the point of it is my guess is that by developing these synthetic guaranteed investment contracts they're able to earn to um offer a higher yield does that suggest that there could be an element of risk there and maybe it's an element of risk that you're not comfortable with which by the way would be perfectly understandable\nUh from my point of view\nPerfectly understandable\nFact of the matter is that um stable

holding what is on your mind today\nOh thanks for taking this call I'm a longtime subscriber in a long time listener and my question is about a pensions I'm a I'm if he's six and a half and eligible to receive a pension payment of her time in service when I hit sixty\nAnd I intend to take that and uh that call and our benefits they said that a pension is a backed up by the pension benefit guarantee corporation\nAttention is going to be about thirty four hundred a month\nAnd uh that are looking up information on the ... looks like\nA for payments for twenty Eighteen on those are guaranteed for about thirty five hundred a month and benefit said they're guaranteed for up to about five thousand a month I question for you and said I have anything to worry about as far as that to income stream that portion of my income income stream in retirement\n[noise]\nWell uh it would seem to me that any pension that you have earned would be dependent on their ability to meet their pension obligations is that makes sense do you\nMake sense to me and\nDoes that stand right now\nYou know they they've been under stress their pension obligations are under funded but um [noise] that from what I understood that\nAre that the pension benefit guarantee corpus somewhat of an analogous to FDIC insurance that\nAh it's paid for by companies that participate and you're not if you have a ... a large pension or let's say whatever aid and grant or something like that it that that's not going to be covered but after a certain amount you aren't going to be Catholic am I Am I correct in that or am I mistaken\nI Would say this that I'm thirty four hundred dollars a month that's an annual pension of over forty thousand dollars a year\nSo what I what I Would check would be what the limits are on the pension benefit guarantee corporation payouts relative to what you are expecting because I mean that's what's going to determine if and if this thing winds up in the hands of a\nPension benefit guarantee then the question is will you get all or most of what you were expecting so I Would inquire at pension benefit guarantee to see what their limits are and and how that would compare to your situation\n[noise] [noise] yeah this uh this money at age sixty it it would be\nA about like maybe thirty five percent of my income stream that I counted on at sixty\nSo I mean I had uh my uh four one K. and my IRA money is is basically index fans are the best that I can with your choices model year up your act to pass a portfolio in my own personal investments are but I mean this this uh\nThis money uh would come in handy you know and and I I just want to see if it's something that I have to have to plan on and like you said well look I got look up the government website and look up pension benefit guarantee and yeah and and\nSee what the details are yeah that's what I Would do but I mean I my guess would be the worst case\nAnd this is only a guess but worst case which seemed to me you'd be likely to get a even with pension benefit guarantee you'd be likely to get a really good chunk of that pension income worst case\nThat that sort of kinda sounded like it kinda sounded like from the tables the information that I looked up yeah uh that for him out on and I'm looking to be paid at that I'd be pretty much covered and it's kind of what it sounds like you look good that is a\nPension benefit guarantee is that somewhat analogous to a FDIC insurance\nWell I think there are I don't like that can uh let me tell you why don't like the comparison nobody's ever lost the nickel\nNobody's ever lost a nickel in a in a fully insured balance by the FDIC All right they have a perfect record of paying off everybody with uninsured amount up to the insurance limit\nAnd I and I think that that's what makes your situation different because in the case of pension benefit guarantee you there are a lot of people who have only received a portion of their pension because their pension that they earn was greater than what pension benefit guarantee pays out so that's the difference\nGot it so for what they pay out for what they pay out the percentage or the amount that they do pay out on a get a pension they're good\nFor I Believe that uh I Believe that if I were in that position I Would expect them to pay out okay you've answered my question\nThey Rob appreciate the call great to hear from Lincoln I knew someone who um had a family member and immediate family member who had earned a very very nice pension working for a company for many many years in the company went bankrupt\nWell the way you would invest and I again I really want you to complete that book before you start but uh the ... the way you invest is um you can notice for

[noise]\n[noise]\nMoney talk is about [noise] getting yourself\nInto a position where you can acquire that knowledge to manage your own personal financial future that's what it's really all about\nI Know there are a lot of people out there that the try to make money a complex topic\nI Believe that you can manage your money\nBy acquiring the basic knowledge and that you can be successful for the rest of your life once you have that basic knowledge and there are a lot of shark swimming around out there I don't think you need it\nI don't think you need I think it's something that you can do take control of your money keep the sharks out of your wallet\nBecause after all it's your money\nTaking a look at the two thousand Eighteen contribution limits I noticed that the contribution limit on\nFour one K. for all three and four fifty seven plans the base contribution limit it is now Eighteen\nThousand five hundred dollars that you're allowed to put everybody is allowed to put that qualifies under qualified program of\nFour one K. for all three be four fifty seven\nQualified program everybody is allowed now to invest Eighteen thousand five hundred dollars in that plan if you have a plan with that ... the\nFifteen hundred and forty one dollars a month that's what we're told me about Fifteen hundred and forty one dollars a month now I realize that's more than a lot of people can afford to save but this is a\nFor exchange traded mutual funds has been short and and this mislead some people had mislead some people to the point that they don't even understand that they are mutual funds if you had a correct acronym\nFor these funds it would be E. T. M. F. exchange traded mutual funds and that's the third category now the really big difference between\nOpen and funds\nThat are no load or load funds and exchange traded funds is the fact that exchange traded mutual funds E. T. apps trade during the day\nBut of course they share that trait in common with\nThe other category closed and mutual funds closed and mutual funds are generally listed on an exchange and trade during the day\nSo some people mistakenly think that the only types of mutual funds that trade during the day or exchange traded mutual funds frequently referred to as ... not true\nAnother entire class of mutual funds the closed end\nMutual funds also trade during the day the only class of mutual funds that is priced to ... only on the clothes\nThat would be the open and mutual funds now as I mentioned within the context of the open and mutual funds you have two categories you have the know load open and mutual funds\nAnd then you have the loaded open and mutual funds\nNow if you're a money talk regular you already know\nI have always concentrated on the no load open ended mutual funds because you don't pay a sales commission\nTo purchase or redeem the shares why should you there's no reason when there are thousands upon thousands of no load open and mutual funds no reason at all\nTo pay a commission to buy or redeem shares in a mutual fund so that's the opening category in the know load area and then you have the load area\nWhich can charge you five six percent or more just to buy the shares or just to redeem the shares hey that's your money going down to dream\nI don't recommend that of course of action ever\nThen of course we have the closed and mutual funds the thing you want to be aware of with the closed and mutual funds which can trade at a discount or a premium to the net as that value\nYou want to remember that if you're looking at an initial public offering there's usually about five percent commission priced in to the offering price now what does that mean that means that if you buy a closed and mutual fund\nThe initial public offering at twenty five dollars a share there's probably about a dollar twenty five and commission in that price what does that mean to you that means that you get the shaft\nBecause the twenty five dollars that you paid for that initial public offering closed and share actually\nHas a net acid value on day one\nOf just twenty three dollars and Seventy five cents if it has a five percent embedded commission which is very common place and the closed and marketplace\nThat's why there's really no reason as a general rule to be buying a closed and mutual fund on an I. P. O. Y. so that you get the privilege of paying a five percent or so commission\nWell that's no prevalent at all some people would look upon that more as a rip off so with the closed in funds once you get that now that said value at a at the same price as the share price then you have parity\nFrequently you'll see discounts in a closed and mutual fund because the price of the shares is completely dependent on supply and demand in the marketplace 'cause they trade like a stock\nAnd so it's quite common for a close and mutual fund to trade at a discount sometimes they'll trade at a premium in either case the net assets value is what it is underlying shares\nAnd that brings us back to that third category which is the more recent a category and that's\nThe exchange traded mutual fund so anytime you hear E. T. F. always remember this because very few people will tell you this but I Will whenever you hear that acronym ATF\nThe true accurate the true accurate it\nWould be E. T. M. F. exchange traded mutual fun now exchange traded funds trade during the day and that is the big difference between the exchange traded mutual fund and the open and mutual fund the open and mutual fund his price\nSo and the clothes every business day and can be trends acted purchased or redeemed on that price every day whereas the exchange traded mutual fund the ATF\nThat's trading all during the ... a trading day depending on which exchanges listed on so these are the fine points the key points to know\nWhen you're talking about mutual funds open ended mutual funds which are priced to ... at the clothes each day based on the net assets that you of the securities within the fun\nAnd they can be no low which means you don't pay a commission to buy a redeem or they can be low which means you get hit over there but the commission either to buy or to redeem and I see no reason to go down that road\nThen the second category the closed and mutual funds that we talked about in detail and then the third category which is the relatively newer category the exchange traded mutual funds\nAnd that's the agency on mutual funds I bought breaker [noise]\nMoney talks\nHey guys can hear from hip
