H. O.\nHoping to learn more from the Saudis ... Fox News President Trump wants more information from Saudi Arabia after it released an explanation of how journalists you mark his show he was killed he made the comment after hosting a political rally in Nevada\nOr we have representative John Ratcliffe at talking about fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson well he's now saying and indicated he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore\nOr he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria ... that Glenn Simpson is in real legal jeopardy in all of this you also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia probe in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nThat was a great piece by Jonathan Turley ... three reasons Mahler may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker now saying the FBI failed to provide a\nFederal surveillance court with important evidence well we don't that now for a long time and we know that\nFor Pfizer court judges\nOr handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lives that was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through ... from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele a foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the ...\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate in the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the pies that judges that it was Hillary Clinton that paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we're finally beginning to get to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so Jason shape it's just what\nA former congressman now on Fox News contributor author of New York times best seller the deep state we have a Victorian tons singing Joe diGenova of the gentleman ... with us ah thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your will house and it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request\nAs they seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issue a subpoena when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or committee I can issue a subpoena but the only way to on for that is for the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the deejay won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\nThat the name that people need to also familiarize themselves with is mark Elias market why it was ...\nHe was counsel for the DNC he was careful for Hillary Clinton he was counsel for a ... group he was involved there\nThis this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name along with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that\nWas going to plead the fifth and can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think it's important\nThey should make him show up and do it in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth\nIt's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and and I hope they send you were talking to your former French and telling them to get them to uh get in to the Congress to take this ad and I don't care if they're not trained cute\nI'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got a subpoena you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later\nYou don't say oh my he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now we have to think about in and he said Pina and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it they say that I I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... the gang of eight information the three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office or Joe diGenova but you know the idea why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying oh I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on the horse and get some ... but let me just say this because this is really important all the names that you heard Michael fuss Mr he'd lie with Simpson\nOr all those people they are key to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom between the Congress has an important issue a subpoena score we now know that the FBI or am I fix\nAnd that you see a cue to conduct electronic surveillance of American city citizens on foreign soil without legal authority to do so\nAnd that information was in fact conversations of George Papadopoulos\nWere intercepted and in the course of intercepting those compensation they found out that Papadopoulos was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never gave information to the by the court\nYou know it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testifying that in the the nine months of the investigation\nLeading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all um and by the way\nEven her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end up there was something there there is no there are there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media elites strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid dossier that dossier information is leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion\nBut they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be ... begin I is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right the people that were in that meeting and river the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after\nA district Colombia's relieved of his duties but just before Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being most candid about what was going on there but\nEach of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition uh transcribed under oath\nOr before Congress you don't have these five minute little you know after you have questions when you do this and I've been in these they go for an hour for the Republican than the Democrats get time than another hour for Republicans and you can really get in depth information if they would do it that way\nWell Victoria I think that's true and that's right and that's just an that's fair but\nThe obstruction continually I Will take a break we'll come back more with Jason Chaffetz and Joe diGenova also Victoria Toensing with us\nI Want to remind you our friends at my pillow they have

Kavanaugh hearings during the hearings which is fine that was free speech I didn't have any problem with that at all but I think we've gotten to the point where we're going to have to kick out citizens so that the men and women are no longer is get to walk the halls\nWithout what's now becoming I think it's dangerous confrontations own and I met her\nIn protest on the left and in the right

U.S in Saudi Arabia that they say ... was murdered by Saudi operatives of except the president say they didn't get any tape but this time\nThey have a pro government newspaper reporting that quiz show geese apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing\nWell I Would assume that watch exist in this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out and body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but before leaving reality Pompeo told reporters at the Saudi leaders made no exception who they would hold accountable\nSo now according to the British newspapers are saying circus of fish or Turkish officials have a recording of blah blah blah and that that in fact happened on the apple watch and you have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely the show that you could have broadcast signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nYou know I think what's happened clearly as the Turks and the Saudi ... had the Saturday counselor wired\nTransmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's going on\nAnd we'll find out in this case um my take I think it probably all happen but I don't think we should rush to judgment because the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later\nJoining us now Dr Sebastian Gorka former White House advisor was brand new book is phenomenal by the way why we fight defending the feeding rather not defending the feeding America's enemies with no apologies also Dan Hoffman Fox News contributors thirty or CIA op operations officer\nA doctor Gorka I assume you agree with me that all signs point to the Saudis assassinating murdering this guy in a a far Paraguay that's what I'm thinking\nYou know the visit ruin in warfare or report from the battlefield must be questions\nUh I think this man is dead\nWhether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain that this individual was caught between two nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world\nThat's the new often I'm an avid wand regime of turkey and the birth place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was caught in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate this man was a journalist wasn't an American so well that trying to spin it was a foreign national resident who was a common pay ... he wrote commentary\nAnd he has a long decades long history of ... the Muslim Brotherhood that is also related to the figures Arab arms deal out of the twenty first century ... so all of these things are total statements of factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hot but it's been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have you back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years\nUm my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murdered and the most evil rooted brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth now there's no doubt we're going we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nI I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen Saudis\nTraveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived at the cost of the day that Chris Yogi entered and we know he just show again never exited the costs ...\nA week do the makeup of those of the Fifteen Saudis for them apparently part of ... one of them the forensic doctor you referred to as listening to music well allegedly just remembering\n... body after he was killed\nOr what we don't know\nWhat was the orders that were given for these Fifteen Saudi and who gave them the orders and then to hold that they report posts for them\nThose are all questions we need to answer\nThat President I think was a hundred percent right to dispatch and secretary state they gather the fact emphasize that they were a shoe of greatest concerns what will get the facts with accuracy and a lack of the that's what matters I Will remind the listeners that when Sergei Filin power with poison back in March\nBritish home secretary rods that they\nNeeded a voice speculation while we allow the police to carry on their investigation I think that's what's going on here in the last thing I Would highlight is that Well Secretary palms hey was needing and doing it is public diplomacy I'm quite sure what the the FBI legal ads that say in Riyadh\nAnd the other in a central or in in ... probably meeting with their Turkish and Saudi counterparts to collect the evidence but it to be a part of reviewing it showing\nYou know it's I Wish everything could fit in nicely neatly into a box assuming that I Believe that the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince is denying it\nI'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but knowing that there are very different country but\nNow it gets complicated because fall so the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the Iranian had you had money in the region and their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that would cause the entire world\nUm I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia where Don where this with that\nUm I think this will be consequences severe consequences the president said\nBut it gets a little rougher what do you do if you're also trying to battle another enemy I mean the United states did partner with our arch enemy is the former Soviet Union to defeat a Nazi ism in World War two\nYeah absolutely I mean you you don't make the perfect the enemy of the good\nGeopolitics is like politics itself domestically it is the author of the possible ... all over the perfect\nI'm On the truth is wrong we have a lot of a matter of rich or with Saudi Arabia or at the beginning of the Trump Administration we established very very good ties through a and B ... bombers been found them in a vote those relationships are not going to be tested\nBut this is a nation that survival depends upon our support militarily and I'm ... and training so there's a lot but reachable average against Saudi Arabia but you're absolutely right this is part of a\n... I Wish we were to leverage did in the last eight years when Obama was president we know knowing that gays and lesbians were killed were routinely and Christians and Jews are persecuted and women are treated like fourth class citizens I mean you know that never seems to come up when there's a Democratic president\nShould kind of give you one example of how bad it was so this guy who was a deep deep sympathize with the Muslim Brotherhood President Obama when he went on his global opponents tools and he started it in Egypt who worked in the front row\nOf that event sitting back to show the environment five you're Obama White house the Muslim Brotherhood's chief representatives that how big a difference in the lecture and make sure you know\nA Dan Hoffman what are your thoughts\n[noise] well you know it's a bit of a self inflicted well Shawn from the Saudis I mean if if\nIf the two countries that are most pleased about if is Iran and Russia they did absolutely nothing to call what is a risk now between the United states and Saudi Arabia I really believe that there are certain elements of our relationship that has to be immune\nComplications from each one in one flu virus that's why I'm urging people my age to get vaccinated vaccination is safe and is the most effective way to prevent the flu get the facts go to Lou dot Gov together we can all fight the flu and that this time the U.S department of health and Human Services and\nFox News on Del Walters of Manhattan in Georgia a police officer approaching a suspicious car parked at a school shot and killed\nWe had officers or go out on a vehicle Shiloh middle approach shots fired by the beauty of the best shot\nThere may have been on fire haven't\nRented county police sergeant Jake Smith President Trump announcing that the U.S is pulling out of a long range missile treaty\nRussia has not had here today agreement so we go to Germany that different than we are going to develop their weapons if they get smart and others can bar and they say let's not developed these horrible nuclear weapons I Would be extremely happy with that\nThat treating dating back to Nineteen eighty seven this\nIs Fox News [noise]\n... presents\nVarious rating the wonder\nNow through Sunday and Wells Fargo arena begins at ... dot com\nI everybody of anti Bonnie here for mid west\nBasements systems I Know you've heard us talk about the quality service in basements solutions from Midwest\nBasements systems but did you know they also do concrete repair well like what I mean you've got a sidewalk or a driveway or a patio that just is not leveled out anymore maybe you need some help with that the people to mid west basements systems can do it\nThey are engineered proven product is redefining the quality speed and durability of concrete repair you really should see this an accident they make a few dime sized\nTold and your driveway slabs sidewalk ingrained in slap for that matter can they get to high density thumb that lifts and level is to get you back on solid ground they can feel your cracks and joins to prevent further water penetration now the old method of doing this is called ... where they used a pun concrete in large holes to lifting them up but this new policy\nWell why should we overtime isn't nasty and you can even drive on it after jak Fifteen minutes Midwest basement system dot com or call five one five to eight nine sixteen zero thanks for ... days many talent anti by anything today\nOvernight I only see twenty thirty unable to try to win the south west intended twenty\nAllowing for high to climate to eat and they didn't have her fifties fraternal Thirteen I meet her I'll just amber Alexander\nCloudy and thirty six in Des Moines news radio ten forty W.

H. has made a weather forecast and ... and ... they had\nSome in sixty nine at W. H. B. analysis you trust the me too movement has resulted in office is being reluctant to hire\nNeed to know what Jeff Angelo I'll talk to a business expert and asked how your office that affect the tomorrow it nine news radio ten forty doubled you wait Joe back\nOn Monday talk thank you for joining us and certainly on our broadcast over the years we have discussed some some some critical factors that you can incorporate it into your investment management to help you along the way and we've talked in detail about a number of these not the least of which\nIs diversification\nWhere you are diversifying your portfolio money over a many different investments not putting all of your eggs in one basket and we've talked in detail and you know it's something that's come up and that is the issue of how much money you put it in any one stock how many times can you recall\nThat people have called into the broadcast investors have called in and said well you know I have all my money in this stock or most of my money or whatever\nAnd it's just not good investments sense to do that because what you do when you concentrate your investments in one stock did you expose yourself to something that is known as specific company risk\nAnd specific company risk is a big deal if you focus on just one company\nBecause if something goes wrong with the business model or in some other way something goes wrong with your company like Enron for example than the money's gone and that's the reason that we have talked so many years about our four percent guideline\nAnd our four percent guideline is basically a an offshoot of modern portfolio theory that's all it is and in modern portfolio theory it has been documented that if you own twenty five stocks\nA lot different than all your money in one or two stocks if you own twenty five stocks\nWith an application of about four percent for a full portfolios as soon as you're doing your own stock picking\nIf you owned twenty five stocks across many different industries not twenty five drug stocks not twenty five tech stocks only five stocks across many different industries that what you can do in that portfolio is you can um achieve a level of diversification\nThat will avoid this problem of all my wanting money in one stock all my money in one industry group\nAnd that is really a very very strong tenet of investment management that idea of diversification and then there's asset allocation especially someone that's approaching or in their retirement years\nAsset allocation makes so much sense where they're going to adopt a balanced investment portfolio where they're going to have a portion of their portfolio allocated to the stock market\nAnd that includes a portion of that in the international community stock market and then they're going to have a portion of their investment portfolio and the fixed income area\nAnd there are many different ways to invest in fixed income securities and many of those are government guaranteed slug FDIC insured CDs or treasury instruments\nSo as an allocation is another of the key tenets of investment management keeping expenses low is something we've talked about on this broadcast for more than a quarter century because when you keep those expenses low on your portfolio\nThat means that there's more money going into your pocket and less money going into an advisors pocket and that's good because you wind up with more money at the end of the day\nAnd so keeping expenses them is a big deal and you know a good part of that can be done by incorporating something we've talked about and that's including index funds in your portfolio index funds might be the total stock market index there might be the S. and P. five hundred they might be the um\nNow they might be the Russell three thousand but index funds can go a long way to doing two things virtually keeping your expenses down which is great and secondly guaranteeing you you're not going to under perform you cannot under perform [noise] on the index portion of a portfolio [noise]\nThis is America is money program [noise] where it's all about the money [noise]\nThat it's incredible that we don't have it today but we don't have it's a day on a national basis we have it here we have it there\nAnd I'm Talking about of course it would cover all the bases that many of which we've talked about on Monday talk over the years that are so important to young investors young people coming out of school\nWho\nIn many cases have no knowledge of what's going on out there which makes them what it makes them shark bay because they don't know what they're doing and people take advantage of them we see it all the time\nBasic fundamental finance for example ah there's so many areas that have to be covered in this course for example mortgage finance teach the youngsters about thirty year fixed rate loans\nFifteen year adjustable rate tell them the benefits and the potential negatives\nOf each mortgage finance and you imagine when you have no background and is going on and getting a mortgage you have no idea what you're doing\nCertainly another area of this two semesters senior year mandatory course would be tax privileged investing teach the youngsters above\nThe four o one K for all three be four fifty seven benefits teach them about the IRA benefits so many things to learn in tax privileged investing a major topic for the youngsters\nTeach them the magic of compound rate of return the magic that so many of our money talk listeners have enjoyed\nOver the years compound rate of return has been called the eighth wonder of the world no wonder when you consider what it can do for a long period of time\nTeach them about interest rates what about interest rates what happens when they rise what happens when they fall\nAnd the different maturity so they're ranging from the federal funds rate than overnight rate set by the Federal Reserve all the way up to the thirty year bond and even longer and some bonds certainly\nGives them an introductory effort on the Federal Reserve because I think that the typical high school graduate we have very little to answer on any questions about the Federal Reserve and some basic information\nAbout how monetary policy has conducted would be in valuable\nFor these ah these young students along with that of course would come and understanding of basic economic theory\nThese are all topics that could be included in this to semester mandatory senior year high school course that should be on the books right now everywhere certainly talk about taxes tax rates what it means to you\nCertainly how the progressive tax system works in the income tax all of these topics would be major areas of interest that could be covered in this course obviously\nInflation because it is inflation that degrades you're purchasing power over time must talk about the topic of inflation and all of the others to maybe we can hope that someday the discourse\nWill be on the books in all of the high schools around the country but until that time we will for the most part we will continue to graduate high school students that no little or nothing\nAbout any of these topics and you know what that's really sad because this is something that can actually be used on an everyday basis to live a life\n\nI bump Brinker this has money to

[noise]\nIs money to [noise]\nWe are back on America's money program and we thank you for joining us it is great to have you with us John is on the line in San Ramon John it is your term welcome\nTo find out junk the increase in the national debt as a result of the tax bill or if you believe that there will be an inability of the United states to cover it\nTerm I'm borrowing\nNeeds and or whether or not if you do agree that the United states faces or a bankruptcy and the next well much\nI don't think we have a bankruptcy and the next twelve months John but I I have to tell you that there was nobody in Washington with any power\nThat I'm aware of that cares at all about the national deficit or the national debt the annual deficit or the national debt\nIt seems as though the whole topic of the national debt in the annual deficit has completely vanished from the radar screen I'm not hearing anybody in Washington DC\nIn a position of power talking about the topic is vanished got the debt to Dennis Dennis ... advantage what\nDo you have a concern over the uh the short term that we could face a some financial\nBecause of our ah inability to to borrow the money necessary to cover our short term debt even if it's not\nA ... ... well ah for the next twelve months I can speak clearly I Do not have a concern because I think that uh there are enough people out there willing to\nTrust the full faith and credit and taxing power of the usa to buy our bonds they may demand more interest going forward\nWouldn't be surprised at all going forward if they are demanding more interest for the debt but I think there are buyers out there for the debt and for the next ... months I've no question\nThat there are buyers for the debt at the prevailing right at that time whatever it might be\nAppreciate the call John thank you\n\nJane in Illinois Welcome to talk\nYeah think kill I I Want to get your opinion on that robo advisers\nWell what opinion would you like what's your question well how would you compare that to say are pretty are rolling over ... della tea or are they in art\nWell of course I'm as you know vanguard has a a a low cost advisory\nService I knew it cost something in the area of thirty five basis points which is close to one third of one percent a year look I think if a person is is out at sea without orders and they have no idea what they're doing I think they're way better off with a service like that then making a lot of mistakes\n[noise] I'll uh with a robo adviser you are saying\nWell the one that I described yes I think that if somebody has available to them something like that at a low\nCost and is going to provide them with some guidance as opposed to being out there and having an absolutely no idea in the world what they're doing\nThat's a recipe for disaster so I think in a case like that or it it makes sense to me thank you for the call money talks comes your way each and every weekend as we talk about subjects financial Steve's on the line in Nebraska Steve welcome to Monday talk\nI have a question about my four oh three at work I'm sixty years old and I keep finding the involved in keeping me for all three B [noise] that was just wondering if I convert that over to an IRA can I [noise] um [noise]\nOr they're less attribute it to an IRA compared to for three be [noise]\nSo what kind of fees are you experience\nUm well [noise] something that my uh [noise] I I kind of try to\nTake your advice like with your opening monologue with uh doing most of my work myself and not trying to utilize it to save save money on those have well it turns out that he's charging me these days anyway [noise]\nAnd and that I don't appreciate that especially when they kind of told me that they weren't going to ... have [noise]\nWell here's the deal if you if you roll your if you're eligible to roll your account or into something like a a a self directed IRA at a place like a vanguard or if it done with the\nUm I think you will find that a especially if you're using index funds which have very low expense ratio is I think you'll find it very inexpensive\n[noise]\nNow here's here's the question do you need to ask you need to find out whether you're still eligible to contribute to for all three baby if you do that\n[noise] um as far as I can determine I Am I don't I don't want to stop for all three\nNow so you want to confirm that with your only confirm that with your HR yeah yes or a very important thank you Bob\nYeah this is very very important that if you make a decision to make a change in your four O. one K. for all three be whatever like that where you're going to do a roll over\nMake sure that your HR department confirms to you that you can still make your own going contribution to your account because this can vary from plan to plant\nThe national debt is now we're ... trillion dollars what happens next rising inflation drops into the dollars value some experts say another crashes coming you can't fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins and an IRA from Augusta precious metals\nCoal eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and learn how an

eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven\nDay Joe\nThe thing is down\nAll the time for information right now is now facts find your going to use radio voice W. H. O. [noise]\nGreat to have you with us here in America is money program muddy talk\nThis is the program that works with you to help you learn how to become your own personal financial manager gets you out of the way of the shark attacks\nSo you can take charge of your financial future and your family's financial future as well we talk about everything here from investing in your four O. one K. or for oh three baby to saving for all of those important future goals education for the young sprouts\nOur view is that you can get that job done by acquiring the\nKnowledge the knowledge that empowers you to control your financial future and um\nYou can do some really good forward planning and one of the things you might want to do is take advantage of some of those tax privileged accounts that are out there\nAre lots of opportunities out there you have the opportunity to put money aside in your um your IRA program whether it be the traditional i._r._a. or the Roth IRA\nThat's five thousand five hundred dollars for those under the age of fifty\nAnd six thousand five hundred dollars for those age fifty or more even if you have a non working spouse you can open an IRA for the non working spouse as long as it's funded by you're running and has to be covered by earned income earned income\nSo that's another opportunity to put money aside you can make a fully deductibles traditional i._r._a. contribution to qualify\nAnd um\nThat's another way to get money working for the future now that way you get a duck should\nYou get a fully deductible contribution to a tradition liar way as qualified but you can also do a real die or rape you prefer if you qualify for that program the amounts are the same fifty five hundred for those under fifty sixty five hundred for fifty plus\nAnd do our income\nThresholds for Roth IRA eligibility\nAnd these are all terrific ways outstanding ways for you to put money away for the future whether it'd be in the traditional i._r._a. the Roth IRA re the most important thing of all is that you take advantage to the max that you can afford\nAnd the other most important thing of all is to absolutely take advantage\nAnd an end a minimal\nTake advantage of the full matching provision if you have a matching provision to so many companies do in a four O. one K. some for three days this is the definition of free money if anybody ever asked you what is there such a thing as free money the hazards yes\nAnd free money is represented by the matching contribution that your company will give you\nIn a four O. one K. or similar type plant because if you meet the minimum standard let's say they say well we'll give you three percent if you put in six will match half of your contribution up to six percent so you put insects they add three\nNine goes in nine percent goes in of your salary and yes that three percent the company is throwing in there that is the definition of free money that is like a raise that the company is offering you but you have to be smart enough to take it\nBy at least reaching the minimal contribution\nStandard that you would have to make but that's a great way for you to put money aside as well this is a great\nTime for you to maximize your charitable giving uh my favorite charity is the U.S funds for UNICEF which does great work for children around the world\nI Would also point out that there is a terrific provision in the tax law which is now a permanent law\nThat you can give to your favorite charities directly from your IRA this has to be done directly from your custodian to the charity or or charities of your choice so you don't handle the money you direct your custodian to make the gift or gifts\nNow in the case of an individual you're allowed to give up to one hundred thousand dollars a year\nThe your favorite charities directly from your custodian to the charities from your IRA and if you do that as part of your required minimum distribution you don't have to pay income tax on that money up to a hundred thousand\nAnd some of you I Know one person has an IRA and the spouse has an area where you can both do it\nUp to a hundred thousand each on an annual basis of your favorite charities instructor your custodian\nTo make those gifts you may have been planning to make 'em anyway it'll give cash give or indeed money because you're not going to have to pay income tax on this money\nThat had to come out of the IRA anyway as part if you had it as part of a required minimum distribution so there's no reason to pay more than you have to pay\nThis especially true sense if your ducking charitable contributions you know if you're a high earner that they do take away your deductions as your income increases\nFor those of us would\nLike information on my market timer investment letter

M. D. amount what you're going to do is it you're going to add up all of your pre tax accounts\nYour traditional i._r._a. your role over IRA you're ... if you're not working or are you still working right now are you actively contributing to an employer plan\nA I'm not working part time only but I'm not contributing to unemployed on that\nOkay so if you were working you would be able to exclude that current four one K.\nBut you're going to add up all your pre tax accounts traditional i._r._a. roll over four one K. you are not going to add the Roth IRA a value in your calculation\nUm and so what you basically have the pre tax you're going to exclude the Ross ah and then this is actually when we're building um when we're building income plans for people we look at different and distinct ah categories of investments the pre tax the raw or the brokerage account any savings\nAnd so as we're trying to figure out how to you know get people that paycheck that retirement pay check the the money will come from different places\nNow have you ever thought about so you've got this Ross and you've got the pre tax accounts have you ever gone through any sort of Ross conversion calculation have you ever considered anything along those lines\nWere not on a heck of a considered it I'm done on okay about four years ago I'm I'm going to be doing another one\nBecause this is my last year that solve the seven and a half next year I'm going to do a second raw conversion from a traditional our right\nThe the issue that kind of um the sidelines a lot of people is that so what what happens with these Ross conversions is you have these pre tax amounts you effectively take a distribution\nI. E. earned income for whatever you want to move from the pre tax Ira over to the Ross\nSo a lot of different factors um you know ... kind of old way on the viability of this move but your taxes are now what they're going to be a leader your overall financial situation but the thing that trips up a lot of people is their ability or inability to pay taxes\nOn the distribution with outside of the IRA money\nSo as long as you have the ability to pay that tax burden with outside the IRA money and as long as you've gone through the calculations you should be fine\nOkay great great\nAwesome well Thomas thanks for calling the show and a really have a great week thank you very much\nNow it's time for this week's portfolio review and this is we're anti dives deeply into a portfolio that's been sent to us\nAnd this week Andy's review has his Social Security twist to it and that's perfect because we're trying to help Americans today with a limited free offer for a portfolio review that includes a Social Security analysis\nNow a reminder make sure you consult with an advisor before acting on anything that we discuss and you can find a local advisor by going to investing sense dot com\nSo now this week's review Larry says his portfolio and he writes\n... if you plan to take Social Security and you have a sizable four one K. does the draw from the four one K. impact Social Security payments suppose I make Fifteen thousand dollars part-time draw Social Security and pull sixty thousand dollars how will that sixty thousand dollars impact Social Security\nHey great question Larry let me tell ya Larry's got a pretty cool story we went back and forth over email the first thing that I asked Larry was when is all of this going to come together you've got\nHis reply to yeah he said I plan to retire in the next eight to Nineteen months I'm sixty one I'll be sixty two in January and I want to work part time next year I have about one point four million in a four O. one K. and three hundred thousand in cash\nI Know if I go over a certain cap while on Social Security I'm I'm not going to get the full benefit\nRight so the rule that Larry is referencing only applies when you reach full retirement age and that's when your earnings no longer reduce your benefits no matter how much you earn now\nIf you're younger than full retirement age and you make more than the annual earnings limit\nYour earnings may actually reduce your benefits so it's based on this for retirement age right for Americans born between Nineteen forty three and Nineteen fifty for your full retirement age is sixty six\nA beginning with you guys born in Nineteen fifty five two months are added for every ... year until\nThe full retirement age reaches sixty seven\nFor Americans born in Nineteen sixty or later\nSo what are the Dutch and to the benefits in case you reach the earnings limit\nIf you're under full retirement age for the whole year\nSocial Security ... a dollar from your benefits for every two dollars that you earn above the annual limit and for twenty Eighteen that limit is Seventeen thousand forty dollars\nNow if you can imagine it gets a little bit more complex in the year you reach full retirement age", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "21"}
