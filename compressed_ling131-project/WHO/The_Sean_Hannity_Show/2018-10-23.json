H. O. [noise]\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news propaganda severe weather station news radio ten forty W.\nI. Gary Barrett go with your weight your radio news our top local story they shower Fort\nOr apparently some people are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's\nHusband being accused of some type of me to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere\nI'm here's what is anecdotally something that I think should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you this if you want to predict it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida it'll do a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida as important Florida I think he won his races by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe not the best politician with the best gift of gab or ... or but boy when it comes to getting the job done with\nThe people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with uh we've got infinite whatever reason the media's fall in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd you know run to set the suffered a great debate last night and he is now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax they Gillum would support Gillum is use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views\nIs trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected by being honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe and what they really want to fight for we saw that with ... and the project berets as tape and the great state of Tennessee\nAnyway you know run the Santa sees in a fight for his life down in Florida\nWe got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but\nYou know for whatever reason Britain is out there trying to convince the people of Tennessee that he is something that he is not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water\nAs they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and saying that his public position on Brett Kavanaugh is just for show and we saw the same thing and the tapes in Missouri with Claire McCaskill\nYou know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony\nShe goes on to an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets looks so Harvey tour\nWith with wings unbelievable\nBut some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it is in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice cos\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not going to not take care of you we pay the healthcare costs we pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody's against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process\nThat we have sovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected\nAnd what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront\nAt the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry I mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texas alone\nVictims of crimes some very serious including murder\nI mean it gets downright scary now we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the weekend confronted some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing them throwing those out the the door of the restaurant\nNow it's almost happening on a daily weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you but I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to what we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare their fundamental promises which was keep your doctor keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for in theory or coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and healthy to buy plans they never want needed or desired and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled or Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year or and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer and heart attack\nBut the anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or evaporating before his eyes\nEven his Democratic colleagues don't think it's going to happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate have faded in the final weeks of the twenty Eighteen electorate with a party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber\nIt's a far cry from pretty much the last year and a half oh we're gonna we're gonna take control of the house in the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away it looks like it's going to be a Republican pickup Martha mix Sally is going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean there's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support it skipped Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo now we have top Democrats are urging caution on the blue wave to temper expectations of new Fox\nA poll has come out top Democrats now they're spending their time managing expectations about quote the blue wave\nAnd sweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill urging caution about those predictions mid fresh signs at the midterms are much closer than anticipated Democratic National committee chair Tom for as it was still hasn't condemn Keith Ellison\nSaid today that he doesn't use the term blue wave to talk about a possible victory for the party even though house minority leader Nancy Pelosi has her eyes on the speaker's gavel said just days earlier that we're looking at a democratic tsunami\nLook I Can't look I don't have a crystal ball I all I Know is winning everything is possible\nI can see a scenario where Rick Scott wins in Florida Ron dissenters becomes the governor Marsha Blackburn wins in Tennessee Martha Black ... Marshall ... Martha ... Sally wins in Arizona\nWhere we have Dean Heller holds the seat in Nevada which is tough that's a tough state tough race a lot of money being poured against him\nWhere I can see Claire McCaskill getting the exit sign Jon Tester getting the exit sign and Heidi Heitkamp saying goodbye and even Joe Donnelly the problem for the Republican Braun in the state of Indiana is well in his particular case he's got a libertarian in the race\nAnd that means that the libertarian siphoning votes away from the Republican wrong\nBut Mike Braun is now claiming that you know a Brett Kavanaugh surge citing internal polling is now as a leading will see in Fifteen days\nYou know if you look at all of this and add to all of this this was an opportunity one bit of anecdotal evidence we have you know they say voter enthusiasm for the Democrats is at an all time high but you know crazy uncle Joe Biden was at a rally in Vegas on Saturday in an attempt to boost\nDemocratic Senate candidates according to the a P he drew a pathetic five hundred people\nA hundred and thirty thousand people have signed up they want to go see the Trump cruise rally tonight\nI mean amazing I was down in Houston in Beaumont, Texas this weekend and and doing a a town hall with Ted Cruz and then we have four thousand people or around there a moment at a huge crowd in Houston as well\nWe're doing better than crazy uncle Joe Bernie Sanders is warning his party that there is no blue wave coming and he also says that you can't win elections by alienating half the population and I hate to say it but I agree with Bernie you're absolutely right\nAnd you've got to force the hypocrisy so we got\nOver ... very very scared and they are scared\nRefined topics that are hard to scream in major blow in\nListen if you dare\nComing from the radio\nNews radio ten forty\nNazis designed Jang ... what a difference a few years and may God Bless president Donald Trump [noise] Senator Ted Cruz getting some cash\nTaxes are going to really [noise] a man who is become a really good friend and you know we're a little difficult\nThe president no longer calling Cruz lion had his new nickname is Texas Ted former president Iraq Obama's stumping for Nevada Democrats and accusing Republicans have voter suppression\nThere are states where Republicans are actively purging voter rolls right now\nAnd the Supreme Court blocking questioning of treasury secretary Wilbur Ross over his\nDecision to ask about citizenship and the next census this [noise]\nEverybody this was banned for ... every once in a while you're kind of glad you did something but beyond that once in a while you're really glad you did something and that's what I've been hearing from friends that have gone to ... have been taking my advice and going over to ... to rally western Jordan Creek town Center for fabulous\nClothes at fabulous prices and with the change of weather it is time\nTo change out the closet fall weather means more layers warmer tones and versatile looks for work or home ... clothing always has the latest trends and the looks for the season including sewage as low as sixty nine\nNinety nine how do they do it I don't know because it's brand name stuff and it is good the staff will be happy\nTo help you find the right look for any occasion if you'd like or you can be on your own if you already know how to do that stuff ... we'll hook you up this ball with a new tailored suit and over coach too convenient location Jordan Greek town center ballad west mall in both cases up on the second level and remember when you look good you feel good when you go to\n... statue Taliban heart and sent you hard\nNews easy to find you found it here use radio ten forty doubled you wait Joe\n[noise] staying informed tone from the current events being up to date call it a little bit of birds during an era pretty much current events\nAnd knowing what's happening in the world around you I pay attention to world\nIt's what gives you an edge in ever changing world I'd\nJust keeps me the most days like today and my current events I I talk about just about everything is in the news and\nAll of that can happen here what are you waiting for seven views radio ten forty double ...

in the back of their heads hoping this happens southern or maybe something bad will happen in Trump will look bad and we can blame him as someone gets hurt\nYeah you you never know I Hope I Hope not I'm not yeah\nSame here but I Will tell you want on Saturday I had a a person from Honduras\nWho came here legally and when that lady comment is that a Republican event Saturday morning in our home town in her ... she came up to me and she said\nI and I think of this kind of stop she gives it the right way she came here legally came here because she loves this great nation where to start her goals and dreams in this great nation that's the part that upsets me the most when you see this kind of thing happened and the and the possible political implications\nAnd and motivations behind these think that's what bothers me the most and I think it is\nCommon sense Americans say look this is not how it's supposed to work you want to come to this country and you're a legitimate asylum seeker that's one thing but when eighty percent of the people who show up at our border claiming assign um aren't legitimate\nOr asylum seekers that's a problem and we know that's probably what this this group is is mostly about as well\nWe also have this issue of the mob that no Democrat seems willing to come from either I mean you know we saw what we watched Ted Cruz and his wife get out of a restaurant by an angry left wing mob we watch that happen a Pam Bondi at a movie theater we watch that happen a secretary Nielsen we watch that happen to Sarah Sanders\nA we saw Mitch McConnell go through those are the airport and then this weekend that happened a again a let me play a little of the McConnell confrontation and then you have the liberal media you know literally and then we have

countries\nYou know it's unbelievable you know what the ... you know ... uh what's her name Maxine Waters you you create a crowd you confront them you do you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore Mitch McConnell Leo country you know then we have you know Eric Holder kick them Hillary you can't be civil with somebody you disagree with\nNo this is this is is wrong and they get this is not how not having any decent people are supposed to behave and and it is you know with the part that bothers me the most Sean is Dennis To send it is a good friend of mine and he is as far left as I Am\nNot is actually a lovely guy\nHe's a wonderful guy he's a friend and he would never act that he will debate the idea that you'll show up and how the robust debate like we're supposed to win this great nation but he would never left this isn't new to this is the way it looks and and and people who believe in their position is their policy\nThat's supposed to be but what is happening now is so dangerous for this country and so so wrong and just\nLet me ask you this and this great nation opera\nHow does the president and this would be my goal the president obviously is is gonna pull back aid to some of these countries that are allowing yeah there's this caravan to move forward\nUm nobody wants to anyone to get hurt at the at the border these you know I Would assume the vast majority are innocent people but you know we're getting we're we don't know anybody I mean you could have people that are mixed in with the crowd that want to bring harm to our country but I Would assume most people come here because they want a better life\n... if they are hell bent on disobeying our laws and our sovereignty and the president then has to protect our borders how do we do it in the way that is safe is for the people that are there because I don't want to see people getting hurt at the border you don't see people the president does want to see that\nBut I Can't you can't allow them to come in either\nNo I write and this is why we've had legislation that's been introduced to Democrats once a quarter 'cause I think deep down they want the politics of this you see they don't want to solve the problem we need more judges on the border we need more ability to when people get there to hold them not this catch and release policy hold them\nHow they're have their case it due to cater to that we could find out or they legitimate or they're really fling something or or are they coming here to do harm are they part of some gay what's their background each it takes some time to do that but it takes resources it takes people\nBut if the Democrats won't allow it to pass the legislation that would put all that in place so we can get a answers quickly are much much more in a in a much more quicker and better that we do today that's the problem so quit playing politics let's solve problems and let's do it in a way that's consistent with a rule of law\nOr we'll talk more about the election Jim Jordan is with us from Ohio he'd like to be the next speaker of the house also\nWe'll get to that we do have some deep state news we haven't touched on yet Martha ...

are not just doing it to be you know in talking to all your friends whether Jim mark Louis Gates' whoever\nOr it's the same playbook which is which actually is kind of absurd when you think about

don't want them here anywhere anymore you know telling Henry Kissinger to leave the country Mitch McConnell not only did they tell Mitch McConnell to leaving the country but then they're talking about the guy smashed literally ripped\nHis leftovers I guess just maybe it's taken a meal home to somebody else and throws it outside the restaurant door banging on the guy's table somebody's going to get killed here you watch somebody is or hurt severely it it's going to happen then nobody on the left ever\nCan critique their own side for the rhetoric they're using Anthony Scaramucci is with us I just finished cover to cover his ... brand new book\nUh and it's phenomenal and it's the Inside Story about Donald Trump has called Trump the blue collar president\nAnd how billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle a blue collar Americans that won the presidency you know those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they liked the way judge Kavanaugh was treated ...\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so we're with what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light Sean like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that insect light\nWell the un has that the Trump Twitter\nInsect light and they're all going towards the light in their vaporizing a Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test\nShe's less of a Native American and your mate into the vapors ... big caravan issue the way they're handling the care of an issue if the galvanizing his base that Kavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they figured okay me too movement seems to work there is no due process in the meat you will Smith\nLet's take this guy that's a very well credentialed judge\nOr he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one and Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump\nTwitter insect vaporize or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of and uh the president's base is actually going to turn out much higher percentages and people predicted in so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate\nAnd it couldn't happen without the energy and the ... of President Trump\nWell if they do it when I'll say this he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what if you like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're gonna have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nAnd the president is is battling back on all these ... and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says they're not we're not able to do the job of\nStopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them an Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people they legally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blame the Democrats\nAre not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's just all it is as he sees recognizing with a legendary Milton Friedman onset about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your order because free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states so I don't get\nA you know ... on on on promoting my my uh my vote today in the last couple of days mom a lot a left leaning shows ... they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's\nResponse all you want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that have voted in the last I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw ... ... ... well could there answered by so\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more job\nOut of the bottom ten percent of the society shot the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies\nBut also the fact that he cut the slack at the border and so it made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving the lower middle class families shot you know to have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us all through the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get on each call them the blue collar billionaire yeah and I said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President is at the end of the day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave as a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any that are in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look where you started I you know\nSean Sean listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so clearly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspiration in America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that\nCan do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents that our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white\nFree market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies of because what we both know is that you cannot system ties or through a political system created equal outcomes never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and her kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she used to all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction is that it seems like there's no limits here but\nThere's no moderation left either ... the Democratic party ... used to be ... I I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nHave to losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nOn equal outcome so you know bad society uh even though it sounds great on paper all of your ideas when they make contact with reality or disaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people it's happened to me\nIt's happened to me on college campuses it's happened to me\nI appreciate ...\nThanks my front with Fifteen days till election day one of the important Senate races were watching is out in the great state of Arizona which by the way could be impacted by this caravan that his marching towards our southern border as we speak\nSenate candidate and war hero Martha McSally is going up against Christians cinema Christian cinema seems to be floating out there of will get the state of the race has the best election coverage continues Fifteen days till election day glad you are with us it's the Sean Hannity show\n[noise]\nWhere you'll be haunted by the voices we really very scary\nI doubt I give\nTobar ... very very scared and they are scared\nRefine topic or something that would cause people to win a major blow in\nList ...\nComing from the radio\nNews radio ten forty\nSome NATO as a caravan of some seven thousand migrants make their way through Mexico towards the U.S President Trump at a Texas rally calling for tighter border security we feel that\nThe president's been calling the march a national emergency for the U.S meanwhile former President Obama at a rally of his own in Nevada also addressing immigration there's\nNothing American about ripping immigrant children from their mothers\nDon't vote\nPresident Trump's been saying he's ready to cut it off the American aid to Honduras Nicaragua and El Salvador where most of the migrant marchers or from will and now a category for hurricane heading towards Mexico's Pacific coast with winds of one hundred and fifty miles an hour it's supposed to move north\nAnd jumps several inches of rain on Texas\nSeemed like everybody was getting threatened during those Kavanaugh hearings did Senator Grassley get threatened we ask them\nAnd did you hear about that which is a Brooklyn that put a hexagon Brett Kavanaugh we've got it all for you right now under the anti by page at WHM radio dot com when\nParking lots of good icy everyone depends on their little snow and ice control while\nThe ... the whole new striker stainless steel hoppers brothers from western\nWestern strikers British we in a leadership designed to maximize his running efficiency\nAnd just unique circular shuttered lecture provides more targeted delivery that minimizes waste and protects nearby surroundings for pickups dump bodies in blood and see the strikers for richer western dealer today this is a drug is limited to students with the northeast forty whatever they're doing or truck equipment in a\nWhile like Dr ... area Paris allegations\nOf monopoly lowly while we're right in our local news there is such a thing as a was saying like whatever parents are so dumb stuff\nGet to know your neighbors know Des Moines why\nJust normal or your door news radio morning\nYou wake Joe it's Maxwell this year's Susan G Komen race for the cure in Des Moines is almost here joined thousands walking together at the state Capitol Grounds Saturday October twenty seven and do it for a loved one friend the coworker a neighbor\nOr for yourself together let's reduce the current number of breast cancer deaths by ... percent in the U.S by twenty twenty six we can do is go to ... dot org just signed up today and room\nBeautiful sunshine of or Monday comb landed on high is being very comfortable tonight we do have a week is going to move through to just change our temperatures a little bit\nOdd tomorrow's fifty four degrees fifty five on Wednesday a lot more sunshine and pretty calm wind over the next couple of days that is the news radio ten forty W.
