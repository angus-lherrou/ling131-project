O. J. face consequences\nRegarding fight that while he signed the final buys a warrant themselves and then when he was talking about the rule of law speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least to the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one\nAnd Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nA Solomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell former FBI general council member James Baker he was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember ... and Lisa Page both took notes of the meaty and McCabe was saying yeah rod\nRosenstein had in fact said this anyway now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea of\nSarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president\nUsing the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCain had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with Medicaid\nAnd the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was the real plan being discussed set a source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI\nI remember that you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel\nAs soon as Justin ... at that time frame around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed him private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office of making those statements throw spokes person is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress\nAnswer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we're going to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is where laying out here are the top people at the upper echelon remember twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page of both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon ease but an investigative reporter is what the hell\nRag Jarrett Fox News legal analyst and of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax\nThank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated\nWe got a first start with the timeline the timeline is may twenty Seventeen or that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein just before that we had people like ... Lisa Page in and Peter Struck talking about uh media leaks strategy that had to do with the dusty a\nWhile it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes and again ... all was was the ... recycled in different news outlets\nFor the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about Sarah ... taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nOr if there's one other event that occurs and that may turn friends that really I think it's the shock wave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI Director of it all out all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from his testimony that in may and they still have no evidence from a ... a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's let two agents who have an anti Trump a virus read that investigation he get fired and what's the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey that the roses are McKay and a stroke page it's\nHey maybe we can remove this guy you'd rather eat can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia maybe we can prove easily competed and will will record him and uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment this is not what the FBI with hot in the theater I'm sure record talking about the history book\nLays out a real possibility that this was a soft crew right look at this we have the FBI investigating a crime here that\nFact they can't find a crime by a page\nHas all these well Lisa pages testimony just to be clear she said they they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove him through other than me and and this conversation is so extraordinary ...\nIt says that drama the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it\nShe got the FBI the deputy attorney general or allegedly have a conversation he says it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and no matter which way it comes down is just another example of how far down the road the FBI\nWas beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counterintelligence\nAnd again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is John group of rogue power hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field officers purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a Greg Jarrett why every FBI guy I Know is so angry about this because they know was ripped out of their hands\nAnd this and all of them say that if this was them they know they get fired\nThat's right and in fact I interviewed former top officials or the FBI who are angry at people like James Comey Andrew McCabe James Baker Lisa Page\nPeters struck for ruining the reputation the good name of the FBI I wrote a column recently that said Rosenstein actions\nIn an attempt to ... the sitting president United States\nIs the equivalent of an attempted coup not a bloody violent coups what's known and John refer to it a moment ago as a soft coup ah using and misusing their power and the law to remove a sitting president and so here we now have not just James Baker\nWho was told this was serious because the people in the conversation with Rosenstein\nWho are Andrew McCabe and Lisa Page you said he was dead\nSerious recruit people to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment and secretly record the president\nTo gather evidence in support of it uh Rosenstein whenever he gets caught engaging in wrongdoing claims oh I was misunderstood he threatened the intelligence committee staff members in January first denied it\nThen it mitigated but said oh\nI was misunderstood he threatened Devon newness and said oh I was misunderstood and now\nWe can all fight blew\nA message from the U.S department of health and Human Services\nMuch News I'm Joe

number two we was the one that that recommended the special counsel Robert Mueller number three is also the guy that signed the fourth financial advisor warrant\nOther words the third renewal application on Carter Page a Trump campaign associates\nWell now we have information corroborated and confirmed by three separate high ranking FBI deal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to seek alert secretly recorded conversations with President Trump and the hope she said something that they could use and then in both the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page\nAnd go into the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and uh they're saying the Baker's set it bigger and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following is\nWe use ... pretty stunning revelation since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department\nAnd the FBI officials have set in sworn testimony but James Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firms Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funneled money so it would look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but and then they hired fusion GPS in our research firm that went out and got hired by the name of Christopher Steele and he used as Russian sources to put together\nA series of papers they become known as the ... same dot CA that was never corroborated of verify but used as a buys a warrant application the bulk of information to get a buys a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associates and it gets worse than that was used even though this information was not corroborated it was December ...\nThey did on all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used what now understanding to bludgeon\nThen president Donald Trump and to try and get him removed from office and creating a phony Russia Trump narrative that never ever had any evidence whatsoever anyway we found out that you know in the case of a ... coup either lawyers who've die by the

a cut out a go between for Hillary Clinton the FBI knew he was a go between in this particular instance now the question is why did the FBI knowing all of this not stop it\nWhy did they lie about it in effect the application for the Pfizer warrant wiretap on the Trump campaign was done\nAt the direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton and that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice and Clinton herself and you have numerous officials that the deal Jay and the FBI have sworn under oath that nobody at the FBI or D O D J knew anything about the Democratic party being\nBehind the Clinton dirt house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign\nWas feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI so it appears the FBI and the Justice Department we're all doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for Pfizer warrants and permission to snoop on the Trump campaign communications Sean Solomon and Greg Jared continue with us or anything I'm saying here that is wrong\nGreg ... you got a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was Hillary Clinton Russian collusion two people\nAre on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele who composers it totally fabricated phony document\nBased on suppose Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch knee investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now\nA second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Sussman or who is passing along\nComputer storage data as well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection and conspiracy to use phony opposition research to

that there would be right fire\n'em and all the FBI guys they all knew it wasn't true from the beginning at least a page even testify to that effect that's right I mean\nYou cannot use double triple quadruple here say from anonymous sources to launch an a counterintelligence investigation that is strictly prohibited yet shown that is exactly what the FBI and the de OJ did and what John\n... there's a you know there was a guy that I had a few weeks ago that they can get a lot of attention on the script guy but his name is bill priest that\nHe was ... strokes boss he was the chief of counter intelligence that the FBI he told\nHe told the congressional uh a committee that at the time they were admitting that by using that information for Christopher ... they had just gotten betting if there hadn't been and yet the standard for the five is it must be substantiated before you can submit it to the court records it exactly right\nThey they hadn't even begun to substantiate process and yet they're using it presenting it as a fancy to verify the court when you look at these\nAt that point they willingly lied before ... ... ... and light it as an advisor court application and they also purposely withheld key information like have you back that Hillary pay for it or how much of these are crimes here oh you\nKnow you just defies alone is deprivation of rights under color of law

warranty\nOr the God Forbid I get cancer or the God Forbid I get in a bad accident right\nRight and you you don't have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for lawn care insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled when we need to do is insured less which is how every other insurance product works they keep it that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline then as simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility and at the same day in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors in over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your age and you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches ... it's an emergency you know a lot of history and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota\nAnd then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr gross in terms of your president of duck ah docks where patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation was er physician run house policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table whenever we're having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions are fucking back to the table to have conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like Seventy here in southwest Florida a practice any health are plus when he was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nAll it does is create obstacles to access in Turkey where ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nAre seeing some inbound medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing got about health insurance we're using it for all\nAnd you know when somebody is you know pay twice the amount of money for a service because they just are health insurance water ensuring is using insurance drives up the cost of the other products so among the cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars\nWhile using your your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to give it authorized\nYour co pays five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\n... solution so I'm pleased to see the the worst shifting the conversational from a coverage for everyone I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care that real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee on this exact topic\nIt be a better idea I mean I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody shock gather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody\nIt whether you're pay our taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally everybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm because people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford

one of the outrageous I recorded on the trial of abortion doctor Kermit Koch now how the woman goes you knew when it comes down and there's no police report and I helped get those crimes the mainstream media tried to come around we had instructions natural course of the gods now movie it's amazing Cormac\nKnow is perhaps the most prolific Sharon\nA welcome both of you to the program I'm ... you you watch the tactics you see the polls for the first time raspy it's been showing that Republicans have more enthusiasm the Democrats in the lead up to the mid term elections I think the Kavanaugh hearings has awoken people to just\nHow vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I listen to the old tactics of the past\nWith the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where Democrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night on Fox or you know a racist besides you just you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics when he's in Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they tried to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time shot in a long time\nWe had a president in the White House who said we're not going to back down and cabinet and we're not going to let you back then I work in the back you up\nAnd we won one and that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Orange County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or discussing label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really\nA spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated or like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats\nAre in a more determined to vote in the upcoming elections as as a dramatic twenty five points shift in just the last six weeks Greg Garrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a massive amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation or ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is written and\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about furnace today just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd so you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is then they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump\nThey you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy damned bonds you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have\nThey went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the and you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempted sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American I have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it's a host\nAt a at a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have ... end up this rage ... not all of them but many of them against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapist Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime and literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic he's been he's been called trees is they've jammed up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose the train rapist or whatever it's sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this a psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this this this American patriot and Kavanaugh you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their base follow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry now learn an see below sea many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and then teach men of Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize is wrong and preposterous I could certainly explain how in a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible or for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned especially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that\nOnly drives Republican voters to the polls to make sure that these people are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to a ruined the accomplishments of Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than\nObama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not just made up there I mean the statistics demonstrate\nAnd so if Americans want to maintain that prosperity 'em and add money to their wallets into private ah from government officials who loved to squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nAnd his new book is out right now it Spygate the attempted sabotage that Donald J Trump

thinking about fidelity or or um [noise] uh one of the uh the scout stock houses where you can\nGet information but then have him to the ... you know do the actual trade when it comes to talk about it together and try to pick the right one and then start investing some of this money got\nWell I mean I think I think it's a good idea I think that to me only need a three thousand dollars to open a a a personal a personal account how old is the youngster is sixty\nYeah okay well you want to have it what what threw me yeah OK\nYou have to do a cuss the custody accountant actually yeah yesterday and initially but then he'll get to be Eighteen to\nShovel you anyway [laughter] so he says\nI'm I'm ... ... so he doesn't get tempted with that with the money you know [laughter]\nWell I I think that it's fairly easy for a personal account for example but probably about three thousand dollars of vanguard probably about twenty five hundred dollars or so at the ... the first\nOne that I Would buy would be to get started would be a double the\nSparked in total stock market index or vanguard till the stock market index depending on which company you go to but I think that's a great way to get started and then they can dollar cost averaging as he wishes going forward I think the only caviar\nIs that you know as you're going to need money if he's going to need money going\nForward then you know\nHe's in a position where he has an investment account in that case in the stock market which certainly tends to fluctuate as we know\nAnd so there should be money that he really is investing a on a longer term basis I think as as it gets started move as opposed to a money that he's actually going to need to go forward while he appreciate the call bill is in Missouri bill it's your turn\nI thank you for taking my call I'm trying to determine the best way to withdraw money from investments when I retire I'd like to tell you the two approaches I'm considering\nThe first one would be to take four percent of my investments each year starting with non IRA won ... gone go to regular IRA and then brought by a re\nApproach number two would be to take all of my interest dividends and capital gains\nAnd then if I have money left at the end of the year I weighed reinvest it\nDoes that make sense\nI think it makes a lot of sense for you to collect your interest and your dividends against that four percent withdraw guideline that you're starting with because I think what you're going to find is you will you will have some years\nWhere the some of your interest and dividends and capital appreciation could exceed that four percent figure and certainly uh I Would\nInvest that money if that happens there'll be\nThere'll be other years when they match up very closely there could be other years where your dividends and your interest in your capital gains a don't come up to the four percent of what you in which case you can liquidate a small number of shares in order to get to that four percent figure but I think that that should work\nOkay\nI Would say that I'm not sure that ah I liked the idea of putting the traditional\nA tax brokerage account before the raw tech privilege you know because the money you take from the ... tax free if you follow the rules\nSo I think I'd probably do a um a slight change there I'd probably priority to prioritize the personal money and then I'd probably use the Ross money and then lastly I'd probably use the traditional Monday because that's going to be taxable when you take it out\nOK and reverse the order of those too but I wouldn't actually tap into any of that uh until one of those years when I didn't get four percent by taking interest evidence et cetera\nYeah and and in that case and that's a good way to look at it and uh\nYou mean where you didn't get the four percent from your personal portfolio right that's a very good way to look at it because I'm what you could do then is you could use your Ross money as your backup money and you still would not create any tax liability by doing that\nOkay thank you very much\nFor your help great to hear from you built checking in from the show me\nState in ... Missouri yes indeed\nWhile lots of great callers this hour and we are taking your calls on the pope rely one eight hundred nine three four\nTwenty to Twenty one that is our contact number right here [noise] coast to coast forwarded a border\nAnd the ... civil way east and north to Alaska [noise]\nFrom the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters [noise] America's money for\nHis mom [noise]\nNow I mentioned existing home sales or they were slightly lower in July by seven tenths of one percent to basically a five and a third million union annual rate that's the lowest since February of two thousand sixteen\nSo um we look at the figures across the board we see that\nWe could say steady we could see steady ... in housing market but\nThose earlier times when we saw some really sizeable increases there not happening right now just not happening median existing home prices\nDid very very well your ... year they're a four point five percent interesting disparity there the media new home sales price is down one percent\nIn the last year but the median existing home prices up four and a half percent and I think that probably one of the factors there is the scarcity of existing homes for sale could be a factor\nIn that four and a half percent year over year game which is better than the two point nine percent consumer price index increase over the past year so\nAll of that going on out there with keeping an eye on all of this of course as we monitor the economy I Would say the monitor a monitoring of the economy right now would dictate I'm saying\nThat it's okay it's okay we have a year over year real gross domestic product growth rate on the books as of the currents figures that are available of two point eight percent that's a good figure so I'm hopefully that will continue\nOur toll free line one eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one that is our contact number let's get mark on the line in Naperville markets your turn\nI ... thank you for taking my call I I have an idea for protecting Social Security benefits\nAnd this idea is that if we can leave out of an I go to them by which half the lawyers or something of the employer contribution to Social Security employee goes into a photo wife Kate type\nI like a ... a target fun consistent with retirement age of that employee\nOn the condition that that money could not be touched on retirement\nUm I'm just wondering\nIf something like this kind of how to work\nI just don't know where the votes would come from because Congress has been unwilling to allow the privatization of anything related to Social Security George W. Bush the president\nMade a proposal right to to invest a small portion of the Social Security fund in the stock market if that had been done\nThat would have done extremely well because he made that proposal when the stock market was at lower levels much lower levels for a door during his two terms so if they had taken up that idea the place to small portion in the stock market which would have to be indexed\nThen uh that money would have done extremely well unfortunately Congress which can't seem to agree or how many days in the week there are any more they're just in case there simply dysfunctional they're incapable of governing\nWell maybe that was that the condition on talking about is that that money cannot be touch Social Security retirement age and maybe the concern that passed laws\nThat money has got to be touch prior to that that is at risk and the stock market but also this money could be invested in a year or so the U.S government\nUh or twenty five or ... what should be it would give certain uh returns\nWell they all ready invest a lot of the money in it and they already invest the money and the equivalent of us treasuries right now they do that right now\nBut I thought it's all I Do you I thought that\nYou know the yeah but that they consider it the equivalent because that's the rate of interest that earns is the equivalent it ... it it earns the market rate of interest one has invested yes you're yes you're right there's no money there the whole thing is a ... year right now because you know why because\nAll the money is getting all more and more and eventually all of the money is getting paid out of the people who are currently working paying Social Security tax and then they take that money and they pay it out of the beneficiaries\nAnd that's where we're headed and so the whole thing is a under the unified budget there's no question about it the the the whole concept of a trust fund with money out there yeah it's I always use you're absolutely correct\nBut I don't see any any one first of all I don't see anyone politically in Washington stepping up on this issue it's become the third rail of politics and they don't want to touch it they don't want to cut Medicare either\nA in terms of making those fiscally responsible they don't want to go near it on the other hand uh I don't see the votes in Congress to get something done on this because they just are well they're totally dysfunctional and they've proven time and to get\nThemselves they prove it themselves\nOne eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one it is on the line listening to the mighty WLS Chicago although at\nAll of this in Chicago I got a a large portion of my money and money markets that are not covered by FDIC and I'm trying to fight a that is a problem\nThe reason that I have the money and money market account um is that\nI'm not sure how long I'm going to live and I don't want\nMy money in a like a CD for a longer period of time or or even a shorter period of time so that it would be a hindrance to my\nEars and I'm Wondering if there would be a problem with keeping it in a money market at this point\nI think if you're with quality companies companies like the vanguard companies like fidelity any of the high quality companies I can only speak for myself I don't have a problem having money and money market funds because I'm worried about it\nBut I mean you would have to speak for yourself on that issue as to whether you're comfortable with it or there is another way for you to do this which is just a short term treasury bills which could be liquidated the anytime\nOkay\nYou could use for example if you owned Ninety One day treasury bills three month treasury bills than those monies can be liquidated at any time and they're perfectly safe or and or not only that the interest is exempt\nFrom um state and local tax so that's certainly something for you to consider you would not for example you would not have to pay\nA the Illinois state income tax on the interest you earned on a treasury bill so that might be a an increased incentive for you to take a look at like ... or something like that and the rates have been increasing as the Federal Reserve continues to increase short term rich\nAs so that certainly is something else was going on\nAnd I do appreciate the call\nAnd that was an interesting a speech that the fed chair Jerome Powell gave at Jackson Hole Wyoming this week I Hope many of you had an opportunity to uh read parts of it or even more that you've had a chance to go to the ... in Jackson Hole Wyoming\nBut uh there's no question about it that he has made it clear\nThat uh he's going to continue to watch inflation but he's not particularly upset about inflation right now\nAh and and he certainly has made it clear that he's going to gradually increase short term interest rates until they get to some level of normal\nAnd um he he doesn't seem to be launching in any way from the the program that he has set forth which he basically inherited from\nA from a chair Yellen his predecessor which is to gradually increased rates of interest as the economy grows and as employment grows and as inflation remains manageable I think that would be a synopsis of his view\nAnd I think it's a view that's generally accepted at this juncture\nIf you'd like to join us on the toll free

D. ladder\nNow if you're going to use the CD ladder is an alternate or you could use for example equal amounts of the three six nine and twelve months CD\nAnd by doing that you'd have a very short average duration you know our average duration in a portfolio is less than one year your average duration on a three six nine twelve months CGI would be even less than a than the one that's in the portfolio which is already over one year\nAnd that would be another way that you could look at it in other words there are various ways in a rising interest rate environment that you can go depends on how a wrist wrist tolerant you are if you're not risk tolerated at all\nThen to see the letter fully FDIC insured is risk free it's held the majority and that certainly is something to consider as well and that money market fund is also something to consider and we've included that as part of the portfolio let's get out to the great cayenne us radio Denver\nLon it is your turn will\nAffect by

she just finished\nHer medical school and I'd like to\nBuy her in the long term IRA find which would you prefer\nWell I think that uh for the twenty eight year old certainly getting started a I Would look at something ah with broad diversification and low expenses\nI Would recommend or that you consider starting with something like either the fidelity spartan total stock market index or the then go total stock market index they both have extremely low expense ratio is\nA minimal I Would consider the minimal not significant and they give you a broad diversification they give you tax efficiency so I think the total stock market index has either one of those out this would be a good place to start thank you\nFor the only eight year old for the fourteen year old where it's a little dicey because you're going to be writing college tuition checks in about four years so you have to be a aware of that as well\nAnd so uh I think I Want to have some diversity in that portfolio of by that I

sense dot com and now back to the financial engines investing show with Bob Richards a nationally recognized certified financial planner professional\nAndy Smith with just a couple of minutes away from this week's portfolio review first we have a question from who's calling from Massachusetts hello any\nLaw so my question is forty eight years so um my husband\nAnd I make I said I think thousand dollars a year I only have about eight thousand tonight thousands of dollars and they brought a A R a and I would like to know how much I Need to put away they\nCan't retire maybe one Seventy looked at it like question\nOkay great question um so you know kind of the easy answer is I usually tell people save as much as you can for as long as you can\nAnd so kind of on top of that then you said All right so if you're forty eight you want to work until you're Seventy you've got about twenty two years and so that's a good amount of time\nTo get a fair amount of money a you know socked away\nOr inside the raw ... here's what you can keep in mind so with your Ross IRA um and then you know the same could go for your husband as well\nSo with your author raise each of you can contribute up to fifty five hundred dollars a year\nBefore your age fifty but maybe before you turn fifty so you're forty eight how old is your husband\nMy younger than ...\nOkay so each of you can contribute fifty five hundred dollars a year now once you turn fifty you can actually save you can save an additional thousand so you can save sixty five hundred dollars a year when I\nWhen we know when you're fifty so here in a couple of years you can start saving sixty five hundred so what I Would do is just kind of have in your mind you know for these next however many years however long you're working you plan on saving fifty five hundred dollars a year before age fifty\nAnd then sixty five hundred dollars a year for that twenty year period of time between eight fifty in Seventy now when you when you retire so you want to work until you're Seventy the other thing I wanted\nTo retire on that but at this point out choice because I thought\nOkay you know and I would say that you know um you you've got the savings you're going to be working one of the things that we've found that that is most helpful for people's um you know to to help them find success with their retirement is just working longer\nSo the fact that you want to work until I Seventy yeah might not be the thing that you thought was going to be the best thing in the whole world but it really is going to help you because the longer you work the ... the less you have to pull from your investments\nOr you don't have to claim Social Security uh you know for a you know for anything for that so when you retire at Seventy you're going to have Social Security and then you're going to have your investments to live off of\nUm do you have any debt right now no I pay off all my that perfect alright so no debt um any other short term cash need that you see here in the next twelve to twenty four months\nAh no okay I I I don't want to buy a house because I'm thinking I'm paying Fifteen clicking on it a try no okay so I feel like um I used to own a house before my mortgage was twelve hundred dollar fucking run it out as a mortgage payment okay\nI'm I'm putting money away for something for\nOur perfect perfect and if you're paying you know fourteen Fifteen hundred dollars a month in rent now the mortgage earlier was less than that you you can that's just budgeting um when that when that comes into play 'em so really what I Would have you do right now is you know for twenty two years\nOr however long it is you know that you're going to be a working you know plan on saving that fifty five hundred bucks or sixty five hundred bucks into that Ross IRA now or do you have access to email I go\nUm when you are in a position to send me some more information about the Ross I can put some more ideas into an
