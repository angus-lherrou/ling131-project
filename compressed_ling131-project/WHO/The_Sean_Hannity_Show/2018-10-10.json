exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAnd exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was it if the field agents if they were allowed to do

[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nProbably our scary hurricane season continues and hurricane Michael now\nIs headed straight for the Florida Panhandle looks like it could hit land that uh categories the panhandle and and the entire area that would be just in Fort Walton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh is hurricane warning storm surge warnings have all been issued along the Gulf Coast\nAs I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place and it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job of starting the official weatherman other Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and spin I'm being told that the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is\nWhy I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City or that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cage\nIt there in November believe it or not um Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane in the Gulf\nBut a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area now the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the a sort of the silver lining here Pensacola and mobile are going to get north wins\nAnd mobile I don't think this was a big deal immobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three four inches of rain but once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially in that Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area\nThe weather pattern you remember of Florence was off its peak when it hit the north Carolina coast this one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nAnd I don't expect anything to stop it from being a at least that strong category where he perhaps even a a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember Shawn last time I was on with you I said I'll I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing and ... what does it mean look the average person including me has no idea why the actual angle of the ... when it reaches land matters so much why does the angle of the storm matter\nIt's also the overall pattern one Florence was coming into powder in the western Atlantic was a weakening as far as tropical cyclones on September twentieth believe it or not Japanese meter optical agency\nIt's maps came out and said look out October of ... through about the nineteenth and the Atlantic basic you notice all the tycoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely I said well what is it has to do with us well when the action stops there\nLike a good last year it shifted into the Atlantic basin and that's what you see going on folks as you can watch this stuff\nComic to three weeks away now I Can't tell you well is it going to New Orleans or is it going to cap I owe or whatever I could say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw and watch we got so last Thursday and friday you know I'd been shown knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get him ready about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico so that area has not been touched remember we hit Louisiana and Mississippi with Gordon Alberto\nWe hit it off to the east over there with ... this is going right in between and instead of coming western North West setting it's heading into classical faction from the southwest and it's going to race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas you're going to have a fast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately\nA lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is going to be another three to six locally and inches of rain coming Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between K Patterson Norfolk go right out to sea to the south of New England no problem in the north east from it\nBut it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas or because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't hit the ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe ... hurricane force along the outer banks and forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia uh Augusta places like that as it moves north it's going to accelerate through there\nBetter the security that we are now obtaining the better trade deals that we are now also

Sean if you want to be a part of the program what we played their Rod Rosenstein you know for people that did wrong and the deal Jay face consequences\nRegarding ... well he signed the final buys a warrant himself and then when he's talking about the rule of law and speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nA Solomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record remove Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell former FBI general council member James Baker he was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he\nApparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember became and Lisa Page both took notes of the meaty and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAnyway now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president using the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCain had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with McCain\nAnd the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was the real plan being discussed set a source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI\nOr member then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel as soon as Justin ... at that time frame around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed and private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot\nAnd he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office but making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress\nAnswer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates that already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we've got to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is we're laying out here are the top people at the upper echelon member twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page of both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon ease but investigative reporter is what the hell\nRag Jarrett Fox News legal analyst\nAnd of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax thank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated\nWe got a first start with the timeline the timeline is may have twenty Seventeen or that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein just before that we had people like ... at least a page in and Peter Struck talking about uh media elite strategy that had to do with the dusty a\nWhile it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes and again ... all it was was the ... a recycled and different news outlets\nFor the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about surreptitiously taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nOr if there's one other event that occurs and that may timeframe that really I think it's the shock wave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI directors that allowed all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from ... just after market may they still have that wherever you're from a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's let two agents who have an anti Trump a virus read that investigation he gets fired and what's the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey roses is a a Medicaid and a stroke page it's hey maybe we can remove this guy rather can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia\nMaybe we can prove he's confident and will will record him and uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment\nThis is not what the FBI was brought into the wrong track record talk about history his book lays out a real possibility that this was a softer right look at this we have the FBI not investigating a crime here that in fact they can't find a crime by a page as\nWell at least two pages testimony just to be clear she said they

says that job at the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it\nShe got the FBI and the deputy attorney general or allegedly our conversation he says it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and no matter which way it comes down is just another example of how far down the road with the FBI\nWas beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counter intelligence\nAnd and again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is John group of rogue power hungry upper echelon

counsel Robert Mueller number three also the guy that signed the fourth financial advisor warrant\nIn other words the third renewal application on Carter Page a Trump campaign associate\nWell now we have information corroborated and confirmed by three separate high ranking FBI deal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to seek ... secretly recorded conversations with President Trump and the hope she'd say something that they could use and then and vote the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page\nAnd go into the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and uh they're saying the Baker's set it bigger and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following is\nIs pretty stunning revelation since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department\nAnd the FBI officials have set in sworn testimony but\nJames Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firm Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funneled money so it would look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but and then they hired fusion GPS and research firm that went out and got hired by the name of Christopher Steele and he used as Russian sources to put together\nA series of papers they become known as the ... the same dusty a that was never corroborated a verified but used as a buys a warrant application the bulk of information to get a ... a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associates\nAnd it gets worse than that was used even though this information was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used what now understanding to bludgeon\nThen president Donald Trump and to try and get him removed from office and creating a phony Russia Trump narrative that never ever had any evidence

direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton and that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice and Clinton herself and you have numerous officials that the deal Jay and the FBI have sworn under oath that nobody at the FBI or D O D J knew anything about the Democratic party being\nBehind the Clinton dirt house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes staying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign\nWas feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI so it appears the FBI and the Justice Department we're all doing the Clinton campaign's bidding in applying for Pfizer warrants and permission to snoop on the Trump campaign communications Sean Solomon and Greg Jared continue with us or anything I'm saying here that is wrong\nRight Garrett you've got a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was Hillary Clinton Russian\nCollusion two people are on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele to compose is a totally fabricated phony document\nBased on supposed Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now a second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Sussman or who is passing along computer storage data as well\nDocuments to the FBI and

told\nHe told the congressional uh a committee that at the time they were admitting the five using that information from Christopher ... they had just gotten betting if it hadn't been and yet the

right\nRight um you you don't have\nA car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for long term care insurance just for the big thing and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last eight ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled when we need to do is insured less which is how every other insurance product works the key to that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility at Seventy in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors in over thirty two hundred patients\nAnd your age and you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor or three\nIn the morning that it's going to answer my call you do you have\nAnd I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches ... it's an emergency you know a lot of the three am phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor\nYeah All right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model the day of duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nYou know and what do you do Dr grows in terms of your president of duck ah docks where a patient care bound nation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation has er physician run house policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table whenever we're having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions are back in back of the tabletop conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida a practice any health are plus when he was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nAll it does is create ... ... ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nWe're seeing some inbound medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing got about health insurance we're using it for all\nAnd you know when somebody is you know pay twice the amount of money for a service because of the ... shots water we ensuring is using the insurance drives up the cost of the other products so ... cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars\nNow using her your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to give it authorized\nYour co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again on the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\n... solution so I'm pleased to see the the you know we're shifting the conversational from a coverage for everyone I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nI think that the real close and that's why I was about to testify on us some help committee on this topic\nWould it be a better idea I mean I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shocked that gather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody it whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally\nEverybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm but there's people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that are up public in his within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nFor every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it but the big things heart attack\nOr accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars per year or a month\nA month so and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars\nPer household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household or that the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send them on a ridge analogy\nThrowing more money at the problem has never fixed it the what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get ... cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable\nI'm actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add to that just a a ... you know as far as the cost of care you know the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the ... primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well Obama Care made that illegal\nAh so it's something a little stretching just brought ... get access to these major medical plans called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses they're Seventy five dollars a month or\nWhat it is this going to be implemented easily\nCity by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for atlas MD and they have a preexisting condition a doctor or do you deny them service\nThat everybody's welcome and everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ... Wilson over to not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to know judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\n[noise] boy I I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the the truth is it's so much more simple than that I\nHave a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership\nWe do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance\nWe can lower the cost and and pass the savings on directly to the patient that this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those because they're going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nBut they're gonna have to move out of New York because they don't make it easy but they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the few states that make it a very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that cost that would be an amazing model it it would cut down there\nRight let's take New York out of the equation or California ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida um I don't know Missouri yeah how do they do it\nIt's as simple as signing up effect shopping on Amazon there's there's almost nothing to it um\nYou know we have one supplier that makes it very easy overnight shipping and that's just it if I Want to buy a bottle of a hundred pills a blood pressure medicine I can if I Want to buy a thousand pills I can and it's about the same price um but it's fundamentally cheaper than\nWhat about Lindsey Graham is saying that what only block grant the money that we're already providing to individual states and let them come up with these innovative you know like centers of innovation all around the country and I think naturally people would move toward your system\nI I I Would agree with the logic or the federal government's basically saying we've given your money with strings attached before and we haven't received full value for that because we've wage you down with regulatory burden\nOf welcoming to the point on October ... an evening with you is a celebration of American patriotism and values and you'll get asked question presented by brown ALS serious about firearms since Nineteen thirty nine\nAbout an American things only you in a restaurant\nDestroying is fine\nGet your ticket now go to an evening with due to the dot com that's an evening\nNews I'm Carmen\nRobert hurricane Michael get stronger and closer to the Florida coast and may grow to almost category four strings by tomorrow's landfall that would be nearly one hundred thirty mile an hour winds sort of folks taking this one seriously\nBad traffic evacuating all day yesterday most people in this town Appalachian coal look the southern point of the big band they're gone\nFox has failed Keating it don't get drunk putting an end to talk of her father naming her as the next UN ambassador tweeting today\nI Know that the president will nominate a formidable replacement for ambassador Haley that replacement will not remain\nFox's John Roberts President Trump says he's considering several people to replace you went to Vassar Nikki Haley who announced today she's stepping down at the end of the year and the first African American drafted\nInto NFL size George ...
