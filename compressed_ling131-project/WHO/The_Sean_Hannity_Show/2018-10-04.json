racially profiled a black man in a traffic stop the old Perry says they want to see the investigation voices done on off this is Kyle fees and not only high demand that were involved in the case\nWho follows Brett Kavanaugh\nRight that was Lindsey Graham has been very powerful all throughout the hearings and he had a moment last week during those hearings were bred cabin on Dick Durbin wanting is FBI investigation will be\nAll right they've had the FBI investigation\nNow we know that we can have an up or down vote in the Senate so who's going to vote yes and who's going to vote no because we have one party that in every single case even though there's no corroboration\nEven though facts on the ground continue to shift didn't change where we don't know what data location people that are supposedly eyewitnesses to alleged\nActs of violence say it didn't happen and the stories change about well they're putting drugs in the in the punch and boys are lining up almost on a weekly weekend basis\nTo rape girls are winding up in the halls while he was around the punch bowl when he gave out some red solo cups that's what that evolved into you know at what point is there no shame here at what point do we not understand how deeply dangerous this is\nFor every American because we're throwing due process and the presumption of innocence literally out the window\nNewt Gingrich is with us a former speaker of the house with thirty four days away from an election best selling book Trump's America the truth about our nation's great comeback well I guess that's on the ballot and thirty four days how are you\nI'm doing well and I think you know\nYou can't have ... if you're only interest is raw power and that's what we've seen a Dianne Feinstein deliberately holding the letter was about raw power a fact that you have a democratic senator who says if you're for Kevin all your complicit with evil\nThat Rob how are the kinds of shearing dishonest questions and accusations that we've seen that raw power and that is what this election is about the selection will decide what kind of country we are\nTo how how many Americans are really comfortable with this kind of character assassination dishonesty and all out effort to destroy decent people and I think that's going to be in that that is truly on the ballot even if it's not on the ballot because all of us have now is she\nRight there on television and editing without distortion we've seen how bad these people are\nWell I just you know on a level that we've never seen before and I guess it really comes down there are five people but I think it really too with the Democrats would consider voting\nFor judge Kavanaugh will only do it I Believe of impact is enough Republicans to get them over the finish line but it comes down to Susan Collins that comes down to Lisa Murkowski and\nSenator Jeff snowflake who is on his I Want to be president trip to New England as we get most of the week and his media tour which is second to none so how does this end up\nWell I've been I think in the short run that I I'm an optimist I think that the the basic decency\nA judge Kavanaugh and other family ah the sense that most Americans have that he has been a smear treated with a vicious personal attack\nAll those things I think means that the Susan Collins the world is going to vote yes and he's going to be confirmed probably by Monday or Tuesday Wednesday and he'll be on the court but to deeper underlying question but all of us should learn about who these people are proud\nAll right how truly dishonest and vicious they are I Hope that that stage for very long time\nLet me ask you a thirty four days out of an election you were there as a strategist when Reagan became president\nFor the first time in forty years you ran on something and you got the entire caucus of Republicans house and Senate to agree to nationalize an election and make promises to America you called it the contract with America\nAnd that you would you promised you would vote\nOn ten specific items in the first hundred days of which you did accomplish that passed and Republican for the most part with a few bumps pickups in the road\nHave been in power since um how to Republicans now I think the anger of the bases beyond anything I've seen in recent years rightly so over what's going on with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Democrats\nDemocrats don't have a vision for the future we had I ate horrible years of Obama we've had two very successful years of President Trump what is the pitch what what should the Congress men and women and senators be saying\nWell first of all the president has done a great job he watches various trips such as Mississippi will be in Minnesota and he's laying out the case that if you want results of a team called Republicans\nAnd if you want resistance you've got a team called Democrats and he's been laying up and and you see it in the numbers than people realize the lowest unemployment for African Americans in history lowest unemployment for Latinos a continuous economic growth many good things that are happening I think the president is set the stage now to pit\nAnd spent the last five weeks telling us what's coming next\nWe've got this much damage you know ... I loved the vice President Pence said and I he said America's coming back you know what I'm saying we're ... we're not\nPush of a lot of work to do but we're coming back and now you have a chance for the president's leadership and I think this election ought to be about which kind of America you want us to be you want us to keep coming back\nKeep creating jobs do you want us to control the border to save our children from MS Thirteen gangs from ... from opioid deaths are you prepared to be part of a team to one's\nConstitutional judges not radicals I think if we got campaign could be stunningly successful and we can have as much fun on election night as we head into thousands of\nWhy I mean I hear optimism in you that I look I'm going to be honest I don't quite share it I'm not there with you\nI think it can happen I Believe it's winnable I Believe the Republicans can keep the house I think that Rick Scott can win the Senate in Florida I think Republicans could defeat Joe Donnelly in Indiana a U.S a Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nA Claire McCaskill in Missouri I think they can beat Heidi Heitkamp I think Martha ... a great candidate out in Arizona I think Dean Heller can hold the seat Nevada but I think they're all tight races and then you've got then we've got about fifty competitive house races which could tip the balance of power there\nSome course now that is probably have campaigns\nBut we've got we've got thirty five days out here to go out and when\nAnd and I remember it and you remember 'cause your air two thousand six two weeks out I Do an interview with Megan Kelly and she's telling me how we're going to lose so then you are going to lose Michigan we're going to lose Wisconsin I said to her we have to alternative universes in my universe\nI Believe the average American is so disgusted with this resistance oriented left wing radicalization I think the average person knows when when you hear Democrats say they're for Medicare for all they're talking about destroying Medicare they're talking about destroying your health insurance\nThey're talking about bankrupting the country and I think that we just have to go out and wage campaigning I must say\nPresident Trump is doing as good a job of getting out on the stump telling the truth laying it out as anybody I've ever seen and I I Believe in the American people my optimism grows out of a belief that the average hardworking decent American his disgusted\nBy what they just saw happened to Kevin ... is is committed to a work ethic due to a better future and as the Democrats get more radical I think you're going to see the Republicans continue to move a you know for example a\nGovernment run health care means tax paid abortion well they're very few places in America where there's a majority for your tax dollars paying for abortions and I think we have to be fair to tell the truth play into it in a direct way and if we do that we're going to have a very good election\nI got to take a quick break from our nation's capital more with Newt Gingrich on the other side later on Joe diGenova Victoria Toensing and much more as we continue from the swamp from the sewer it's Sean Hannity show\nBy the way if you like me and you hate weak weak coffee I hate it or those big liberal corporate corporate coffee brands they're the worst\nUh and you want the best coffee you've ever had\nAnd roast to order delivered to your door simply the best of the best well it was created by special force veterans by first responders they hire special forces and\nAnd the American heroes as part of their company they even donate or a portion of their cells to veterans of first responders\nBut the best part is not only is supporting a great group of people but they come up with the best coffee you've ever had premium coffee with every order they've got the best gear you've ever seen how black rifle coffee they also have a club is no lines no running out they'll ship the best coffee right to your door hassle free every month\nAnd once you try it you will never go back to these liberal corporate coffee brand ever that was very simple just go to black rifle coffee dot com slash Sean\nAnd you get a Fifteen Percent discount black rifle coffee dot com slash on Fifteen Percent discount why their check out some of the really really politically incorrect and cool videos and also the gear you're going to want to buy it awesome gear and I have some myself\nBlack rifle coffee dot com slash Sean quick break from our nation's capital when we get back we'll check in with ... and Jeff Lord later on Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing Hannity from D.C tonight at nine with all the latest you won't get from the mainstream media\nYou know ...
