saying what that means maybe and we've talked about this after school shootings and after other church shootings\nWhere the president said well maybe we need to have retired police and military it's a sad state of affairs\nBut um as a line of defense but that doesn't take away from the horror and the vicious evil\nThat took place here you look at the victims I mean it is heartbreaking to see the faces of those slain for their faith was the cover of the New York post today and as you read about the the lives of these people it is one heartbreaking story after another\nAre sadly too we watched the media do what they always do and that's rushed to blame and pulling out all the stops to blame Donald Trump for the Pittsburgh massacre when in fact the prime minister of Israel Ron dorm or the ambassador of all said that the president's comments were welcomed unappreciated\nOn every front um we'll get into all those as we continue rose ten and I'm the host of Clinton rows and rows um plugged in Pittsburgh, PA ugh long friend of the program and David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney thank you both for being here\nUh you know how much I loved by friends in Pittsburgh rows of very very sorry your thoughts and prayers go to everybody or the fact that it's been so viciously politicized within minutes makes me my stomach turn and those trying to cast blame against the president make this a campaign issue is just nauseating\nIt is shining you or so left in Pittsburgh as well as soon as I heard the story the news Saturday morning\nI mean my heart went out and I was almost afraid to hear that list of victims their names because\nThis community it's such a lovely place it's a very popular ...\nI go there to shop and to dying and in fact my son told me just about a month ago that's one of the neighborhood is considering moving too\nSo we we love that community it's a tight knit community they are very involved though in so many aspects and not just their community but the out if the surrounding communities and as it turned out you know of course I grew up with a girl who's ... and with the two brothers\nThat perished on Saturday but there were so many people that have done so many great things in this community and the Pittsburgh area and it's just it's heartbreaking it really is to see that this happened but as soon as I thought those things\nAnd immediately I got sick thinking that this is starting to become political\nAnd\nIt says you can count the seconds there's an interesting side note that there is no throw this to David I'm how democratic candidates increasingly turning against Israel\nAnd our mutual friend Alan Dershowitz you know I had a pretty powerful column that he put out linking the the mass of good at the Democratic party's tolerance for anti Semitism most recently we saw Bill Clinton two seats down from Louis Farrakhan\nI'd never ever get in a room with a vicious racist anti Semite like Louis Farrakhan or picture that emerged or with ... and Obama that was hidden from the public for eight years while he was president that existed that they had had a relationship\nUm and if you look at some of the most pro Israeli president I think we've had since the the forty eight partition plan un partition plan is a is Donald Trump\nMore recently making Jerusalem the capital of Israel which so many other presidents have promised that never had the courage to do\nYeah any person who would suggest for a moment Donald Trump as an anti Semitic bone in his body is that of their mind look at his family et cetera but you're absolutely right and what you pointed out ... ... if you believe that words matter then it goes much further than just a President Clinton sitting in a room\nWith Mr fabric on their pictures of President Clinton President Obama Cory Booker shaking hands and smiling with Farrakhan members of Congress doing the same Linda source or another hater\nOr get an honorary degree at City College an honorary doctorate\nAbomination what climate dizzy away just wrote a press release about some of these kinds of things I looked at this Linda ... praises\nResume or day are terrorists to Palestinian terrorists who killed two American college students she's been praised by Christ in dealing with a brand she hasn't praised unfortunately by Stacey Abrams is running for Congress here in Georgia now um it's words matter and those things matter a great deal\nAs it should be expected when you normalize Israel bashing and the hatred of Jews it should be expecting\nAll the way that our average which put it I thought it was pretty powerful you said they can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism and I agree\nWe we have to have a zero tolerance policy President Obama meets with ... shame on him President Clinton sits on a platform with Farrakhan shame on him Keith Ellison joins Farrakhan was one of the greatest purveyor of anti Semitic hate he's right\nI'm just because he's black doesn't give him in the past four is anti Semitism in any liberal was any positive association with Farrakhan as is part of the problem not the solution and you know just last week\nFarrakhan was making anti Semitic statements and it was only two months ago that Al Sharpton Jesse Jackson of Bill Clinton were all sitting next to each other with Farrakhan at a wreath of Franklin's funeral I Would not go to any funeral that he was that I'm Sorry I just you draw the line\nAnd trying to find may here too and there's something I like your listeners to know because\nI I noticed a couple of headlines today on Sunday there was a letter that was published in written by eleven members of a group called bend the ark and they have a Pittsburgh affiliate right here and they sent a letter to the president is blaming hat and they said that you yourself called the\nMurder evil that yesterday's violence is that direct combination if he were influence\nAnd they said you're the factory eerie ear work and your policies have\nInviting that's involved in this\nAnd that you know what was interesting is I had so many messages and phone calls from listeners today they they pretty much agree first of all of that than they are just that your listeners now it's not representative of the Pittsburgh Jewish community they did not speak for that and that is what many of my listeners said these\nPeople are are there and if she were left wing group I'm a very progressive ... and and they don't speak to the Jewish community here in Pittsburgh I've been told by many this morning\nYou don't have everyone David go Harry important\nVery important point by the way I Wish they were obscure\nPeter Beinart as a matter of that group that is real fast and Haider from start to finish\nRecorded that George Soros his grandson is a member of the group that report to speak to this one for this wonderful Pittsburgh community I been to the tree of life shall I was a guest of the rabbi there for about ... it's a wonderful place they're not haters they're not people that want to politicize anything\nWe roll up our sleeves we face that evil with courage and the sacrifice\nAnd and and that is who we are as Americans and when they play the blame game on the media it makes me sick because we missed what the true story is what the truth is and rabbi Myers I Love when he said\nHe said the bullet holes are too numerous to count but we will rebuild because we're tree of life we've been hearing one hundred and fifty four years you can cut off them branches that the tree will continue to grow we will be back\nSo that Sean is who we are and date as a nation I Know you agree that we aren't the nation we are not divided\nAnd ... and ... most of us or not but the blame

the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think will definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house real clear politics average has the Democrats and two oh five Republicans at two hundred and you know basically you've got these dirty toss up seats or or thereabouts that are in play and that's going to make all the difference\nYeah that's right and and ... are a vice to people right now certainly uh ... thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education literature through our organization is ignore the polls ignored the press ignore the pundits do your job get the ...\nAnd everybody tells me you know I make a living for people not ignoring\nYour except it okay but I think you're right though\nBecause the polls are so often so wrong I mean let's go back two years Donald Trump lost every state according to the exit polls five Fifteen on election day\nWell that's exactly right and I mean look when I was state party chairman in Georgia when we elected the first Republican governor and that stayed in a hundred and thirty four years the\nThere are three virtual outcomes here one is we shock the world Republicans picked up Senate seats hold the house that would be the best case scenario then there's the split a situation where Republicans get seats in the Senate but below sea become speaker and then there's a worst case scenario you wake up\nYou know ten nine days from now when you find out as speaker elect below sea and Senate majority elects Schumer and\nIt's really up to the people which decision which outcome they want because we'll get the government we deserve you stay home well that's a half a vote for below sea and Schumer if you don't vote for the Republican you're basically voting for below sea ...\nYeah and I and I really believe Sean ... the intensity gap in the news yeah the gap that wants to separate the two sides has closed significantly since the cabinet nominations\nYou know you see different holes were Democrats with a high enthusiasm maybe Seventy two percent of them Republicans maybe sixty eight Seventy percent but anecdotally I'm telling you I'm seeing stuff out there that I saw on twenty sixteen I was in Des Moines Iowa last week at an event with the vice president\nWe had a very strong organization out there we have over a hundred and fifty people walking door to door just in Des Moines neighborhoods and this one gentleman who was volunteering told me he was at the president's rally the previous a friday and Cedar Rapids they filled an arena\nThat we're over two thousand people who couldn't get in they stood in the driving rain for two hours and watch it on the jumbo Tron\nThey stayed there to show their support you simply cannot want it to quantify that with a whole are within analysis it's an intangible it's out there and it's real\nQuick break we'll come back more with Ralph Reed founder chairman faith and Freedom Coalition cybersecurity some

have a Florida Man arrested for threatening to kill a Republican congressmen\nHave angry leftist mob disrupting Marsha Blackburn campaign rally would Lindsey Graham um we've seen two Republicans punched in Minnesota uh there's a lot of anger and a lot of violence out there on the left you see Republicans being run out of restaurants\nUh Pam Bondi run out of a movie theater secretary Nielsen oh Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz and his wife Mitch McConnell Kevin McCarthy's office it with a Boulder busting his office window so there's a lot of left wing violence out there and it's a pretty dangerous time\nYeah and I think a unique time you're dealing with uh this kind of pervasive dark the most important thing that you can do is light a candle and I think what people have got to do is they've got to resist that hate with a love for their country a lot for their fellow man and\nHope for better future for all of our citizens staying positive stay prayer full and work hard you know I when I was

hundred number one show and if you want to be a part of the programs amazing the criticism that has been out there\nOr what should be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border or a significant display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should\nWe saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that\nLet people got to the border knock down the fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security and made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear that that's not going to be allowed to happen and we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given\nSpecial consideration to work in southern Mexico a but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend in a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them\nAnd who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed that the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nAnd Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries are from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this that's the only\nBit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis sees a senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen as extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the programs are glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having me pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column and night but I haven't read the whole column ... my read a bit is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question let on the Mark I'm in the actually good actually no great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this or folks from my party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the president who basically tried to uh overthrow the constitution and making ... president for life there and done with the Venezuelan\nAnd laid out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet there will and organizing a posting videos pictures from the marks\nSo again no great great mystery this is the work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and it is in effect the giant covert action campaign designed to make the American\nGovernment look bad and our allies that well\nI may look America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and\nI'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with with anti immigrant sentiment or dino phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border wall\nWith a big door and that people should respect our laws\nAre constitutional republic\nAmerican sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process of maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that is called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with a Smith ethnicity as mounting to do with race this is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws humbling according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply ... to walk across the border I have always wondered\nBy the way those folks that are actively don't want to control the border why is it the only people who can walk here should be allowed to getting just added stuff if that's the principal\nWell what I'm not I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he ... and people rush across our border being at a port of entry or along the border that has not fence and that our military is on the border\nThe military is going to be given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here\nAre coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their families that's my guess\nBut nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nBut I agree with one of the sun shine we don't want to vote for and also it has undoubtedly true that most of these people are simply being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S stuff\nOn the look probably been lied to the beginning I'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross um so they are\nIncluding the ... in the middle of this I'm simply used as human shields on on a harder on the behalf of oaks hostile to the United states that is a horrible raunchy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nYeah look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people are taking the time I think more than any other person and media in this country\nAnd I've been down to the border Thirteen times and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built\nUm I I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall of an end fencing and I can look across the fence\nAnd on the other side of Mexico I saw nothing but poverty I saw ... what we would almost describe homes built surrounding will look like what we would describe as a junk yard even and then on the other side of the fence or ... million dollar half million dollar homes in San Diego\nAnd apartment on that one side and all I see is poverty and and and ... I think I'd want to look across to the other side and I want to go over there is things look dramatically different and better over here and I don't think Americans you know there were very open people\nBut we can't take in the world's population and we have to have the ability to control our borders and what we're asking is that people do it the right way\nAnd it really just keeps you know what's in our circular argument it's just what we have to do for our own safety\nIt without question of what you just described age most of the world all of sub Saharan Africa most of South Asia most of Latin America is the argument here on the people who will control the border\nThat we are supposed to allow me to ... billion people move here because that is what you were actually talking about if you're going to carry this to its ultimate logical conclusion obviously cannot\nWe have to maintain control of them\nYeah All right we'll really really appreciate it Sam thank you eight hundred nine for one Sean is our number you want to be a part of the program we got to take a break up right so the biggest part of off year elections mid term elections or turn out that means you showing up\nThat's that's where my head is that today and\nUh well I'm trying to warn people that this was real but you know hit we have history running against us so there's only going to be one of three results on the morning after the night before\nAnd it's either going to be while the Republicans picked up seats in hold the Senate Republicans while they held on to the house and that's going to be the best case scenario or it's going to be a split decision they pick up seats in the Senate but lose the house or\nIt's going to be a disaster and that's you know speaker elect Nancy Pelosi Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer Hillary frankly I can see any one of those three scenarios unfolding with the third one the least likely\nSo you know I'd rather go vote for the gusto and when it all one of the big problems for the Republicans as they've had forty five retirements\nThat's forty five unknowns on the ballot and the Democrats you know they're getting all of this money poured into these house races because they've given up a lot on the Senate races there going all in the get the house and\nTo really try to get in people's minds and\nMake them understand that for the Trump agenda to continue we really do need both houses\nBut those Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Maxine Waters is a committee chairwoman and Adam Schiff as a committee chairmen and Gerald ... is a chairman it just it's a disaster for us eight hundred nine four one Sean are toll free telephone number [noise]\n\n[noise] get a grand in your hand you could try to trick or treating there you go that's right and the best they got to be a very good cash that can catch a game\nYou can try to catch didn't win a thousand dollars up to sixteen times a day every weekday\nWow oh that's a scary Hillary as though you're in ... the same thing when you're listening\nWhich began follows a lot of weight ... here here's your a thousand news radio ten forty W.

be the tipping point it's actually thirty races kind of like what we have but\nThey they have a five seat race they've got the Republicans locked in a two hundred seats they got the Democrats locked into two hundred and five seats\nAnd the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words they're toss ups in other words it we win the seats and that means that Republicans will retain the house
