[laughter] I don't know\nOkay suddenly ... soon as possible\nDemocrats this is what we're now witnessing and this is not unprecedented I've been in this business radio Thirty years I've been in t._v. I just started my twenty third year\nThe playbook is the exact same every two four years Republicans are racist Texas massaging as Dina phobic Islamic phobic homophobic\nThey weren't dirty air water they want to kill your children and some look alike of your Congress man or woman is going to throw your grandmother over the cliff\nNow they've even taking it a step further than that\nYou have the center for American Progress switches John Podesta says oh group he created this thing and another think tank I've never heard of the third way\nTheir advice thing Democrats what they should do and not do and the lead up to the election what they should say what they should not say spend as little time as possible talking about immigration\nDon't tell the people the truth about immigration sanctuary attacks ... pack up punch it says that a memorandum oh okay New York times got a copy of this thing Democrats the strategy is preparing the memo or advise him all Democrats\nThat they could neutralize the attacks if they responded but they should spend as little time as possible talking about immigration itself instead\nPivot to more fruitful issues like by the way health care and taxation for healthcare means he put a bomb and care I don't know how that's fruitful for them ... you know keep your doctor keep your plan and pay less that hasn't worked out very well people millions lost their doctors their plans and they're paying two three four times what they were ones paying\nAnd the only thing they want on taxation is oh they they they want\nYou know they use the rhetoric you know redistribute shouldn't tax cuts for the rich the reality is ah that's never been true in half the country only pays three percent of the tax bill\nThe latest numbers came out and Bloomberg yesterday\nTop three percent of Americans pay the majority of taxes in this country the top three percent\nTop one percent pay forty percent\nThe top fifty percent of all taxpayers pay Ninety seven percent of the total individual income taxes let me say it another way the bottom fifty percent of taxpayers only pay three percent of the tax bill that's it\nYou know which small percentile of taxpayers you know also pay three percent or more well you know if you look at the top fourteen hundred taxpayers one thousand four hundred people in a country of three hundred plus million people\nThat group alone pays a massive share of fourteen hundred people pay nearly ... percent of the taxes just just fourteen hundred people\nTwo thousand one bottom fifty percent paid nearly five percent now it's down to three percent that's it you have this progressive tax system that they want but it's still not enough they want their crumbs back\nThey're not going to tell you Maxine Waters the Jason if you can find the cut Maxine Waters said they don't they keep telling me not to say it they don't\nWant me to compare what you're dealing with what we have in Washington DC

side on their side and I'm not going to move her house you know there's a difference how some of our leadership talk about how we should all all of this not saying please don't say impeachment anymore with Iraq\nI was saying the chicken [laughter]\nAnd they spent they Maxine don't say it\nIn other words we we we agree but we're not telling people what we want to do we're not going to we're not going to ... we just want to keep it quiet well we're going to do well that's what the center for American Progress is recommending they doing immigration\nIt's very difficult to wait on immigration with vulnerable vulnerable votes in states that Trump carried in twenty sixteen the strategy memo goes on arguing\nEven the most draconian of Republican policies like family separation threats to deport dreamers undocumented immigrants cetera et cetera\nFailed to sway most voters emphasis added let me interpret this for you\nBeing quiet don't tell the people the truth of what we're really going to do\nDon't talk about immigration don't tell them we want to eliminate I stop saying it don't tell them you won't open borders keep lying to them you know we've got Claire McCaskill we got an unbelievable tape that we're going to play in the top of the next hour would project very tough remember last week we had\nYou know former governor of Tennessee reticent and the people in his

wants to semi automatic rifle ban you know she's quiet on gun views because he has a bunch of Republican voters\nBut if this tape revealed she seek relief supports gun control groups\nHer staff says you got to wait until after election to bring up Trump impeachment you know to voters ... listen if they don't understand why we won't say they need to get over it you know people just can't know\nThat ... McCaskill in a ... Obama they have the same view on everything it's all in this tape people just can't know that they actually are heard or campaign guy saying and McCaskill's office\nWell they're all this is why

get the money and mind you know even on the bill yeah I was in black or\n[laughter]\nWhat I'm saying is if they ask in less they specifically asking voting for the wall we should let them go they need to think that [noise] so I think she's saying she's on the wall and they don't ask then let them think that\nIf they don't ask let them think that that's what the rule is now for the Democratic party even the center for American Progress sending out don't talk about immigration Maxine Waters admitting that she's being told don't talk about impeachment gesture shop about it we we know we know we're going to do but we're not going to\nWe're not going to help people the truth before an election that's Claire McCaskill and and people on her staff people just can't know that she wants a semi automatic rifle ban and that\nThat of course she would vote yes on gun bans of course she supports the semi automatic rifle ban\nYou know she's quiet on guns because she has a bunch of Republican voters but secretly she says she supports say hey gun control group\nYou know what our staffers saying well we'll wait till after the election to bring up Trump impeachment to voters get over it we can't do it now we got a line now with you know three weeks Twenty one days election they why would we ever tell people the truth people just can't know McCaskill\nAnd Obama essentially the same views on everything wow now the people in Missouri I Hope you're paying close attention but it's bigger than that a project Vera tosses got this undercover video they got the undercover video of the week before about former governor of Tennessee Bredesen Marsha Blackburn is now up by fourteen points\nBecause on that tape it's the same line he'll he'll do the right thing when he gets there of course we don't agree with everything Trump says no not at all do what ... what we're saying we vote for cabinet of course he wouldn't vote for Kavanaugh\nI mean this is all part of a light campaign propaganda campaign and it's all about power\nAnd it's being exposed at a very high level I mean this is really you know seeing people how they really are is should be so enlightening to the people a tendency in Missouri a James O'Keefe is with us She's the founder of project Vera toss\nExposing the senators I you know I watch this and I'm just like what a bunch of liars that's all I think when I see those great job\nYeah Sean this is a pattern you know we released the Tennessee won the Tennessee Senate candidate bread is and you know responded by fondling and bumbling his words caught red handed these are all the staff or Sean inside their McCaskill's office they're all saying essentially the same thing when it comes to Obama\nGun control impeachment they're all saying that we have to do one thing before the election and do another thing afterwards some of that audio is a little hard to hear but\nOne of the most powerful pieces was when the sky Glenn Winfrey one of McCaskill staffers explains to our journalist when we asked so what do we tell the moderates ... after we did the impeachment because we are going to happen mislead them\nAnd the guy goes will tell them get over it\nAnd that's the that's the ... it's that this is the other guy next arose field organizer tells us he says a quote people just can't know unquote than the cast on Obama had the same views now I confronted neck on the street yesterday with a microphone ethnic why don't you why don't you tell the truth\nAnd of course the reason is and this was true in Missouri it's true in Tennessee it's true in North Dakota\nOh some of these red state Democrats they have to lie to the voters to get elected it it's a necessary condition so all we're doing is exposing\nYou don't want no one's going to say agree with that point they don't have the lie they have to lie if they wanna win\nAnd ... it's a question of whether or not they will put aside any any sense of decency honor honesty and embrace any level of truth and they won't and that's the point and you know I think everybody on this showing on TV\nIf you look at houses and play the senators and play if you vote for any Democrat in the house you're voting for polo see\nIt'd be a vote for Claire McCaskill or Bredesen or hike camp or cinema or Donnelly or Bill Nelson you're voting for Schumer because that's who's going to own them in control them that's what they're going to vote to be their leader\nWell you know and and Sean and some of these states like Missouri in particular the pro life Democrats and pro gun Democrats used to be a thing decades ago misery with the stalwart when it came to those things but that's a shrinking\nGroup of people and and people like Claire McCaskill half state in order to when they have to or they think they have to mislead\nAnd again this is a Greek chorus of staffers these staffers are not necessarily villainous I suppose there is on us because they're going along with it but they're just telling the truth so it's very interesting to see British and after we play those tapes on your radio last week\nBritish and talk to local media this is the kind of the Senate candidate he told all the local media stations well al these these young guys were caught and kind of misled staffers who while they don't work for me when in fact they did he apologized so it's going to be\nVery uh by the way and that was a lie to the first thing is that well they're they're just college kids no they weren't actually worked for him\nAnd the guy I Apologize this guy brown who is that the Democratic spokesperson for the bread is in campaign he actually apologize to the media can you believe that Sean apologized\nFor misleading people about our videos so it's very interesting to see how McCaskill's in response now this guy Josh Hawley the Senate candidate that's running against a McCaskill has responded he's tweeted out this video um he's jumping all over it so the question is really interesting thing is because\nWe're going to get him on the program and later this week I mean we're basically following the work you're doing you know one of the question is going to ask but go ahead finish your thought\nWell I was going to say that McCaskill has in the video it's she says of course I'd vote on a ban some type of gun ban and we asked her staff or what type of ban is that he had semi automatic rifles now this is an issue that nobody wants to talk about in Missouri particularly Claire McCaskill so\nWe're hoping that she gives a clear unequivocal answer about what her positions are on the gun issue and that's going to be very interesting if we can somehow get her to speak on the record publicly about this now that we've caught her red handed well\nI again I think that you're rocking the world of big state Senate candidates\nAnd exposing them for who they really are look I've been saying in explaining for a long time now what the agenda is when they want endless investigations although they'll stop the investigations that helped them the ... they'll they'll protect their deep state buddies\nThat conspired to to first stop Donald Trump remember winning and then later to destroy him um and then they will have endless investigations impeachment if they can do it\nThey want their crumbs back they're even saying that openly they're hiding their positions on open borders and eliminating ice they're not talking about really wanting to keep Obamacare under any circumstances and that's what they want to do and stop the president's agenda that's been working so these tapes\nI think expose what's going on in every congressional and Senate district except you don't have the manpower to get every single one but you've gotten a couple of big people are already\nWe've got we've got and request to do it in every everywhere and we have to be a judicious about where we do it and when we pull people out because I could have gotten more missions if ice but there's you know it's people are already early voting and some of these states and they fit the the bigger issue is like I said the last week or the few days ago\nAbout don't lie to the people I ask this guy next to roast when I saw him on the street yesterday said why do you have to why do you feel the need to lie why why as our politics so broken that that becomes a condition to having to win the honest

there to tell people\nYet and I agree with you and they had on can't get on with the family thinking gotta get out of California you can't afford to pay taxes and apparently this yeah\nI mean it's

and Tennessee have Heidi Heitkamp was already down by double digits Joe Donnelly is in big trouble\nUh we now see Heller was very important seed in Nevada he's now a by seven in the latest poll at least eight I'm really worried about right now is Florida and Rick Scott just has done an amazing job for the people of Florida\nWell yeah and then the hurricane obviously that that was devastating but but the response and that's to hurricanes now remember that that have hit there in the last year where where Scott has really shown if you remember on the two thousand twelve election\nRight here in Jersey uh that's where Hurricane Sandy hit and then President Obama had the advantage of\nActing like a commander in chief and going to the devastation while Mitt Romney has basically left helpless and they say that that hurricane may have tipped the scales back to Obama 'cause remember Romney at all the momentum in the world are going into that storm so yeah look a Jim Messina who was speaking of President Obama two thousand twelve he was the campaign manager\nA for Mr Obama at that time and he said yesterday I said why did Senator Warren have to do her announcement with her DNA now he goes why can't Democrats ever stay focused and I think this Elizabeth Warren\nRevelation or lack there of will only hurt the party further because I don't see how you could ever say and many media outlets by the way Shawn said that this was definitive proof right I'll give you literally the the headlines\nA fence around her and she's Ninety six percent European I mean at that one one thousand twenty four she has perhaps maybe Native American ancestry of some type I mean but it is but her she literally personally changed\nHerself who minority status when you ban and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority female professor there a Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous they're out there outrage by it\nDry and that was a turning point right when they when they came out and said this is wrong this is inappropriate this is a mockery then where are you going to say is attacking was with Warren is it\nStill conservatives or does it actually Cherokee Nation but I mean the the headlines yesterday Associated Press Warren DNA shows I have Native American heritage a CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence of Native American ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren really reveals\nProof of Native American ancestry again what proof this so backfired on her ... particularly ... nation got involved and and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow her I Know people think that she is a front runner\nBut the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are ready at Trump rallies in twenty twenty with one one thousand twenty four just written and that's it\nBecause now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where you can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that so\nYeah sure him to see who the Democrats settle on right away and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party has taken over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center\nFor American Progress and there was a group formed by none other than John Podesta but they're running their reelection now ... very revealing the Maxine Waters says they keep telling me not to say it I keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five\nSo they're hiding their agenda we learned that in this project ... with Claire McCaskill in her own words also\nBut now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration and all you know a sanctuary attacks pack up punch says the four page memorandum [laughter] I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times were obtained a copy of it\nAnd Democrats and strategies to prepare the memos that\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot\nTo more fruitful issues like health care and taxation it's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their super Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent\nCon be quiet about what it is they want to do how they govern\nAnd and the types of agenda items they really have\nThat's not an enviable position to be and I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps them\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP about four percent unemployment below\nFour percent right there's something like seven point six million job openings that was that was reporter by CNBC today I think in the country that's incredible we have Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate\nEvaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer lobbing missiles over Japan threatening Guam and the United states these are all very substantial victories the trade deal he just did with Canada and Mexico I'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the\nPillars of the presidency in terms of accomplishments Trump is winning right now he won with Kavanaugh as well even the CNN did a\nA segment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four percent forty five percent among registered voters member\nOf al ... was the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into this election because to your point they have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad for me so I can be the first woman president and I I Would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think\nBack I Can't remember what his platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and GM is alive hey that's easy to remember and it's a it was good enough right who was it will make America great again or keep\nAmerica great again the Trump can run on his record and Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have a it it's going to be a a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump's in trouble like it didn't two thousand sixteen but\nAgain a in till they have a message in ... Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin to win over those voters that see jobs coming back and companies coming back I unless they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate to have a lot of problems on\nOne poll that shocks me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now he's always had notoriously close elections he's always had all of these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with\nI'm not sure if the polls accurate but it has him down and that surprises me but I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball\nI always tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you got you got to make up ground than anything can happen between now and election day in Twenty one days but you know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making the recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona\nI see a surge of just the right time for Dean Heller in Nevada which will help him\nUm I I look at the other races Donnelly now is beginning to fall back in Indiana Marsha Blackburn is emerging in Tennessee thank goodness Claire McCaskill I Believe this tape is absolutely going to help to feed her uh if the people in Missouri\nIs widely disseminated 'cause it's outrageous and the only Democrat that might be safe at this point seems to be Joe mansion in the Senate yeah\nAnd in the Senate in order to win that back you had to go through this narrow paths if you're a Democrat through Arizona red state Texas Red state tendency red standing\nBy the way up I'm going to he's up by eight in the latest poll I'm actually going to be down during a town hall with him this weekend around the Houston area I'll I'll give up that announcement later in the week\nOh there you go yeah and and remember better more money than any cat on my gosh right million dollars and he's tattered already has a twenty twenty presidential candidate you know\nItaly sweating egg I mean it was was pretty outrageous 'cause she was claiming almost on a weekend basis you know that Brett Kavanaugh was that these parties and they were drug in these young girls in these boys were lining up in the hall and and gang raping these girls as a matter of adults almost a weekly thing\nDidn't have it on his ... I Would think a fairly smart guy right and and to listen to that story and say I'm going to go to\nThat with this I'm going to say that a girl who was two three years removed from high school repeatedly went back to parties were gang rapes were going on she knew they were going on and she's still kept going back and oh I won't be able to actually find anybody that can corroborate the story at least no one can independently find anybody\nThat was list I think NBC was saying yeah we tried to find the for people that Julie sweating except rep those parties one's dead to win and returned our calls in one didn't do virtually sweating to watch so now Democrats who used to hell ... and the media obviously\nAnother story but also the hunting on it but in the process they gave up any semblance of core values that everyone believes it and that's due process in the presumption of innocence that's where they lost that\nI got to run but Joe ... over the hill dot com you want to check out his work is probably the only media he is the only media reporter in the country that I Know that is actually fair and balanced and\nAnd he goes against the grain and thank you for a great job thanks so much quick break right back your calls on the other side of big candidates and I tell you about that and the minute including pastor Brunson\nIs going to speak out his first cable interview tonight at nine what it was like in prison in Turkey and much more [noise]\n\nThink ...
