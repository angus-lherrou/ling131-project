New York times reported they could find no one with first hand knowledge nobody\nTimes doesn't like Donald Trump\nAnd then they also pointed out a bit of information that was a little bit scary and they found out that Mr Ramirez herself had been contacting former yell classmates asking if they were called the incident and told them that she could not be certain if Mr\nCab and all was the one who exposed himself\nWell I hate to say it based on her own words that point that's it that cases over add\nTo it her own admission that she quickly became a ... and ... that the party that she was foggy slurring her words and admitting in her own words that she had significant memory gaps from the evening so the New York times couldn't corroborate the stories\nAnd of course we've got your number three allegation number three and that was the case of Julie sweat Nick\nAs soon as the woman that is being represented by the attorney of the year for the Democratic party Michael em Ali\nAnyway a lot of credibility issues as it relates to her and we saw all of her allegations blow up the sheep backtrack big time on her story in an interview that I don't think ever should've aired on NBC News but does she gave the names of for people that she said would be able to corroborate her story and\nWell they couldn't find two of them or they wouldn't respond one of his dad and the other one said she ... they don't even know who Julie sweating it is I've never heard of this person\nSo that story fell apart and\nHad an ex boyfriend that had found a restraining order against her and I'm not going to go through a whole bunch of credibility issues that she has you know I have a lot of facts evidence to what she's saying is not true at all from a former boyfriend\nAnd oh anyway and that was the third allegation where are you supposed to go from here\nI remember Mr sweat neck was claiming that on a\nRegular basis almost weekly weekend basis it almost happened on the weekend basis that these boys including Brett Kavanaugh as a teenager\nIn high school that they were regularly happened often almost every weekend she was a time of the parties that they were literally drugging girls against their will making sure they got an ... capacity hated and that they would\nLine up in the halls of boys and the boys would then\nGang rape these girls and it happened again almost on a weekend basis and then it became in the interview well I don't know if he's spike the punch shy but I saw him give out red solo cups once and I saw him near the punch bowl and\nLining up in the home I I I didn't they weren't exactly lined up in the hall but I saw him in a whole\nIt's just not anything that would hold up anywhere under any significant scrutiny\nAnd the FBI has done the best that they can do and it's interesting that all the people that have been demanding all these FBI investigations they don't want an FBI investigation into Keith Ellison and number two guy at the DNC always now

state Senate in Texas right down along the border and this we had a candidate who got lost by twenty points four years ago came back to the special in one um\nAnd is the first Hispanic Republican state senator uh in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience who this is going to come down to isn't holding\nIt isn't conversation at the coffee shop who cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up at boat and if our side does show up in both I think this could be\nOne of the most historic elections that you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections I have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would thrust of behind\nThe scenes I got to give you a lot of credit because I remember speaking with you you probably forget it the day before you became speaker of the houses in Nineteen Ninety four and I remember talking to you that day and the day of the election and\nAnd you are surrounded by a group of people in Joe Gaylord and you actually shared with me the information you had and you said it was absolutely true that for the first time in forty years Republicans would take over the house\nI think you and I were two of the few people willing to go out on a limb and said yeah Donald Trump as a real shot of winning this election and\nAnd people laughed at us at the time and I I Believe that then and and we proved out to be right we also the ... both of us predicted Obama would be an abysmal failure as president based on a very rigid ideology that he seemed

they're going to shock the world and all these people are going to do what they did in twenty sixteen and being the shock of their life\nWell that's right and I mean I think what what I Would say to

D quickly had gaps in her memory and the fact that we now know that you know so many different things that we didn't know before and that Mrs Ramirez was actually out there soliciting information from her fellow your classmates the New York times reported that because she quote couldn't remember\nThen in the case of Julie sweat Nick we saw her backtrack dramatically from her original story and her claim that judge Kavanaugh was a serial\nDrug or and rapist of teenage girls will give me the evidence in cooperation to any of these women story that's what I Want from you Danielle and don't duck and don't dodging don't hem and haw that I'm asking a tough question give me any cooperation you have\nI don't hit the cooperation because I'm not don't yeah I and I don't find it was investigating that's right and we talked about this last week [noise] wait a minute what everybody's talking it was a full and\nFair investigation getting married at twenty cooperating witnesses to the I think now and the FBI added\nNo excuse me why every main person that was mentioned in the case of professor Ford and the case of miss for me or as the New York times tried to corroborated they spent an entire week interviewed dozens of people\nAnd then she herself was calling around to other yell classmate saying I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if it was him that exposed himself and then we all watched Julie sweat Nick all third shift\nAnd backtrack from her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drugging of women so could you have any cooperation for any of these incidents at all\nI'm not getting any education that I don't expect the next day and I did\nI mean all you're following you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite of corroboration people are saying those they don't recall those stories at all that it or that happen that way at all\nThe churches are conjuring not staying on at the last twenty four hours at camp out at the judges drinking oughta honestly I I think this is horrendous for shy\nIt's um the idea of not answering my question I'm asking you if the people make serious claims allegations on a serious real topic because there are real evil horrible president predators in this world\nAnd they mentioned that there are specific people have you interview them that they're going to tell you my story is true and it turns out to be the opposite don't you believe in the presumption of innocence Danielle McLaughlin yes or no\nOf course I Do show the outline getting something\nOf course I Believe and the and the and the presumption of innocence but I also have to leave that the FBI should've been allowed to do a full and fair and ... and that is why you're going to see on the left a huge outcry and I understand that this is energizing the geology hey\nI Know there's not a talking point what was on a second\nI Want you interview looking in the case of professor Ford\nBefore people she identified were at the party and none of the four have any recollection of the abandoned the one I witnessed says it didn't happen\nWhat else are they supposed to do is we don't know where it happened we don't know when it happened we don't know the location and she doesn't know how she got there I got home from their what else did the FBI to do they had already given sworn statements under the penalty of a felony\nAnd all they did is reiterate those statements that the FBI what else could they possibly do Danielle in that case\nAnd being on the opposite side it if the if the if the FBI just\nAnd yelled ... question do you have any corroborating witness or any corroborating evidence at all you can say right now\nThat isn't on the question that as an I.\nC.

left and I just really really hope that uh that he'll make the right decision tomorrow or Saturday challenge\nSounds like after his comments today that that's more likely but uh it just you know I Know there's a reason he's not running for reelection and it's just hard to see a\nSee good people leave to Washington and come back a few years later and not be able to really recognize that I feel like that happened with McCain I feel like it's kind of happening with just as well\nI think the most shocking statement that he made was on sixty minutes when he when he actually admitted\nWhen asked if he would be voting this way if he had to face the voters he had an absolutely not [laughter] I'm and I'm like oh so you're you're only stand on your principles when\nWhen you have to face the

got the FBI weighing in\nA Joe Biden said it would not going to offer recommendations\nAnd they're not going to offer opinions here and all they are going to do is give you a straight data and that's what it was given and everybody seems pleased by that his comments Susan Collins comments seemed to satisfy them no corroboration of any of these claims as we've been claiming\nAnd as we've been telling you and so the allegations have been problematic from the start you know assuming assuming for a second here judge Kavanaugh where to get confirmed we we have got to have a deep analysis\nIn this country over where we want to go forward in terms of going forward because if we allow this to happen to good people it it's it is so it's so dark um I was having a conversation with a friend of

for the rest of Brett Kavanaugh's life\nPeople know that this is what he's been accused of and yet in spite of the fact there's been no corroboration shifting stories and\nA media hysteria that that's why\nTo the extent that people can literally destroy other people with innuendo falls uncorroborated claims a shocking to me they did it to Robert Bork they did it to Clarence Thomas they've been
