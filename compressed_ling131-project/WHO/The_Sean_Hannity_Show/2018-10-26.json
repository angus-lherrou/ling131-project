them try to put the blame on the president's than making these choices are as you know Sean was much I walked off the CNN uh they they stuck\nBranded in the middle of broadcast they said that he was going to talk about the device that was ... which I thought was a good idea the general public some insight as to profiling packaging whatever the case may be um and then he got on for a ten minute blasted the president\nI just think it's bizarre I think it's way over the top I think\nThey're going to get what happened in Bernie you if you're sitting on the set of CNN explaining and detailed and you left and they send cameras following you for ten minutes\nI ... what happened I was on the ... we were already introduced to do a segment on on the devices and the investigation and then then you have to ruptured and said that running was going to speak about the specific device being sent that was set to CNN and his name\nUm but then he got on and he went on this ten minute tirade against the president\nYou know I didn't have any objection that he'll be an on I thought this was a guy that has credibility in the agency that could talk about profiling could talk about targeting could talk about packaging could talk about what to look for give the general public some real insight as well but\nBrandon is referred to the president as a traitor and Britain is up to his eyeballs and all the

and his wife you know we've been saying that we better be really careful here it's I've been saying for weeks now\nGoing back to the Capitol hearing so say we'd better clear the halls of Congress somebody's going to get hurt somebody's going to get killed and no one will hold you know the rhetoric gets ratcheted up\nAnd then those people that were silent when it's a Republican\nNow or oh this is outrageous we can't have this kind of rhetoric this is this is horrible he can't say fake news they are fake news\nNo they are and we need to keep using that phrase and I'd also like to congratulate the commission of just doing what he did yesterday that was a capital moment whether you stood up the truth I I just like one person on the left of who it is CNN anybody tell me which

nut job or some lunatic on what it doesn't matter what their politics are\nWhy why is it OK\nWhy is it okay for CNN to run high runs a day blaming\nDonald Trump for not taking responsibility for these are tempted leather bums why is that okay when the ... republic your profit from congressmen actually getting shot that at a baseball field very close to where I Am spending about by left wing

at\nOne with mansion up and the other with his opponent the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey up and that means that West Virginia is now in play that means that Joe Manchin can be replaced\nOr joining us now is the attorney general from the great state of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sir congratulations there seems to be a very big comeback\nI'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a\nElection day well Shawn thanks so much for having me on and\nI think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on the differences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter will help advance the Trump jobs agenda and mansions or dishonest Washington liberal\nThe more and more people drilled down on mansions record he's starting to lose support so we feel very good and we're going to win on election day we just have to keep out working on the way we out\nYou know I was really worried during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business and it was one of our our best resources and we have clean coal and we have\nYou know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work\nBut it's but energy is the lifeblood of our economy and once Donald Trump got elected which by the way would have never happened to Joe Manchin at his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened at the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nWell thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you\nI spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the office that took the lead nationally to go against the Obama power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and\nThe more people are hearing about that the better off we are\nAnd I basically have helped serve as a bridge to President Trump's really strong policy that West Virginians really appreciate that so that's one of the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today uh I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nWhile he votes with them when it counts so you know I I don't like the count a naming of post
