{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WHO", "content": "And stuff oh we'll be almost irrelevant because we're going to be so healthy there's this play into a into this stuff\nReally I mean even when you just look at the state of health care in Iowa and the costs are some of the lowest in the country at length fixed just for its cost as well\nAccess could be a little bit better it is more of a rural state so I don't think it's an outlier there\nBut the al ... so it's actually how healthy people are can definitely be seen their higher life expectancy is there's lower heart disease and diabetes rate so all these things these health outcomes are evident in Iowa\nWow that's so that's really fascinating as well so low a little heart disease and diabetes\nYeah after a few things that I Would say that part of the country isn't nearly all on the same page on but I think having better access to health care and you know I think the first step there is having an insured rates certainly can account for that\nShe'll be ... to ... ... does like I'll get something from you guys every day or we don't talk to you every day obviously we talk to you when I was doing well but it's a these surveys are rarely a one off so it was so how many times have you guys do on this one\nThat is what we've done yearly for a couple of years you know especially as of late when they say the AA has come under the microscope we won a casino how has Obamacare fared from state to state and it's still here although obviously on murkier terms\nThat you know we wanted to look in and see exactly how that check out across the country\nAnd how's how's ... are we done better or we'd done was one of ... so we improved ...\n[noise] yeah I Would say has improved from year to year I mean are just looking at the overall change and its insurance rate it had a lover uninsured rate to begin with which is certainly helpful ... twenty and that number has gotten about five percent better which is certainly a great number\nRight and you know connect to to ah to that was the five to cities in America um are you did that one that long ago as well right\nYeah absolutely so we did we took a look at health care with we just said has certainly improved in Ireland when in the states for health care and when we're looking at just the sea levels et cetera and after Iowa\nStill doesn't do as poorly as a lot of its neighbors that actually tied for for with Hawaii in terms of one of the least at\nLeast ... I'm looking at ... were a lot to do more in the west Des Moines\nJust as a city or is the first I was city only ... been America sixty six\n[noise] exactly so that's pretty low down there especially when number one would be the fattest\nYes no I was by the way in Little Rock Arkansas and the Little Rock come way ... ... ... nothing to do with Conway, Arkansas\nSide [laughter] [laughter] I was not\nClear nothing to do with me [laughter] so ah so yes uh uh the morning was the first Iowa City in the\nList at a sixty or sixty six in terms of factors cities\nOr not to do my best not to contribute to that number by the way it was making that very clear as well\nOr a mad appears to be a be overly Iowa City or in the top one hundred\nYeah absolutely so that's pretty far down there again number one would be the fat is not one hundred obviously opposite they're so being the one of those lists where you actually like to be the low the average line\nYes indeed ... what is it is very interesting stuff I Love talking to you and we always have fascinating conversations uh so uh so what's next what are we going to get from your goes next you know what I saw\nYeah keeping keeping with things that Iowa is good at or known for um we are looking forward to the mid term than singing exactly how much it vote and waited from state to state and this year I think more than other\nMess or we go up or what do we do very well to get people to the polls and we we usually have very high numbers were very engaged a which I think is good luck to do without first in the nation status in presidential years or ... will help always a pleasure thank you so much for taking the time today I really do appreciate it\nThank you than we will talk\nTo you again soon so they go oh we are all we're doing pretty well when it comes to an insured rights\n[noise]\n... tonight ladies and gentlemen thank you for being a long ball derive thank you to our guest today is about the book of a job in our own but everybody else we're very grateful facts\nYou use them as food ruby do and the mind you must like you guys it's never the same without you bought you already know how their cells and one of the rest of the nice tomorrow's from foreign\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to wait Joe Joe ... and I arch radio station and on your age the radio Haiti are being\nRevealed morning doubled you wait Joe\nSimon and you know I've interviewed Newt Gingrich a bunch of times but I can tell you that he's one of our great conserved his mind and there'll be here in Des Moines bowl one night only on October the fifth day you'll get to hear him speak you're going to ask questions you got to meet him it'll be a special night for a great goals ticket tax deductible\nSupport our American story spotted weeknight June W ... radio oh me that you should term audio tickets at an evening with new dot com that's an evening with new don't come doing right now\n... financial engines dedicated to giving you more than Fifteen Years of rational sensible investing a Bush do the best W ... coverage this week's show they show has been moved to five pm Sunday this week only\nUh we have a tough race by the way it's going to be a tough race\nFor Scott Walker in Wisconsin who I think it's done a phenomenal job a as it relates to you know the state\nOf Wisconsin in ... I Hope that people are Wisconsin finally remember that but we now have Walker one poll finally up by one but it's very very close a we have a Georgia governor race that's also closer than I Would like for comfort\nOr with the Republican camp up by two and so we're following that raised pretty closely I'm In ...\nThe other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well what fifty one percent and rest musician\nAnd so we'll watch that but I think if you look at Heidi Heitkamp I think she's going to be and should be defeated in North Dakota\nI Hope the people of Montana will pay attention and understand that you basically have Chuck Schumer junior because John tester always goes with Chuck Schumer\nAnd the people in Montana can take back that state which is a red state then you've got other states like Indiana I think Joe Donnelly can be defeated in Indiana I think definitely Claire McCaskill she ought to be sent packing\nAnd I think Marsha Blackburn is going to be a phenomenal senator from the great state of Tennessee should've been a longtime friend of this program in recent polls now have her up as well\nAnd then we get to the all important house races I'm not going to spend the time here it's more of a visual thing that we're doing on television\nAnd we're picking ten important house races at night and more identifying those specific districts that are going to make a difference on election night in twenty six days and that will literally they these these districts were putting up hold the balance of power in the house of representatives\nI mean because of gerrymandering up a big portion and percentage of seats\nI ended up being safe for both Republicans and Democrats so we'll find out for voters by the way Trump more help now to these candidates in the president's got what he's out for days this week and he's going to be campaigning for everybody and these tight races in an attempt to help them all out now am\nI honestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump\nBut if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent if they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it if they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall\nIf they will do the alternative healthcare solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts and health care cooperatives et cetera were just going to have a better country\nAnd and more prosperous country you cannot deny the success\nOf this president and the fuel the pure force of personality I mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I Know he's an icon of class I Know he's a disruptor\nWhat if he's not fighting then we're not winning and when he goes up even against their own allies and says you're not paying their fair share and they do and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make Russia and Vladimir ... rich again while you're basically\nIt's your counteracting everything that NATO's trying to do which is prevent a hostile regime\nFrom ever having the power to turn off the ticket and turn off the lights blood of western Europe's economy\nIt's just simple basic things nobody ever thought that the president would get along with little rocket man fire and fury apparently Mike Pompeo the secretary of state at a phenomenal meeting I talked to two sources\nA phenomenal meeting with little rocket man and now a little rocket man is dead he's serious about getting rid of any nuclear ambitions\nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula the guy that everybody in the media said was going to start World War three that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula\nYou look at Seoul South Korea you know you look over the DMZ and what do you see thirty million people live there a nuclear armed North Korea is not something that the world needs if you care about human life\nAnd as a result I Would assume that you know markets would open up to North Korea the people of North Korea been suffering you might even see a reunification one day of north and South Korea Korea how great would that be for the world and I got a president that's not dropping cargo planes full of cash and other currencies\nAnd on the on the tarmac for mullahs in Iran that hate us and chant death to America death to Israel that's not happening either\nYou know I Want to get in Michelle Obama was on the today show earlier today and an interview with savannah Guthrie asking about recent comments from Eric Holder about kicking Republicans let's go to holders comments and Hillary Clinton's comments you can't be civil with anybody that disagrees with us listen\nTo all over [laughter] my wife went really high voice scare me [laughter] so you know when they go low we go [laughter] go low we [noise]\nWe just moved in with radical ideas about\nCannot be careful with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nThe house Android that instability can start again but until then the only thing that the Republican theme to recognize and for that is strange [noise] and you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nAnd the president [noise] really demeaned the confirmation process\nAnd we we can't be civil of we disagree with them no give us power and then we'll be civil or you've got to be kidding when you when they go low you just kick 'em\nWell Michelle Obama said fear is not a proper motivator hope wins out and if you think about how you want your kids to be raised how you want them to think about life and their opportunities do you want them to be afraid to their neighbors and you want the main greedy one dimensional wondering Michelle Obama say anything when\nSarah Sanders was run out of a restaurant or Pam Bondi was run out of a restaurant or secretary Nielsen was run out of a restaurant by these angry liberal leftist\nMobs and they are moms and this this is Rand Paul pointed out somebody's gonna get hurt somebody might get killed and all of this if they allow this to continue bought the rhetoric is coming from the quote so coal leadership\nAnd by the way Brock Obama himself was not exactly a faint when it came to the issue of being a well civil\nOn your friends your neighbors to the doctor whether they're independent or whether they're Republican or you're with them and I'm not at the foot miss a purchase on Fox News also is a very\nSimple against a Sean Hannity alone\nWhen someone is cooler acts like a bully you don't just sit there and level\nNow our motto is\nWhen they go low we go high you\nKnow they're going lower than they've ever been and that's what we witnessed with judge Kavanaugh would know due process known presumption of innocence the\nMost outrageous allegations that were thrown against this man and people still I Believe I Believe people when there's no corroborating evidence\nThat's a party that doesn't believe in fundamental basic fairness constitutional due process and the presumption of innocence that isn't said\nAnd we saw what happened to him but we see it every two and four years don't we and we're seeing it now and it's happening and you got people like let's see Maxine Waters Cory Booker Eric Holder yeah getting their face kick them when they're down you know follow them in the gas stations in grocery stores\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for and what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house hand or the [laughter] that Clinton villain he can start to get\nYour body cabinet [laughter]\nUp now they are lashing out one piece at a time there flailing away while only can they are getting venomous because they've locked themselves into a corner Rush Limbaugh\nSo everybody wants to have these conversations and then when we engage about

under oath that's the normal procedures to underwrite\nIt sure is it's just supposed to come in at birth order your maybe he's the guy who runs the Justice Department\nAnd understand the timeline on may ninth\nKobe is fire based on the Rosenstein Nemo or make six eight to ... when he has this conversation with Lisa Page and Andy McCabe where he says he was thinking about\nRecording the president contemporaneous with that ... held the FBI chief counsel Jim Baker that Rod Rosenstein was serious about that this solemn may sixteen and of course may seventeenth is when Bob Mueller's named special counsel also in San ... what else happened on ...\nThat's the day more than ... director\nThe same day just kind of interesting and then of course he doesn't get the job in the next day he named special counsel so this all happens and then as you pointed out in your intro a defies ever know the third Pfizer and they'll get signed one month later so that sort of the timeline and what we want is all you want to bring you didn't ask me questions about all those it then throughout that two month period\nAll right Dave Brat let's bring you into this but first of all how is your race going I you know I Know that you've been targeted now by by Nancy Pelosi and company and the thrown a ton of money in your district to get your defeated how's it going\nIt's going to go where when and on the pilot the or the health care immigration pact or my opponent is a work you're liberal and so we're putting the word out but it's like you said they're pouring billions in because\nThey know they're going after you and never come off big time during your right\nRight no it's it's a it's a battle\nAnd that there there is is that my opponent the resist\nA she really doesn't have a platform it All right now and so she's just running on the resistance and out and do vote and that's it so why I think I think the people especially after the Supreme Court dabba collapsed and then she Hillary yesterday and all the folks chime in and on the left I think the ah the voters in Virginia or darker to write that\nLook I think we've been putting a pen specific raises a night um congressman Jordan you know I mean the California Arizona a Mayo loving Utah Colorado is a number of seats there there\nWas it and if people want the full list the we've identified the top Seventy seats we put it up on the Hannity dot com you can also that people can check and make sure that that if their congressmen or a woman who's in a tough race that they get out to the polls what do you think's going to happen in twenty six days congressman driving\nI think we're going to win I think we got great candidates like Dave Brat who were fighting for the American people elected us to fight for so I think we're going to win and I think the way you phrase it ups on his way you've been doing it\nHow radical the left is I like to say it this way there there that that left today is that they apply Capra Nick when he respects the flag they embrace Governor Cuomo when he says America was never decorate material and Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed anyone who supports the president and we saw that double down on that whole mindset doubled down yesterday with what Clinton in holder said about Republican\nWhat are you all the ... they're going after terrorists Sanders and Pam Bondi and secretary Nielsen says\nYeah I it just it just how radical the leftist today's modern Democrat Party today's party of the lab has taken most extreme positions in history raise your taxes abolish ice never secure the border continue to socialize medicine and impeach the president and you contrast that with what the president under his leadership we've accomplished\nList is going on but we did this the other day but they could buy the taxes cut ... regulations reduced the economy going at one point two percent lowest unemployment fifty years out of the Iran deal the embassies in Jerusalem we've got a new NAFTA deal the hostage to the ... in North Korea and we got to get guys\nOn the United States Supreme court that's an amazing record and if we ended up that way and twenty six days we will win and keep the majority and continue to be able to do things to make\nAmerica why don't you know some of these candidates they can't string two sentences together there's no idea why they are running for office when you can't communicate\nThis is a nationalized election and we got to understand that and go out and get that kind of message they read understands that he's out campaigning on the good things that happen with conservative leadership and his leadership uh that's how we have to run these campaigns and if we do I think we keep the majority\nLet me ask you a question now Fox has confirmed that the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein then acting FBI directed his after the firing a coma Andrew McCabe and Robert Mueller all met on a weekend day after Mueller's investigation started up\nAnd in that meeting Rosenstein and ... and McCabe or or both detailing reasons why the other one needs to recuse themselves the Russia investigation as as a whole are sitting there watching all this go on to knowing that well I guess I'm In charge of the whole thing what do you make of that uh they brought\nYeah well I'll just go back to the way your frame that you um ... dot com it's all like you're in Iran oversight get specific but in your intro Rosenstein said we have to follow the constitution for the people\nBecause we need oversight to follow the evidence using reason and now he woke up in front of the people right say he's not just saying no to Jim Jordan and members of oversight committee he's saying that the American people\nAnd he when he's just that in your remarks that the job and the role of the constitution is to give the people oversight\nUsing evidence and reason so he he's thumbing his nose at the U.S Congress and if we don't hold strong that President is not good and I'll let him go on with the so it's a\nYes on ... ... you're exactly right both the cave and Rosenstein ... this is interesting that both actually right Andy McCabe should have been recused from any type of oversight over the Mueller investigation because of his involvement with his wife with\nHis his conflict when his wife was running for office and he was supporting her so that should have disqualified him Rosenstein is right about that but the caves right about Rosenstein Rosenstein wrote the memo\nFor why companies should be fired one of the things Mohler is looking into was there obstruction of justice into the firing of calling me\nYou've gotta be kidding me so that guy's gonna oversee this so both of them had conflicts and so that that that sort of the funny thing is to argue with each other and like you're both right neither one of you should be involved in the special counsel any type of oversight\nOr I don't want to thank you both for being with us a congressman Brad the seventh district of the commonwealth of Virginia\nThat will lick suppose all of these red state Democrats they say one thing when they're running for office but they have very different plans after and later and we're going to get to all of that\nUh let's say a re just in Ohio Toledo what's going on regions how are you\nI'm Shaun how are you I'm good what's happening\nOr you just had Jim Jordan and Dave Brat on there and you've had a a a Trey Gowdy I think previously over the past time but the thing that irritates me about when you talk to these guys and this Rod Rosenstein a fiasco that's going on [noise]\nYou'd never ask them why don't they just somebody stand up and make this guy up here and how does he keep his job when he won't come and you know go before Congress like he's being instructed to\nWell I mean that's a great that's a great point because you and I wouldn't be able to duck a subpoena\nYou know we you and I wouldn't be able to have it they subpoenaed are documents good luck to us it was like in the case that Hillary Clinton yup they ... have you ever subpoenaed\nYou know your emails and your delete thirty three thousand of 'em and then you bleach ... your hard drive and have someone bus stop your devices and take out some carts guess what's going to happen to read just take a guess\nYeah yeah I Know you're going in jail in\nJordan I liked Dave Brat I like all these guys but after a while you just find that they're they're they're all talking no actually\nThat's not true I mean you think of everything that we have gotten we've been able to peel the onion to the point where we've exposed at all of this happened they listed in every document we have gotten this because we had to pull teeth to get everything I mean we we are getting their hope you see that\nYou've given it to him on a platter but they will act on it\nFor well it's not Jordan and it's not brat and it's not meadows but it is some of the leadership and the Republican Party that are weak and timid and learn nothing of the success of Donald Trump that I can that I can agree with you on All right we'll take a quick break we'll come back
