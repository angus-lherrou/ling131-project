H. O. radio severe weather center has been activated and\nAgain we this is Gary beard and the W H A radio newsroom we do have a tornado warning who's been issued for boon Dallas in green counties until seven thirty pm with the tornado producing storm located near Perry we just had were just prior to the issue is with this warning\nThat uh the Perry police department who was reporting the tornado was on the ground north of the Perry high school there also has been an extension of the area of the tornado watch\nThe tornado watch now used extended for a deer Adams Kass Clark Lucas Madison\nMy ... Marion Monroe union waffle low Warren counties in that is until ten o'clock tonight\nAnd the tuna watches continued for APA news Decatur wrinkled Taylor and Wayne counties until ten pm news well are reminders that you're listening to ten forty W. H. O. Des Moines let's get a description of the uh weather picture from TV Thirteen said Wilson\nAnd this is who Daniels in before we go to ed and Gary I just wanted to run down and make sure I've got all the ones that are accurate here we've got Decatur wrinkled counties under a thunderstorm warning till seven Fifteen ... I Believe so um we had a tornado warning for Decatur in wrinkled counties or a thunderstorm warning that'd be a tornado warnings\n... where we have two things that are still in play right now we have a severe thunderstorm warning that a expires out in just about a minute okay uh for the APA news area there ... who's been cancelled from the ... morning the tornado warning you see that effect for boon Dallas in green counties\nUntil seven o'clock and it will expire out\nAnd it looks like that one that tornadoes quite concerning is going to be a boon by seven or Ogden by seven oh five within minutes that people need to be taking shelter and then to the city a boon by seven twenty\nRight and it looks like the uh the national weather service also issuing the tornado watcher extending the area of the tornado watch to cover a large part of the southwest part of the state of Iowa as well in this watches in effect until ten o'clock tonight\nIt's all because of that sunshine and the heat that we've seen the strongest thunderstorms redevelop\nFrom the moon I over the shirts and\nThat's again that tornado warning that was still here for a little known I it is still a still in effect a no updates on that one at this point ah but ah the circulation is on the cells\nJust south of there into a Missouri they've calmed down a little bit they've started to lose a little bit of the rotation uh so we're we're not expecting this to be a long lived Tibet but through at least seven thirty we have the tornado warning for boon county we also have it down to the ... or a two areas of Decatur county\nAnd then you can notice here that that a center of a tornado that tornado warnings been allowed to expire or just to the center bill area north of ... toward Maria via\nNo more warnings for this one and you can see how everything is kind of spread out\nYou see that with the the loosening of that rotation it just kind of falls apart a little bit may see you know it's definitely some severe strong to severe thunderstorms but we'll be watching that close\nThis is a tornado warning this just over the county over the state line I should say from Iowa Missouri back into the Mercer county area that is moving to the north northeast and it's holding together pretty well so we may have an extension of that just round a Leon back over to Morgan to the moon but we still have a tornado warning there\nFor that I thirty five court or into southern Iowa it is continuing to move to the north or in a pretty good a pretty decent pace\nSo here's our latest updates a severe thunderstorm a with a warning and now out for 'em again the uh Decatur Wayne area that's the brand new one that just popped up forests and this guy is moving to the north\nAt a riot northeast at a very fast paced almost a of looks like sixty miles per hour or six them up her wind as possible and there's also a chance at this one may have\nA a a tornado with it so we're watching this on clothes but this is the brand new warning until seven forty five for dictator and Wayne counties\nI Would expect this warning to be eliminated from ... back up to ... we still need to make sure you're in a safe place make sure that you're seeking shelter these storms are going to be racing to the north end to the east\nAt a ... up to about forty five miles per hour thanks vegan and\nUh for a garden grove homicides and would burn and share it and and the Kona within the next hour especially garden grove you need to be seeking shelter now that is until seven thirty five this is for the severe thunderstorm warning but then outside of the warned area would burn shirts and\nA into a just south of Knoxville this is all moving your air into your area and this is where we expected a lot of rain\nThis is going to be an enormous amount of amount of rain coming in a short period of time or near the Oscar Lewis area today we had highway Ninety to shut down because of the a heavy rain or there's going to be more flooding for sure tonight tornado warnings still in effect until seven thirty\nFor to cater and wrinkled counties so for another Fifteen minutes or so\nWe'll see that to severe are there that tornado warning severe thunderstorm warning basically right underneath a tornado warning so for the same spot we do have some rotation but again it's not looking as defined as it was earlier they were\nAh we were just talking and listening to again some of our a law enforcement folks who did not seen anything on the ground there it was radar indicated where they did find the tornado warning on the ground or the tornado that was observed is that you're Perry and that continues to move to the north and east I've not seen this one again\nAh ah issued or reassured but a\n... county you guys need to be continued to seek shelter down there and also Decatur county southern Iowa boom back over toward Ogden\nThis is where the outline of this tornado warning continues to show these kind of flaring little jagged edges\nThat's where that high wind potential will stay with us and that also has a lot of rain is going to be a day loser of rain falling across these areas that had been flooded out uh we've had a lot of folks showing the pictures of\nEspecially ah the area around boom or into the eye thirty or highway thirty court or where they've seen the rivers rising at a terrific rate over the last couple of weeks and that still going to be the case tonight so boon seek shelter now from Ogden right across the highway thirty\nThis is moving to the north end to the east and you can see that kind of cone if you will or ... that is kind of stretched out a little bit on the north side that means that is moving to the north and to the east\nWe also have an aerial outline of flooding this down to the south\nOr we'll get to that maybe a little bit but we're most concerned with our tornado warning for boon until seven fifty or there'll be in the boon area by seven Fifteen Erickson by seven thirty seven forty for ... and in stories city by just about eight o'clock\nThe tornado warning is in this outlined area of course as I mentioned earlier that flowed out her is actually the ETA path or the path where we expected to be at that time are we still have a again the warnings that are still in effect\nIn the boon county area back down to the south for the tornado warnings [noise] they have not cancelled but one to the to the south yet again that we're seeing the tornado that was on the ground right around the Perry area\nA that was a new there Perry high school and then near highway one sixty nine that's where we've actually seen it on the ground the strong spotters today so this is that a spot ... just north of Perry and then moving back up into the odds and area in Boone county is\nThe first time we saw the observed spotter or down in order to observe the solve this tornado on the ground was right around six fifty one so it was just before seven o'clock\nAnd now as we get to dark as we see some of these storms with high amounts of rain they can be rain wrapped so we're still looking with velocity scope here to show you where these tornados are moving to the north north east\nIt is going to be a dangerous situation if you're caught on the line of this even with doubt the tornado this is going to give us a high wind effect with these bowed out kind of echoes where they\nKind of share out like this and get this kind of jak an edge on them that's where we're going to see I think the potential for some very high winds\nMight even find some debris with out a tornado as that wind speeds or pick it up so if you haven't moved a patio furniture and hail we've had enough rain a lot of people maybe it given up on a given the patio furniture out for now but it's going to be chilly as well as we go through a seven day forecast\nThat idea to secure that before the storm hit you a little too late for that in the boon county area into the mind though this is going to be right on our doorstep\nAs we speak from around going back over to West Des Moines a into a Norwalk ah Anthony ... said that the line of storms that are really starting to\nChicken with some gusto of a heavy rain and the possibility of one or two becoming severe\nBut I think as we hit this a seven thirty at quarter to eight or our that's where we lose of course all the heating of the day and that should allow these storms to start to die down just a little bit\nAs far as intensity of the high winds but we won't find is the lack of rain this is going to be a ton of rain and even some lightning where the lightning tracker now on does a Megan's putting it into motion\nYou can see that it streamlining from ... all the way back down to a\nAlone I into Grande river right along that I thirty five court or it's going to be some dramatic like\nYou're listening to live coverage on news radio ten forty WHM does severe weather coverage and Gary buried myself Sudan you'll send was Ed Wilson of course getting his insight from the W. H. I. T. V. channel Thirteen weather center\nI just wanted to mention some good news it looks like Dallas in green counties had been pulled out of that tornado warning and that's excellent it does continue however for boon until seven thirty and I said mentioned this is all coming toward the Des Moines area and points to the north and some of these areas that the as you said Gary on the radar with\nA showing that there's a lot of the storm was in Boone or should be a boon right now and then we'll be going off toward stories city if I'm not correct\nRight that's correct but to the Des Moines area will be seen on a very tiny cell in about another ten to Fifteen minutes\nOr that sort of the the the leading edge you all who storm activity and it looks like the heaviest storm activity we're going to miss we're going to see a we've seen this storm sell this moving toward us starts to dissipate a little bit\nUh if you look on the radar on television you may not see that but we've been looking at two or three different radars trying to see what a what they're seeing and it's looking like as far as the wind velocity it's starting to dissipate that this storm cell they it is kind of broken away from the main sell is just to the\nDue south of the\nOf the a Dell area right now and it is moving right into the metro in the next Fifteen to twenty minutes probably will cut across the uh\nIf anything is is falling according to two scheduling will cut across\nAround the urban Dale and then up into the ANC any areas it may miss that the main part of the morning but it will hit the suburbs and then followed after that and about ten minutes after that will be the storms they will last for\nTo keep a tune here to news radio ten forty W.

V. shows with more people who are claiming I should have been interviewed I could have told this town and I just hope that people can separate the wheat from the chaff\nHas a prosecutor looking at these three cases how would you handle them thirty six years later in each case no corroboration in each case\nUh well uh with I don't know anything beyond what's in the public record but without corroboration you might entertain a meeting for an hour or two and say thank you for coming by a there's nothing to talk about\nUm okay so when when professor board for example she can't remember a location\nShe can't remember an exact date or a place not he's struggling to know the year in the case of ... Ramirez she's calling other fellow students from back in the day she's asking them if they remember because she's not sure she remembers\nA in the case of Julie sweat neck who who made the you know changed her story well Brett Kavanaugh gave out red solo cups and he was near the punch bowl and I saw him in a hall maybe not lined up in a hall\nUm which is very different from the these sworn affidavit that they had originally laid out a week before I mean you ... if you look at that but in the prosecutor's office what are they going to say\nWell are they going to say these are all frivolous accusations but uh as far as we know regarding doctor for\nThat one nine or ten witnesses interviewed and people are going to say well there were so many more who didn't weren't interview it's not the number of interviews it's the what they have to say and if it's all cumulative you don't if you don't count the witnesses and but I think\nSome of those other people as I say now I'm going to want to have their twenty four hours in the sun\nOr you know in the in the same and they're going to want to go to the national Enquirer or something like that but there are no criminal there no criminal cases are no civil case is a good man was confirmed he's now a justice and we need to move on\nLet's talk about the news that we are pretty confident as coming out this week um let me just say this very up to sleep I can that if a top ranking FBI official word a confirmed that\nThere was an orchestrated effort among the upper echelon within the the OJ and the FBI to go after Donald Trump or retribution for the firing of James told me what would that mean Greg Jarrett\nIt would mean that this was all a hoax the Russia hopes and it wasn't Trump Russia collusion\nAnd that would mean Greg Garrett was right from the get go but yeah I\n... and and yes and the latest information only corroborate the thesis of the book there there wasn't Trump Russia collusion but there was Hillary Clinton\nRussia collusion she had on her payroll British spy or who is using Russian sources and now we've learned a through the interview behind closed doors of James Baker the top uh FBI lawyer\nThey documents were being passed him from Hillary Clinton lawyer and the ... lawyer\nOr to you know this is astonishing information uh and in fact we've also learned that you know this was

week\nWe are going to issue a subpoena to the Justice Department that expands upon the subpoena we issued earlier this year and include McKay memos\nAnd some other documents that have been requested by us but that's far not produce including Peters trucks personnel file some of the struck page a tax ah\nThe ah the the Bruce or three oh one and some other things All right so joining us now in Studio we welcome back to the man that than the middle of all of this\nAnd I said do you know what the news is tomorrow you getting bits and pieces of information about what's happened there ... there we have people that know that were there that understand\nThat in fact I'm a lot of this was a plan and a scheme of not only a media strategy league strategy but uh to take out a duly elected president\nI'm hearing a lot of big hints coming Sean but similar to the situation where the DNC paid for a lot of lies about me I'm careful to not jump to any conclusions until the real facts are on the table so but I I agree and what I'm hearing is going to be really big\nYou know when all of this I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain this information obtained these warrants against you um you've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you would go to Russia where your work brought you that you often would be debriefed by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with them correct absolutely shocked yup yup bitten\nBy intelligence CIA up gosh absolutely and other intel community people for decades yes for decades and I assume they liked you and trust that you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments similar to any international relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted it was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted ... to spy on your country that you love\nNo but I again I'm happy to share insights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah but what we're pretty open guy\nBut so anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hospital regime\nAt and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact the food and does have a network of of their own deep stayed operatives\nThat are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't doubt that\nWell in terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that the\nRussians did versus what the what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you talked about election interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia dead\nAt the DNC ever get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI [noise] um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire a room people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies and they mentioned to me that there were a\nDemocrat hired operatives working in Washington who we're paying for these ah these operations and you know soon thereafter at ... I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nAnd listen first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I I first started getting the phone calls I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a call ...\nThat they had the spies a warrant against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report a I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen ... within just a couple of days of when the uh first Pfizer weren't with I think first\nRan with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's what we said wait a minute there's a Pfizer Warren on the Trump campaign or were you aware of our reporting at the\nTime ... it's funny Sean right interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know in these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox what they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but there again because it's all about you know media perception\nWhat were they asking you at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing un simultaneously you've never been charged with anything\nThere's no indication you're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going\nTo be charged Frank ... well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and\nAgain the primary focus of those conversations was about the ... right by the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to ... a lot about that that they ask you specifics about that dossier absolutely yeah basically everything I've done and kind of all sort of\nRevolving around that also you know as you were alluding to I've\nBeen a source for the intel community previously and you know I helped or the year prior there is a an indictment of ... or ... you know someone pleaded guilty in the southern district of New York and I was a witness on that case so you know we were talking a bit about that too\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what now now that your life had been up and that um you I I Know you're fighting to get your good name back I Know media organizations have pulled lies about you or I Would say that the\nThere was absolutely reckless disregard for the truth that a lot of these cases um what are your plans what are you going to do what are you going to do to the government that ends up you know using on verified information to literally take away all of your civil liberties has got to be some records for you\nWell I've definitely working on a few strategies Sean to me the biggest concern is just the damage that this has done to our country and the roads blocked that it's created for the Trump Administration in the first couple of years in office so\nMy the biggest thing that goes back to the first thing you were talking about in your segment a with chairman Goodlatte is just getting the truth out there and so I'm doing everything possible to help facilitate that you\nWrite a book what it's like to be spied on by your government you know something to that if I'm Serious\nTo be you know a at a movie certainly that can be put on the screen as as well\nBut I mean what does it feel like 'cause I guess maybe there are some people because they took out the Warren on you do you have you ... do you know what they did they ask you about everything that you were saying and doing it this time basically yeah and you know going back many years again at\nAnd I want this to hurt law enforcement I Love law enforcement I Love oriental community but you can't turn the tools of intelligence as powerful as they are on the American people\nI I fully agree Sean and one of the big ... problems as you're alluding to is secrecy no right so much as just undercover and\nYou know and even it it's funny over those ten plus hours of laps in last March when I was talking with the FBI agents you know eventually they were asking me a lot of questions and then as as we went further and further into the interviews towards the end of the er the long conversations\nThey started saying well our bosses and want to [laughter] you know and they I think they saw through it but they knew you know that was back during the\n... era as maybe one of the lessons never go visit Russia ever [laughter] don't go to a lot of ...
