but it could very well go back you know we're talking about that in the news they say that we had hurricane that were far worse than what we just had with Michael ... says\nThat they say I mean they say that and the ... what about the scientists who say it's worse than ever\nA show me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda mostly camp during the answer is also a political agenda\nWhere was that angle of the the altered climate change data it's science was as the Al Gore and others would tell you but it was so surely perfect is no disagreement and the scientific

Atlantic is changing it's getting colder again we're going back to the cold\nPeriods of the Atlantic multi decadal oscillation like we were in the eighties and nineties early nineties and that's a natural cyclical process so the past two years if you look at the charts you can see Greenland has had well above normal snowfall\nAnd near record snowfall so Greenland she apparently she's on aware of this because two or three years ago of course Greenland wasn't that way so right about Antarctica so so Antarctica is up near normal they will record breaking record breaking\nHigh about five six years ago then they came down below and they're back your normal now let me let me say this is the president answer the question perfectly here's why\nUp until now\nClimate change first of all everyone believes the climate changes so that her question is based on a false premise that he doesn't believe the climate change\nThe climate is always change naturally feel now people are saying that now it's man that's doing it how it is not questioning it make any sense in other words if you were just apply only accept something after ten million years every single time it was natural now

reviews of the pro check their bail ability even book appointments on line and when my wife love most is that home advisor is completely free to you\nAt talking about fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson well he's now saying and indicated he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore\nOr he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria ... that Glenn Simpson is unreal legal jeopardy in all of this he also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia probe in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nIt was a great piece by Jonathan Turley ... three reasons mother may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker now saying the FBI failed to provide a\nFederal surveillance court with important evidence well we don't that now for a long time and we know that\nFor Pfizer court judges\nOr handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lies that was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through ... from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele a foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the ...\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate and the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the Pfizer judges that it was Hillary Clinton that paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we are finally beginning to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so Jason shape it's is with us\nFormer congressman now on Fox News contributor author of the New York times best seller the deep state we have Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova of of the gentleman ... with us ah thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your will house\nAnd it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request as they seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to\nIn front of them under oath well the hard part about when you issue a subpoena when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or committee I can issue a subpoena but the only way to earn force that is through the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the OJ won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issue by Congress\n... the name that people need to also familiar ... themselves with is mark and why it marked why it was ...\nHe was canceled for the DNC he was careful for Hillary Clinton he was counsel for a put a productive group he was involved there this this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name\nAlong with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that the Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they could just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think it's important\nThey should make him show up and in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth\nIt's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope they send your talking to your former friends and telling them to get them a get hit in to the Congress to take this it and I don't care if they're not going to\nI'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got a subpoena you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later you don't say oh mine he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think about seeing as you said peanuts and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it they say\nThat I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... the gang of eight information the three oh two between\nOur Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying oh I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get some ... but let me just say this 'cause this is really important all the names that you heard Michael fuss Mr Elias ...\nOr all those people they are key to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom between the Congress has it and can't issue a subpoena score we now know that the FBI or\nAm I fix and that you see a cue\nTo conduct electronic surveillance of Americans said he said it on farms\nThe oil without legal authority to do so and that information what fact conversations of George ... were intercepted and in the course of the fact that he does compensation\nThey found out that off the top of it was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never ... information to the by the court\nYou know it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand\nWhat the insurance policy was Lisa Page testify that in the the nine months of the investigation leading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end up there was something there there is no there are there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media elites strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid dossier that dossier information is leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion\nBut they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaky so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be good begin I is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nNo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right the people that were in that meeting and remember

about Obama\nOnly play with ... ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect the president that that represents the free world so they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and anytime any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile and\nMr Speaker you're gonna
