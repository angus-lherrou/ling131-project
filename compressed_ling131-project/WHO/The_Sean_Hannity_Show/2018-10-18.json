Saudi consulate in Istanbul also have a Turkish newspaper reporting as much good show gay did work for the Washington Post\nManaged after visiting the consulate you lived in Saudi Arabia is not an American citizen but he he wrote for the Washington Post for many years Saudi council and it can be hurt on the tape saying during the show these tortured do this outside you're going to get me in trouble or in another tape\nAnd unknown person again I Can't corroborate doesn't only telling you what the New York post and the British newspapers are reporting on one Turkish newspaper\nIf you want to live when you come to Saudi Arabia beat quiet anyway return to Riyadh on Tuesday ahead of a plan search of his residence part of the official Turkish probe into the show\nTo some parents that is the the Saudi council he's back in Saudi Arabia Middle East English language website holding a Turkish sources saying that there were no attempt to interrogate could show ... but that us Saudi hit team came to kill him\nSource told the site that his death took seven minutes forensic physician doctor Salah Muhammad al ... body listening to music as he began to cut to show these body while he was still alive\nIn New York Post Turkish authorities believe to show that he was killed by a special team of Fifteen Saudi officials though the kingdom the crown prince of Saudi Arabia denying that says these claims are baseless this report comes as Mike Pompeo met Wednesday\nAfter being in in Saudi Arabia now meeting with the Turkish president hairdo on and the Turkish foreign minister after ... rubber arriving from reality where he said the Saudis promised a thorough investigation\nMike Pompeo on Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh said he didn't want to talk about any of the facts a day after the president said there's got to be a presumption of innocence but he wants all the facts\nStop us deployment diplomat Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh blah blah blah blah several of the members of the alleged hit team were found to have close ties to the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nSolomon according to a a photo by the New York times Turkish officials have shared an audio recording with the U.S in Saudi Arabia that they say ... ... was murdered by Saudi operatives of except the president say they didn't get any tape but this time\nHave a pro government newspaper reporting that ... apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing well I Would assume that watch exist in this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out and body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but\nBefore leaving reality Pompeo told reporters that the Saudi leaders made no exception on who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British newspapers are saying circus of fish or Turkish officials have a recording of blah blah blah and that that in fact happened on the apple watch and you have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely that show that he could have broadcast the signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nAnd I think what's happened clearly as the Turks and the Saudi constantly had the Saturday counseling wired they have transmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's going on\nAnd we'll find out in this case um my take I think it probably all happen but I don't think we should rush to judgment\nBecause the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later\nJoining us now Dr Sebastian Gorka former White House advisers brand new book is phenomenal by the way why we fight\nDefending the feeding rather not defending the feeding America's enemies with no apologies also Dan hop but Fox News contribute a Thirty Years' CIA up operations officer a doctor Gorka I assume you agree with me that all signs point to the Saudis\nAssassinating murdering this guy in a a far Paraguay that's what I'm thinking\nYou know the ruin in warfare or report from the battlefield must be questions\nOr I think this man is that whether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain that this individual was caught between two nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world that's the new often I'm an avid won regime of turkey\nAnd the birth place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was caught in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate this man was a journalist wasn't on American soil that trying to spin it was a foreign national read them and it was a common type that you wrote commentary and he has a long decades long history\nOf ... the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the figures Arab um see a lot of the twentieth century ... so all of these things are total statements of factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hot but it's been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have your back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years\nUm my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murders and the most evil Bruce Bruce brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth now there's no doubt we'll go and we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nYeah I I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen ...\nTraveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived if it costs to lift the day the show he entered and we know eat fish again never exited the cause um we do the makeup of those of the safety and Saudis for them apparently part of ... one of them the forensic doctor you referred to is listening to music well\nAllegedly this membrane ... body after he was killed or what we don't know\nWhat were the orders that were given for these Fifteen Saudi and who gave them the orders and then to prove that they report posts Puerto those are all questions we need to answer that President I think was a hundred percent right to just fashion secretary said\nCat or the fact emphasize that they were issue of grave concern to us we'll get the facts with accuracy and a lack of the that's what matters I Will remind the listeners that when Sergei Filin was poisoned back in March\nBritish home secretary said they needed to avoid speculation while we allow the police to carry on their investigation I think that's what's going on here in the last thing I Would just highlight is that Well Secretary Palmdale with needing enjoying it saw cliff well see I'm quite sure what the the FBI legalized fish in Riyadh\nAnd the other in a central or an uncle or\nMeeting with their Turkish and Saudi counterparts to collect the evidence but it to be a part of reviewing it shot\nYou know it's I Wish everything could fit in nicely neatly into a box assuming that I Believe that the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince is denying it\nI'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but knowing that they're a very different country but\nNow it gets complicated because fall so the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the Iranian had you had money in the region and their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that would cause the entire world\nUm I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia were done where this was that um I think there's there will be consequences severe consequences the president said\nUm but it gets a little rougher what do you do if you're also trying to battle another enemy I mean the United states did partner with our arch enemy is the former Soviet Union to defeat or not the Islam in World War two\nYeah absolutely I mean you you don't make the perfect the enemy of the good\nGeopolitics is locked on the fixer self domestically it is the author of the ... the uh over the perfect on on the truth fish or we have a lot of a matter of rich or with Saudi Arabia I at the beginning of the Trump Administration we established very very\nGood ties through a and B asked um it's been found them in a very those relationships are not going to be tested\nBut this is a nation that revival depends upon our support militarily and I'm surrounded and training so there's a lot but reachable average against Saudi Arabia but you're absolutely right this is part of a\nI Wish we would have leverage did in the last eight years when Obama was president you know knowing that gays and lesbians or killed were routinely and Christians

I mean I've talked to people on the left they you drive the nuts I mean you give them fit so fury that I thought only I could do\nIs try to see things just auditor discuss and I think one of the things that they're ceding most about that what they're most hating right now is the fact that both Claire McCaskill and Phil Bredesen neither Senate candidates one of them is the United states senator\nHad been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage I mean it's it's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri or their their the local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journalists do not want to talk about this in fact I just got a bike up Washington Post he's tweeting at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about somebody's position I said what about other things she's saying here but she hasn't been public about so they they very much have shown for good reason\nWell I'd listen I wouldn't you expose fraud what this is now exposed as something that I've been pointing out for a while we have Maxine Waters on tape saying they keep telling me not to say it and every time they tell me I'm going to say it anyway impeach forty five impeach forty five\nThen we see the center for American Progress warning every single Democrat running for office don't talk about immigration we know we know we won't open borders and eliminate ice but don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna do don't tell them what you have is a massive\nFraud propaganda light campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about the ... that is really scary\nScenario for the country and for people that ... that's the only way they can win is polite and to hide who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show now\nUh this is the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in in Missouri and one of the staffers agrees McCaskill quote essentially has to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these are staffers throughout her office hiding\nHiding in masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's acting beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us\nTo take the money through ... indirect means in order to I guess appeal to moderate to the front page New York times story today about how these\nPro life pro gun Democrats or was shrinking\nConstituency in Missouri the Democratic party have voted these people out but the ... still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it is a truism that in order to get elected in a state of Missouri or Tennessee you basically have to mislead voters to get elected as a kind of crap and that's what these stories and cover\nKnow the thing is to me um I think we the American people had it when\nThe Democratic party a band in any sense of due process under the law equal application under our laws you know immediately I Believe her but they also said the minute Kavanaugh was announced we are going to oppose them any way by any means necessary\nAnd then when all the the the allegations are getting more severe more severe and everyone's saying well I Believe her not even want to hear from judge Kavanaugh presumption of innocence at all and when corroborating so called corroborating stories fell apart they still didn't care\nAnd I think the American people are watching that we have a story out today where you got these anarchists middle class of ventures attacking to Minnesota GOP candidates are assaulted one is a woman\nA name as state representative Sarah Anderson punched by an anarchist EPA trying to stop him from kicking her campaign site\nI mean this this is now the Democratic party and you're exposing it and yeah you're going to be hated but I think ... shining a light on truth I thought this was this stuff that's sixty minutes used to do\nWell undercover McCaskill statement McCaskill Claire McCaskill issued a videotape state which is unbelievable I Know you play a little bit on your show last night and she had been quoted she says well starting with Josh Hawley as to her opponent would be part of ... betting someone in my campaign first of all I categorically unequivocally deny\nThat he does not work for me he does not work with me I've never spoken to any of these candidates I stay away from candidates I investigate candidates but she is one on TV Sean Claire McCaskill just falsely stated that Josh was involved in the attorney general Missouri was involved in this and then she says three times I committed fraud\nWill will walk by what were courting the people being honest that's brought\nIn their own their own their own are it's not\nMy words I'm not the one who said quote get over it this is a direct quote for staffers next a roast about how she's going to impeach tropics you've got to tell the moderates to get over it after she gets elected ... words and she's calling me a fraud stir for telling the truth to the American people it's the job of investigative reporting\nTo expose the truth and and I think she didn't have to respond to her response because it's filled with lies and then you wouldn't do an accusation\nI'm just glad that you were able to get all of this out and before the election um why do I suspect that there's probably going to be more tape other candidates I have known you now what for a decade or more\n[laughter] that's right yeah I mean ... you know am I Am oh a pun intended Missouri now you know my ... next to release the candidate of the time we have to United States senators\nAnd their candidates opposing them responding to our investigative work we're lying in their responses were sort of using the Olympic ... tactics against the landscapes the landscape was to get the reaction and use the reaction in the reaction to the reaction\nWe have two reactions now and we're going to the next state will be releasing another video early next week and it's very very a battleground state [noise] same theme Sean ... they have to lie and then once they get elected do deal bait and switch through\nAnd do what they actually intend to do and it's just on videotape stopped by words stopped my claims are not giving you unsubstantiated\nNot a lot of people watch it to themselves and
