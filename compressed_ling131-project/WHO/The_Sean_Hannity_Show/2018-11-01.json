stroke\nA that happened back in June they've had an investigation of the border regions announced last night they were going to retain DJ's head coach\nUh and then things got out of hand verbally and uh uh out in the state of Maryland the governor a chimed in and the result is that he's been relieved of his duties as head coach and at first up the big picture is the tragedy of what happened to Jordan McNair\nAnd uh now DJ dark dark and is out at Marilyn I don't know how well you know coach a dark and but it's a sad day at Merrill\nOf only met them I'm at the the media days in August uh so I really don't know him a well but\nA first and foremost as you mentioned is just you know the loss of life I Can't imagine the impact that would have on our program and justice you know the family everybody involved are just so tragic so uh that in itself is just you know a part of the grass that whole thing\nAh and then you know what's what's happened since then you know we're not at the scene or we don't all the details facts et cetera but I just can't imagine what everybody's been through over there and I made that comment to the ... before the game so you know I don't pretend to know any of the details whatever but you've got to ask of a job\nJust trying to hold this whole thing together 'cause I Can't imagine that that the you know the center of the story is a loss of life which I just cannot imagine being associate with it that's got to be really just hard for everybody and obviously most hard on the family\nYou know the pressure to win at this level uh is is tantamount to ...

keep watch over everything uh but uh it it you know nothing's fail\nSafe no nothing as and you have to have a you have to trust people in allowing people to do things and um you know it's a big organization but a voice well very lucky to be here are like we have a tremendous staff of coaches or who know football but more importantly they're great men and uh they're they're great mentors I Believe that\nUh and then on top of the medical staff that it was just absolutely fantastic so and I'm trying to force thing or even suggest earns enjoyed it but it's just so many things ... things are going to happen uh and and unless you're right there you don't all the details but\nUh it's just it's ... points out just do a you know things can happen fast so\nYou know you always have to try

it's just amazing to watch it sure is\nA huge folks are and how much they would basically undermining America for the purpose of idea unless\nThere's a lot at stake I think the most you know if you're barely pay close attention the Democrats stand for nothing except painting Trump wanting their crumbs back open borders not anything that's going to improve the lives of the forgotten men and women in this country but there's just because you spend a lot of time with us today we really appreciate it thank you and five or six days now to election day I'm sure\nWe'll talk before the election and afterwards and get your take on the results so thanks for being with us look forward to\nEarn eight hundred nine four one showing us our number\nAre so when's the last time you and your family just gather around a table and play a game together I don't know probably maybe never in some cases\nMay sound old fashioned but you got to listen to me the new board games that are coming up they're really amazing and you got to try it one I've been telling you about which wages as a party game\nBy the way only takes thirty minutes to play everybody all ages can play it it's simple to learn nor the game is going to bring families together like what's in waitress I've been talking about it for years\nWhat people tell me the feedback I get from people that are played it but we all start playing everyone puts their bones downloaded devices down and we actually connected the family and real memories are created by the way you can get which in wages this week target is running a special you buy a game or two you can get with some waitress for free\nThe only way that she's going to get that capital back history of California in orange county and in my district it was the first time in eighty years since FDR ran for president did we had a Democrat nominee for president when\nOrange County and so the Democrats think we're vulnerable and that's why they hit zero zero in on us\nWell this is really interesting because most Republicans you don't think of California races being that important but now it's become crucial in terms of you know we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com\nUm that they're really focused in and which means it could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know who controls could or the house\nOr come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi this is a real threat and I think a real possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four saved democratic seats a hundred and Ninety nine safe Republican seats\nAnd all these thirty some odd toss ups are are Republicans on defense that means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all those money\nI'm can ... exactly yeah so tell us about\nYou know what are the issues there do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are are being influenced by the money and the negative ads\n[noise] yeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where people want to continue to this America forward I mean we had the lowest unemployment in forty nine years that's you know in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it in Nineteen years people have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs\nConsumer confidence is that I mean we're really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear do you want to continue living uh America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era to where you had over regulation where you had high taxes where you\nHad government in your life and I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district we have over ... fourteen point advantage on the ... the return over the Democrats\nSo we aren't seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump by big margins\nBut the house it's just harder to figure and I don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds history runs against the party in power that forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS seat\nUm and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job for the people ... and you're\nA state and in your district but the you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that or democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free healthcare for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\nIt's a very challenging environment and to be from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out the so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now and the Democrats have thirty nine\nAnd found it is really really important that we hold our seats we got to turn the state around you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that come out of Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly gather news that\nUh it is getting more and more affordable to live in the state and we need to have it get to the point where that pendulum swing back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for Californians until we\nOne of the problems is that you will ever have swinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations and hide taxation of states like California and New York Illinois New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them\nAnd you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot of a lot of cases Nevada or that they leave the liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states\nBecause if you look at it I mean it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy a first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you know one one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if you're a member of the union you no longer have to pay your is\nThe unions can troll Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles we may star\nThat said that money go out of the hands of that at the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point in the future and the state of California\nWell I got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California you know have and this is the headline which I think it's pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions or California Democrats in in tight races\nAnd one other article came out said literally spending ... million dollars just on Southern California so\nUh we wish you all the best is is Mimi Walters California's forty fifth district\nA and I wish you the best on election day and Dana Rohrabacher and all these other Republicans in Southern California these races all will tip the balance of power\nAnd if you vote for anybody that's a Democrat out there if you swayed by these ads you're pretty much voting for below sea hope the people in those districts to understand that so anyway thanks for being with us\nThank you so much\nOr I Hope it works out for you\nNot fun running for office who wants to run for office these days are All right let's get to our phones or we have so much going on today six days out of election day\nLet's go to Mary is in upstate New York Mary Hi how are you glad you called well New York's on the verge of re electing Cuomo and what was done a thing for upstate New York\nAnd the fact

continue on our past\nAnd and and get rid of the Affordable CARE Act and uh you know overhaul of that\nUm and yeah I agree with you on that fracking point as well but I actually was calling to talk
