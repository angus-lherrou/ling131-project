America will desperate love because they're losing the more they lose the more desperate they get and it's good I think it will get worse before it gets better 'cause I think we're going to keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans that all they have left is this kind of a new electric violence a which in the end I think turns people off it's it's it's it's it's also a little scary because ... proved when he was shot um\nYou know if you're conservative and you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is it's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watch the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of videotapes\nAbout running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas culminating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves with the conservatives maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's wanted wasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory in and obviously the Republicans taken over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract\nAnd I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg and that is a I ... everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threaten trade wars they're not they're not\nMaterialized because that's never been as a pension his intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\n[noise] yeah I think look I I think he is the fourth\nA cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity and is often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo and the federalist society\nWith so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments uh and that that's just a huge advantage\nAnd they're all grows out of what is now if you go back to the Goldwater of fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulate each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with him and and the and I think are just further isolates from\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they wanna teach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done\nUm they also want open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration\nThey want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just that and we hate Trump that's it\nWell I think that's right and that's partly because uh if they tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be defeated so badly\nThat they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think and I mentioned the send your TV show last night I think that we're about to be\nA magic moment in American history and I think the two words that captured in my mind are Kavanaugh and Carol van I think Kevin all the way they treated him of the viciousness the smears the character assassination to childish behavior by\nUS Senators incentive meetings I think all that came together to really re galvanized conservative and I think this caravan coming up from Guatemala should be a major focus of Republicans for the next couple of weeks\nBecause it makes clear\nThe argument about whether or not we have a right to be a sovereign country or whether in the Feinstein pillow see San Francisco Democrat tradition we have an obligation to open up our border to anybody who can get finance and remember these three thousand people I agree with\nLaura Ingraham is asking the question who's paying for this these three thousand people probably cost Twenty one million dollars to move\nFrom Guatemala actually four thousand people now grown to admit a spike among and us border crossings but you know Nancy Pelosi actually said we are not funding the border wall and that just as it seems to be an appendage to Donald Trump manhood I mean\nYou know imagine anything similar said about any woman by any Republican or conservative\nI mean it's outrageous the double standard and then so flagrant but\nYou know we're we're already have paid between healthcare education criminal justice we've

probably the most frequent user of the Robert Mueller's pit bull Andrew Weissmann yeah that Andrew Weissmann they went after Paul Manafort that Andrew Weissmann that of course was responsible for tens of thousands of Americans losing their jobs as it relates to Anderson accounting\nWhen you go back years and the Enron investigation\nThe same guy that was overturned nine zero in the U.S Supreme Court the same guy the center for Merrill executives to jail for a year and that got turned over by the Fifth Circuit court of appeals but sounds complicated it really is it is the single biggest abuse of power corrupts\n... scandal in the history of the country and I haven't even mentioned\nThe abuse of the powerful tools of intelligence that we give these people\nSupposedly to protect us joining us now a civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney David shown and Carter Page was banned at the center of all of this for the last year and you know Carter I Know that you're moving forward with investigations lawsuits and I don't blame you one bit I mean\nFrom everything you've told me is that our FBI our CIA our intelligence community knew well because as your work took you to foreign lands when you come back from places like Russia\nOr you would willingly ... feet deep briefed ... and and tell them everything you know to help your country out so uh I guess if you were really the bad guy that needed to be surveilled and they needed to Hillary Clinton's unverified phony Russian ...\nAs the presentation to commit fraud on the rise of course I Would think you'd be indicted right now you were as bad as they say\nShot it just it it just kept getting crazier and crazier every day I uh I think it just uh just ... this week we have the Saudis that are um owning up to various things that may have happened there and you know starting investigations\nAbout things that may have happened a couple of days or or he was within the last few weeks\nI mean this is something that is you know people have been covering up here in the United states for over two years so I think as a a you know a symbol of democracy a symbol of good government that hopefully uh\nHopefully the uh the car just starting to fall here and people will start phoning up to all the uh all the wrong doing that was done and that I think we're seeing hints of that as you've been a\nA all over in terms of your reporting south\nSo bring David and David as an attorney in a in a really good attorney you know Congress has a constitutional roads called oversight their job they or their check we have a system of separation of powers and checks and balances part of their oversight is when they are investigating the investigators they have been obstructed\nEvery step of the way request document requests we have found instance after instance where they cite national security is a reason for not turning something over ... only to be turn\nOut to be having nothing to do with national security only an embarrassment to them now we see in in just the last two weeks oh Rod Rosenstein who gives an extensive interview to the wall Street Journal here doesn't have time to testify under oath lens Simpson has pleading\nThe fifth Nelly or doesn't want to appear and testify under oath James Baker is testifying today and James Baker and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe one other person all saying Rod Rosenstein wanted to wear a wire\nTo go after the president of the United states\nOr if you are representing our friend Carter Page here I mean I Would think you'd have a multitude of lawsuits and the Carter page ought to be a pretty rich man by the end of all of us\nYeah quarter page has a very strong basis for thinking not only information but also damages and relief and he is now by the way of course\nConducting some litigation going after that doesn't Carter Page is very important to St example of how very wrong things have gone both defies the court and otherwise and government you hit the probably the most important thing going on here Congress's\nRole in providing oversight um you know God willing congressmen Munoz is going to return after this election his work and good let's work as the vital Congress to no longer bluff though anymore they've got to compel the testimony of these folks\nI think there's a real argument for a Fifth Amendment waiver from the public statements\nThat these folks make the American public demands transparency\nAnd they deserve nothing less than transparency and by the way these aren't simple in the states that have gone on you know we talked about this\nNinety nine page report on fire the\nCourt a abuses that uh and it said director Rogers was talking about um these aren't just mistakes these are conscious efforts and engender by law enforcement officers to invade the law they there is by the way one author or having you that no one really has exploited yet\nAnd that's a fight the quarter review there is a court that sit above the five to court it will also under their rule for consider procedural motions there are three judges to chief justice of when you right now that that just ... percent telling talent from different circuits maybe\nMaybe that court should be the subject of the uh the ... the foreign promotion trees you what's going on in the\nFight the court also just remembering you have in the five support efforts\nBy New York where are these buys a court judges a fraud was committed on every one of them they were that run verified uncorroborated information\nTo spy on the guy you're also talking to on this on this line quarter page why haven't we heard from them yet\nYou're right they should do outreach Collyer the providing judge and the fifth corps and these judges other quarter review it violates their own rules rules Thirteen and it violates the Constitution's and as you pointed out many times the most sensitive area\nOf our government probably because if it's part they application for the most intrusive kind of eavesdropping that there is in the world\nNo you know there was an article by John Solomon I Want to just read a little bit of it to both of you and carnival start with you to get your reaction considering you\nAs of now you appear to be the victim and all of this unless something changes ... Carter Page that I don't know about you are as\nOf now have you with this horrible person that needed to be surveilled\nAnd not just basically a I don't know a kink in the armor to get a Trump and then you become the on winning victim in a witch hunt against him but you know because you will light about they use phony information to obtain the warning against you but of all the agencies and the federal government Solomon points out that shouldn't be immune to special\nInterest schmoozing the D O D J it's\nPremier law enforcement agencies like the FBI the DEA the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives topped the list their independence from influence and their integrity and meaning out the law fairly are essential to their success in the trust\nThe American public puts in them but\nThis week the D.
