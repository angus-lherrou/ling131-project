I Believe Dr Ford or something\nI don't believe facts show that it was a cat and all but I Believe something happened\nTo someone else who did it I think something happened to her I was there was no

right that is the uh [noise]\nWell that's the party of Nancy Pelosi if in thirty today she's the speaker of the house screaming in the background and all the protesting that we have seen in the party of Chuck Schumer and and now we know a party that is willing to put all\nDue process aside fundamental core values constitutional protections like the presumption of innocence aside\nThat will go along with the guilt by accusation I think one of the more articulate moments who's in the beginning of of senator Collins speech today and how she rightly pointed out there was opposition\nFrom day one Chuck Schumer was one of them there was nobody that President Trump that was that what was going to be nominated that was ever going to pass the get many Democrats from the get go and I do believe that that\nJoe Manchin probably a shortage reelection with this decision today but I don't really got I don't really get the sense after reading his statement in hearing what he's saying and what he's with standing in the halls of the Senate today\nUh that that really might impact that much at all I got the sense that he did it for all the right reasons as well as articulated by senator Collins and what was the most riveting one hour speeches I think I've ever seen on the Senate floor that actually meant something\nAnd how she systematically went through every single not only allegation but the role of advice and consent the meaning of the constitution the interpretation of the federalist papers um what it means to the whole issue in process\nOf of a\nPresumption of innocence and and how important it is to society\nOr even issues where I disagree with her like for example roe v Wade and precedence and and judge Kavanaugh is real record she she brought a level of the seriousness and sobriety to the entire debate\nI just I I I don't know her and I frankly was blown away by this today and it give us some reaction to all this we have David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney Greg Jarrett Fox News legal analysts author of the number one\nBestseller the Russian hoax Greg what was your reaction to that speech I don't know if you had the same reaction I did I was I was stunned I I don't know Susan Collins well but I Know a better today\nIt was nothing short of brilliant ah with with uncommon eloquence and sound reasoning she delivered the finest speech on the floor of the U.S Senate that that I've ever witnessed in for a non lawyer\nIt was a come Halloween legal brief in support of Kavanaugh I thought it was important\nThat at the outset Collins condemn the outrageous behavior the distortions by special interest groups activists protesters and some Democratic senators making it clear\nThat their shameful character assassination backfired on them as far as her vote\nIs concerned and and I I the best part of what she said uh was free counting many of Kavanaugh's opinion to demonstrate\nThat even Democrats and liberals should be satisfied if not pleased with Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice but you know she did something unique here\nUh she reported the sexual misconduct allegations and said in no uncertain terms that presumption of innocence and fairness is relevant in the Senate advise and consent duty and she announced her own standard\nFor considering accusation she said it should be more likely than not which lawyers you know in the civil cases is called a preponderance of the evidence\nUh and she said it wasn't there\nThere were no witnesses to corroborate Christine forward including closest friend nobody has any recollection of it all said so under penalty of perjury so she present have\nThat was very low to certainly the most impressive but I mean her of a real obvious heartfelt caring for professor Ford\nAlso excoriated whoever it was and she doesn't believe it was Dianne Feinstein and she defended both ... and Senator Grassley in terms of the fairness\nWhich I said from the beginning I think the seriousness of the allegation deserve a a serious response from the Republicans and I'm often a critic of them and I think they did handle this perfectly on their side\nAnd but whoever did leak this today grave disservice to this woman and there's no doubt about that David shown let me bring you in and get your initial thoughts on what we watch unfold you now with the announcement Jeff Flake Joe mansion and Susan Collins it would appear that tomorrow's vote expected to be around five in the afternoon eastern time on a Saturday\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was just not a a non partisan speech\nIt was a speech in a row of mind or of the dignity that we can have them in spite of big disagreements\nAnd talked about the law the constitution the role of the Senate advice and consent\nAnd a little bit of a class\nAnd she made all of these left wing or is that have been saying all these days and it's going to get worse unless we insist that stop at thirty two days Lindsey Graham is next\n\n\nAll out

this\nProcess did all the work you would ever want or expect from a representative\nAnd and now I guess the left is about as unhinged they've been I don't even think it's safe to walk the Senate halls at this point\nSenator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina I Would argue it would not have happened but for him\nAnd he joins us on our news maker line um you know you told me something when I was in Washington earlier this week\nAnd I asked you I said well what are you know about Susan Collins and you'd you basically describe what I learned about her today I was blown away and I don't get blown away very often I really I'm too cynical I'm from New York I've been in radio Thirty years I'm a\nTomorrow I start my twenty third year in the Fox news channel\nShe's a moderate she's not a Sean Hannity conservative she's a moderate but she loves the country and she's got more guts and most politicians and our little finger than most everybody I Know in my district she's not afraid so helper Sean till you're ... years to help her they're killing our financial\nSenator helper I\nI was so blown away by the speech I Would absolutely recommend that people help her she she did something 'cause\nShe has leveled the playing field them brought a voice of sanity well thought out intellectual constitutional sanity that we stood on core principles a presumption of innocence was beyond the ... to me but let me ask you this\nUm tell us about ... mentioned it yes to\nWell mansions ESL light Joe and um you know he was a yes but Susan was the center of the storm and I'll say something about like we've had our differences I Know the president said their differences but Jeff Flake also is a a\nJeff Flake or is on the other side of a lot of things with Trump but he rose to the occasion and say listen\nI Want to hear more but I'm inclined to believe what I Believe\nI Want to hear from Dr Ford he listened to you also listen to ... and the process her and says in the lake and Susan ... is going to make Kevin a better nominee more legitimate nominee so I Want to thank him too but in the end of the day this is about a person a single person\nWho is sort of the odd person out in politics\nRising to vacation and being that giant and to the extent I did my part thank you I wanted to stand up for a good man 'cause I've known him for Twenty years uh I wanted to let everybody in the country now have despicable and my eyes he was being treated and that they are had\nSenator finest moment and all the way I was on your good good and I don't know yet as we'll have more or ... or if I'm going to you're going to join\nUs on Hannity tonight will for reaction it looks like the boat takes place to move forward five a thank you Senator Lindsey Graham I wouldn't have happened without you in my humble opinion and ah you had I again I think you find this moment ever and uh and you've had other great moments as well uh eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free\nTelephone number but this process this blood Janine\nNeeds to and we'll talk about that and more and the election on the other side [noise]\nOn the Hannity [noise]\nYouth Radio's forty\n[noise]\nAll right folks you and I both know that off year mid term elections are about one thing and that's you showing up now this election is the most important midterm election in our lifetime\nYour tax savings is on the ballot\nThe American economy is on the ballot your jobs are on the ballot and your kid's futures\nAnd their jobs on the ballot or wages for one k.'s all of this is on the ballot and if you're a small business owner well your tax cuts are on the ballot also and here's the biggest political issue on the ballot who's in charge of America's future if you want to preserve the victories in the past two years\nAnd what we went through a lot of that success earlier in the program and a lot of it bears repeating by the way I mean these are ... for a million jobs created since the election more Americans now employed\nThan ever recorded in our history unemployment the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine\nFour hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs those are the jobs Obama set a never coming back by the way things are only going to get better with the explosion in the energy sector\nOnce they can get up and online and Anwar and and continue coal mining the president's saving the coal mining industry in West Virginia singlehandedly and once we continue to extract more natural gas in the world would ever needed in three hundred years\nWe have all of those ... resources fourteen states record low unemployment ... record low unemployment for Hispanic Americans African Americans Asian Americans youth unemployment fifty five year low median household income\nIts highest record ever recorded\nYou know we have the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for Americans without even a high school diploma and veterans' unemployment is now reached its lowest rate in Twenty years\nAnd four million people off of food stamps and I can just keep on going and promises about the types of judges he put on the court and gutting endless bureaucratic regulation that that literally hamstrings all businesses in America\nPromoting buying and hiring America actively promoting and asking\nPeople to come and build their factories and manufacturing centers here in creating the economic conditions\nAnd the regulatory conditions where it's possible I mean that's why all these manufacturing jobs are coming back\nOr reducing illegal immigration courts defeating ISIS you know a course pulling out of that idiotic Iranian deal and little rocket man not firing a missile over Japan every other day\nI'd say that's pretty good but with thirty two days out of the electorate a lot can happen between now and then John McLaughlin as pollster founder of McLaughlin associates shown is with us also a pollster author political analyst for Fox News\nOr thank you both for being with us or we can see I don't know if you want to call the cabin on balance or the\nCabinet awakening there's every single state now Claire McCaskill is down significantly in the latest poll in Missouri\nJoe Donnelly is in trouble and Indiana Heidi Heitkamp is down in eleven in her state of North Dakota or I say that Rick Scott will be the next senator from Florida and then of course Martha ... has been surging lately uh where do you think it stands at this moment John McLaughlin\n... I I think you're seeing a a definitely a cabinet effect but it's really what it is it's three gauge where the Trump voters a short you know you're done and I talked about two years ago how Trump had to bring new voters and to to win the election and we did\nDonald Trump ignited millions of new voters who came out and voted in twenty sixteen that didn't vote and twenty twelve that took a pass on Mitt Romney and\nUp until this time up until the hearing last Thursday or those voters were staying home or a good portion portion and weren't engaged and I think\nThey got to see the the the actual hearing in the news coverage and the character assassination the ruthless politics I think the Democrats could look to Chuck Schumer is a really smart\nStrategic senator and he's the leader and he looked at that map and he said this thirty five seats up twenty six or eight hours entering states that that Donald Trump won\nWhat can I Do to try to take back the majority\nAnd he probably made a calculation if we can embarrass cabin or that the Republicans pulled him it was suppressed the Trump voters so that a good number of those sixty three million would stay home because you only get Ninety million come out in the mid term elections so they they made the hit\nThe Republicans stuck from the president stuck with him and the Democrats were exposed\nThese voters are now outraged that the Democrats would put such a late hit on\nAnd try to smear a good person who would remind them of their father their their their son their their their brother and said this was totally unfounded uncorroborated there's no evidence to it\nAnd they're trying to destroy this man and his family and the Republicans are ... the Republicans and independents who supported Trump or coming back out and you're seeing them in these polls that Missouri poet McCaskill behind was appalled that we did for super back she's down ... points down or you're seeing this I'm seeing this impulse every day it's\nIt's not a big explosion but what it is is\n... ... is coming back in and\nGalileo while ... Trump voters worked on what what\nWas a huge enthusiasm gap just a month ago a lot less than a month ago two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago\nUm has now totally and completely evaporated and conservatives have been awakened and and by the way Doug shown the party that we saw protesting and the party that Russia's to judgment the party that doesn't believe in due process a party that doesn't believe in the presumption of innocence\nOr the need for some corroboration and the party that defended Clinton and defense Keith Ellison a I don't think they're looking too good here to the American people right now and they they're being shown to be the radical party I've been describing for some time\nWas shot I mean I don't quite know how to fly but al ...\nAnd you can say I actually agree with your characterization in their handling of all of this has been pretty stupid and detrimental um to you know any sense that they have have any sense of moderation in this day and age\nWell I don't think they have any sense of moderation but what they do have is that I'm going to lead in the house which I think it can lead to pick up the house and I think\nFrom what I see looking at the Senate races they're all very very close within the margin of her\nAnd I really think to get a definitive answer will have to come back and in a week or ten days after capital is as I think we all expect narrowly confirmed to see whether the effect job than\nYou are talking about Iran is actually going to hold over time I think it really has to play out and I think there's a good chance that the protests you've seen\nFrom the Democrats are from women like him or not we'll continue and will ultimately a benefit particularly in suburban congressional districts less so Senate races the Democrats\nHow's it going to play with the voter in the rest of the country not in New York the the San Francisco and Los Angeles or or Illinois or Chicago how's it going to play with her I think of America I think it's very differently\nI think the the real challenges the one John raises I think it's that's right will this re engage the Trump voter I think as of today probably some evidence that that\nIs going on inside twenty point enthusiasm gap just a ... and sixteen days\n[noise] let's let's let's wait a week Sean and we'll see where\nThey don't think this leaves a bad taste in people's mouths what they did and said this man support\nFor the disgusting and nobody who liked toured experimenting Arlen and things like\nThat do you what they did to this man and how they bludgeoned this man and his family as as vicious as they've been with no due process and for once you know how critical am of Republicans they took it with the seriousness the topic deserved they handled it properly\nThey looked into every crevice in corner and we still have no corroboration now do we believe in the presumption of innocence or not\nYou probably have the Democrats handle this\n... ... ... if if I can voiced support for you perhaps he'll give me a chance to do that I had a I said this is somebody who has my own a judicial legal philosophical differences\nWith a judge Kavanaugh so I Would not be voted for him but I Do think showing that you are correct\nThat the way this process has played out depresses me as an American first and a Democrat second\nUm I think the process is destroying\nA the independence of our judiciary destroying the presumption of innocence and basically what is destroying what makes our country great so we may disagree philosophically but I'd like to think we stand for the same enduring values\nWasn't Lindsey Graham who in many ways showed such a profile in courage in this\nUm and even and I think the deliberate seriousness of Susan Collins\nYou know the Republican Party is made up of a varying factions that I don't see these factions really existing in the Democratic party John I mean you got the extreme left and then you've got the super duper extreme left and\nThere's no room for a scoop Jackson they even through Joe Lieberman of all people out of the party how do you throw a Joe Lieberman out of your party um I mean that's insanity to me\nOh absolutely and and I tell you what\nDoug does makes the point you have over four weeks ago\nAnd that's a lifetime in politics I mean I mean remember twenty sixteen the Democrats put the late hit on Bush or not Bush part of it they did it to push for the drunk driving but they did it with to Donald Trump with a tape that women are people people weren't right through it and realized it was a choice between Hillary Clinton\nAnd Donald Trump and they voted for Donald Trump and and this voters in the heartland right now that are engaged we have to keep them engaged over the next four weeks because when we when again and cabinet gets confirmed they can think oh things are fine now\nOr a for next year so we've got to do is look left that she'll certainly had a fifty five percent unfavorable rating I mean fifty five percent will be a landslide for the Republicans and they could they could hold the house so right now we're headed to gain seats in the Senate\nBut it's too early on the house and and\nPrior to cabinet looked like we're going to lose the house but uh uh with that kind of a negative on policy for her to be the leader to oppose Donald Trump every day for the next two years to his reelection he needs to take her on every day about\nThem wanting to raise taxes on the economy have open borders having having a back to the elites where the swap runs the country again\nSo uh if he does that over the next four weeks the Republicans could hold the house and they'll definitely pick up Senate treats\nAlright thank you both John McLaughlin and dug shown eight
