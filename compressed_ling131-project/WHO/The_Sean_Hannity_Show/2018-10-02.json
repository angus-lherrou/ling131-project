H. O. [noise]\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news traffic and severe weather station news radio ten forty\nInvestigate all three credible allegations of sexual assault\nAgainst judge Brett Kavanaugh and that would be by the way I read the FBI is already looking into allegations number two which was\nThe New Yorker piece this was by Mr Ramirez and remember even the New York times couldn't go with that story they had reported that\nThey interviewed several dozen people in an attempt to corroborate her story they couldn't find one person with first hand knowledge\nAnd then they reported that Mrs Ramirez herself was contacting former your classmates asking if they were called the incident and told them pull some of them that she could not be certain Mr cabin all was the one who exposed himself and that's what they're saying\nAnd remember she admitted she quickly became a ... that she had gaps in her memory foggy slurring of words\nSo that's what the Democrats are citizens are credible allegation well if it was so credible why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when he sat in front of them last week 'cause they ... they all had the opportunity to delve into anything they wanted to delve into and they chose not to\nThat we've got the the third incident which is the ... case where a woman claims that routinely almost on a weekend basis and she had been to China these parties herself personally that\nThere was Brett Kavanaugh one and a bunch of ... kids that were drug ... girls and then lining up in the hall waiting their turn to rape innocent girls\nAnd a a whole series of allegations have looked at as as Byron York said the gold polls\nHave moved very very far away very very quickly and all the people that but not just going to be a week limited scope no big deal just an FBI investigate you want to clear your name right you'd want to clear your name right judge\nIt's not about clearing his name it's about giving them more time so they can come up with more allegations and it doesn't matter at the end of the day Democrats do not even want a vote on judge Kavanaugh\nAnd they want to continue the smears the slander the lies the mismanagement character assassination frankly the political blood joining of judge Kavanaugh and his family now as evidenced by now remember\nDianne Feinstein had this for six long weeks she had this back in July\nThere was a California state or California congressman that had\nIt early July and then they went to Dianne Feinstein Dianne Feinstein on two separate occasions was meeting with judge Kavanaugh and then of course we had the original hearings and not at one point that Dianne Feinstein ever mentioned professor Ford\nBut while she was meeting with him privately she was simultaneously recommending lawyers to professor Ford and one that was the bench really chosen was Deborah cats\nAnd she is a lawyer that represents professor poured but which is fine but she has a history of oh challenging Paula Jones and supporting Al Franken so in other words she's\nRadical left political the attorney is\nAnd so anyway they were emails sent out we just found out late last week of a friend of this attorney for professor for this Deborah cats woman and she was in the hearing she was sitting to the right\nOf professor forward or to the left on your screen if you were watching the hearings\nAnyway it goes on to say that friends emails were sent by a friend of Deborah cats the lawyer representing professor Ford recommended by Dianne Feinstein\nAnd they were soliciting women to accused judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety and this is what they were sending out last week where we just need an FBI Barry expeditious very quick very limited in scope\nThey were they have been and continue to be on a fishing expedition\nNow the emails were obtained by the Washington Free beacon seeking corroboration from classmates of cabin all about your book and trees and gang rape and one email sent\nA late last week delivered to roughly fifty alumni of stone rich school of the Sacred Heart an all girls school near Georgetown Prep\nWith the subject line corroboration needed Deborah cats need to find people who are familiar with what the slang terms were used by ... cabin on his ear book page meant\nAnd the devil's triangle and the F F F F F\nA wording in there if you can speak to any of these are willing to sign an affidavit please contact us that's a fishing expedition and that is ... this is what the Democrats wanted the delay for now if it was truly limited in scope and\nWe know that in the case of professor poured that they were four people she mentioned we're at this party\nSome don't remember ever being even her best friend don't remember ever being at a party where Brett Kavanaugh was at the end of the you know that when the perjury I mean ... under the penalty of a felony here so they all signed these affidavits they're all agreed that the that they didn't have any recollection\nAnd the the most difficult part of it is is professor Ford identified an eye witness to the event that I witnessed his said under penalty of a felony\nThat it never happened\nWhat professor Ford is claiming and this is professor Ford who put\nMark judge in the room at the time of the alleged incident so I'm not sure what the FBI really can do in this case beyond\nSee whether any of these people are going to admit that they committed perjury and gave false statements ... there's nothing else really left for them to do please use your voice you will not get a second chance this letter goes on to say I mean well this point you're you're pretty much just soliciting\nYou know randomly anybody to come forward please please come forward and then the hope is that it'll be delayed again and again and again and you know on top of that than we've got you know what was supposed to be limited in scope what was supposed to be done expeditiously in a week\nNow is turning into because they can't get anything else at least not that we know of yet who knows what Dianne Feinstein knows\nThen the only thing they've got is well didn't commit perjury about the amount of alcohol that he drank you know could did he really black how would anybody know if he blacked out that's the only he would be able to tell you if he blacked out\nNow he admitted to drinking to liking beer liking beer a lot still liking beer drinking too much beer you know being intoxicated he admitted to all of that\nWhen he was in high school and college which not all that uncommon let's be honest about it and so they're trying to say well he didn't he do we know we had to a blackout was an I worked as a bartender for a number of years I Know a lot about alcohol I watched that up close and personal\nYou know everybody's got a number for some people the numbers to and after two they lose for some people I there were people that every single night I work could sit there from six PM till four thirty when I close the doors and other throw him out and they'd be walking straight\nHaving been drinking all night I mean the tolerance level from individual individual is just it's an enormous you know you see some people that go beyond their numbers they become a crust of or flirtation I saw it all I learned a life lesson and it wasn't good\nIf you go beyond what ever your individual number is it's never going to be good for you or or anybody else for that matter\nUm anyway so we got that and so it's not about limited in scope there's a lot of news or no time any uh was I don't know where the clock is I'm Mark Penn and wrote an interesting piece which I I found today\nAnd he said that he's a pollster was the Clintons pollster and he noted today that in the immediate aftermath of last Thursday's testimony by professor Ford and Brett Kavanaugh slim majority of those surveyed sided with her but\nThey found he found is the support for professor Ford collapsed when voters were told that none of the three ... a witness to she cited to corroborate her allegation have any idea\nAs to what she's talking about and that fact was barely mentioned during Thursday's questioning and it was only mentioned if you remember at the end of the questioning or one of the things that were saying that we see a new poll out by Remington research group because the election is thirty six days away\nI Want you to think about thirty six days from now when you turn on your TV on election night and do you want to hear the words Nancy Pelosi has just been elected speaker of the house and Chuck Schumer is the new majority leader\nOf the United States Senate because that's what the Democrats want now if this doesn't\nIf this does not show you this is not of a party that wants to make America better that has a plan to help the working men and women forgotten men and women of America\nAs a matter of fact with every bit of success the president has it it it diminishes any chance they have it getting back their power and after two years of trying to destroy the president\nYou know they want to Christian do their way back into power just forgetting the eight years of Obama which would disastrous\nAnyway so we've got this election you're going to tune in at night\nAnd you're going to flip the channels and you got to be watching the news channels and you're either going to be seeing happy anchors all over the country or you're gonna once again shocked the world and you're going to defy the odds and you're sick of their agenda this blood thinning

you know you're totally screwed\nRight well maybe you shouldn't have been writing in may before you interviewed Clinton and before he interviewed any of the other Seventeen witnesses maybe maybe

months no she didn't do that she waited until we were closed and then she probably leaked it but you know who am I to say go ahead\nPlease Mr President you said that it's correct to say you're limiting the skill of the FBI investigation\nWhat is it has to do is say I don't mind answering the question but you know I'd like to do the ... with the other headline in the cabinet and I know how that talking about trade and then we'll get to that will do that a little bit later think anybody ever had a great deal of hats or Congress there are I think so but you know if it doesn't have lots of other alternatives but I Do think so I think if they're fair\nWhich is a big question but if it's fair on both sides are Republicans love it\nIndustry loves our country loves it if it's fair it will pass I think it'll pass easily\nRight now or to Sean Hannity show as we're back in the swamp were back in D.C a lot of breaking news eight hundred nine four one Sean has a toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program\nWell what we're supposed to be last week a limited in scope and done very quickly is now evolved into Democratic senators oh the FBI must investigate all three credible allegations of sexual assault against judge\nBrett Kavanaugh by the way why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when they had the opportunity last week\nIf they don't want to expand the scope now the interesting thing about this email is well they are now putting out a list of we've got to interview this one and this one and this one and this one and this one including that anonymous person in this anonymous person that they're literally trying to tell the FBI\nHad to do their job and we found out this weekend emails were sent late last week by a friend of the left wing attorney that's representing professor forward that's the one that didn't believe Paula Jones and\nSupported Al Franken anyway but a friend of hers last week a you remembered Dianne Feinstein recommended this attorney cats Deborah cats for professional forward\nAnd of course while she was meeting Dianne Feinstein with Brett Kavanaugh anyway it turns out that they are now soliciting members of the Georgetown Prep community for information and searching for additional women who accused\nSupreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety this is what you would call a witch hunt this is now a we don't have enough so let's see let's let's go out and solicit people\nAnd see if we can find people that are willing to say something horrible about Brett Kavanaugh because maybe that's the way we'll be able to stop the nomination we got delayed like we wanted now we've got to be able to get everything that we want Newt Gingrich has a great question is there even one Democrat decent enough or disgusted enough to end this cabinet travesty\nAnd he joins us now Sarah how are you welcome back to the program\nI'm doing well but I was very struck this morning by Byron ... column in which he points out that the Democrats having decided that sex may not work are now looking at whether or not Kevin all might have been an accurate in describing how much he drank so there are spreading a wider\nAnd frankly in an age when Justice Ginsburg was very political\nAnd some attacks on President Trump Democrats are trotting out judicial temperament of this whole thing is is this character assassination it is I think tremendously bad for the country uh and it is it tells us who they are I mean I think the key to the election this fall\nIs which America do you want to be do you really want to be an America\nWhere somebody could live a decent life for thirty five years have two lovely daughter is a good marriage\nAnd then get smeared on ending Lee was totally uncorroborated assaults as I said really the America we want to become\nYou know the judge was honest as could be said I like beer I drink beer I drink beer then sometimes I drink too much beer\nHe denied ever blacking out I mean the accusation that somebody could observe some well he had the blackout that night um I was a bartender when I was Seventeen and Eighteen years old and I've seen a lot of drunk people in my life\nAnd I couldn't tell you whether or not they remember the incident the next day and it wouldn't be me in the position of saying that\nBut what they're doing is they're moving the bar this is what you're saying the goalposts now are being literally moved every second every hour of every day and now that we have people working on behalf of the Dianne Feinstein\nRecommend the lord lawyer Deborah cats and sending out letters saying ah we we need more people um it sounds like they never want this to end and I don't think there is going to be a Democrat to answer your question that's going to be decent enough or disgusted enough to end it\nWell let me try to be very clear from it because I'm I'm frankly very disappointed in the judiciary Republicans up just denying reality fact is\nThis has nothing to do with traditional government this has nothing to do with the Senate this has nothing to do frankly with judge town this is about a militant left wing group willing to lie assassin H mayor cheat I mean when you when you have\nWhen you have a mob that goes into a restaurant to harass Sen Cruz when you have to women who break into a an elevator to arrest US Senator over and over and over again which you have on the left his willingness to break the rules\nTo get what they want and I think that it's a very serious problem\nYou know it does raise a lot of questions because at this point I don't think we're going to go back to high school years\nYou know when people talk and I've watched a lot of there's this weekend you know two commentators actually saying this is Sean Hannity could have given the speech\nAnd I'm thinking okay um how is one supposed to act when they're falsely accused of literally drug in women and boys lined up halls all over the course of course of many weekends\nAs the boys can then take their chance that gang raping women and being a participant in that I don't know what the significant or normal reaction would be for me if you're innocent it would be righteous anger and indignation that that to me would be the normal human response if you're innocent\nRight well let me let me play historian from it because I spent the weekend thinking about what we're living through when you know Cory Booker says you're complicit with evil if you support Kavanaugh\nDeceiving example you're getting you know when one Blumenthal as the president was pointing out\nThis terrible record of overtly publicly lying about having served in Vietnam when he didn't\nKnow suddenly he's lecturing us on the importance of honesty and integrity [noise]\nAs I thought about it I went back and found the following quote from Abraham Lincoln which he gave at Cooper Union in New York City and Eighteen sixty\nSpeaking about the defenders of slavery who were prepared to destroy the union\nHe says quote your purpose than\nPlainly state it is that you will destroy the government unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the constitution as you please\nOn all points in dispute between you and us you will rule or ruined and all events close quote I Dream of profit option is I really believe that's where we are I think on the left you know people like Maxine Waters who remember if they get a majority she chairs the committee\nShe's not some random back then should not take she's a senior member of the Democratic party leadership and she has publicly saying that people you go out and find members of the Trump Administration you harass them and the stores you harass them at the gas station you harass them at ... at a restaurant what kind of country is that\nWell they're telling everybody to do it now they're out on a fishing expedition in what they promised last week which would be limited in scope and you know ... and an extra day to expedite the timeframe is now you know they're expanding it out even longer and longer longer which means what we both suspected they just\nThey just want to stop this no matter how they end up doing it\nUm right when you are but the point is\nI think you're right but I also think that there's there's got to be a choice\nSo it was made here by the American people because if you can smear and lie and slander and bludgeon a guy like Brett Kavanaugh and go on these fishing expeditions and you're not even hiding what it is\nNobody is ever going to want to serve in any capacity in government ever or not we want\nPeople should remember when you get to the total attorney and history of the left if they can do to count and all they can do it to you that can do it to your daughter they can do to your son\nI mean this is what happened to the Duke lacrosse team total liar total fabrication shouldn't over a year or is a cloud over these young men who had done nothing and so you turn around and the left is is very adept at this they believe in bowling they believe in intimidation\nThey they don't think the truth matters what matters is power\nAnd I think people need to understand\nThis election is a choice about which America we're going to become it's much better choice suggest the president this was literally about are we going to reward people for this destructive and who are willing to cripple their own country in order to get power or are we going to repudiate them\nAnd insist on people frankly are getting us results and if you think of as an option of results versus resistance look at today's news about Canada and Mexico once again the president as a breakthrough once again something is being done\nIt'll be a special night for a great

I I'm sure they were it was easy to find people because they already had been interviewed\nBy the Senate Judiciary committee like the the the goalpost are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to that to believe that any of these people\nUm it it can take themselves seriously they said it's going to be four days a week and now they're going to have an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial\nThere you know she works at that at every Democrat that that now they're going up the Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI they're actually going to be this horrible partisan organization you know it it it it\nIs and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's life long reputation here on the line\nHere that are doing\nTwo weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think ... ever gets back in many many ways\nI mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on there is someone who clerk for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there are certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse is counted the name of discounts them because they disagree with in any way\nOn and he is someone who it does ... incredible amount of respect on the bench\nKavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as the lower court judge the Supreme Court\nSaid it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they walked to fourteen different times they've found now they vindicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think um they are not going to be watching this\nWith the same knee jerk a part in response is I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people are ... but but it\n... the parents who brought her reputation now\nIf you read James Comey's New York times piece that he came out with the ... it to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the FBI's packet in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was running an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um\nBut then he goes on to trash the president at length and then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a ... in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not um once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them that there is what he says refusal to do so\nIs its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever\nTalk to the FBI they less you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI I don't love the upper brass under Khomeini and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is ... ... people I Know the salt of the earth people and I said I've course I'd want to help\nHim he goes no and then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was lying to them\nAnd you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say\nBecause it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that says if you look it hit companies coming ammo right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book but the irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime to lie to the Senate as their ... with their investigators it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending they're ... that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies of\nWhat the FBI guys to say that this is somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list of people the Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to they're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same thing because the FBI ... and ... as well make that can't force them to talk to them especially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they they could be dealing with taking the same\nExact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new to hear that there there's like protection\nAround the IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know that's the one we're even the New York times that said they had attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate a story and then saying that Mrs Ramirez\nContacted former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr Kavanaugh was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here

running for reelection I Can't be who I really am\nI'm well that's a problem what you're basically admitting that you're fraud\nExcept uh now that you're ... you're losing the burden or written yourself but the burden of facing the voters\nWell now you're going to be who you really are that's what it sounds like to me which kind of is it a mission that you've been dishonest the whole time and so I have a suggestion if this is a\nTrial balloon and he's thinking about running for president ... get in the game go run you know there's a way to get Supreme Court nominees through and that is you can become the president then you can pick your own person and you can do what you think is best then you can be\nAs boring as you want to be is president every single day and maybe yeah maybe President Trump has more personality but you notice that style it's always comes down to style\nYou cannot argue with the results is what the media is fixated on this is what never Trump is fixated on there is an anger at the president's iconoclastic you know bombastic at times you know style that's what it's about\nA eight hundred diaper when Sean a toll free telephone numbers we continue from our nation's capital and the Sean Hannity show studios here that we have now considering we're moving in\nLooks like we don't have to get a place down here um I have a lot of meetings this week and a lot going on this week which we're going to bring in the best coverage we can as promised or by the way congratulations to our own Linda and Sarah quarter they have a big premier that they've launched tonight on a a brand new documentary they put together on opioids and\nHow the opioid epidemic and is is literally in large part being fueled by are open borders is\nA lot of these drugs make their way from Mexico straight on up through to the United states small towns big cities you know we have over a hundred plus people dying every day or so you have a big premier congratulations thank\nYou I really appreciate it when do people get to actually see it themselves and I know one premier night it's not available to the public when when is it going to be available to the public\nUm well we're basically we're hanging out a deal right now hopefully we'll get some some TV coverage from some really big shows were still working all of that out ... you know if only we knew someone MTV\nThat right I I I got the message I voted linked almost full on one hour documentary this is a real it's forty four minute now and well for that is a TV our yeah I just wanted to make sure you know it was forty four minutes I work in TV I Know what a TV our is um which is the point but it's sad because we're losing Seventy two thousand people\nLiterally a year because of this opioid epidemic a lot of them are young kids\nI mean these kids you know they get an mom and dad or grandma grandpa was medicine cabinet biking and Percocet oxycontin and they think it's fun and the next thing they know they're addicted and there's no more supplying grannies medicine a cabinet\nThen they're out buying it eighty bucks a pill and\nThen they find themselves really addicted and somebody offers a ten dollar bag or heroin and now they're a heroin addict and there were set up as um rate is like eighty five percent of your addicted to this garbage and they can't get off it and then the next thing you know they're going to buy a bag of heroin that God only knows who's putting it together\nAnd they drop what is the equivalent of three grain of salt that's how tiny we'd be affecting all inside of the heroin and these kids die and these adults or even die\nWell I think I think there's another point to the DEA chief with interview today and he made it very clear that the biggest threat to national security\nAs Amazon does and Amazon's employees generally are more of the high tech friday they have\nSome of the the uh lower skilled cohort though that work in factories and and the district distribution centers but uh they're probably more in the higher wage spectrum then a Walmart is\nAnd so the problem is is the higher minimum wage the centrally pushing Wal Mart to pay their workers the same level as Amazon is not going to pay its workers\nAnd has a higher impact on Walmart than it does on Amazon towards it constitutes weaponize in government policy to benefit one company or the expense of another company so\nOn and so let me try and get my head around this because uh you would think to the ... ... you you particularly a coup them out as a as a competitor that might suffer from this\nAbsolutely and they can cope but there'll be ways that they cope in terms of uh increasing automation which will decrease the available matter of jobs it'll change how jobs are there'll be more jobs going into automation less lower skilled jobs but the bigger problem is simply that uh", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "02"}
