George Rochester and it's not fair what's going on in\nLife when man that's what's going on we're talking about the hot guys\nAct like I'm at today masks on a fan of bright first downs like\nNew Year's eve and they also saw in our sang\nSome derogatory to thank God I have to remind them that they didn't have a big giant championship since Nineteen sixty seven and it's from the Gulf or fan's question then I find it up to the ball\nPark says last night Ken championship Nineteen sixty seven\nSo I wanted to get them in their mouth and France and in contrast how good\nThe fans you really are their their knowledge and um they they don't talk smack and watch the fans we do that what that means said\nNow I saw one on TV that wasn't dress pretty cool though\nSure yes yes there were a few of them there now what ... what else you're going to say I didn't mean to cut you off\nOkay well how she only had about a week\nAnd that game student athletes opportunity to get healthy so I was wondering in a secondary I'm One of the options are usually play\nOr Mary ... than they are they can get in an old you're an attorney and carrying on a first house I was wondering if you have any knowledge about the status of those three cats and a let's just go down to Wilmington and get another on\nThanks recreate call uh okay so we knew that we're going to see some changes that secondary we knew that it was going to be the Riley ma specifically was probably going to get a chance to play a lot at cornerback\nThe tour and young thing you're not the first one where you are the first one to bring that up on the show we have seen a lot of that Rick on Twitter and Facebook people wondering why we haven't seen more of torn young I've got a theory on that but I'm borrowing some of this from Chuck law from last week when we had Chuck on during the week sound off\nAnd on Monday Night when I had him on site ... reaction on my ... a sports station fourteen sixty cakes and on my show\nAnd he he mentioned that the one thing he wanted to see going forward from the hot guys was consistent running attack and that he thought the guy that would be able to do that would be ... Kelley Martin\nThat he thought I read that one of the things the hot guys would maybe have worked on during the week and want to focus on against the Minnesota teen that on paper I think new they would be could handle\nOne of those things is going to be fined a consistent running back in and feed him enough times to to let him show what he's got and I think that's why we didn't see only what five ...\nFive Paris Eighteen yards and um what what for ... twenty carry fifty five yards he lost he ended up with a net forty seven\nHis longest was Fifteen yards but he's still the average into point either the twenty calories does make me think that that was a bit maybe even a number they were shooting for they wanted to see what would happen if they gave him that many carries eighty handle that sort of low and let's\nNot forget that this team especially when it first happened I'm Talking about Minnesota was loaded up front and one thing they were going to do was stop the run\nClearly we're going to make it tougher us run the football really [noise] uh you know ... regrets of getting down there and um you know became particular rent for the football ... not that were against it but to a you know to the point where we made some really good place and [noise] you know there are two critical errors that\nYou're you're you're telling me something I don't know it's OK sorry that I was ... that uh that quote to go a little longer than the ends of the weirdest\nBy more than ... than needed means that I have but I Will only with a hundred and six yards rushing now if you would have told me the other day that I was only gonna get a hundred and six yards rushing I might actually tells you the game was closer and they weren't gonna put forty eight points up\nAnd you're trying to say we're going to do that on what thirty five carries yeah I Would have said the same thing like ... boy that's that's tough sledding first of all the off into blind did not play as well today as I thought they were going to so\nWell I mean they got Denise daily ... family the Iowa divide but one of the best throughout the first four\nFour games I'm not getting Stanley ... number one in the Big

or\nWell listen I I I Love Hawkeye football and I and you know uh I've many times hurt them go up to Minneapolis in a\nTo go for it and they're a dangerous even on a bad year they're dangerous and and ah so am I my thing is ... ... ... that we didn't have the classic defense today and uh we uh got shot herself in front of\nMy my view is as a coach\nUm they had an opportunity to put them away and the first have just put them completely away and they never did hook and so they were so dangerous for the whole game look what happened between Texas and Oklahoma\nOklahoma's the better Texas beat some forty eight forty five ... it's like well how could this happen well they left the door open in Texas just walk through and\nSo my in basketball or football if you've got an opportunity to to uh uh you know just just shut the door in first for third quarter or whatever but this case the first half\nA that is what do you you know it's like what in the water for sharks you know the bullets in the water what do you can swim way finish the game and the first\nHalf as I get what you're saying Frank ... but let's go to the first half\nThat was it a defensive problem that was an H daily problem throwing a pick a input Minnesota right in the ... in their own red zone so that was it a defense leaving the door open that was in Iowa ... screwing up and making a really bad play and Kirk variants I think even said you take fourteen points away from this team\nFrom Minnesota which he believes those to turn over the dog's head gave them fourteen point we're looking at this completely differently and I and I and I completely agree with and that's not that's why we're not hitting the Pentagon ... your\nBrother's freaking out I Would put a forty eight points tonight yes they gave up thirty one but you you you do have to take into account the turnover turnovers will kill you two\nWeeks ago in Wisconsin you weren't here you're up there I ... I but I watched it in ... yeah I mean and those were dumped turnovers you do have to stop those mental mistakes\nBut I think when we look offensively that Iowa can win without having to run the ball for two hundred yards you go from one oh six but yet they Stanley goes twenty three of thirty nine you'd still like a couple of more completion in that thirty nine you throw one pick which was a horrible pick when he goes for three\nFourteen I'll take that if you can put forty eight points up score off turnovers I'm okay with it I don't\n... yeah it's I think that this does aims adore\nShowed you light it was an old\nYou'll look at this at the end of the year you'll remember the forty eight thirty one this was not a Seventeen point game that is what coach variants I think is in a diplomatic trying to say yeah we beat this team and a couple of stupid mistakes and by the way the five penalties\nAlmost all of them you can remember like there are there horribly time penalties and that's been a recurring theme\nI'm going to cost me Ross and it's not how good of a senior next you know she ... she was she was good\nI Want to ask you this at any point did you think I was going to be challenged into football game no no and that's that's what you have to do to your gut right when we watch the Oklahoma Texas game you always knew Oklahoma had to come back and it did even though it lost\nIt was down to touchdowns in the fourth you like yeah I I'm not buying this yet not once during today's game that I go oh this is they're going to come back\nI can tell you I've got it written down the only time my confidence even waned a little Travis was when you're up fourteen nothing in Minnesota puts together that long to make fourteen seven there was that moment of\nMaybe they've figured something out here in this there's something different happening with this office that we weren't expecting but that was it that they came right back hawks but another touchdown up a that was on me I'm a fake fake field goal\nYeah which was which was a brilliant call we'll we'll get to that a little bit later on but let's go to the phones to wait for ten forty we're going to Wisconsin It's we're Ernie is Ernie welcome to the jets rose barbecue sound up a news radio ten forty W H you\nGot to get evening hey I just want I I've watched Nate from his home town and he aired it out in high school I just wish we could air it out a little bit more\nWell I don't think that's going to fall into what Kirk variants wants to do I mean you're looking at what a sixty forty run past split Ross yeah\nOr any of this is something we've talked about a lot over the last couple of weeks with this and it may be that's probably been the one recurring criticism from week one has been the the lack of those deep balls and we've talked to a lot of different people about it I were lucky enough on Monday nights I mentioned that we talked to Chuck Long said Rosenfeld is also on with us\nI mean between those two guys they've been a part of something like a million football games and they both said the same thing that almost every team they've been a part of\nThe Austen's would have a conversation about the fact that you've got to take a couple of long shots down the field in the first half you want to take two or three just to remind the defense that that something you're willing to do and I think private you hit on the head it's just not something that coach parents these valley ...\nAnd early stay right there I'm going to play this when I played at last hour but I think it's worthwhile you again on Minnesota stopping the run listening the way he talks about the past\nClearly we're going to make it tougher us run the football really a crowd in the box or their their ah saved his especially we're aggressive getting down there and um you know became particular rents a throw the football not not that were against it but to a you know to the point where we made some really good place and [noise] you know there are two critical errors that\nWe had to throw the football not that were against that to me I interpret that as like well we're not against it but we sure as hell don't want to boil it definitely should yeah right right right yeah so I think certainly appreciate a\nGood call to enter Ernie thanks for listening up in Wisconsin yeah we ... them stay on his hometown appreciate that to eight or ten ... just in an urban Dale Jaycee to Newton Steve in St\nPaul stay on hold we're going to get your phone calls this is the jet throws barbecue sound off a news radio ten forty W H A [noise]\n\nIs it going you know the W.

a bunch of you're right about\nThat so give up one sack got five and\nWe can have a conversation about this defense and not mentioned the guy that still the most electric player on this team and that's a ... in the defense is solid when he's not on the field when he's on the field it is a\nGame changer absolutely right yeah your eyes are drawn to Martha yeah you see him on the ... he looks like an NFL did it it's one of those it's one of those words\nIt's so cliche but when it comes to a guy the field ... he's a specimen right he's especially when you're like oh my God he's a special\nYou know what I thought you were going to say it's another cliche and it's that thing that nobody can define he's got it yeah you know he's got that yet factor and it is it your your eyes are drawn to him you know it's going to make a ...\nAnd if he and if he doesn't make it on one down you know in the\nCourse of a series he's going to disrupt one or two people as you can't do anything

definitely a hundred percent\nThat are ... and it's one thing to say it right I mean we all screw names that we all owe it but but if you typed it out Niles Cannick\nThat me or their game that means or their notes and everything yeah and they\nThey the crew went into this with Niles yeah wow wow I\nI was dumbfounded we have like one day I wanted to know like I saw some tweets this earlier before you show got on an about like how every time a reef\nAnd at the up and that's a came out of the game\nOr don't ask me I think of an ... on that side of that I\nI Know that kind of I kind of combat and but uh [laughter] uh basically\nEvery time they did that they brought up and then it was when a Minnesota would go into that wild cat formation they tried to get rid of all that pass\nRussia was like a kind of looking back it's kind of seems like that's true I didn't know if guys noticed that at all or anything like that and pick up on that then yeah and that is yeah I mean I Know there was getting in there like crazy but yeah I mean I kind of interesting little\nTake especially with that a tight and they used to be a quarterback where it's like that for\nA Minnesota so yeah that was pretty much it just one of the cars or anything like that and also to from the miles yes go there are some crazy\nBut I haven't really had to call man so but this is what happens now I'm ... it

[laughter] listen to these podcast 'cause you won't believe anything ever happened in your life ever again it's called ... vision is his yeah season too is all about memory but but this is this is from six hours ago yeah\nJazz is I don't think they actually said dials they had it that way and the graphic and announcers verbally corrected it later on so you read it [laughter] right oh my God they said dials but you see it and it said Niles and you think they said ...\nVery much not only possible probable Travis\nBut see an everybody right now is doing the same thing was that difference like ... well yeah my everybody else's memory might be crap but mine's amazing and I know I heard him\nSay not yeah well what are you going to destroy goes yup he said it and the graphic was there too

can write checks two hundred and fifty dollars or more you could even pay bills two hundred fifty dollars or more but more importantly you have a check writing ability\nA two hundred fifty dollars or more in all cases you a check writing ability and that's a great way to have a money market account with liquidity which check writing so that's my favorite way to invest short term money and if you're making less than that right now wherever you're keeping the money I certainly would give that some consideration for a great\nChance tell you one other thing I forgot to mention really important sure and another one of your favorite topics I Do happen to be a product of a Illinois kicker cracking mentioned that is now\nWhat kind of pension is that what kind of a pension does that produce\nThat produces Seventy thousand a year\nOkay so that's certainly\nBy the time it gets me is like forty thousand a month right now\nYeah so you put a lot of years in for that I'm sure\nI did\nOkay so I'm All right so we have that and that's very important and what that might do it that provides you more income than you need a that might mean that\nYou don't have to do a full four percent withdrawal you might do a lesser amount in withdrawal which helps the overall integrity and longevity of your portfolio I for example even or even reducing the amount from four percent to three percent\nAs a cause of the ... has a very positive long term effect in terms of sustainability and and longevity and the integrity of the of the whole program just reducing it from four percent the three percent the only reason I mentioned that is\nA if you take three percent of tour of a while actually above half a billion now with this new money\nOr you know that starts to add up into real money\nSo uh you take three percent of that on top of the Seventy one thousand it may be all you need and you you know maybe not ... percent\nSo I have a need the three well in that case it in that\nCase you might want to take two I I wouldn't take zero but you might want to take to that in that case but I find that takes up there [noise] um [noise] I Would not take zero because well let me put it this way let me rephrase that I wouldn't take zero forever\nOkay that's that's what I mean does it matter ... matter if you take a zero for a few years so right because you have this other income I I Would not have a mindset where I'm never going to take any money out of my\nInvestment portfolio because I I don't think that there's any reason to because I mean I what I don't want you to do is wind up being the richest person in the cemetery\n\nAnd run that risk if you take zero forever then you do run that risk and there were people with that\nWith that the classification there there are people there right now with that classification and so I don't want you to do that so uh yeah I Would think of course right now here in you have this income you're fine but longer term you might think about gradually uh doing some withdraw\nI think in a fixed income portion of the portfolio\nThat fifty percent into percentage column that send a fixed income portion I don't have any problem with investing that because we have a we have largely inoculated that portfolio against interest rate risk\nBy reducing the duration do ah ah basically less than one year and when you have a duration that's that short you've done all some ...\nOn a lot of an occupation on interest rates risk\nSo in the event interest rates do go haywire\nUm than you would have a kid you'd have a situation there where you wouldn't get destroyed by rising interest rates so I think the on the interest rate on a fixed income side portion I'm fine putting it in on the equity portion I Would take a dollar cost averaging approach a and a lot there have been multiple bouts of weakness this year\nOr you can always just take a dollar cost averaging approach you and whether you use periods of weakness or not\nUh you're putting in small amounts of money over a longer period of time\nBut I Would not be inclined or were twenty eight fifty ... five hundred were within one percent of the record high I Would not be inclined at this time to be some kind of a lump sum throw it all in investor that's not my inclination to this time I Would prefer a dollar caused average approach\nTo win thank you for the call it's

September federal open market committee meeting\nSo that's kind of baked into cake if the economy continues to grow we consider that baked indicate that rich continue to rise in the short term but what about longer term rich\nWhat about the ten year rate I mentioned the ten year rate has more than doubled in the last two years from one in three days to two and seven eighths\nWhat happens to longer rates like ten year writes going forward well\n\nIf longer rates rise that certainly would make sense given the fact that if you combine real GDP Growth with inflation right now you could justify a four point eight percent ten year there's certainly a four percent plus ten year at least\nBut what does your current tax ... record the benefits you when you put into pre tax contributions what is your current and you have to include Delaware in there what's your current marginal rate\nYou know I I don't know I Would think the at the lower maybe Fifteen thousand because by the time we\nPut away what we do and it's one bringing our income down probably around the house and then by the time you take out the children adoption any standard adoption and they think I think it's around ...

Fifteen thousand last week it was senator twelve thousand the four week moving average\nWhich smooths out the weekly volatility right now stands at two hundred and Fifteen thousand five hundred these are very low levels\nWe're talking about levels here that compare to levels as far back as\nAlmost fifty years ago that's how they are now they've been low for several years the last three years have been incredibly low but they've stayed low uh one of the things going on out there is we have a tight labor market right now we've seen the increase in people leaving their jobs\nTo find another job and that's because people feel confident that they can get a better job\nAnd all of that is happening as a result of a very strong labor market out there very strong so strong that we now have more job openings than qualified applicants we have plenty of job openings we don't have the qualified applicants to fill them\nSo that's going on out there as well\nAlso on Thursday we'll get the federal housing Finance Agency the S H if a house price index and that will update for us the year over year rate of change\nIn housing prices and I'm right now it stands at six point for\nHouse prices right

year\nBasis as a result of this a report\nAlso on Thursday we will get the new home sales figure new home sales for the month of July and these are measured by counting the number of newly constructed homes with a committed sailed during the month of July\nSo uh this is a very important number because new homes contribute a lot to the economy new home sales\nContribute a lot to the economy\nSo this is a big deal comes out Thursday a system aged it's six hundred and forty eight thousand prior month with six hundred thirty one thousand\nAnd um I think the market would like to see a better number on a new home sales because recently it's been ... sluggish and if some sluggish mission these figures\nSo that number will come out on Thursday and also what's going on of course is\nThe annual Jackson Hole\nEconomic symposium dishes in Jackson Hole Wyoming one of the most beautiful places on earth I Hope you've been there I've been there a number of times that amazing place the ...\nThe
