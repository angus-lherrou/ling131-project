course of the next four weeks\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation or ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is redundant\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about furnace today just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd so you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLooked the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country\nOr they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want war Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republican celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal so all of this isn't the jeopardy damned bonds you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have\nThey went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed split the and you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempted sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American have a better life\nRight and showing the media and Greg just nailed it by the way [laughter] you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic guy I mean it it's a host and a parasite at this point they're\nThe same thing they have ginned up this rage ... not all of them but many of 'em against Donald Trump to such an intense for me to think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapists Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe'd been he's been called trees is they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves in the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose that train rapist or whatever sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this this American patriot and cabinet or you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their base\nFollow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and teach Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could have certainly explain how on a legal basis impeachment is\nNot possible uh for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned especially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls\nTo make sure that these people are are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to a ruined the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than Brock Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not\nJust made up I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to maintain that prosperity\n'em and add money to their wallets into private ah from governor ... love to squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWell I didn't like what Kevin McCarthy introduced which has a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nOr the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars you needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nIn legal jeopardy too what Rosenstein really want to say oh you know Mr good lab which is you know I sit down and have a cup of coffee and we'll chat a little bit so if Rosenstein words ally as as I suspect he might\nUm he doesn't he's not looking at a fashion misleading statement to Congress he's not looking at perjury because he can always deny the conversation ... ... remembers the which which is why this is so critically important\nWell they've got to do they shot a subpoena him and they've got a demand to show up and they've got to put them under oath and these answers have to be given but\nUh I got to let you both go do it right great job Greg jar congrats on the successor the Russia hoax ... new book is out right now it Spygate the attempt to sabotage the Donald J Trump that soon to be a best seller thank you Dan bungee appreciate you both being with us when we come back whether bell dot coms job is already well update us next [noise]\n\n\nThis election this fall who's about to America's Gingrich is one of our great conservative Muslim ... proud of welcoming to Des Moines on October ... an evening with new is a celebration of American patriotism and values and you'll get asked question presented by brown ALS serious about firearms since Nineteen\nThirty nine it's about an American things only you in a restaurant\nDestroying you is fine\nGet your ticket now go to an evening with due to the dot com that's an evening with new don't go\nThere to greet flying around going to cost a lot of damage it is so low it out there\nHurricane Michael hit Florida like a freight train hurling in with one hundred and fifty mile an hour winds the strongest ever to hit the panhandle flattening trees ... and flooding street surprisingly only one death reported it's tearing through Georgia now near Albany\nWe obviously are concerned it is on Nike any stormed we've\nHad governor Nathan Deal telling residents to watch out for each other Michael is weakening rapidly but still a hurricane with when does eighty five miles an hour ...

[noise]\n\n\nOrange\nFake news gives utilize Hannity's applies the crew [noise] Sean Hannity is on and on right now\nUnfortunately this is a gold because hurricane of the worst guys because all of them and so I said with hurricane come into play so the star search a semester anywhere between nine and fourteen the\nStorm surge is going to be the worse the slant on just to the east or south of where the landfall somewhere right now to project between Panama City ... are going to push forward so not only is he going to bring forty feet of ocean water but in addition there'll be wave action on top of that primary\nDriver why we evacuated service\nAnd then a couple of that you got over a hundred and forty five miles per hour winds [noise] um [noise] you know a structure still for two thousand and one or not is on to to handle that I went\nAnd uh it's going to unfortunately push through the state so we're asking us citizens in southwest Georgia suffered ordinance to ah be vigilant and make sure that they understand\nWhat's come to this area is going to see a cat one\nStorm as it moves inland than what the vegetation there while we're anticipating is a lot of down trees are impacting the power in and uh you know here again we're going to see a lot of damage devastation along the coast structurally [laughter] and then as it moves and you're going to see power outages throughout the state\nThat was brought along FEMA administrator I was saying that hurricane Michael is a Gulf Coast hurricane of the worst kind Michael striking the Florida Panhandle uh ... dad the hit\nAnd wins now gusting up to a hundred and Seventy five miles per hour uh the damages severe it is hitting a maximum of ... now as we speak\nOr we welcome back to the program a good friend Joe ... he's the official meteorologist at the Sean Hannity show with weather bell dot com well everything predicted as we talked earlier in the program today has come true this is a bad bad storm it they are now in the middle of it\nAnd uh it's more devastating that we even thought it could be\nWell we had it going to as a category for my company from Sunday and as a matter of fact I I Know my dad used to always say I mean the if you have to tell somebody said something you must not set it loud enough but not everybody hears things a few days away so it was actually is that we put it out publicly with a patriot post\nWhich is a conservative blog I Do a Monday morning telling people that it's going to be but look here's the thing with this storm folks the first thing is this is not climate change or any evidence of it okay\nSo you could see this coming you could see the whole pattern come in fact I talked to Shaun ... on the sixteenth of September I said I'll I'll be seen you get an October probably because of the Gulf\nRight now you said it right on the show I Know\nYeah right right on the show and you could see the pattern setting up\nEverything got together and that's why you and you see that every once in a while but let me put it in perspective this is the worst storm ever hit between mobile camp I that I can find on records\nOkay now you know when the ten thousand years ago something hit worse so we're not sugarcoat that but on the other hand it's not because of your SUV\nAll right this is what nature is capable of doing and you could see this pattern setting up\nPretty far in advance it's also one of only a handful of storms the last twenty five years including Harvey by the way that hit at its peak Andrew did that ... that I was in at its peak when it came into Florida was weakening off its peak\nMost of these hurricanes and we've been blessed and not like the thirties forties and fifties that hit on their peak now as far as the storm it's as if it made landfall\nAs a borderline category five I'm ... and when it's all done they may call it a category five I'm not sure they're going to go in and look at the damage but there's a lot more left with this storm folks\nBecause even though it's weakening hurricane force winds are going to go all the way in the central Georgia I've got to be ... to one Seventy five but they're gonna be ... to eighty Ninety a hundred miles an hour\nAtlanta you will escaped the worst of this but I guess it's probably going to come right over Augusta very close to Columbia South Carolina just north of Fayetteville by this time tomorrow when we're talking and then we'll move off the mid Atlantic Coast between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk, Virginia very late Thursday night\nOn out to sea to the south of New England just be a glancing blowing the I Ninety five quarter in the meantime for you folks in the Carolinas All right you you're not going to have the kind of a kind of\nCold long siege bought in as six to twelve hour period\nFor much of the interior Caroline is they're going to be wind gust into forty fifty sixty miles an hour that's going to cost power outages three to six locally twelve inches of rain will aggravate flooding situations in areas that were devastated by Florence I'm I'm Sorry to say that we've got a call it like it is\nAnd she was very very pleased but so we are number six in the list of states with the lowest uninsured\nWrites row joining us to talk about that from a wallet hobbies are good friend Joe Gonzalez how long a Jill I'm great to have any lack a ... so are you a completed the race for five hundred\nAnd forty seven US cities and\nThe old fifty states in addition to breaking down agent race and ethnicity I Wish you guys wouldn't do that on income level um and the following on some of the highlights a which includes oil coming in\nAt number six with the uh in terms of the list of the lowest number of uninsured were beaten by Massachusetts Hawaii Minnesota Vermont and rode on\nThat's right so when we're just looking at the base uninsured rate here it's about\nFive percent for adults which is very low for like three percent for children so good numbers and that translates the cities within Iowa as well\nYeah it really does is comparable\nTo literally so we had that we went over and over five hundred and fifty cities and none of the major Iowa city's weren't even in the bottom half\nA and we're looking at all kinds here small medium large Cedar Rapids did the best at sixty ninth Iowa City than any sport one that rang the lowest but you're still great numbers as city\n... um uh but still a great numbers that we don't want to pick on Sioux City\nNo two hundred and six out of the last five hundred fifty city so well above average and it actually when we're just looking at decreases and its uninsured rate between twenty ten and last year it\nDecrease the uninsured rate by eight percent which is a great number\nOut is a really great number of so ah so are well less than five percent are uninsured less than five percent of the population one drives that kind of thing\nWell a couple of different things and when we're just looking at what states have done that are getting a little bit better than others\nI think obviously Medicaid expansion is one of them I like is one of the state that has expanded Medicaid and effectively lowered its uninsured rate further because of that\nIf you're looking at the states that have not so places like Wisconsin and very brash go South Dakota a lot of islands neighbors you see that their uninsured rates are pretty much double\nDouble what we have\nExactly that will lead Iowa and just the average overall a state that had expanded have an uninsured rate of around seven percent if not more like eleven percent so Iowa I already got their\nNormal better better than the average voters have expanded it's very interesting isn't it [noise] um okay so uh uh one is uh what is this doing to the house because a previous governor ... ... ... ... ... and I'm a\nCurrent governor Kim Reynolds or they or are they they've been fighting this fight to my guy with the healthiest they the union I'm so these are the southern shores", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "11"}
