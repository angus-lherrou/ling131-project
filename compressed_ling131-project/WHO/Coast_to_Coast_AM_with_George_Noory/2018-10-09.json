next ours we talk about the high technology artificial intelligence Byron Reese with us his book the fourth age if I were in the long mosques delete Stephen Hawking they were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about was what we mentioned earlier which is kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on his simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines\nIf if you are a machine and your brain as a machine in your mind as a machine\nAnd it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an IQ of a hundred and two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley um my probably cost about it I I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nOn my website asking essentially the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country doesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe you're a machine because eventually we'll probably build a mechanical ... if you don't think human beings are\nKnow these technologies can do an enormous amount of good they can they can feed the hungry and diagnose illness and do all of these things and I'm not sure that introducing an element of like it may turn on his ah\nThat that may be more that that may do a lot more harm than than than good it it it's very little suggest the machine would do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a you had a rocket blow up because the single one was uh\nAnd it's supposed with a ... opens transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um you could out an airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane full of people\nThink you've got the co pilot right\nThere you go but if you have a um if you have a computer fly a network computer fly all the airplanes in it quote has a heart attack\nLike that\nYeah that may that may propagate through a systems maybe much ... much more brittle much one better they made breaking big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and and we come you know we're better now I think\nAt writing good software that we were\nA few years back [noise] what is fueling the growth in the ... and just really the incredible gross of this kind of technology\n... ... is it the human being\nThe main thing that fuel for technology is it's actually finally working\nA hey I even the term was calling to Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist to make sure you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that very interesting reason which was\nNewt and you know three laws of planetary motion laws magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find out what the intelligence we did that being said people get excited about a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took him out for ten years\nThen there was a breakthrough more funding everybody\nGot her a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up space up his face up to space up to space it's delivering the good it it can it if you out of business it can make public any department in your business to ... to ... percent better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things you couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now have the technology that we know how to do some cool things if there were no more advances and they are\nAh we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today\nTo the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense is a ... they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now will we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nThat's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that response to its environment so land mine is the kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary uh yeah if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said um there's a camera and it can make sure that somebody wearing a petite ... or\nCarrying a gun mhm\nAnd then it blows up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also sniff for gun powder and\nYou know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess that's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence\nThat fights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're going to make a promise killing systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budgets that are spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I'll let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter it that\nCould could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot\n'em and it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally didn't uh they only put that in because people requested it and so uh it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions require people to make decisions\nYou can always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think there were going to build a a weapon systems\nIt's going to have it\nWell for for three very easy reasons you can argue that ah\nThey're they're better they're more effective it their mission and there'll be less collateral damage and wherever they are you going to argue that you will be saving lives of soldiers ... or ... whatever country you are and and\nAnd third you know they won't they won't work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately lower the political cost going to war which uh is is not not necessarily a good thing\nWell it may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nOh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapon systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know if if one has no cost a then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean I Do you see the day though by run

we don't have robots that can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone and an adult yeah\nSo ...\nCorrect correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long so right now hands down and and I think for for decades to come\nUm people aren't going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of movements you're not going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your wall out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I'm happy when it gets started right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kind of wherever that I'm\nNot like you said that you know yet um\nAnd that's it and that's a big yeah because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer can\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines and which is kind of all the things the brain does that\nWe can't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does and then we have consciousness and people think\nWe don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people have spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project to try to take this little worm you've got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to modeled out of the computer\nJust pick a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible\nSo there are so many we're we're so spectacularly\nAmazing uh beings that that\nTo duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\n[noise] so you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages meat already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do\nAnd and we've used it\nTo overcome scarcity because for law of human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never enough food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed the productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action\nAbout what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore 'cause 'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't\nUm then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and not actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us the division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize in we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity and then the third time things changed I think was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened or you invented a nation state and that's why five thousand years ago you can kind of set your clock by it all over the world\nA giant civilizations emerge ... America and just go all over the world and so I Do think\nThat um that\nIntelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude if you if you actually can take human\nAnd put it in a machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we are the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter huh I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called them robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster\nThan humans can I'm coming from St Louis I've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast uh\nYou're you're right that is already officially intelligent you it is to be\nFrightening if if you saw if you were a skilled across person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and said that was a bad thing do we\nKnow not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers are filling up bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and ah you know we never had unemployment long time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it\nStory they have encouraged to\nKeep informed we have to have open lives Keith engaged and gave him mouth\nTo make your ...\nBecause what happens next this is just the beginning happen here and we all have to wake up on news radio ten forty doubled you wait Joe\n[noise]\nFox News I'm Carmen Roberts the Supreme Court newest associate justice promise has to be a non partisan player on a team of nine\nI was not appointed to serve one party or one interest but to serve one nation America's constitution and laws protect every person of every belief in every background\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh speaking at a swearing in ceremony Monday Night in the White House President Trump apologizing to Kevin on his family during the ceremony for the heated confirmation process\nHurricane Michael's getting closer to Florida now about four hundred and fifty five miles south of Panama said he expected to make landfall Wednesday with torrential rains and the deadly storm surge\nThat storm surge could be a foot high end even be felt in Tampa Bay state of emergency are in effect for twenty six Florida county stocks\nAs Evan brown this is\nFox News [noise] Suzie\nOctober night what's new today on the free I her radio a radio\nIs perfect for decorating the house or just setting the Gehry move our ... has ... with labor inspired when no after day\nIn swing mixture you break out all our great deal gay party playlists whether you're at home or the stadium the new I our radio ... collections that come out and\nAt this point I kind of when it's match the TV and then\nI went to I play dot com and downloaded began and play newly lack of games on my computer for free new sign up and no credit card require nothing like a good mystery to take me away but I don't\nHave time for a movie or a novel so instead I mean to the latest I played game in the mystery tape piles adventure theory and when I Need a classic Agatha Christie murder mystery game had just fine I get my mystery bags and come away thinking more clearly now why find no problem with the ...

GDP did kill off a poll just like he thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nNo air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education do they can grow your own food make your own clothes you can work Fifteen hours a week and live\nLike you did in Nineteen thirty or ... people decided they wanted more and so there's no limit to human once it turns out so even in the future of people are going to say I'm going to stay late\nAt the fusion reactor 'cause I

time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now Byron this technology\nUm I I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you can imagine a machine doing a job I think we all have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who the machine a\nFix my road probably go to machine teach kindergarten probably not a ... or what we wanted to and so I think machines will be doing almost anything that you could imagine a machine doing that doesn't require unique human

landmines we drop drop dumb bombs uh I mean the nature of warfare is rebuilding machines that they kill a so I didn't mean to say\nThat uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we built machines that that we push a button and we don't know who's going to die\nOr the debate that is allegedly going on is whether are we going to\nYou know make more advanced systems that operate completely economists say that you can just release in an area and it will go and decide that's a non combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth a it's a subtle distinctions but bart agree

you're the you're the nerd we wouldn't be stuff and you know and I would\nSay Ninety nine point nine percent of the people um have kind of gone with me on the journey um I I think that's a very small you know point zero one percent um you know they they just they can't make their way over\nRight to our nine that's right um\nBut I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories\nThey could interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise] and I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about\nYou know put it writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet they're afraid to tell these stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy\nWhich is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book was so you know people could feel liberated to just to tell their they'll talk about their experiences 'cause there's so many people have had him and I also wanted them\nTo you know I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happened and not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that the people are all into this and like you said not a lot of um admit it but once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is going through the same thing they open up\nOh my gosh they talk your ear off and you know just just for your listeners then because I Am a nerd divine if I roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah go ahead\nBecause I you know when this started happening to me um I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand\nUm a lot about what really anything about goes photography a little bit of that medium ship just you know some of the thing that little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans believe and go sit we're almost the majority\nWere barely a minority and that's grown I bet and\nAnd you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent\nI I Would think so and the second is that um I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this and\nEvery two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds someone in North America is Googling the word ghost that are saying\nYes every two seconds so none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you whose is listening um but they can also now use them statistics to tell their friends hey\nEither way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nYou have nothing to hide and you have

painful disease for everyone um and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing ghost and photograph\nAnd at first it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I'd opened a like a ghost portal because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about tends to get exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh it goes were older guys what am I done\n'em and and then I started the aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand photographs have\nYou been doing this show me things what kind of cameras [laughter]\nAnd I found\nI use and what a great ad by the way right shouldn't apple say have an ad that says shot on an iPhone and have scroll through a bunch of pictures of ghost [noise]\nUm it was an iPhone I ... at one point and and the journey I bought a real cameras like Samsung camera on the

else it's interesting\nYou know when this was going on for the entire journey looks looks good into your mother's situation and the old timers but how did that really gets you going\n[noise] how did you I'm Sorry say even get me going through this year I mean how did I start to heal from that you\nStarted to these strange things\nYeah I um you know I I was I'm very lucky I um have found some phenomenal\nAh women actually in this world that are incredible psychics and they were like my psychic sherpas through this and you know how how make me understand that I was an absolutely crazy and then I wasn't running up and down the streets the Sherman Oaks screaming you know hide your kids had your wife we got ghost in the neighborhood\nAnd um so ... so I had some guides\n... you know that that were held\nAnd we understand it and an album investigated and um I I started you know and then after I saw the first coast in a photograph I um\nYou know I kind of panic was intrigued because I I

Adam and Eve away from God to really\nGet scratched out of the book of life\nAnd so clearly he's not a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory that's all this is the theory is that you know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience\nThat when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit spirit goes off and parties in the actual space I'm sure many people have talked about the actual planes\nAnd you know when our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this little space\nI think that that's a little space before it lands properly and you are a line on is when this can happen\nAgain is just a theory it's a pretty good it's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition than I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have at our bad\nBecause you know what the light doesn't need more light or the dark does it need more dark dark needs a lot you know the the the darkness one flight\nSo I think it's you know people are are these bright lights that I think that this entity kind of makes its way and and I don't really want to spoil for folks 'cause I I I Hope people will read the book I'm\nA of what happened that last time that alec saw the ... man because\nOf that is probably the most profound event that has happened in my entire life\nWould you want to do to duplicate that experience yeah I could handle it now\nYou would really yeah I could which you couldn't\n[noise] um it was um oh let me just tell

Sorry\n[noise] when you say you're going to tell us\nYes so I yeah so I I so how how about you just tell everybody instead of just the thing about them having to read the book to find out because what happened was that\nAlex called me one night and said I saw that man again\nAnd and he spoke to me\nAnd what he said to me was how her my name is Ron\nAnd I went he he said what\nHe said how hurt my name is wrong because I noticed that the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of I accept that it was not\nVery nice jeeze and I said I'm he's trying to scare me away from you\nYou think that was him\nI don't think it was like that that but I think it was that man who knows\nI say a lot about a lot of people fair to say um but I think that you know\nIf anybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare either going to find that thing that triggers you right there I find that deep dark thing they're going to find it was the antagonism this person's life and mine is my accept that\nAnd and he brought that up and Alex didn't didn't even know about my accept it didn't even know his name\nWhen all this was happening to you [laughter] we went weird yeah I mean\nAre you under control which is now I mean do you feel as if you're in control of what's happening\nI I Am I Am I Am I Am now because I now understand that I Am in charge\nI completely understand

fish died down and\nDo you know who the subject matter is or ... or these random ghost [noise]\nUm [noise] I Do have a picture of my mother has a [noise] um I didn't include it in the book because it

more at work you know there's a lot more work like this story you know from the four oh five but I think is so I'm profound about that is\nAll the coordination collaboration that had to happen on the other side in order for me to still be alive\nYou know my spirit guide you know talking to me and and I had to listen and believe\nToo not just Pam my friend who I who I Believe it was actually her sister who was holding her down where she could not answer the phone or the other four people I called that you know their guys or their spirits are there fast somebody was distracting them not to pick up the phone\nAll with the you know chance that I Would hear an lesson that's pretty incredible when you think about it from the flip side\nDramatic yeah it is and as I I Believe that's happening every day all day all the time to millions and millions of people\nDoing that used to listen don't you think it's pretty stark if you did not believe in the other side that that's all there is\nYeah I
