{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WHO", "content": "You're right I mean at least there are such such powers that feel threatened like the reality because it sometimes\nEasier to uh you you know especially when when ... for for oppressive regimes you know it's easier to control people when they don't don't know things rather than you know going the other way and for the regime to become more enlightened\nIndeed and I think the second you start to ask even why of government and that becomes a dangerous question even that kind of curiosity or wants to be suppressed by certain types of dictatorships and we've learned this throughout history what happens when you when you deny people their curiosity in the end the regime suffer\nIt's not even in their interest is to suppress the curiosity of your own people\nIn the long term of course it isn't I mean because those those kind of societies they at the end you know the liquor behind in terms of for development in terms of uh you know science in terms of developing good humanity is the art and all that\nImage is remarkable what's happened because of curiosity let's talk about some of the technology today do you think in the end that the Facebook the Google's artificial intelligence or going to benefit curiosity hinder or is it a mixed bag\n[noise] when I think it'd be somewhat them mixed bag but they think that overall it's a good thing and I'll tell you why one type of curiosity which is ... specific curiosity which is you know when you need to know a very particular thing like ... what was the name of the actor in that movie or something like that\nThat actually you know I'm the availability of information to our fingertips literally you know can satisfy that very quickly I mean you know once you may be too struggled for hours to try to remember that name\nNow you can Google each right the way and find it so that type of curiosity indeed\nIs kind of hinder a little bit in some sense by by the availability of these stores\nBut at the ... on the other hand the important things really are headed to buy all the the availability of these uh you know did you do to us because remember you know for example of questions that science us new questions that you want to research\nI mean those are questions to which you don't know the answers so you are not going to find the answers on the Internet\nSo on all you're gonna find on the Internet is to find the information that may be able to help you to investigate the further so in that respect I find for example that the Internet really enhances my curiosity because I can satisfy the simple things right up the really fast\nBut then you know that allows me to find more information to dig deeper\nIt also allows people on platforms to connect and question each other and talk talk to each other in ways never before imagined professor\n... you're exactly right I mean you know I mean at the time of Leonardo and so on I mean everything you know was communicated by\nBy by writing letters and even those letters or you know we're we're down on paper which was not cheap ah and so on and he took forever you know to get to where you needed to be so you're right I mean the communication is so much faster so the passage of information is so much faster\nOr the storage information is of course completely different than all that so that that ... at the end those are the types of things that had a ...\nHow do we cultivate for the folks listening we ever over a million people listening to our show now ah and I'm sure they're they're wondering I have kids even for myself how do I cultivate this thing called curiosity cannot cultivate it\nYes it can be cultivated and you know I I Would not claimed to be an expert on this but let me suggest a few things\nUh one thing is of course to ask him any questions and of course the other thing is that they are so many questions kids tend to ask them any questions threatened not to answer the questions immediately but try to answer them in the following way you know they ask you why that in that in that so you try to answer when why do you think it's that\nAnd then the kids would say something and then he would say okay so let's test that if that is the correct answer then it also means that that and that and so on and that's how you you know Dr Stanley curiosity another thing that is very very important in my opinion\nIs that you should always start with something that China is already curious about for for example you know most young children are interested in dinosaurs so start science lessons with dinosaurs because they're already curious about\nAnd from that you can then leads to other things you know you think they should know you you know for example you want to teach them about free fall acceleration on earth okay they may be bored by that\nBut they talk to them about dinosaurs and then you say when dinosaurs actually became extinct and you know why because an asteroid heat to earth and you know kids older dinosaurs\nOr you know why the asteroid because ... accelerate towards the earth because of the earth's gravity so you started with something they were curious about and you let them do something that you wanted them to know\nYou know and it's interesting because you're digging into something I think about a lot and that is where the science the science isn't story combining converge is in large measure what you're doing is telling the kittens scientific story and it's through questions and answers and this process\nThat you're driving their curiosity but my goodness look at how the story plays a part\nIn the ideas story plays a part what how important is story the curiosity\nStories extremely important I mean ...\nYou know people like stories people love story telling a I actually START I started the book with a very short story by by the American author Kate Chopin which is called the story of an hour and and the reason I started it with that is because\nI was so impressed with her ability to create curiosity we almost every sentence you know almost every sentence hit ... enjoyed some sort of any electoral cliffhanger and you want to read the next sentence\nAnd that's a powerful thing and we should keep it all in mind one thing that surprised you as we leave this interview what's the one thing that surprised you and your research for\nThe or a number of things that surprises me I mean for example that difference between perceptual and if ... curiosity we feel when we're surprised and curiosity we feed when you know we really love\nTo learn uh I didn't realize that does you know actually activated different parts of our brain and were associated in one case with an unpleasant state and the other with a pleasant state that surprised me another thing that it's an amazing the Judy was\nThat you know I thought that curiosity such an important topic that you know lots of nor a scientist and psychologists would be working on that\nAnd I was surprised to actually see how you know a relatively small number of people are working on that\nOf course you know consciousness he's such a big thing is just a part of it and so nor assigned to start working on many other things but they were still surprised that relativity not more people are are working on curiosity specifically\nWell we're happy you did the book is why what makes us curious the author professor Mario Livio and he's a professor of astrophysics an adjunct at the University of Nevada Las Vegas\nAnd he also worked with Hubble Telescope for twenty four years thanks so much for joining us professor ... thank you for having me\nTo\nThe journalists has had long standing ties to the Saudi royal government uses Saudi but has written critically the current government and the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman will eventually will become king of Saudi Arabia Dr\nJohn Curtis online columnist dot com what's this year John if it's proven that Saudi Arabia is behind this and a few of the ... what are we going to do about it\nWhile they're gives any question their business as usual cannot go on George\nI mean you know there's ... you're talking about an extra judicial assassination of a you I'm a Saudi born but us resident journalists for the Washington Post this is an outrage\nBeyond proportion uh Mohammed bin Salman is beyond the pale beyond the pale he's gone ballistic this this man will do anything and anything anywhere anyplace on the planet\nOr if it serves here's a mission consolidating power to the parent\nOf a king Salman fraud and I think the gruesome ness of this ... landing Fifteen Saudi team of of a hit man basically an assassination squad enter and the Riyadh or in the Istanbul Airport\nThat on videotape that videotape shows a cause so gay going into the embassy it also shows Fifteen of these this hit squad also going in some of whom were forensic experts an

constantly that wealth hearing\nScreaming and a scuffle and then complete silence\nSo they have a convincing a you know audio evidence that lets the transaction that everybody suspects went on\nSo the Saudis are completely denying this George right now saying that this is your disc girl was rumors that you know by by the uh the the international press to discredit the kingdom\nBut the fact all point to a very elaborate hit by bin Salman as retaliation against a showcase for filing all those reports about the brutality of the war in Yemen\nAnd uh the crackdown that has gone on in Saudi Arabia where he literally incarcerated entire royal family to consolidate power within the last year so it's a lot of the U.S officials\nAre going to happen and there's already been cause and and and the Senate by Rand Paul and and Lindsey Graham basically to stop arms sales immediately and that's running in conflict with many of the big business interests we know that make their living on these

stock crap like that some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure that's a good thing recessions are necessary the Federal Reserve and government the recessions is bad thing\nThey're good things um\nBut and then you want to buy the company that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a Super Bowl I mean the tech bubble took five years to build the dot com crash came in the last year and a half\nUp six or seven times kind of like the one bubble here recently cracked and a lot of companies want another well which what were the survivors what companies like apple and Amazon if it up on Amazon there oh my God I was\nThe far right is the far left and this is around the world but it's the most extreme here and Trump is playing this like a federal\nThat's why how he won he picked off\nThe far right and and win against the centrist Republicans and then the Republicans had to follow him because he now has the baton and he has all the power so so this is this is this is going to make this I'm much more difficult it the social and political level again down here\nTwelve years of recession twelve and I think now Fifteen Percent unemployment after Hurricane Maria no civil unrest these people just aren't like that they're not as polarized down here\nIn the U.S we are poll right this Kavanaugh thing it was just pure partisan\nYou know the Republicans believed him and the Democrats believed her the men believed him don't women believe I've never I mean is this there was no common sense no rationality it was just political partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy and the Democrats\nHated the Republicans for defending him in and installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really I think that that social unrest and this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republicans going to say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and all this you know free money and stuff\nAnd the and the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate on up and blah blah blah blah blah and and and they're gonna hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time or in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war\nOn the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial and urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue the south has read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge now I think there's going to be facts I think states like California or the whole west coast\nOr the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything there is nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet thing was the perfect example that no middle ground it's either red or blue you know\nAnd his argument and its arguments in hatred bitterness on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy I Know that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost assaulting you know ... senators and in the elevator and stop this ... every body yeah there's a very high tensions and\nI tell you I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto Rican I'm kind of like watching on the sidelines to see what happens and then if I Do decide to move back to Florida where I'd probably move 'em\nBack to 'cause we're familiar there and know everybody you know I I Will do it when I can buy a condo there for a quarter of the price [laughter] and\nAnd and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about the ... the next year also George's this is this is when it's gonna\nYou know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got her I suppose it's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is a one of many of our cycles we cover and zero our\nIn our newsletters that Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes and this has happened every Ninety years since the industrial revolution cause the greatest boom and global\nHis lawn you know here we had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying the timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September or lose one fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called the leash me\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and it didn't happen it didn't happen then but you could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we we were in the same position and we were coming into a two thousand sixteen the marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally Tom and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turn boys I mean when Trump\nHad that surprised when and the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred ... apple loving hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a reversal\nThis is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that\nUm and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses\nIt as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that's\nThat's not going to win reelection I was just going to even\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea which would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired after elections early next year and\nTrump could be in trouble by late next year so so either were peaking now or best Trump polls on and no disaster we're\nGoing to peak late next year and see the greatest crashing history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble lasting pass next to the end of next year but there is there's a fifty fifty chance it's happening now and you don't want to get hit by that\nFlows

within the can you predict dumped five years from now\n[noise] yes you know we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know the trouble and the economy started in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm\nJust from the baby boom generation when they were predictably spent and when they would stop spending so yes what we see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight\nWill be over a bout about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst and and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see a global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next global boom the difference is George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been this far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and Southeast Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics in the United states is kind of the best house and the bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bubble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spent much more of their money that\nSo you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next\nBut between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three is going to be way more on the downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only the\nOrange or does it real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when they die they are literally permanent shelters if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan and places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes and young people at the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and then of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be really fun to be the next year\nThat that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be the\nNext global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about one that's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war somewhere what's that going to do to to the economy\nWell you know wars are actually simulate have been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and\nUh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption a around the world and makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and then when things get scarce and there was a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said as soon as they are all our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and ... and it's a global thing is well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\n... they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to give him too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but there's certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise] the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where I saw let's go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona to get things started with a side Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday dirt and\nCrash that's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and and that's what happened in the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging now they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent [noise]\nSo so they're they're at risk it too but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick and then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in Australia is the big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack a head of ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the\nMore affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this we're going to take your deposits and worked in a kind of ... them into equity and are dying bank who wants to equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in even in Australia that people are realizing they're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your access money\nThan you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm on on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that have\nHave it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen and people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens in in in in the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly when it happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nAnd that's something we go to Keith in Rochester New York He's taken away\nA Mr ...

to stay on the line because I Know you're going to have questions and I want to get a few linked then because I Want to charge twenty three sixty thinks the path that I I\nDo think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent accounts\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured\nUm except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation is\nCome along so I I my bet is\nThat they're going to come to part we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there too onerous we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare\nThey're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay well if we can encourage student loans\nThen people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it the leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nDo thousand a year and I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars in a voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWell well here's a I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think\nThey should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly in the great depression but to put it on in a permanent\nQuantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and and the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place\nJust send you know send period to to to get us out of the at least send them money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if if they just sent everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but\nIt would have help people instead of the banking system this whole bailout his whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger only made the rich richer as only benefitted corporation including these tax cuts and has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to check you know he really is because I wanted them to be forced to spend that red line them you\nKnow right and they don't spend it or they got you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and have them spend that money to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to Harry in Port Huron download very good that you\nKnow hello there George an area that question for you mentioned earlier about the banks and you can't just now but uh the taking the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been it was kind of opposite of the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems was farms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do a bank if governments have to exploit for money or pull account if they're gonna do for the more fluent or towns and those going to be in the in the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with theory Dunn Hi Barbara North Carolina\nFor telling you how can you think you\nAnd I think you just answered that part of one of my question is why I asked\nA direct and I got one of my parents are fine I'm up I'm like oh hey humiliate crumble yeah come flying\nRight yup they play all about timing\nIt's all about time one of my guiding the looming psychology and I tell you that you just answered my question like\nAbout the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much um I don't have to worry about that so much and I'm a larger account holder is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're gonna have to restructure so security there's certainly going to take the benefits off of a larger\nAccounts and more affluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected and whatever's scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that's all right oh deposits are insured they can't insure everything if you have a major club but the smaller accounts it it'd be spread out and a few accounts and you have more money in your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're going to be way less vulnerable than and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounts those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hit and of course when when things go bad people going to hit foreign deposited more Iceland\nWent down and basically stiffed all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes the smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again\nI still say have as much as your money in a protected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans\nBusiness loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash in it they can't\nPay they can't pledge doses reserves\nAnd well that's a good thing Harry thank you were at a time here ... website it goes to goes damn dot com psychiatrist looks at the journal\nMan and money in the morning you're Jonathan

welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nAnd for inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started it\nWell I think it was because I almost died so many times\nYou know when my book the borders for normal first came out many people ask me if the book was based on stories with my patients had told me that my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential\nAdopted bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that are doctors should not be Pete anything he told by Haitians and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nFive stories from my readers and for my audiences and from family and friends and from I own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I have these experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had some close calls with that so many\nVeterans that [noise] um you know it's been a lot of literature written about the near death experience mhm\n[noise] but the um term near death experience\nYou know it's clear that document moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago that's right I think he estimated that something like one in thirty Americans that had a near death experience or know someone who have had one and that's a large group of people\nBut there's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never would pronounce clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I looked at how my close Russia's staff affected me I see that I have some of the things after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience in other words I'm\nHaving had all these clothes of it that I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I also have over my fear of dying and I have found get myself a shift from materialism into spirituality and then they and an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say was gradual the\nFirst couple of paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything of them I just kind of ... the ... yeah\nI just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because I didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and when I went to a um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez well yeah that was that was quite dramatic um but at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because it would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why do they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it that the the um anonymous themselves don't it other than how low Jeanette ... ... it's more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide and computer\nI just feel like I'm the owner bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nOr the super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia ... um yeah\nAnd I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um like transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said\nYou can't keep giving you a team of therapy because it's getting too much damage to your body\nYeah was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be any mission in order to receive a task fine so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having lived in that fight against that they gave me the parents find huh [noise] now the patient who gave me the ... with an anonymous donor that\nThe rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed the contact mhm and I did write to him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was the name of the U.S navy\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in Persian Gulf wow so\nHe was flown back into the don't you send in Washington DC and a team from the\nCity where I live way down to Washington and took a sample of stem cells and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fined ever ...\nHave you still in touch with him the death that are happening\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and\nWe've become friends that's amazing you say your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and it is\nHere altruism you know he said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor drive and one of the bases where he was stationed then he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is that she swab\n... that's it yeah\nThat that takes a lot to get the DNA so that's\nWhen his name entered the donor bang and then um years later my name came up on the computer and at that point he even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor [noise] but then once you know\nWe found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow seafood produce more stem cells\nAnd they gave him these injection for five days and then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was\nBrought back to where I live ... yes we've become friends and I just saw not too long ago\nIn Dr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psychic Rome has that help or hurt your psyche has your practice\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean\nYou know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to the if the ...\n[noise] however since I had that experience and psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's his psychic experience and much a psychotic experience\nRight and and there's a big difference there\nWell absolutely there is a big difference\nI mean sometimes if a person the something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed to the last um spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post death contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased has been in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel his tax on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common in fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of of a loved one will have some type of post death\nContact with a loved one\nEven if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\nUm in in fact you know atheist agnostic have these experiences as well as religious people\nYou see that everyone is psyche again I I tend to believe you and agree with you\nOK but uh when you say that what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP or telepathy or the cognitive beams and other things you talk to both types of decisions hundred voices and so on death\nThat vision is near death experiences so certain types of psychic experiences such as ESP and collapse of the earth extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing um for example someone phones you and you're thinking about

his work the borders of normal a clinical psychiatrist de stigmatize as paranormal phenomenon many let's talk a little bit about to death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened to my dad when he was in the hospital he thought his late sister he mentioned oh they're so until you mentioned her name she's out in the hall\nAnd there was one study that was done in a hospice\nIs dying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm\nSaid someone who is coming to take them and they called they didn't call them and they called them visitors and as they got closer to death is became more frequent and these visitors or the vision current disturbing at all they were very comforting\nSo as you say these ... can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that brings up another subject which is sometimes people receive messages and dreams which aren't the cognitive\nAnd who's giving them the message\nChats the question like where's this message coming from you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say it's coming from something they've added or we can say it's coming from the spirit\nWorld you know but some of these\nMessages for example this woman I mentioned who had to be here is that where would that be coming from that could've been her fear mhm\nYou know um and maybe it was just a coincidence that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nOr there's there was a movie about a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other government to leaders\nTo to assassinate them and you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that I mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy\nI don't know when I was dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of getting having making someone have a heart attack I don't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although we don't really know and how how did we know it's right you know so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable\nMhm [noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams because I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um wasn't it pay cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it\nJust clear as day when I woke up this is the message I got I I just saw these where it said this is a world of illusion\n... and the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have permission about the ides of march [noise]\nRight in fact she dreamt the night before he was killed she dreamt that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate hate in order to please also with his favorite told Julius Caesar the where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he northern ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong permission premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their premonition still many\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition\nAnd then they do the water should uh after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know that said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they'd disregard things which could be dismissed that superstition\nIs always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride was Richard ... was among horse racing and ... one of his friends apparently really\nUnderstood who's gonna win the race but didn't bet on that horse but on something else and lost in ... in the movie screaming in Grand you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fair I think people are they don't believe that\nThey don't believe in also they're afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because\nThere have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth who have another body experience during surgery and then when they recover from the anesthesia and they wake up to ... to tell the doctors and nurses\nAre what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies there was one patient who was blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the patent on his\nDoctors pie and of course the doctor was astounded there was another case of a blind patients who left his body during surgery [noise] I think no he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures\nAnd he left his body and he was observing everything that was going on and then when he when he recovered and they couldn't find where she put his dentures\nAnd he wanted his teeth back right\nBack but then then they said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I saw you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nThey were they were wild yeah it works it would work yeah\nWhat ... what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component life I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related you see I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual\nI mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them ... some people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous\nOr mystical are mysterious Israel different words are being used to describe the same event so I think paranormal events\nCan have a spiritual component yeah but I'm not saying every paranormal event but some do of course it depends on the person who's having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things [noise] [noise] oh definitely\nI think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there is something more out there that we don't just have to live our routine nine to five eight you know day to day lives that there's something more than we don't really know about and I think it should be explored\nUp next when we come back with Dr many make this we're going to take phone calls your goals your stories about pretty cognitive dreams and so many other things\nYou were just talking about here on the coast to coast they find out more about two nights just log on to go to ... am dot com\nExperience ratings you'll be wondering\nWho are enough from October Seventeen through twenty first begins at ... dot com\nBubble you wait Joe if you've been wrongfully injured while working or rent a car or truck accidents your most important decision may be the attorney you choose you need someone who will successfully represent you someone who can communicate your story to the person responsible for paying\nYour story needs to be told and heard you need Fred Hamas over thirty five years helping Iowans recover all their losses call Fred double duty us double A. the Des Moines offices of Fred Hamas Gulf red you'll isn't right\nThis calling I kind of when it's match the TV [noise] yeah and I went to\nI play dot com and download it began\nIn ... new and lack of games on my computer for\nFree no sign up and no credit card require nothing like a good mystery to take me away but I don't have time for a movie or a novel\nInstead I mean to the latest I play games in the ... theory and when I Need a classic I get the cricket murder mystery game hit this time I get my mystery and come away thinking more clearly now why find no problem with the three I think I can play my games on line and tune out [noise]\nI'm so glad I went to I play dot com and download the app if my daily sanity restoration I play every day [noise]\nThe more you know one of the outcome perusing the world's worst books but wonder if those jobs don't you just do jobs like looking for anyone with a pulse will just called him a\nGold card on how ... how are you from agricultural gene you clearly said we want quality not quantity of property I'll go oh\nWell like my mother taught me at first you don't succeed cut your losses are run by God don't even find your perfect global employee at ... dot com local jobs that were [noise]\nWant to wait Joe ... and I arch radio station and on your age the radio Katie ... to\nUse radio San ...
