read books including the field in the intention experiment in a way to the power of each\nLimb is the editorial director what doctors don't tell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn won't come back to the program\nHey George it's great to be back\nYou two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI Am I mean we just had two amazing ones last autumn and we just calculated the results a few months ago\nYou know I get an intention a bit when several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas or the other ... you know the category four or five and we did a little um let's bring it down in the ... are you a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens at work so they\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep that uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just skirted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean\nNow we've run about six piece intentioned experiments trying to lower violence um last September we ran a six day experiment to lower violence in the most violent place in America which is believe it or not a U.S a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri ...\nAnd we calculated the results Georgia and it was amazing um we looked at and I had a professor of statistics look at this from University of California\nAnd she saw that crime went up in St Louis has a whole property crime went up in St Louis as a whole property crime went up went up in fairground the neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent from before\nAnd it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so something's going on here\nWhat do you think this is one of the people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the feel of what's out there\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I liked I called it the field it's a quantum energy field\nAnd what seems to be the case is we can shift what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our phone everything is energy\nAnd our thoughts are another kind of energy when there are worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now you know I run thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make seeds grow faster to purifying water\nTo healing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence and\nYou know of those thirty three twenty nine have shown measurable positive significant effects\nDesigner trend of the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that kind of track record you know new pharmaceutical drug has is good or record is that in terms of studies so\nSo as I say what really seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power to change things\nNow maybe he'll think the experiments you been working on a blade are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis\nAnd then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I live in the u._k. and we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras and nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries I was working with a guy who's like the Deepak\nOf the middle east and also\nA very prominent is rarely a documentary producer so we had eight in Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait and then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other\nAnd I also beamed at this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world\nSo we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and we chose it because it's you know the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know and just calling their screen and they could talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know ... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was\nAmazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic and it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does attitude play ... in the ship your upbeat and positive will that generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individual for instance we didn't intention once for a kid call Luke who is Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide he threw himself off of forty foot structure after his he broke up\nWith this for a serious girlfriend and he broke and everything he had brain damage she had\nA you know he had nerve damage and so I got my my community just start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLook better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live\nBut he got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated but here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief in the power of intention was pretty stupid\nSo it worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George I now I work with a lot ... Gary Schwartz at the University of Arizona noted psychologist and a Jessica us\nWho is a very well known professors statistics and has been doing working consciousness research\nI worked with the late ... I worked with people from from Penn State university water expert um I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University you know just really prestigious universities\nSo we'll get an all kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable\nAnd then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up and with some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with Dr Schwartz we did some seed experiments where we had four sets the seeds and we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientist\nDidn't know which ones we were sending intention to so we had you know real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done with the scientific protocol that they really helped me set up because they're the scientist\nAnd then I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate\nOr I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to to do the intention and I'll be made out of my uh Internet site or YouTube or own Web TV or radio you and I did one together\nAnd um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results and the reason we wait a while is\nSafe for the peace experiments if you just do it a week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's going on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nAnd do you know losing the title of your newborn the power of each has to do with the number of people you put in the group the test why ... why not three Fifteen\n[laughter] will the power of eight really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments I wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups of\nYou know groups small groups in my workshop you know will will they heel and so this is just another experiment in my own mind and\nIntentioned experiment and\nSign up now ... zone or ... ... email newsletter get a today it goes to ... dot com\nIn the morning and the last thing in the news trafficking whether you need from a website that they elected by ten forty W.

you're you\nThis one makes you feel like you're part of something much much bigger the power of eight you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not

ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this the ... largest chiropractic university\nUm has their nearest scientists and we're planning a study with their biology department to looking at the immune system workers so what changes in your immune system when you do this\nI'm the one the other big pieces of this I talked about it with altruism was the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something else wrist it when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments\nAnd they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas nerve it's the longest near the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's and it has a\nEffect on um things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released to feel good hormone when we're when we're caring for babies\nAnd then the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that we um you know we we actually get healthier\nBut the other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending love to the Israelis\nThey found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group [noise] um that Vegas you're also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like\nUs so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow America America is so polarized now what if we started doing intention experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be your mother\nIt would be an interesting experiment\n[laughter] well you know we're doing one this that this someday undoing a pilot experiment like that in\n... county in Florida um we're going to do something about lowering violent but\nWe've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next next spring\nUm we're we want people of different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nYou would have talked about a mirror affect what does that\nMirror affect me was the biggest piece of this George because\nYou know we weren't just seeing effects among the receivers that stuff and the receivers of the big intention experiment you know the outcome the biggest change all that was amazing to me with what happened to the participants in these intention experiment\nSo when we started doing these these experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and we're able to get on the website and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly I asked them how it was for them and I'll be getting answers back like that [noise]\nUm I felt like I was part of a higher network you know my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beaming Star Trek remember these are people who are participating in their own\nHome in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly after they participated in a piece experiment their lines became more peaceful\nThey were making up with relatives that we're getting along better with their partners that we're getting along better with their bosses and they're co workers\nThey were and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with\nSo that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiment we had loads of healing when we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lines were more peaceful\nIn a way that's probably the most the most powerful part of the intention experiment it's not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation in what happens to the people\nIt changes their lives being part of
