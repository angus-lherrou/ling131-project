they're they're flying off the the bookshelves people are buying them but do you get also some pushback because you're you're this is kind of uncomfortable for some people you're you're pulling their

the first story we're told you know I'm only some of the story was first told him I was born in one of your work to shovel the victory but\nUm you know a lot of history has been saying like five or you know and people don't like it when you re investigate things and a lot of luck out from under him\nIn a in a cage the the things that I write I as I'm fascinated by history and I just ... ... what have you been out there just because I have been a while I'm you know you like a question about who's in our life history for table was All right\nSo I have to be very careful when I write the books not to fall in the confirmation bias on commission biased hearings on that you actually\nI'm finding just the fact that you want to continue that certainly you can\nThat can be very careful not to fall into that because out of every four or five books that I start to look into that one might make it will be information that I find so it's not like I just say well that's right shoulder [laughter] it's not worth the information that you have to go so\nFar right now in the case of FDR um you know this is Seventy almost Seventy five years ago three quarters of the century mean was it

all right well truth is often uncomfortable it's a it's it's not about necessarily making people feel good it's it's like a scorpion sometimes things [noise] um but you did they say you\nDon't paint a flattering picture of of FDR you mentioned a communism although you know let's be honest communism was was kind of the fat back then before people knew I guess the real truth about what was happening in Stalin's Russia and the er the programs and the ... the the forced\nA started nations in the Ukraine and so forth um but um let's let's talk about a young FDR talk about someone born with a silver spoon in his mouth\nOr paint me I'm a ... a portrait of the young FDR\n... you know all the Iowa lose a I pledge they always say use beneficiary of the lucky ... this guy was\nBorn in week who\n[laughter] you know I mean ... they were just sitting in the news was old world well\nI mean there are groundwork quarter mile down the road is the Vanderbilt man\nYou know they're on the some

a\nYou know it was all but that was out around but not established students um sees all the way through school or you'd rather roof off and go play football and so forth\nAnd uh it was a well I think it was what was that I wanted it was but he was or something it was really a you know\nIt was actually something I think one was there for the asking and his political started out in the last of our main and stuff and how does this and this and that blossomed than being governor of new or by the people don't know what I was governor of you or are they forgot because they're just not talking about it anymore\nYou or a you know he was an old man now he just talked to him [laughter] over Roosevelt was born and Roosevelt maybe it'll Roosevelt fighter Roosevelt which was a little odd or the woman

cousin was he a second or third cousin\nI think it was a second ago right\nAnd and he was he was a Republican how did he was a Republican how did he received his younger cousin and the Democrats\nWell they got along really well I'm actually our father wasn't too thrilled about what\nBecause that was just not the way but he was raised with a that Roosevelt name that was done anything to find out if he was\nA quote narrowly a bowl on\nA special night comes out so he can get a lot of things are well unsavory slip and some self marrying it's puzzling on funding a number of rows of you know that name so it was awful lot of weight so you\nKnow he was a ... benefitted from the Roosevelt name as well so\nRight and he was also governor of New York lots of you know he was you know he was also governor of New York which is was has always been sort of a stepping stone to the White House\nYeah it has happened that way through the history absolutely there's no doubt about that\nAnd the young FDR didn't exactly have the common touch daddy I mean he didn't have um ...

Mussolini at first he was an author of Mussolini so Mussolini actually started\nThe whole thing but you know again I'm history books being what they are that tendency over the last um [noise] so America gets under the war Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed and night for\nMore than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn\n'em coverage of entry and in Birmingham I'm very interesting stuff so um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way um anyway uh we get into the war and we're we don't have anything to do was down at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really\nThey have no people have no idea according to my end it was there how close\nEngland came to losing the right one they were lined up on the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel\nAnd this was what their MO was they used to go and laid on airstrikes bomb them into oblivion and then just tape around your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well\nEspecially France and they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain that of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the Brits\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with um never trust them I'm of course to admit previously and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with the church shows the one who\nGot the two together but he he just hated the fact that the Americans\nBecause they were so similar to the time\nThat style and in America and the the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world because Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we were before on\nSo you know to answer your question around about fashion um Churchill like it for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand\nWe weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about that rate for I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on he wouldn't have been as fan but of course we weren't getting that\nUntil decades and decades later\nRight here in New York Times wherever they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure calling us I mean there's ...\nThere's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their faces a ... billion\nFDR it seemed that the ... and reading a book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with Allen I don't know if this was because he admired him or like that he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStoned and need us we needed style and Stalin didn't need us\nHe was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and it's and Stalin had to pack well Hitler violated the pack and went after style in which completely blue silence mind\nAnd they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march and then\nYou know Hitler's ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to Stalingrad because it held his namesake so now Hitler's leading under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course we didn't know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was such a\nDelusional Vic theatre if at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch course midstream and go toward styling read\nUm meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this it doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission\nAnd they were just says well I don't care I Want it will do it so\nStalin is already beating him or he doesn't need us so Hitler has he has he ever and here he has the opportunity to play a little\nLittle hard to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging it is it's dollars table in which they get this done\nRight so there was a the conference of Casablanca and\nAnd then later to Iran I think in a was terrain in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct they have at even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world\nA instill at this point you know I I see pictures Roosevelt still looks pretty robust a you know he you know by by the standards the Nineteen forties he was an older guy but by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even\nIn Nineteen forty three um but I I Want to back up all the minute and talk about the assassination squads hitting that we're sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nOh yeah they were what was going on the other side of history that has now been revealed and this is

I'm more a humane way to make money and the Rockefeller uh\nStarted out lighting houses with kerosene but boy that combat stumble engine that guy's a gas ... like a byproduct than\nThat cannot days ran out now nice guy\nThat I never have no idea how the relatives out well and and and the\nYou have a clue as to how they made their money ranching right\n[noise] well\nI Know that I I yeah I Do\nActually and the tour guide at the Roosevelt mansion mentioned this they were actually in the timber business so I was told 'em and they were dealing with timber in a in the United states and they also we're dealing with timber and South America so that's\nWhere allegedly there and when they came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion and they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the\nStock market was not as big as it is today and there are only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so a handful of players could really influenced things they can create the peaks and valleys in the market\nSo when you have the money to start with and you can you you can influence where the bottom is and you know what the topic is you can make a fortune pretty quickly and Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why when a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else could do that and they started the SEC the security Exchange Commission\nAnd FDR actually put Joe Kennedy in charge of it because according to FDR quote unquote acts of courage to crush across\n[laughter]\nReally interesting stuff so that's what I Know about that I mean if there's more information out there I Love to hear it but their their their money came from Denver\nA and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old it's an old east coast family ah probably it's money so you know just kind of keep the Toomey elation of wealth over generations compound interest um that sort of thing when you have all the money\nI'd also hurt and I don't know if this is true but the the um that's FDR's mother the Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars as well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those they used to call them the Boston brain than those very wealthy east coast families\nAnd I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company a and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be on that as well\nYeah I had heard that about the Delano family as well there is so much information out there I mean I spent so much time digging and digging and these guys are never written a book let me tell you what if I was paid a penny an hour\nI'd be lucky [laughter] by the time you research and dig and dig and dig because if you attach names who wants to be as best they can you know for them as far as I did I I still\nGet fascinated by stuff somebody will call in and say hey that you know the ... and because it wasn't that long ago really this Seventy plus years ago you know one

is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychics\nWe're talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off and we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have been some money to get that um\nThat young student who had done the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he\nHe would pick someone out of the crowd like someone like you or me you know right in there and have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but this time there's\nThis guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why he passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would have lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out and\nThey would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he would even get the guy that was in control of the light and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer and the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise the\nMagician would be in the middle of his you know they say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up and the photographer would take a picture and\nAnd the you know the fake media would be totally surprising where are you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini to pull off his mask and so these guys are very sick and\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh\nYeah this writing on beating on Harry right\nUp that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean so I had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was in I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a circus or Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritual is so how did that how did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an vowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife were both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the fighting in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as\nA matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years and I think the friendship came about through fan just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um\nBut eventually um there was a little bit of a discord between them that got so much that they did\nBreak off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call\nOne it was based on laws that were eternal certain

discussing\nA Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com or Thomas high Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her or so so what happens [noise]\nAnd his healing processes hated by pain killers and some of this is um morphine and he becomes addicted to more than a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on 'em with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my oh James Pike up yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon earn a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yeah\nYeah yeah and I think it's an I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide the year before\nNow what Ford did for this high profile say on with the tip of the secret to do this and that\nYou kind of breaking up a sign on us Thomas or I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voiceover IT line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay\nI'm James ... this was the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little up front research\nBrings it into the ... as if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from a conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for this they out and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case Houdini case as fun as it is and is exciting it is it is not going to be the first break through convince all the hard nose skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the stance in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just did it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor could he then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight\nBut when Harry dies she's in the spotlight\nBut she doesn't have anything to do\nKnow and so all of a sudden she's in an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do these ... and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the top ... will be higher closer to God and the spirits\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you've pretty much guaranteed they're gonna fail so she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and\nAnd that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say\nWell I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and Simon and go back with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream belief\nBut your inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine\nAffirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do in the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm now someone who would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere um and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nDo a whole world that Harry Houdini still live and they will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was perfectly honest and here in trying to prove the survival of consciousness\nAnd I resorted to trick to prove my point for the simple reason that I did not believe communication with possible I\nAm now here in my desire to do this mistake how all those who lost faith because of my mistake to lay a whole again of hope and to live with the knowledge that life is continuing\nThat is
