interesting it was nearly three years ago at the end of January twenty sixteen I reported at ... dot com and my coast to coast AM radio broadcast than\nThat a new ninth planet or planet X. was indirectly discovered at the far edge of our solar system where the ... belt and the art cloud meet\nThe hyper belt is a disc shaped residue of rock dust and ice left over from our solar system creation and it extends from the orbit of Neptune out far beyond Pluto to about fifty astronomical unit from our son\nAnd the crowd of mostly ice and dust goes much further\nStarting where the hype rebelled in an extension for three point to light years from earth and\nUs fear Ikle shape that surround our entire solar system including the ... belt and I have a beautiful graphic of this at my your files dot com report for people to see what our solar system really looks like\nNow I say planet nine when indirectly found in twenty sixteen because\nTo date no human on earth has yet seen this hypothesize massive object but Michael Brown PHD professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena\nHere now back in twenty sixteen that he was confident there was a huge object ten to twenty times the mass of earth moving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud\nPreventive brown simply calls the planet nine because he's the astronomer they got Pluto knocked down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades\nIt was twenty three and professor brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called Eris out in the type rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argued that Pluto should be downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to a dwarf planet in the hyper belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWhen I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote\nIt is like chasing I'd go whatever is out there it's math is so great that it's gravitational field pushes half a dozen other hyper belt object to cluster together on the opposite side\nOf planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits close quote\nNow that is why so far it is an indirect discovery\nIt's now late twenty Eighteen after several tries at the hacking Subaru observatories in Hawaii defined planet nine invisible light and or infrared\nProfessor brown says that it is quote till like chasing a go after more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet can be only seven times more massive than earth\nAnd just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update on his search for this elusive planet nine or planted act that he uh is it still trying\nTo mind and he told me\nThat he is planning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week\nAnd this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to visually get to this ... serious math because they've been working on computer refinement and for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun\nSo that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than Neptune a good way out there but they had ... narrowed down the focus so he has deliberately going on November first started another surge because the new calculations\nPredict that planet nine is close to a constellation that can only be seen by American eyes in the winter\nHere now from the California Institute of technology's planetary sciences department in Pasadena, California is astronomy professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the constellations up until the winter\nBefore we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start deliberate first that's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nIt's a search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eye because so far the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what your I Would say just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet now and looking at it in the end for a study of will be very important but not probably the best way to look for it\nIsn't it amazing that all of this impact on the solar system perturbations and even tilting the playing of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nYeah I think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look it\nIt'll be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing in that direction so it will be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized it'd be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between\nThings that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right and like no no no it's five thousand times more massive [laughter] this is what we mean when we say a planet in the outer part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might have come from why is this massive object all the way out to the edge of the hype about going into the your cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or not they were inside of our solar system where Neptune and urine is our but then he got knocked out by Saturn or Jupiter like do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but in ... we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has all of this is just speculation\nYou can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou've been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a Neptune like planet just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it will be a gaseous atmosphere it probably won't have clothes it's probably too cold to have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might\nBe quite bland\nA mostly just kind of grayish white atmosphere with no features of it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it it's something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAny that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter like ... it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the hype rebels and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realized that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there's a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure 'cause we don't know what is beyond the planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what the border of\nEverybody's all offended by words but it only depends on who the wars that offends hill Sean

a one and a hundred events can become as often as every other year and so these really extreme floods extreme heat they become much more common in the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now where computer models showing to do is have you worked on the ... the report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to two\nIt could be substantially\nWorse than even those the stuffed with\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger nations the United states included\nMy adding coal now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nBut unfortunately you put your finger on it my guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office\nAnd so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which just or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with that shorter period of time and it will be somebody else's problem or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes and houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migrations away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned votes on the east coast around the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they're likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level Roger I'm forced to migrate as their\nCities become inhabitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you go ... billions of such migrants at one point five degrees but you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we could expect\nNorth America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low lectures\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war and ... and ... all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to a lot of the crises\nSo doesn't that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from coast\nBut this has been something that has been identified\nBy law of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency during the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a head and the same mentality\nHas taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist but this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we thought it was for years ago\nTo global climate change in increasing more definitely bring more wars\nYes there you go\n... well it it's a terrible future if we can get this under control and one of the big headline the summer of twenty eighth team\nA Malian Florida home may see sea level rise
