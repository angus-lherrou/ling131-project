H. I. heart radio\nAnd welcome back to the coast to coast George nowhere with you with Nick ... with us a rod Serling his life working imagination the name of the book Nicholas how many twilight zone episodes were there a hundred and fifty six\nWell that's why I think ... gallery that came out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately\nWhat was his role\nWell he he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called my gallery was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even hitched it he's the one who probably pitched it to the network will I bring all the\nYeah after that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and and he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see\nThat kind of his absence come up all the time in episode where you say uh you know rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow come you never wrote a book\nWell never a novel he did write your collections of short stories\n... sure but I'm getting the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually the stories that made up tonight gallery movie uh they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary um ... but he never\nHad the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with tells me he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away for long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThere's there's going to be a ... to the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out or is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it\nAnd from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things um I Am cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue port where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise]\nYou know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kind of thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is they launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know the going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how\nYou know how classic these shows are that can be re Andrew reintroduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wasn't around surely one of the co writers a planet of the apes\nHe sure was in a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was\nHe didn't really get credit for it to well he did get literally get\nCredit for it on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling a so called credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of\nYou know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I I clarify in the book\nSome of these shows whether it was not gallery or twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a heat you know Carol Serling was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift she said that he wanted to believe\nHe had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know they only visitations and UFO sightings and all kinds of stuff\nBut he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own he never saw a spaceship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular\nAh documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of\nAnd during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like\nThat now the twilight zone there were a thirty minute episodes but I guess mine is commercial time they were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of 'em yeah back then now nowadays with thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod Serling could write a story in a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often\nA complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story in twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pinpoint your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah as you said there are so they're so different it was very hard to to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know hard science fiction and fantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so\nUm you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to throw a couple of my favorite at this point probably is is walking distance wrote songs for season\nA episode about his kind of archetype all you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know we live as youth and go back to a easier less stressful life\nWas on the Willoughby or it's just like really as kind of a stop the Willoughby as kind of a companion piece to its well\nDistance yeah so they're both very similar and they're both among among\nFavorites and that was that was a big theme is or was this idea of going back to his innocent youth and bring him to New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was a classic a\nMan is yeah absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still know to this day they know that and it gets a cookbook you know they that's\nEver [laughter] and they're just so many good the uh what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and start a average Sloan who actually started rod Serling his very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater\nOr his start in that and you start in the fever and yet exactly he was he was against gambling and he got kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine thinks of taunting him\nAnd it drove him crazy after a while to know that exactly right yeah All right Nick stay with us we're going to come back and take phone calls

that greasy with us rod Serling in his life working imagination ticket for a rod Serling were alive today watching television what what do you say about the current state of TV\n[noise] well I I think in a in one regard I think he would be thrilled with how adults television has become in you know in the in the realm of drama\nUh during the time that restaurant was riding obviously we talked about some of the censorship but\nNot on the issues but also the language and and just the ... the subject matter in general even if it wasn't a social issue um you know today there's so many shows that are that are are so adults in scope or you know I don't even have to name them but you know Mad Men and Breaking Bad and\nYou know not just cable but but um but network television I think it would be thrilled with how how uh the with the quality of those shows now of course we have many more channels now and he\nThere's certainly a whole lot of you know of of jumped to but um but I think in general he will be happy with it and one thing I could tell you I'm sure he he would hate reality TV\nOn the um he\nAnd and I don't say that just you know that's not just like me saying that at the time you know I guess reality television Ford's time a route had some very negative things to say about a show called this is your life if you remember this is your life uh this is your life with a show where they bring somebody onto the show it in the normal you know regular everyday person and\nThey will trot as family members out there and they would go through his you know scrapbook and look at you know it was kind of reality television for the time and he just despise the show or you know he thought it was just an invasion of privacy and everything else so it's a reality show and he would hate but but I think there are so many shows now that he would absolutely love\nWoman old time television to knock a really did not understand the racial mix ups demographics when you look at some of these old shows way gone back or even the comedians are the game shows\nThey were all older white guys you know in and I'm not I'm not talking like a middle age I'm Talking older white guys [laughter] where did the television\nYou know it would be difficult to get that kind of a person like Jimmy Durante for example you you think of him he was a big superstar very talented I don't think he would make it today\nYou might be right yeah yeah you could be right I mean well listen to the ... the um\nThe field as has grown so tremendously there's so much more competition\nThat uh you know there'll be there'll because it's kind of like talking about a major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know ... you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin player from all these places and they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more more competition\nWhat would rod say about all the different channels available though in his day there was just three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it gives to uh to writers and creators that you know I'd been his day you know if those three networks didn't want to air it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know had on the contract to CBS\nCBS didn't want to hear it that was it nowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation\nOr seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely at some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nSome basing let's take some calls so let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started hiker\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you were talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white and of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look but I've always been amazed at what I was able to do\nWith regarding the size of the sets which to me was as far as the visual impact was which is a testament to the you know the cinematographer and the lighting directors which I just I was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish was wandering from Nick if he knew how many cameras used during the actual shoots\nOkay Nick do you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with that that's one of the striking things about the series is is\nOf course the production level in terms of budget you know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the time but of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you the brilliance you know spaceships a shooting across the sky and that kind of things so that ... had to\nWork with a you know more a relatively modest a set\nAnd the so and he did he got the most out of out of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern\nUm he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room because it was going to be cheaper to make you know young actors one room and that's it and he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like I have the beholder or you know and I married twenty thousand feet or something and then he would do one of these shows that we've got kinda got the budget back under control\nHe jumped started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean it's it's certainly there are a lot of you know stars and soon to\nBe Robert Redford start yeah yeah has learned Redford\nActually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first\nBy Robert Robert Redford on television a and that was a great great show when he was a very good in it too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to say what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah was it was very that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house\nIn a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom [laughter] it's\nCalled the invaders and and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered episodes of the series it's ... it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the you know spin offs person you know a says a few things\nWe found out who they were in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery\nOr because everybody thought she was ugly in she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else look like and that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there's a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered episode\nAnd the one that really gave me the message of people was the shelter about the fallout shelter\nYeah the shelter is a great a great episode Serling wrote that one\nAnd uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to be you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what this what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into it and they can't get into it and they turn on each other and it was yes that that was a terrifically a well known episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nHi are you know I'm an episode that's a very rare episode that it was finally released years later and it was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas do you\nRobert Duvall absolutely right another great and you know a great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode was the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all in our long as opposed to the half hour oh really yeah okay\nYeah and miniature was one of the hour long episodes and it ... it was involved in a in a lawsuit at the time that\nUh the series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated\nSo it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years or in so that was long long settled and um there was a special on called the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh he has a horrible horrible incident hum a helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set\nA it was yeah yeah cats they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation you know in Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead yeah Hi\nMake a couple of questions or one would be the first one would be that seems like it was very a scape is\nMore than maybe someone stay back in the sexes I'm just speculating if you had a job and he came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality and I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there any other shows really like that my second question would be about\nYouth Radio in St ...

backwards at the beginning [laughter]\nUm but no that that's that I couldn't tell from that from that description of may have written that\nDidn't one step beyond pop up after twilight zone\nYes uh yes how the outer limits came after the twilight zone as well but no actually one step beyond I Believe actually perceive the twilight zone by year I'm Out of limits came afterwards but I Believe a one step beyond which started in fifty eight I think\nNext up we're going to end in Tulsa, Oklahoma and were taken away\nFrom Georgia and neck you know\nStarting man he was ... he had the ability to be able to understand human nature because if you listen to a lot of his episodes and I've got every one of them and I ... about every two months\nYou know everyone wanted his shows has a point to it but he's trying to point to you know and I think it's because of their experiences at a combat soldier during World War two and which I you know it was all about uh the Nazi movement and all of that you know\nAnd the everything you've been through one of my favorite episodes it's hard to say which is my favorite but I think it had to be the one that's to be twenty five Mitchell twin engine bomber coming over from Italy crashes in the desert\nThe cap that airplane didn't go on a mission for whatever reason which was Robert coming Bob comings I'm Sorry ... and Bob coming it's just having me walking by seeing this newspaper of his airplane they had found laying in the desert\nAnd he went back in time where you went back to the desert in his mind\nAnd relive the experience even though he didn't fly that mission you know and or any I ended up in a hospital room\nAnd haven't psychiatric care trying to find out you know what caused him they had a nervous breakdown and it was because the shock\nOf seeing an airplane on that newspaper just recently you know and when they when the show ended close to the ending of it the nurse bodies clothing out there and she said well there's sand in his shoes\nAnd so somehow or another he really transport himself back in time toward and twenty five ... crashed you know struggle with those shows that ... did\nHe had a time machine you know one of 'em this guy you know went back in time three different times and he thought he would try to capture events that took place one of them was just thinking of the Titanic\nThe guy went back tried to tried to change that well he failed\nAt one time you went back and tried to stop the uh Japanese from being annihilated in Hiroshima trying to warn them that didn't do any good he got thrown in jail for his efforts on that so I went back and he ended up in Nazi Germany they're already thought he could alter that event\nOf course but a man I don't know we it it'd be hard to say which me my favorite episode the the the Christmas Story the guy that played art Carney played the ah Santa Claus in a department store and that call Cowell was his name he wanted to be the biggest it ... times\nThe guy was all a shrine hand\nWhen he got a break from the department store you went and got drunk came back he was setting up on the chairs little boy jumped up in his lap\nSanta Claus just it was two grown man I mean he fell out of the chair on the floor you know where she got fired and everything he went outside and he was all down down and he went in the back alley and picked up a bag and it turned into gifts mysteriously bags and all of a sudden became full of gifts that did it uh you know and pecans\nAnd he went around giving gifts to everybody and it just and that story\nYou know and the guy who ran the department store they found call well given these gifts out at this a place like a John three sixteen mission type place you know policeman comes in here and goes where did you get all these kids to get a receipt for all these gift blah blah blah and he goes no I just I found the bag and the give strength and I'm just giving them out\nTo the police station and the department store owner came in there so yeah there it is there is the merchandise call well you're the Bob I'll buy you know\nAnd ah the guy's name was Mr gun department store owner right and and they need to step out of the bag at the police station there wasn't nothing but empty cans in it right\nThere so they had to let him go of course the store owner sitting here scratch your head the policemen scratches it couldn't figure out where all those gift recover from it they were coming out of that bag\nSo just before they released a coal oil Santa Claus he raised in the bag and grab a bottle of wine Nineteen thirty three and handed it to Mr gundy\nHuh you know sit merry Christmas and both of them got pretty pretty toasted on the wine and they walked outside and they seemed Santa Claus flying overhead and a slave with reindeer and ... and that right there just catches my heart Everytime\nI live in you as you mentioned something about cans and remember kick the can Nicholas\nOh sure sure yeah kick the can and that was actually re made in this well its own feature film as well about a a old old folks home where a ... one of the old one of the people there and wants to get the get the residents to kick the can to feel young again and of course they do become young again my point kick the can and\nAnd the one person who was against it the whole time he didn't play and he didn't get to become young and he regrets it obviously and and that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually that's a terrific episode\nWe're running out of time your neck but uh I I've been to tell you this is a topic that is so dear to my heart it brings back memories when I was a kid watching television my folks were there in the living room where those those are great time sort of
