that's why Michael dealing with Glenn joined us just a minute a couple of things in crypto news tonight though there is a strange cloud on Mars\nAnd if you go to coast to coast am dot com you can find

and then the thing with the pencil or I don't know you you believe me there there's a lot to talk to a and about coming up\nOn coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it\nOminous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from an ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show from his other books including a novel the no prophecy he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nAnd Harvard and I had my son was born in Boston and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter] I understand that that's why I ask you a bit\nLater on a ... you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are\nAmongst I think an elite group of science reporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in into very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary Roach\nOh you're missing missing a lot to really tell me and you know she's a she's a frequent guest you're in but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she she lives to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and when she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen and she just I Love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her in this kind of ... it was reminiscent do me a little bit on how you were getting into these subjects because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories in everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about the students to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I have you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ... but I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear\nFor somebody like Larry King do hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you huh\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to you have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic says concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I've covered the cryogenic story over the years ah you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of uh of being brought back to life the\nHead being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um\nWhat I ... in a in a sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... ... it's more likely that um what Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicks the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life is you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots that third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robots man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAnd I was reading some of those sanctions and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it\nBut there is still this hope that people have about preserving their actions and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Iran mosque or being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars who's

former science reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as author and the new book is uh is is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that base in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about about the idea of preserving physical life on this planet\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know then we really want to do this and\nThere's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are I Do come under the category of genetic engineering\nWhy we're doing in is something that's never been done before and that is we are elevating recessive trade and\nWe are in the drama of traits in other words we are flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure\nWe're defining the natural flow were to find the natural order of things and you got to believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nOf on yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the commercial was margarine night it was very mired in for a merger and right yeah I don't know margarine is not so great for exactly but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits than suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price and he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know a billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution\nRight where we need to do that if we take it on or who was going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the de ... thing and\nI'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly your elephant you know but much in the same way that we have a sweet or orange right where we have a a a a juicy or beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky net and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name is Anthony ... is a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the sun but [noise]\nHe recently applied to the IRS and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface that sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it it is inevitable that one day a artificial intelligence robots\nPowered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they don't control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because the guy who did that this technology we're creating will run amok\nAnd you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but you know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang goal which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go you\nKnow ... you\nWrite an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall e and I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become ... they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once posts about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... button it up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's what the day ... singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah and it\nI think the interesting these are the two is it that the equation is let's use in a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get then the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average IQ isn't going to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine\nSo ... are like that the cushy Murphy app yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose if you lose a\nYeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that says you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers now how is raising was at the right now I fully believe that completely and I do and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour because I'm saying

I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a ... where are you with that one\nI I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about\nTrans humanism and you know that's it there's actually a movement are called the trans human movement where\nAs you say the uh the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories as the usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I there this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of the sky from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power lines when he touched a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he lost both arms ... them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life\nYou know of severely crippled and and now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses\nBut see these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial\nArms you know that we are mechanical that requires you to wear a harness and you have to ... you know these are these are arms that\nHe can move with his car so they're they're wired to his\nMind and I are amazing fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I agree with you and even even in um [noise] even in a military setting\nI mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there yeah\nWhere you know write it just it just ... you know so so for a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ... you know if if if they if we can give them an extra fella Scott what's on the take some of that load off\nOf their own skeletons I I think that's a I I think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that\nI mean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we can come up with the technology um that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm\nAbout maybe some of our advancements should not be consequences free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would revel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then I never really it's a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and ah you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogate going into war and so we spare\nCould possibly go run there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter]\nYeah I Know and and now and and the ... group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some of their stuff soon or using their own that says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain\nThe question then becomes do you get such warriors the right to make the decision to shoot or not should in other words you give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then\nThat basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in\nWe're going to be now and another escalating arms race\nRight yeah ... it in some ways you know that I often I often think to myself you know all this technology is brand new it's unprecedented but\nWe had our just still the same you know so oh our faults in our ... our weaknesses\nAnd are downsides just get magnified by this technology the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses and our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose to you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate the Sarah\nConnor k'naan from not the Terminator conundrum but the Sarah Connor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war\nBecause you're over welcomed by the technology of the your opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism and you know you\nKnow I mean that's that's how eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending ... Terminator but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to\nYou know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going or at his weaknesses\nBut but positive person 'cause whenever you mentioned Russian scientists I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old head on a new body\nRight yeah yeah okay well had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's put that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween\nHe kind of moments right there were like All right now that this is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I can understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit [noise]\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nAh where they yeah they separate the monkeys\nThat and then they re attached it or just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to\nA level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nOr by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who has been quoted a frequently\nAnd the Chinese or the this as an opportunity to buckets to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you're talking about the showcasing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI I don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into\nThe the situation and the husband was\nCleaning one thing he said there was an intruder and how you came in\nHe killed he killed his wife in the basement and we started looking at things and they found she was wearing a watch\nHang onto the thought because we need to hear the end of that coming up after this break then we'll give the numbers and everybody can join in the ministry\nThe end of life as we know it might go Guillen next coast to coast am in for George Nouri this was he in punted [noise]\nUh [noise]\nThe absurdity you understand how fundamentally idiotic and observe that is the insanity he does some absolutely insane things the absolute madness\nDo you think I'm doing I'm Crazy America twenty eight T everybody's got selective moral outrage Sean Hannity everybody's all offended by word but it only depends on the other is the worst that offends ill Sean Hannity what the hell do we do wrong in this country and I did seven news radio ten forty W.

I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I could pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed a one story and the police looked into it or his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a the deceased woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit and they found out that the they could actually get this\nCalculate how many feet she walked and it didn't square with the story from the hospital\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah they\nThey won't have soles God didn't make him they won't have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and it was like do they\nWork [laughter] so I mean I think some of it as an education peas in and I think that's were great science writing in science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful 'cause it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you're you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right Kenya right after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book maybe totally irrelevant right because by that time the beds and you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me go to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into our DNA when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense then ... now into my\nQuestion before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be talking about the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will\nYeah yeah right well we'll give it a little plug for an up [laughter] and now they're I think you you were talking\nAbout immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality\nAnd when the wrath of God is or out of a finance high and it says that they will pray that they would die and they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this this area that you're talking where we've achieved get more\nOut of this is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse I'm you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse are some hint\nAs to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jive with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating er and and so I I I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does\nDoes a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of um of a mental a question or a mental experiment that people talk about a lot of it will reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence bean whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a hunky Alyssa a kind of a role of human like robot but get so complex\nAnd so beyond ... you know hasn't existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYou know it's like that guy net running it's like running\nOn on energy that it absorbs from the environment I mean that's\nThe horror from saying or from the crush souls of the people in stumps on on you know when you get some coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop you know that that piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and plug it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher six so ... ... ...\nThose exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates\nMore conversations but it doesn't always resolve them so keep that in mind let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona on coast to coast am David\nGoing hey my question for me I'm ... and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\nUm one would be the result you keep breaking up\nYou're killing me because it sounds like a really good question yeah they do we just leave them\nAnd we just left\nA no alright Well James is in the in the Washington Let's try to him

GM Samantha Davidson says at the turn of the century this building space with you that's a\nForm of ... to ... so yeah so this could have been a pharmacy and maybe there is no real explanation for why there are goes there\nBut that video ... especially ... and the fact that we were really got me was because it's a kind of a shop law mandates they can't touch the video\nSo what was it I don't know but if you go and look at it and you want to jump in on open lines of loved to have you let me go to Mike in Charlotte North Carolina coast to coast to get us started Mike\nGood morning hours

with you fear it I mean we're the ... in\nThe Bible says that there are where nothing because they sleep right uh you know we can try to play God but I I [noise] it's impossible because we are not gosh that's all I have to say\nOh it's fair enough I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that sold peace though is a little more complicated so a lot of people would say in it [noise] if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were why wouldn't it have a soul\nIf other people out there have you know\nUh other meant if there are other people who have a ... problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease you know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human or that they have less of a soul\nI'm so I'm not I'm with you in theory well I'm with you in theology on soul um but I think it is much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because that used to be the thing that people said about\nTest tube babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that uh okay let's get to where we got a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi um I are wild hog iceberg for not for five years I don't want to get too much into it right\nUm after last night I have a couple of things to say on this in March ... her saying I'm a reviving manner awarded a habit of the things he ... that were to survive\nI mean wouldn't even know what it is a fireman now further more\nIn our current situation right now we have there are a lot of people storing up first a vital situations and there are a religious groups such as the Mormons who are you know compiling surprise for\nThree years to come for for them is former rooms with multiple wives with multiple shoulder with multiple multiple and\nUm and we don't really we haven't really touch it whether or not these are usable and we don't know even with\nTraining we don't know if\nThe supplies which says ... somebody in a cave or in a whole or in a ditch or whatever I mean so I Would hurt your on your way to um fallen scare myself\nNot to a consuming somebody supplies but just chew on my cell and my child even I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer\nA myself to give her trial like for a year on one of the supplies without training without any\nKnowledge of how to use the supplies to just see somebody could even his thing then sell\nAn interesting you don't really know even with the slight Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know who's going to survive it could be a child it could be a twelve year old kid\nWho hasn't had any training on how to year the supplies that are stored up in these codes are or wherever I'm\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I I I just wanted because there's a lot of listeners who are\nA latter day saints and so I just really be a clear for people most LDS do not practice plural marriage ran the overwhelming number of them do\nBut to her point I was watching on Netflix or there's this series called uh like the men with three wives or three wives club or something I don't know\nBut it's about a renegade a Mormon sect community and everybody generally in the community has more than one wife\nIn the following some of these and that's in Utah near Moab and um and that they they've already talked about saving up than having enough food for these big giant families to last for seven years that's a lot\nI mean and what did even work Kennedy even work I don't know\nA ... but uh yeah so air

science hero trees have a candidate censoring the hold if you dare they surveillance video from August watched the glass tip John counter slowly it starts to move that Andy going that's next to it\nAs oh capitals positive here for a new we'll just get back to that later on but you can go see the whole story and coast to coast am to\nCome and look at the video and then try to explain that coming up later on okay how does that jar move on its own and then the thing with the pencil I I don't know your ... believe me there there's a lot to talk to a an about coming up\nOn coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nUh ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nAnd Harvard day of my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter] I understand that and that's why I asked ... uh uh\nUh later on or if you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in the lead group of science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I\nI I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a terrific tell me and\nYou know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she loves to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what\nHappens to the body after we die called stiff a ... or packing for Mars and when she talked she tried to learn what it'll be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is very I Love it you know she's great and you'd really like her and this is just very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subjects because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it the sciences there but um anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this is enough to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with Ted Williams family in ... but I mean I what\nWhat is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you are\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I tried to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America hunting hunting Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic says concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years ah you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um\nWhat I ... in the sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... ... it's more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic rope so that Larry King can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with the four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is artificial intelligence robots that third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the Ford has to deal with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime and I was reading some of those sections and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not that big emphasis on it\nBut there is still this hope that people have about preserving their accents and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to up load thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nI tell for example the story of on my uh being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars these devolved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and somebody's also got his finger in this whole neural net a business but just the really the new one of the new hot topics out there\nBook that I think we need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should\nWe then that's where we go with the next ... the classic study so much so that the pope rodents fetus at ... on it just because we can should we will find out what's on Michael ... list next on coast to coast am\nSurvival different letting them mind wander allows you to be known out I mean I ...

just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about that\nBased in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which might be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nTrying to get their hands on some DNA some you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now a including a a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know then we really want to do this and\nThere's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are I Do come under the category of genetic engineering\nWhy we're doing in is something that's never been done before and that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we are in synch ominous traits in other words we are flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural flow\nWere to find the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature member the commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nThat one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was Russia was margarine night it was very mired in merger and right yeah and we all know margarine is not so great for not exactly but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits than suppressing dominant trait were flying in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price\nAnd he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against\nYou know a billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution\nRight where we need to do that if we take it on or who was going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah I you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back a quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweet or orange right where we have a a a a juicy or beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as towns words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name as a Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to Hoover and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so from the sun but [noise]\nHe recently applied to the IRS and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface that sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robots\nPowered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they can control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because the guy who did that this technology we're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but\nYou know ... it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang goal which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYou know ...\nYou write an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall e and\nI mean it it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become ... they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just\nDoing computations 'em but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once boasted about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... it just buttoned up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's what the day all singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\n[noise] yeah and\nI think the interesting these are the two is it that the equation is let's use in a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know I using it a drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly the magic sell\n... or like that the cushy Murphy ... yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it loses you lose it\nGeorge here you've heard it here first folks are

I Know several people who have a ... who have a\nTrouble walking or the lost their ability to walk in the ... mine all injuries and and that this to them as a dream I mean the I ... just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\nOf I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a ... where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that or you have that discussion that I have in the book about\nTrans humanism and you know that's it there's actually a movement are called the trans human movement where\nAs you say they are the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories as the usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable there wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I ... this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of this guy from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power lines when he touched a a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he'd lost both arms zap them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses but see these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms\nYou know that we are mechanical that requires you to wear a harness and you have to ... you know these are these are arms\nThat he can move with his thought so they're they're wired his\nMind and I and I said to me than fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I agree with you and even even in um [noise] even in the military setting\nI mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there yeah where you know write it just it just ... you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fella Scott what's on the take some of that load off of their own skeletons I I think that's a\nI I think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that\nI mean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's what it there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we can come up with the technology um that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm\nAbout maybe some of our advancements should not be consequence free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then in ... new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and uh you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogate going into war and so we spare\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah\nI Know and and now and and the ... group you know I called them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some other stuff soon or using their own that's is just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain the\nQuestion then becomes do you get such warriors the right to make the decision to shoot or not should in other words you give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then\nThat basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in\nWe're going to be now and another escalating arms race right yeah ... it in some ways you know\n... that I often I often think to myself you know all this technology is brand new it's unprecedented\nBut we had our just still the same you know so our faults in our foibles and our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses and our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose to you maybe the biggest problem we would face in the law of\nUnintended consequences would dictate the Sarah Connor conundrum\nNot the Terminator conundrum but the Sarah Connor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology of the your opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism\nKnow I mean that's that's how eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending frame it in some Terminator but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to you know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy\nYou know going uh and his weaknesses but but positive person because whenever you mentioned Russian scientist I'm reminded of the story\nAbout the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old hat on a new body\nRight yeah yeah okay well we'll head transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween\nYou kind of moments right there were like All right now there's this is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I could understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end in how far along are they in the pursuit\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nAh where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up the\nThe the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden or by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and\nThere's at least one guy and Russia who's been quoted a frequently or who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "27"}
