{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WHO", "content": "Child like energy how did these kids in southern Mississippi back in the early eighties pull it off [noise] Harris explains that wasn't really\nAs a ah eleven and twelve year old respect like growing up in Mississippi in the eighties pre Internet you know how do you make a twenty six million dollar movie on your allowing us you know we knew nothing about it in and\nFor the first year so we kind of [noise] figuratively speaking grow up during the darkness as far as figuring out how you do that you know I wrote a six hundred page shot list and then it got to the end and realized was utterly worthless you know\nClose up and he walks in the room I mean what are you going to do with that and and then figure out okay no story boards that's how the professionals do it yeah yeah and it was sort of bias no says a filmmaking on the sly\nFilmmaking on the fly can sometimes get a little dangerous especially when kids are in charge one day there was a fire on the ...\nMost of the terrorists we shot in my mom's basement which had this big rambling basement multiple room [noise] so uh we would\nWe'd only shoot in the summertime um you know it was like summer camp you know we we do production pre production during the school year but during the summer that was our time so I'm\nThink a hundred and twenty percent humidity typical Mississippi summer day [noise] um [noise] start early and um [noise]\nAnd a son or down to the basement where [noise]\nYou know made up like a Nepalese saloon my dad's old wine bottles lining the lining the or the shelves and and Jason are cameramen as wiring up square to go off in the wall um [noise] and ah [noise]\nWe have a you know the\nThe Nepalese saloon nearly burns down down\nOur moms and shut us down in the previous summer because well\nThe auto show me with my back on fire and for some reason I had a problem with us [noise] um so they let us continue with a two words adult chaperone found an adult even less responsible than we were [noise]\nSo um [noise] he helped us a guide us to win you know there wasn't a fire in certain edges the frame you know more more gasoline over there it's a wonder if we didn't burn house down don't try this at home catch\nWhen making a film being in Hollywood or Mississippi there are several stages of production there's pre production shooting and post production here again is Eric on the reproduction efforts to build this monumental tribute shown\nFirst summer was entirely nothing but pre production drunk story boards scouting locations casting costumes props year too we finally shot kept none of it because again we didn't know anything about so many [noise]\nUm [noise] so there's very few shots there that we actually kept from that first year but there are certain things that we just would she over and over and over again [noise]\nThrough a trial and error we slowly picked up things about a learning about composition lighting blocking acting and bit by bit we got better and only when we're satisfied with ah the quality of a shot\nIn the scene would we move onto the next\nNow these kids are obviously determined to get the film made but there was another major hurdle that they will have to overcome back in the early eighties and that was just simply having access to the film that they were trying to recreate\nWe only actually saw the movie a few times you know a A N worked\nPretty much from memory for the first handful of years and so some actually came out on laser disc and a four\nAnd so we cobbled together [noise]\nAbsolutely everything that we could in terms of\nYou know raiders paraphernalia you know a story books and magazines and and bubblegum cards and and all that stuff the comic book and the screenplay and and to the best of our memory sat down and and Eric [noise]\nYou know chiseled out well over six hundred individuals story boards that we've been used as a blueprint but we you know\nWe went back to the theater as much as we could [noise] but [noise] um\nYou know for those of us who can remember the eighties there were\n... video stores were really in there and to see that you couldn't really go down and read whatever you want it you know um there wasn't a veil ability issue you know and and it was a movie when they can re release things so when the movie was released in the theater we went back and watched it you know again as much as our you know [noise] allowance would allow\nFor the boys ended up finishing their seen by scene remake of readers of the Lost Ark with their big premier at an auditory the local\nCoca Cola bottling plant in Gulfport, Mississippi\nAugust twelfth Nineteen eighty nine [noise]\nErik de la and Jason lamb just finished an eight year recreate the trio we mirrored their version of Steven Spielberg raiders\nI have teenagers film and TV [noise] it's the hardest thing I've ever done so far we've been following this story up in the past three years if you have to seen by turning back the hands of time I think one take one [noise]\nHe was shot out of sequence of due to his long filming period many actors randomly appear at different ages throughout the course of the film they completed every scene in the film except for one too complicated\nAnd expensive for the kids to convincing we pull off it's the scene from writers were Indiana Jones isn't a fist fight with a big ball knocks you next door an airplane with rotating propellers at the last moment when India is getting his ass kicked the Nazi gets hit by the plane propeller and shredded into a million buddy pieces that splattered all over the side of the airplane [noise]\nIt's a pretty good African shuttering it's only seen the\nKids couldn't match after setting mom's basement on fire it was probably a good idea to nix the death by propeller seen\nThe boys went their separate ways going off to college in the film was largely forgotten till two thousand three when the film producer got his hands on the copy in the remake here's Chris on the film getting discovered all those years later\nI didn't even tell my wife has an Indiana Jones fan so she had no idea that I had even Dennis raiders thing and so when it got discovered in two thousand and three\nAnd like exploded you know and got us into Vanity Fair and we're all sudden touring around the United states and going to Germany and Australia and you know my wife was like I'm so much just raiders thing you know I mean can they like let me see it you know like\nIt's like this thing that I did and you know I still have that like [noise] that reaction and she's like this is cool this is great\nSo this little remake of raiders of the Lost Ark born out of this sweltering summer heat

C. P. international limited\nIn Alexandria, Virginia based company where his primary duties include working on multinational programs for the department of army and since October of two thousand and two colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military\nAnalysts group and his brand new book is called and the alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing\nThat us national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly approaching the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the INS for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nAre of course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven I in a treaty because they have\nA not only build practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles forever range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that\nWhere your tractor cruise missile recalled nine and seven to nine or that has um you know not met the criteria is violated the criteria\nOf course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of the twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we are going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow because it should concern to solve it\nYou know that has cut back dramatically a nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has\nReally crossed the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercise with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a drill with China\nAs a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact a really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology that is of course being shared\nA significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying a\nFighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system and the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states\nNow practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against Jimmy a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have the mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War when President Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the bear\nAnd given their\nTheir passions for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation um coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest as perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our lives but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back\nThe Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have\nBrought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir ... and you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nHas really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that um they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nWhy should we be fearing ... and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political corps and a predatory economics strategic extortion\nInformation warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and\nThere's a long history and in fact in alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests\nAnd in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been a Russian Chinese leaders have been meeting here recently in the fence ministers just met you

certainly in jeopardize our dominance in space our satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're shooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're\nWe're talking about I'm beginning to do well there are rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not\nNot just the military it's economic it's diplomatic ah it's\nAll these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world\nAnd ... on the distribution of dissemination of information or appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and it's helping them\nCensor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor your own population and of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things um uses the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and not become a part in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I suppose to a certain degree because they see a rising\nChinese economic power and they want to be part of a the success of that a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's leading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there\nUm and unless something dramatically happens in a very different way or they're going to achieve that and they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know I see the the Internet and what can be used and what can be so they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes yeah and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of the constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these friends\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because uh the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is the United states or to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course they could show the um the brutal slaying of of a cause Shelby\nUm and how that might\nMean there was there or dominoes at play here obviously and wondering what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his little Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that and the cars so sugary situation is is tragic ah but if you've been watching Mohammed bin psalm psalm and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably\nBeen cut down a few notches here recently especially with\nThe so called Davos and the the desert which he was expecting all these\nUh donors and investors to come over and had him on the back and giving more money so we can develop a true economy that's not based solely upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology they're totally dependent upon our arms of course now they could go to the Chinese or Russian but they don't want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nOn it and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with and of course that their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians and Chinese or a lined up with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime\nUm they're all ... they they've got a you know a way of doing things uh that uh certainly in the west we're not all excited about 'em but the reality is that um [noise]\nYou know a friend of my ... you know my friend you know what the expression Richard a friend of my enemy is my friend or something like that that the idea\nBeing that we we have to have partners in that part of the world it's a dangerous a game that they are playing we see that evolved\nOver the years in Iraq we see it in Syria [noise] you know even you know vitamin ... and I would just welcome a president of the sea of Egypt up into Moscow for his fourth visit in the last couple of\nYears and you know they made big arms deals and they're talking nuclear power plant in ... a ... these sorts of issues are on the forefront if we banned in the ... now\nI'm you know they will run into the arms of putting putting understands that uh or into the arms of chi into a certain degree that's\nHappening I'm you know we have to recognize and the dark side of the world very bad things happen uh our our own government has been involved over the you

Decatur a destroyer\nA in the grave and reefs in the south China Sea um the Chinese warship came\nOnly a few meters away from it\nAnd just in the last day we've had a couple of B. fifty twos flew over um you know the\nContested area in the south China Sea people need to understand that um these islets uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and here to fence weapons and\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers that they practice from\nThat these are claimed 'em by the Vietnamese a Taiwanese as well as the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nYou know next door to them it's really in the middle of that to see but these confrontations are on the increase we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air is I've indicated and of course they have their neighbors\nTo the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to forward station armored brigades so that they can be prepared and case uh the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we kill a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we call them and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent the Assad regime [noise] uh and of course uh the Russians wipe their hands of that even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any time scenario a it is is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got in to say is ... thirty eight that we're really talking uh the the dog and mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's\nInteresting a friend of mine spoke with a a general now president el Sisi of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that air to one who is the current president\nOf turkey is really a seeks to be the leaf and to establish a ... and his statements have been very very um conducive\nTo that interpretation not only within the region but you know the release of the American pastor Brunson here recently ah was after great pressure we put on him a air do on a to cooperate with us but yet\nWe find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places current cologne Germany what was he doing there yeah he was doing his state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has a and he consistently has had over the years a very ambitious thoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him\nClosely would dispute that some of these are issues Syria is you know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who of course uh even though there are some friction there that they are working together\nAnd of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the pitcher to gather\nYou see the Iranians certainly the Turks are sort of our lives\nThe Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria\nHoping to kind of look their chops and and put together that country wants a declaration of peace can be found

as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to run\nAnd on the coastline there then you can begin to make a plutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what everyone wants to\nAlternately whether it's just too rich so the the the the turkey is buying um air defense system that would be at least under the umbrella

security Donald Rumsfeld military ...\nGroup and his brand new book is called ... and the alliance of evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me to feed me\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that\nUs national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly up pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the INS for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians or suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven ins treaty because they have\nA not only build but practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to ... fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that\nWave tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine or that has um you know not met the um the criteria is violated the criteria now of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we are going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow because it it should concern to solve it\nYou know that has cut back dramatically a nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty\nAre deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world\nThat I Believe has really cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S we're entering a new era right now\nI Want to also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercises with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China\nAs a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to uh jointly headed commission on military technology that is of course being shared\nA significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system and the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off\nThe east coast of Russia straight at\nThe United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against show me a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have the mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the bear\nAnd given their their\nPassion for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation um coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that ... that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our lives but now here we are what are your thoughts\nKnow I think you're correct Richard we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back\nAgainst the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir ...\nAnd you know potent of course have captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\nA nationalism and patriotism in a way that uh uh they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at it because they want to rise again they want to be a great power again\nAnd they suggest very strongly that yes we're representing their interest in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been a Russian Chinese leaders have been meeting here recently in their defense minister is just not for any time over the top\nSorry for the interruption I gotta jump in here will pick this up on the other side alliance of evil lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis serious Jimi Hendrix taking us into the

elections\nUm but uh certainly and jeopardize our dominance in space or satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're shooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're\nWe're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just\nThe military it's economic it's diplomatic ah it's\nAll these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world I knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information\nOr appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and is helping them censor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor their own population\nAnd of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things on the use of the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a part in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I supposed to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that\nA country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates um be the world's leading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and\nUnless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds and billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know you I see the the Internet and what can be used in what can be so there are strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these fronts\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because ah the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is the United states uh to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course the show he\nUm the brutal slaying of of a cause Shelby\nUm and how that might I mean there was there or dominoes at play here obviously I'm Wondering what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump administrative should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his do Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that uh the cars so sugary situation is is tragic\nUh but if you've been watching Mohammed bin psalm psalm and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably a ... been cut down a few notches here recently especially with\nYou know the so called Davos and the the desert which uh he was expecting all these uh donors and investors to come over and pat him on the back and giving more money so we can develop a a true economy that's not based solely upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there a lot of technologies are totally dependent upon our arms that of course now they could go to the Chinese are Russians but they don't want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nA and and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with then of course their their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians in Chinese or a lined up with Iran and were lined up with\nThe Riyadh a regime um there were ... they they've got um you know a way of doing things uh that uh certainly in the west where not all excited about uh but the reality is that um\nYou know a friend of my you know my friend ... what the expression Richard a friend of my enemy is it you know my friend or something like that that\nThe idea being that we we have to have partners in that part of the world it's a dangerous game this\nThe backyard looking great Rob thanks man I

Decatur destroyer\nOr in the grave and reefs in the south China Sea the Chinese warship came only a few meters away from it and just in the last day we've had a couple of be fifty two fed it flew over a you know the\nContested area in the south China Sea people need to understand that um these islets uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and here to fence weapons and\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for the jet fighters and their bombers of the practice from\nThat these are claimed by the Vietnamese Taiwanese as well as the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nYou know next door to them it's really in the middle of a sea but these confrontations are on the increase uh we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air is I've indicated and of course they have their neighbors\nTo the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to Ford station armored brigades so that they can be prepared in case the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine Crimea or of the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we killed uh a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we call them and said or they use your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled him um and that's the nature of mercenaries but there were there to represent a the Assad regime [noise] uh and of course uh the Russians white their hands of out even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any time scenario uh is is is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah\nYou know if you've got into phase ... thirty eight that we're really talking uh [noise] the the ... uh and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president of the sea of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that air to one who is the current president of turkey is really a fix to be the collie and\nTo establish a cow fat and his statements have been\nVery very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but you know the release of uh the American pastor Brunson here recently ah was after great pressure we put on him a aired on a to cooperate with us but yet\nWe find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks\nThough in of all places Kern cologne Germany what was he doing there yeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has a and he consistently has had over the years of very ambitious thoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire\nHe isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that some\nOf these are issues Syria is you know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who of course uh even though there are some friction there that they are working together\nUh and of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the picture together\nYou see the Iranians are certainly the Turks are sort of allies\nThe Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria\nHoping to kind of look their chops and and put together that country wants a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so a lot of players here confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nYou make heir to Washington and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know that's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her want her to one didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to take all those troops to who was up to the Gulf into Kuwait\nUm air the one is not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the F for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the Russians\nAre they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late a they even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the ...\nFrom the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to Iran and on the coastline there then you can begin to make a\nPlutonium and that put you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's where the air to one wants\nTo offer them in like ... it's just too rich so the the the turkey is buying um air defense system that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO ostensibly use to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that yeah because we will not connect our patriots and other fads to a Russian S. four hundred a that's why there's a\nIt's a non ... we just won't do it uh and that is a major um bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks", "year": "2018",
