Mitch Horwitz with us or one of today's most widely known voices of spirituality Mitch has also in award winning historian longtime friend the coast to coast am a coach and Mitch is a very popular voice of audio books as well his latest the miracle club Mitch welcome back\nMuch George great to be here I'll always a pleasure my friend what you've been up to these days\nWell a today is the launch day of the miracle club which is very exciting for me because it's probably the first book I've written that is strictly practical that goes into techniques and methods and it's a big bridge that I've crossed with this book and I'm very grateful to have the chance to talk to the coast family about it\nIt's a great title to by the way the miracle club it sounds like a movie already\n[laughter] you know it was a group of a cult explores here in New York City in the nineteenth century and they were dedicated to exploring everything just like you do\nOn your show and I really wanted to revive the spirit of that original group or their motto was try that that just one more try and that's really been my and form a motto throughout my whole life so I use the term in tribute to them\nHow many members that club\n[laughter] that was probably about five of them they were just a little group outside of Manhattan and Eighteen Seventy five while we're experimenting\nWith finances and medium ship and talking to the dead end table rapping and so on they weren't around for very long but they formed the nucleus of a much larger and more influential group to the esophageal society which is still around today and which is probably responsible for the whole revolution and alternative spirituality\nThat is amazing too because during that era the Eighteen hundreds it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today Mitch yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had the spirit of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things and they were looking at different dark places\nBut they were doing it with defensive just asking themselves what is out there how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism was in the attendance and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about\nGod and spirits any invisible world and these people said listen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science but we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world\nThomas Edison believe it or not was a member of this original group when he talked about wanting to construct a machine that can help people talk of the dead it's not clear whether edits and ultimately did that but he and a major general Adnan Doubleday uh we're both early members\nThat's amazing now tell us a little bit about the book the ... club and and because it's also a practical guide book isn't it\nIt really is you know for many years I've written and I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the occult but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experiment with the ideas and the methods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity\nTo write about the things that I've tried myself I Believe very strongly in the powers of the mind I Believe the thoughts are cause of death I Believe that if you walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental picture that is going to affect what happens to you and you can use that and there are reasons for this\nAnd I wanted to write a book that would give people concrete hands on math is\nWhat do you think a miracle is Mitch\nA miracle very simply put is something that is a radical departure from all natural expectation and currents that breaks away from everything that you could naturally and reasonably expect to arrive\nFrom circumstances and I've experienced miracles in my own mind\nIf the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start reading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off until I was in my forties and that didn't happen by accident there was a mental\nPicturing there was a visualization was an affirmation as well as a lot of\nSweat equity but I Do believe if you can find a miracle as a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nAnd the subtitle of the book which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're very strong believer in that aren't you\nI really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long interval sometimes there is a long gestation period between a fought in the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives\nThey will find an uncanny ... grew in sea between things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nMitch have you found the people who dabble with the dark side tend to do some of ... this similar things that the positive people do but that's something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know we face these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she could be an atheist and they still face ethical questions\nEvery single day about whether they're treating other people fairly and honorably if you take seriously as I Do that our minds have these extra physical capacities that responsibility becomes all the more that responsibility becomes that much stronger my contention is that however we may feel buffet by the\nWinds and currents of life we are much more powerful than we think we are we have a hand in advance\nMentally and and often the shows up in ways that we don't suspect so my messages also be careful be careful because what you're thinking about absolutely has a practical dimension on your life and on the lives of\nOther ... before you came on and he uses that he was in Israel in of course great mental list\nAnd it was telling us the story and how he was commissioned to help the Brits in a soccer match against Scotland and over the stadium they put him in a helicopter in he was supposed to influence\nThe ball and and I guess when the when the Scottish kicker was going to the ball or a mentally moved and the guy missed it or something like\nThat and now here's a story about or he's an old or a family friend and he was over at the house hold up my brother in law I've and when I was Fifteen Years old and I've and expressed all kinds of skepticism and er he said to him\nDo me a favor I've and go into your bedroom and draw a picture and so I have and when his bedroom drew a picture came out and said you drew a house and I was shocked and said that's absolutely what he true\n[laughter] I Know Edgar Mitchell delayed astronaut when he was on our program was talking about a tie class episode yet at NASA tie class in the ... or or type pin\nAnd he lost it and you can find it and he was telling Henri bonded and out of the sky just out of nowhere they heard upping\nAnd it was the tight class that that fell on the ground and came out of nowhere the\nOther part of it the the part that class ... into the the pointed at the end of it yeah was in ... ice cream [laughter] yellow swallowed it I mean it's amazing villa in there for that [laughter] it's amazing but\nBack to these miracles and we take calls next hour I'd like for people to share miracle stories with you Mitch if we can but\nBack to the dark side of it and I don't want to dabble in the dark and too much but you know that'd be too but you know people dabble in the dark side the curse of other people they put ... on other people\nAnd then a lot of cases those things happened to these people yeah how how come than the dark side has that kind of power\n[noise] well it represents something that's in us you know we we we we are being of of of a broad spectrum\nAnd my contention is that thoughts are ... and whether you are using your thoughts through spell or whether you're using your thoughts through a ritual or whether you are projecting thoughts at other people something's going to happen there is going to be some effect\nHowever one of my favorite teachers never God or to grade teacher in the mind our tradition teaches that the only way that you can project\nNegatives spell or thought on to another person is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else\nIf he or she could not get rebounds to use so in a certain sense well we grew up calling the golden rule is protection against evil forces and I want people to listen to that very carefully because we are apt\nTo overlook familiar things we are apt to overlook simple things if you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there was an esoteric and a cult dimensions of the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt they really had to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of Sciences from cyclical research to quantum theory rising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nI think they didn't dominate the play for a long time until Seventeen Seventy six

things we have a habit of overlooking simple things used them there's more depth there than one might expect\nOne or some of the positive mind control methods we should use\nWell one of the things that's most important is writing things down right down your goals and I don't mean on the computer I mean get out and old fashioned pencil and paper and do it because once you do that you've\nActually created a physical manifestation so to speak of the things that you're looking for the actual tactile act of writing something I think not only helps\nPersuade you mentally and in terms of your neural pathways of the goals that you're moving towards but you've actually done something empowering you've done something real if you sit down and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life\nAnd you know these are things you want with all your heart there not diversionary but they are essential life goals\nTake that list put it on to some sort of a laminated card or something that you can carry with you look at it\nMorning noon and night think about it as much as possible and when things on that list come to you and over time they will come to you and they may come to quicker than you think just expressed gratitude and most important of all\nDon't tell anyone what you're doing remain silent because sometimes you share these things with other people and they'll roll their eyes are those say it's nonsense and they knock you off your resolve remain silent make your list carry it with you review it three times a day memorize it and when the results arrive\nExpress things that's a method we can all do it is easy isn't it once you get into it it is\nEasy the the the the the important thing is to do it with consistency\nIs to do it with silence and has to do it with total stark honesty arriving at a definite aim in life or a a a a a small number of things that coalesce around one aim has enormous power and aim is really another way of saying focus and we know that\nWhen you focus the sun's rays with a magnifying glass prism they become enormously powerful what is a laser other than focused light\nNatural laws are consistent your mind is powerful when it is focused which is why I keep emphasizing the idea that you have to really nail down what you want in a very concrete way and be very honest with yourself that's we're focused comes from\nMitch since you've been doing this have you use these techniques for yourselves\nEvery day every single day George\nAnd I must tell you you know I my life has gone in directions that I never could have expected I've done television narrating\nAnd and and and written many books and articles\nIncluding in places that are not known for their a cult enthusiasm I've written about these topics in the Washington Post the wall Street Journal the New York times I never dreamt that was possible and so I feel like I'm an example of the effectiveness of these\nMethods and everything that are offered to the coast family or things that I wrote tested myself I Would never ask somebody to do something that I hadn't experimented with myself\nOr you could tell you love doing what you're doing\nI really do I really do I mean you know ... it's a dream come true and the most literal sense you know Fifteen Years ago this is exactly what I pictured myself doing and exactly what I

know it's interesting when we write down a goal in really demand that we pull something out of us that's authentic and that's kind of magic key to all of this material I Would say that absolute passionate intensity is the one the hidden key behind every health health program with\nSomething won't work without it nothing happens\nNow one of my contention is that we really need to have one absolutely definite chief aim in life and that could be something that we very often resist\nWriting things down can help us with that because if you write down what you really care about over a course of days are over a course of weeks you'll see that it will all tend\nIn one direction and my challenge to the listener\nIs whether you can come up with one overarching goal that facilitates all of the smaller ones what would that be if you can come up with one chief aim you have arrived at mental focus and mental focus is the open sesame so to speak to everything that we've been talking about\n[noise] interesting work Mitch or what's with us and Mitch did you get some professional help when you put this together or did you do this all on euro\nGo all on my own you know this was

I view the miracle club is something that we all belong to all of us who are stripers all of us who are experimenter as we are all automatically in the miracle club and my idea was just to create
