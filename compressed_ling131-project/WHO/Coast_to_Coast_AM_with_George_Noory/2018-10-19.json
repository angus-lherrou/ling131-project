the colors and the\nShapes all very very important Georgia so a case here is you\nKnow I I Can't do the do you remember the Casey story where he was getting on an elevator yes he could see ... and he looked at all these people in the elevator he couldn't see any ... scared the heck ... she didn't go in the elevator and the elevators the cable stamp and the people died\nYeah you gotta love case the my bag [laughter] absolutely George Norris reminder\nAs a psychic where do you get your I'll call it power where'd you get it from\nI don't think it's power I oh God that ... where it really is the trafficking yeah a lot of people say that and I think only God has the ultimate power but the rest of us to an end and I try to help people I've had a radio show four more years and I can remember\nAnd it's actually afraid to call in I'm very happy to a ... and that's why she went and got the power from we all get our energy from it's a life for us we get it from God at the moment we take our first breath until we take out last breath\nSo the energy is after all of us to use and I chose to use to help people\nPeople people listen to this show love animals joys in many of them owned them what happens when that pets that animal passes on\nThat's a great question oh it's all connected to our animals [noise]\nWell you know when my cat died we were so close they came to me that night and he said you know mom I'm fine [laughter] and I don't want you to worry about me\nAnd when I lost my dog he came to me and a little hospital bed the night he died and he was lying on his side he said I I'm okay now I didn't feel well before I passed but I'm okay now I Know it's so crazy they called me mom they really think that mother so\nAnimals and that's your question joy to either go to a dimension of all animals are they usually go with the people they crossed over with they will stay with them on the other side so they're really no cut and dried rules about where animals go\nBut they do have a relief as we all do from pain and misery it's like a it's a wonderful dimension but\nI I don't want people to think that two sides that right you're supposed to go and you're supposed to go and you know so a suicides are all different matter and I think Robin Williams and a lot of people have taught us a lot about suicide\n... birds said\nYes don't do it [laughter]\nNo you'd asked me if I see or is that I don't but I Do feel or as Joyce I Do have that ability to ...\n... is feeling the threat class that had you a sense than your feeling that very intuitive so you can feel oppressed and it's like when you're with in there or field is that what you mean George\nYes oh yes I Am ...\nSo if you're with the press and is not that good to step away from them you would pull back right\nYeah absolutely now there are some people who when I called psychic or\nVampires are but they're not necessarily bad people they just have the ability to dream people's energy I tried to work with those people by the way I Try to help them and I've had some stories where they've changed and people began to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but\nI get a kick out

what happened\nWell first of all my mother took me from Melbourne, Australia where we are living to west straight at to see her on the ... and the psychic medium of no mean caliber\nAnd she looked in the ... the old fashioned when she saw that she didn't tell us she went out room came back white face well she was right that when ... when my father had being transferred to the straight an army officer\nI got pneumonia and I died in hospital the doctor told my parents that I had died as pronounced clinically dead and then they look to get and they said oh you boy died and he came back so that\nIs one of the experiences of my life involving the stuff that goes into the new books I must tell you George I don't remember anything not sure what happened when I was out of my body age three members rather hard living under the after ... what happened afterwards when I was eight nine\n... died again pronounced dead again on the ... and the conditions and this is an appendectomy in an operating room and that time I remember what happened it sounds like the classic empty to begin with up onto the field of looking at that and the ... of the scalpel in the ... not\nMoney to be around going down down the beach down to loosen up talk a fountain pocket Melbourne, Australia big moon faces the gate wanted to do with an old marine nine year old kid would want to do go on the ride go some addresses\nSo I guarantee Luna Park age nine in my astrobiology and I'm drawn into I didn't know that goes straight maybe I'm drawn into another world and where I'm deceived by very beautiful very very lovely people and they raised me is that right and I forget that I've got a buddy in hospital bed back\nEventually opt as seeming to live a whole life of Ninety years old so and I'm shocked\nTo find myself in the body as a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my lifelong understanding\nThat there will be on the physical you know nine years old who you talk about this she tried to talk it out that the medication you're hallucinating or something\nLike this person who could explain to me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition is that oh yeah we do that we get sick really sick we got to live with the spirits and then we come back and sometimes with the same and sometimes we're not so the gift of these experiences which rings my co dissociation\nWas in the buildup to eat the travel beyond the body traveling consciousness without psychedelic drugs quite easily and an understanding is there a world beyond the physical and they are accessible\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell on the phone not alone in a little boy you know I was sick I on my father's in the army so moving all the time army brat situation I'll tell you one of the things that kept me going is it amongst mind visible companions a phrase probably most of us remember of childhood was a big man and a lot of white hair and upping face\nBecoming sit on my that is the backup Robin you know you're going to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know goals and they'll like you and one day all day you can't kill your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older rub it younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self help him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe had time travel in our dreams and when we developed the out of conscious or active treated me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to youngest self and be cheerleaders counselor to them in their own time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a why it's a self who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we've gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities a dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into\nOther will we traveled a parallel worlds for example but we're leading parallel lives this isn't\nAs weird as some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis that you and I live in right now it was a medic parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from what we're living right now on may be radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams and then in conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding so low consciousness survive physical death so this is a pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dream travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as little bubble up from the U.S no subconscious not sold them going on this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who've come coding those people to come calling my enclosed glued but loving family members around says to the spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get up get beyond the body in the brain we get into that whole field of non local mind that science tells us about to get in contact information field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the Audrey I'd also part of this is that we are definitely time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams are wild and write them down will notice that they dream of events before they happen one function of time travel we see the possible future\nWe can reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead but we also traveled into the past from this my mother lives you learned about our connections with drama is playing out now the reality is now the time periods in the multi dimensional universe so this is the key to dust and understanding\nOf what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the power of direct experience as poppa dreamed travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from mine experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who work with me and they're giving me permission to use the story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers them but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually be on the old and remind this is one of the reasons why\nMost human kill human couches across history a valued dreams and dream of St believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or got us if you like\nBut you can talk to nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest sold so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our times is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams can be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions in attitudes from Baton on more objective perspective then we can manage for our cells in indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing\nAnd probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities unquote dreamed takers\nAnd which takes a look at what it might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience have lost the sense of a deep up to the sin of that by the gun to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully alive human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning now Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding fun to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we were a member of something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things lacking in our society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple false step process the sharing a dream of a story that makes it fun you can get it done ... minutes you get some help with the fact that your guide to towards action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our genes I mean bad habits apart from that is out of the ... the rushed out of sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get the job of deal with the family we think that we should lie in the in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between ... states have consciousness between sleep and wake that's a good time to catch a good time to embark on loosened dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that cut those\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't\nWant to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so he'd slam the door and say no more dreams sometimes this is

I was in a graveyard this week and I look at him\nYeah I was in a grave yet I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk and I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a headstone is her name\nFull name and there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it's her but I call\nShe's never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to a head start he says what do you think of that I said it's a great story it's a very great story I mean that introduces hope things about you know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my coat and to sudden\nGoal is to a certain place might even be an age of ... but\nAs I'm telling us it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on a day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a new story today I'm given one delivers the story immediately just like that and ... that these examples proliferate so ...\nYou know what it how it works is that the the attitude of the energy you're carrying again to have results your attitude travels ahead of you in life shaping what his waking ... waiting fuel round the next corner which\nIs a very good reason every tuning in life to pause and check your attitude check what is playing when you're in a soundtrack check what you're saying to you so drop the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs and be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know we need the brain to dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think about is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the ... mind to match up into we at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us that the hot a matter of reality is a dense conscious so\n... there's no hope of separating mind and that are there always play together but when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we\nHave to remember the party has its own messages his discoveries that the phenomena but used to be called pre sentiment which I experienced a lot maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know things\nThat are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize what is\nGoing on the body reacts\nTo something ahead of time for example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled surprisingly high and there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to do uh get get some blood for a blood analysis hits the gusher in my blood is boating and it's\nAll I knew lived in pants and after\nThat I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen gamble the white queen screams\nBefore she pricked her finger so she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to it in the Ford took place and the doctor says my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment or anticipating symptoms be says but I couldn't possibly report if people think I was looted you well you know I said so I think the ... we know in our body all sorts of things we know things we know what the bleep we don't know that\nWe know enough about it in all of a sudden medic response was we pick up things from a distance from other people we feel with the feeling in our body as well so that's about the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nWell active dreaming is way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again to remember your dreams are going to share them the right way to you're going to take action that will empower your life and bring some healing energy and guide in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also method of looser dreaming you'd call it shut medical use of dreaming we ... my favorite way of talking on the loose and dream adventure\nIs to start out lucid in state loose it what does that need it means that we use shut many drumming in the workshops\nAnd we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay the romance an adventure still in the stream let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff going on\nBy going back inside the dream and facing the scary based on its own ground it might mean\nI Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Merrill someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic looser dreamy another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that risky try like state\nTo eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psychic an intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like I tend to the images of rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the scenes will come to you the pool to loosen dreaming and finally\nActive dreaming of the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open we ... how to look at the ... the outlook for signs and symbols in the world around you so this is also a program and the method of attending to the dream like symbols of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think that dreams themselves misleading I think that a spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminded to interpret according to the wrong standards I think I don't think the dreams and themselves as a deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems with the floating around that we don't walk around we can pick up things from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to us that is truly our own\nCan be worked in the service of health and healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible beast but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront the issue on its own ground you might find that behind something that's scaring worrying you and\nYour dream is a power power of understanding of how that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not deceptive but a rush to interpret according to a narrow understanding what dreams is about can be very misleading\nYou got to Robert we are going to take a quick
