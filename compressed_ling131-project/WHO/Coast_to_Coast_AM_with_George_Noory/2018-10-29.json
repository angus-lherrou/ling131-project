H. O. five I heart radio\nGetting news radio ten forty W H in my heart reading for some\nGreat stories in the book the monsters monster book I'm at at some of them like lizard man I remember reporting blizzard band as a as a newscaster back when those stories were unfolding and seemed like every couple of days or be a new citing or a a new angle on it\nAnd it was kind of fun it was like an oddity almost like a circus ... kind of a a story or something that couldn't somebody in a costume or\nA ... an oddity like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose bumps such as story you tell them this book about something called the winged man it's a story from staffordshire England in two thousand nine you remember the details\nIronically that was at a place called the kind of chasing central England only about five miles from where I grew up\nArea very well and it's a it's a large area of a woodland far Iceland\nAnd I'm like certain places around the world that seem to be to the hot spots for power normal phenomena the kind of chase he's just the same you know they become known as window areas where it seems everything in each brother come through you know at various times\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local newspaper the chase post and somebody had same this um\nWhat looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or if soaring would be a better term to use over the woods a at a high speed um you know kind of a\nLike a flying mine I'm not unlike I guess the you know the stories coming out of ...\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of ... in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of them even spoke to the local police or the I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have this spate of weird activity in this area which is already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough light the dog mine and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nWhat's healthy we probably don't have on says I'll tell them\nYou know they said that she's a ... or ... or or possibility um [noise]\nYou know I'm not going to tell people the big four days some strange creature that come from the far side of\nThe moon but you know [laughter] I don't believe that date by the way [laughter] but um\nYou know for someone to specifically states something along those lines is is not the way to go you know\nYeah there's a story in the monster book about something you go that's called that squash and you share that with us\nWell yeah the the the ... is he's a really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees the more than anything else is something that's\nSort of pops up is not seen again I'm just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people who like want to know was that\nAnd then he's never seen again but um this particular case is an interesting one um it ... and I pulled Nineteen sixty four in Buckley, Washington and I'm actually quite close to my room there on the witness in mind I'm young man named Brian Khan failed um\nHe saw these strange creatures while he was driving along the road and it was sort of humanoid with this huge wings but it was kind of Harry as well [noise] scares me and had the shining a yellow eyes\nBut they sort of the ... the hair angle combined with the large wings um you know the the the Harry body and the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he kind of looks a bit like ... ...\nAnd um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four and it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these you know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I've talked about that before a that might be a ... year than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we've we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I've got to be honest with you in Georgia I'm doing five books now on on this phenomena foreign to men in black and one of the women in black\nAnd I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI and I say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies I typically are described as looking ... you know go on and the skins live\n... white white um um people talk about how vaccines have this ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them before they even talked about when they're in close proximity to them that they fall and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women in black of turned up in homes right after paper being using wage of bullets which puts another angle to its\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe the ... the ... street it's fall be on you know just guys in black suits walk\nAnd I guess I'm you know\nI'm asking it into context ... with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the use animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans and helicopters that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seem like they are humans that are\nCarrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we are going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wells but we're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans uh pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird\nAnd they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or rather investigators\nWell yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about the ... nations you know you've got a really weird lungs and exploit couple and then some which are easier perhaps to explain there is a power line with demanding black where there's no doubt that in some cases I think the\nGovernment agencies are responsible for their might be but I think it's a very small cats agree versus the the January unexplained ones and the way the ones\nWhat I think is happening on a few occasions\nAnd there's some evidence to support it\nOver the years agencies my actually I Am legend of the men in black as a main cover their tracks in other words it maybe I Would think of him anyway but I don't know what they do\nFrom using\nAs a main quiet you know one of them so the government you know the men in black and I don't think they do\nThat sort of lead us into where we're heading in the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction files what the government doesn't want you to know that ...\nBook uh whether or not you believe alien abductions are real the files on alien abductions are real when I tell ya what might be going on there based on some of the or real life but documents that Nick squeezed out of the U.S in the u._k.

know I think that's what I mean I'm fortunate things for future generations are going to be helping normal thing for probably accept it as well\nYou know you mentioned in in in the book about the idea of the fear that people used to have that maybe the government's going to talk us into getting a computer chip stuck on to our skin and then the\nFollow it and they don't want to be for all the good reasons you know for health and wellbeing and all kinds of ways been in effect they would be able to monitor everything we do everything about us we already have a surveillance devices like that we all carry them or their cell phones yeah\nUm but the idea that our government the u._k. government other governments around the world would what time and resources into Italy investigation of these phenomena UFOs things that's or healing abductions would monitor intimidate\nFollow a alien abductees whether or not the government understands what would you in abductions are all about that idea with deeper posture is not too many but you make the case in this book that it's real and ongoing right\nYes I mean the reason why I wrote the book which actually the official publication diet is the first to November but people can already got it\nBut um the the reason I wrote top secret I mean abduction falls is because over the years I've collected a number of official documents on abductions which would be declassified through the fate of the nation acts in the ... um the u._s. and finally I was in a position where\nI could actually sort of put the book together and you know provide the rate that we've yes it's another book on Eileen abductions but instead of going just overall ground you know\nWhy not present paper with the guy to showing how falls would be put together now I start the book actually with the contact a movement\nOf the Nineteen fifties which preceded they abduction phenomenon by just over about ten years or so and the reason I did that was to demonstrate to people from the would go so to speak but um\nAgencies do ah put together falls on paper who claimed to have had in Kansas for example just about all of the ... of the Nineteen fifties like Georgia ... George finds hassle true and bathroom ...\nAll of them how to FBI falls out putting on them one of the mind raise in Spain was because they claimed when I'm interviewed by the FBI but yes like ... there and say Israel eons\nBut they told the FBI that they the Iranians had a government or governments very different two hours and bordering on communism and I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example George Hans hassles FBI file 'em is\nExtremely extensively about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages I'm ... was about four to and so on\nSo you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape people now in the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one a with a bacterium Bonnie hill case which is I guess he's a defining moments you follow gee when it wasn't the first abduction case on record but he was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn full of wrote his book on the case they interrupted journey\nNow in the story of basketball and a hill that coming back from a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky\nAnd then things kind of get waited a they don't fail writes the you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd I get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board the strange craft would they be strange creatures\nAnd being subjected to a stranger and intrusive\nExperiments now what's particularly intriguing\nIs that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around among Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning about to I Am an essay was driving these vehicles to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nAnd they should they should become known as the the vehicle interference phenomena within you follow Jake what's intriguing\nIs that they they ah British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused coal they promised them security services are sort of like the\nThe James Bond if you like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the file it talks about how the they ... they promised them security services interviewed Ronald Wildman of ... to with a with a ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him\nAnd the most challenging and intriguing aspect\nIs that he told the police so this is a direct quotes that he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that's sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction low in today's world but Ronald ... in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO come down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to ... strange checked his watch and there was something about ... it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together that\nHas the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject and thinking\nSort of amusement well there there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys telling these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realize that the government is really does followed them around it takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts and men or that the CIA scientists study the UFO topic and they include the UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting UFOs might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion\nIs that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those books\nOh yeah because I mean George ... is a first book flying saucers have landed published in the early fifties that that sold in huge figures of gigantic numbers of books with salt\nUm and I have a ... went on the lecture circuits are all around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a communist type\nOf governments that communism was the way of the future and the FBI open that file on a damn skate um\nPredominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with ...\nI think what he's sixteen with a very big surprise\nVoted coming November ... mid term elections is certain to be the defining\nRational elections midterm chiefs historic\nThe thing is at stake chop down all the time for

I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this issue you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're gonna catch grief for doing it\n[laughter] it gives me um [noise] no it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it it's um you know a lot of people and\nCultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or you know we do we do get a pass to study really cool fantastic things right um people's um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences\nExperiences whatever whatever you want to call them so yeah it is kind of the privilege to be could be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of follow my interests and that's really ... how this book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that looked at sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality but as you know this on the move here in New directions by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how are these sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to um have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about your death experiences and and the parents and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how a belief in church um a formal religion organized religion is sort of\n... around the western world but interest in spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remain strong or you may increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is\nYou know people still in America seem to have a lot of I guess would be called spiritual beliefs they are pretty high numbers in America\nUm believe in and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation in traditional religious congregations are silly Asian and traditional really with traditional religious congregations those things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about this how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very real sense of relief and other world um and spirituality and the options are really in the absence of\nParticipation and traditional congregation so I tried to think about and\nTrying to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and and the fence and interested in ... book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and\nI think uh you know concepts like dark matter\nThat are dark energy or even thinking about infinity or or thinking about the the multi versus thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves embrace with ... with a sense of odd mystery and I wonder\nI think about those concepts are sort of uh the seed bed for for a new spiritual infections and I and that's and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard times too late normally George it's too late [laughter]\nYeah a pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other reality um you know time slips things of that sort of that you you'd sort of reached out to look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kind of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given day or a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it it hurts to even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kinds of concepts are so commonly held so um that that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nUm I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the in the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question of well what what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say worried about that for\nThem for the listeners tonight yes you know I'm going to\nAnother demand the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's length with and height\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth of mentioned um send Feinstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world and on science I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talk about an additional spatial dimension [noise] a a direction and space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line of a one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you then draw flat square on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions that has links and with and then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object\nHas three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else\nAnd the the something else as the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really on the nineteenth century mathematicians raise this possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact just skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nGet a grand in your hand you could try trick or treating\nYou yeah that's right and the ... economy ever your stash can catch a

Christopher\nWhite a Christopher I at one of the great things about the book is is how you\nTell the story about other worlds and our our modern perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it you tell the story of people who've struggled with getting their own heads around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific use came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story yeah\nYeah yeah yeah he and his wife is quite a story um but you're right they're they're ... and there's many others in the book sort of struggle with the um you know sort of like out of it being raised religious in a scientific time and feeling that they can no longer an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace\nThe religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and his ... am\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension that has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual low level or worlds to reality I Am headed into an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he\nHe falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make it right and the situation is he he embraces map Madison geometry as a kind of a he kind of hangs onto that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty onto him\nDreaming consciousness has a kind of a freedom\nThat um that our our regular everyday consciousness doesn't have any and he uses a lot of\nScientific ideas that we can talk about if you want to how he does it but he has a has a set of scientific ideas that he that he uses to think about how this might be possible how could the dreaming self be able to have these powers and be able to lift itself off of our timeline and see\nSee I'm into the future and he writes these ideas up in a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know I sometimes I give talks about this and different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually the people in dreams seem to get one of things that than ... than a than happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not\nSleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job where they see out to be in some other reality and then they come back and this one of the audio ... what's the how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of the experiences as well so in that chapter six I'm\nNot a little bit in the chapter on C. S. Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's a famous writer of wrinkle in time\nJust recently a movie made a fact of that book but she talks about time with 'em and and time travel um and so on and some of her books [noise] so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my president could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what climate is which is really counter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein\nPeople thought about time as just linear or something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense of time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know I find had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that of the ways that we experience time is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of her own consciousness that\nEinstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe that could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe I'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through passing through that that block rye or we occupy a little portion of that block but every moment in our path and in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son future [noise]\nAnd and all of our defending future's all of those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the the laws of physics [noise] um and and this is actually discussions Scott defending wants to look at it it's just after my book but you can also look at Brian Greene book he's a professor of physics at Columbia\nHe wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and I was only laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies tackle all the time\nYeah you're right you're right it it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith and destiny and human free will and how freer to make choices um and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow lift itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should say four dimensional world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension\nDreaming stuff he said and lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moment and Don believe that um you know using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space philosophers there I'm that's what he believed was happening some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and if we can talk about that as a as additional spatial dimension or we could talk about that is\nNow maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and and he he thought everybody everybody's sleeping so had this degree of freedom and he also believe that everyone if they haven't kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and when they fall he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believes that if everyone did they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and pass it on I'm sort of mixed up together well\nI guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences\nTo talk about the science is a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we have discussed on this program before might fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions by Christopher white or we're going to take

this in the example of what land where this uh summer hire dimension being reaches down and grabbed somebody from to the world pulled them up\nUm could someone from sixty or Seventy or Seventy reached down and grab us and pull it up so we can understand the true nature of reality what do you think\nOh sure I mean I think that you know it depends on how you think about those dimensions and what's in them but\nI mean you certainly have had you know religious and spiritual people over the last hundred years say things just like that right I mean in fact you've had\nPeople um even even cs Lewis talk about you know God in Christ as higher dimensional um and as beans that calmed down and insert themselves\nInto our lower dimensional world just like the sphere did that in in a an Abbott spoke at flat land so yes people have definitely thought\nAbout um\nWhat we say thought about visitors from from higher realms are for spiritual beings are angels or whatever I'm as higher dimensional um and as I was kind of these higher dimensional objects that than ... entire world\nThat sounds perilously close to saying that science and religion could coexist that uh you know that the heroin normal bleeps good coexist with a scientific scientifically acceptable version of reality\nYeah yeah I think so I mean in my book I Try to put you know a number of different people in the story so I have\nPeople who have let's say these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experience like a near death experience um and then I have them talking about their experience and then I also have scientists in the book as well and some skeptics I have different voices in the book I'm\nTalking about what the meaning of these events are ... and you know there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret\nWhat's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is is are these people who have these kinds of uncanny experiences are remarkable experiences\nMoments of insider and tuition or near death experiences are out of body experiences um and so on and and that they are ... than using scientific concepts to to understand what what could be happening and I think that you know figures in my book like like all of us today I mean I think that\nWe all want to use science you know I think we I think science is for the authoritative\nI'm set of discourse is that we used to talk about talk about reality so I think\nI think that's what they're doing I think you know just like jaded up you've done right who have these dreams that seem to predict the future where did he go you know he didn't he didn't actually go to the Bible at that point to figure it out he went to Einstein you know he went to\nHe went to sort of popular science book um and I think that you know that's one point I Try to make in the book that I think a lot of us are sort of inspired by\nA man interested and fantastic scientific concept um\nWell I mean humans humans have been trying to reach a other higher dimensions rather realities for a long time prayer would be an example we're reaching out to some invisible world there I'm absolutely yeah I Know a remote viewing\nYeah yeah yeah there's there's all kinds of things that would fit into that you're right some people have been trying to to reach the transcendent uh ever since there have been humans\nOn earth right I'm reaching for something else reaching beyond\nOur own subjectivity um and we talked about dreams earlier I think\nA through dreams and you know in the sixties and other times you know Americans use psychedelic drugs to open up a what they believe it was like a doorway of consciousness into\nAnother realm and in other cultures you might use other plants or substances are losing the chance to to reach a transcendent but prayer meditation absolutely they're all different all different different methods\nAre so I'm Wondering if the example of remote viewing where people project your consciousness over space and time seemingly independent of space and time to access information that they shouldn't be able to get that that doesn't that make sense because of the idea of other worlds higher dimensions\nWell um let's see I think I think people have certainly talked about remote viewing and other a ...\n... ... has higher dimensional because uh you know maybe we can go back to Abbott's book flat land for a minute because\nYou know flat line what happens is you know you can imagine a two dimensional world of characters of very flat right sliding around the surface of your desk they don't they know a length and wet but they don't know that third direction or dimension which is\nWhich is up or down so when you're if you're a figure in in flatland and let's say you're just a flat square and you're sliding around on the surface of your flat world and let's say you look out um you know you look around and and what do you see well\nIf you're a flat square sliding around on a flat world you you actually don't see her whole world you just see a line right let's say a friend comes toward you and he's a triangle\nAnd he's fighting towards your what do you see what you just see a line on every everyone and flat land can just see a one dimensional line but what happens when the flat square gets pulled off of his two dimensional world\nUp into a higher space a three dimensional space and the story is suddenly he can see the full dimension ... of his flat world so he looks\nHe looks and he sees flat land before him all laid out and he can suddenly\nHe suddenly has powers of vision that he never had right he can look down at flat land we can see for the first time not just lines that he can see\nA People's homes he can see into their homes right 'cause he's looking down on the whole flat world so you can see he can see all of his friends whether they're triangles or squares or lines\nHe can see all of their dimensions he can see even inside right say let's say he has a friend who's a triangle\n'em all he saw before was their line coming towards them but now he can see the whole triangle he could even see inside the trial you can see inside homes so I raise this as an example because\nSome people have uses say aha you know um well if we were raised somehow in consciousness up into a higher spatial dimensions maybe we could look back on our three dimensional world and have amazing power as a vision\nSo um you know maybe we are just like the square right when raised to hire dimension we would look back on our world and what we see we would see all sides of everything at once you could look\nDown on your home for instance and see all the rooms laid out you know you could see the insides of everyone's bodies you could see the outside that are one's body you can see the top of the house and the bottom of the house um\nSo you would have a kind of a higher dimensional vision um and so people do indeed use these ideas to talk about things like remote viewing right um or or they use these ideas actually to talk about near death experiences because sometimes people have near death experiences they talk about\nHaving this kind of um having this kind of special vision where they can see things I never saw before [noise]\nSo so yeah and so maybe remote viewing is a a you know is a higher dimensional phenomena but I don't know you know I'm certainly\nPeople have talked about it I'm that way and I in my book and especially in the later chapters and an epilogue um is where I talk about sort of near near death experiences and some parents Paris psychological phenomena like like feeling\nYeah Raymond Moody is somebody I've met in a ... interview and it's just you know he's a
