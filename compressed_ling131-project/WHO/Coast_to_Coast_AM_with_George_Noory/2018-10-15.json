counting undergrad American thanks for listening and I didn't I was always a kick to have on the president and\nThe share his thoughts with you and uh I understand is going to happen a more frequently you over the year twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty which I could not encourage it imagine this country imagine some of the fallout and what about three weeks three weeks in a day or two if the Democrats take the Senate\nOne consequence of that will be there will not be any federal judge has confirmed\nBy the U.S Senate over the next two years and won't happen\nAnd then if Trump is reelected and twenty twenty what'd you this point appears to be likely and the Senate stays democratic and twenty twenty and then when I come from any federal judges for the next two years or for the next two years after that\nSo we're looking at possibly a six year timeframe if the Democrats take the Senate when there are no federal judges confirmed by the state Senate under Chuck Schumer think about that and the impact that would have on your life in my life\nBecause CNN and the Democratic party and NBC ABC and CBS listening Leslie stall on sixty minutes few hours ago there in a complete meltdown over the possibility that Trump could be reelected they're doing polling already encouraging Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders to run\nAnd I can down in twenty sixteen\nThe only Democrat that Trump could have beaten was Hillary Clinton every other one probably would have beaten the president and America would not be right now\nMourning in America revitalization a brand new American economy three point seven percent unemployment rate crack down on the southern border we're new ... new trade deals with Canada and South Korea and Mexico the president just talked about with you and I\nWe wouldn't have any of that stuff going on and so that's why three weeks in a day for now is so important especially if you live in\nUh Ohio if you live in a if you live in Missouri if you live in North Dakota if you live in Florida if you live in Texas there's ... there's a few critical races\nThat will determine whether or not the Democratic party will investigate or whether the Republican Party will legislate\nJust think about two to six years\nHaving no federal judge has confirmed anywhere\nIf the Democratic party takes the U.S Senate they will shut down completely they will not work with this president to get anything done including criminal justice reform reforming marijuana laws whatever it might be the president is on the precipice\nAnd twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty of doing some great stuff and I do not believe I Do not believe that Democrats are necessarily going to take the house I Do not believe that the polling was so wrong and twenty sixteen it was a joke\nAnd so if the house in the Senate stay in Republican hands good stuff this is just the beginning on the other hand a wise man told me in Washington that the first two years of the Trump presidency will be peaceful\nCompared to the next two years if the Democrats take the house and or the Senate that what we're going through the past two years to fight cholesterol and scream to move this country forward\nWill stop completely and there'll be investigation upon investigation and no legislation it'll be think Trump at all costs seeing the ss trunk and you know and I know\nAnd so if you're in one of those contested congressional districts whether it's California Texas Florida Ohio Colorado North Dakota wherever it is go out and vote Republican to keep the house in the hands\nOf ah the successor of Paul Ryan whoever it might be and especially if you're one of those five or six states that have a Senate race that is so competitive\n... like in Nevada or Arizona or North Dakota or Missouri even in Michigan Ohio Florida you've got to go out and vote imagine the world with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer completely in charge of the house in the Senate because at that point zero zilch NATO will get done\nCNN and et cetera is then to destroy Kanye West mode because the most loyal voters in America are black voters for the Democratic party and when African Americans figure out

tweeted is there a second ... thinks well there's two things his there\nLike on my news website over a coast to coast to I'm going to take history there there are a list of papers on the right hand side the current neighbor is the one that is on the top\nNow with your uh analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical\nBut the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an elegant which is is that some of the layers have a different thickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view\nYou start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and um ah the review or a who was it was very well known or ... or drop here who don't we reviewed my paper or he calls the waves and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by fitness petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total hide\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get dinner bought\nEvery once in a while there is a jump so uh you have a much thicker course and then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend\nAnd then you have another sudden jump in sickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's ... peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri\nNoted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base\nSome of these peaks have rounds fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty two or three ... so you found that there are round fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and\nThat was it uh it was not for the interpreted what does it mean a it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and in the forty two story great German how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and\nAh originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have\nTo have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the pyramid was not completed\nThere was a they say that was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top\nAnd the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know the one of the the most prominent researchers proposes is Robert ... father John Paul will fall and the papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall a\nAcademia a page and it's also in cosmic womb uh his brother vote to attend these he's in the back of the book where he explains\nThe theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and now of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred and ten courses\nNow we have is there a consistency to the ah repeating the ticker layers\nUm\nDoes it every ten steps that every ... there's some kind of ... you\nI that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately I unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of you know Jimmy it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck by when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nOr because you know you were you could just you know simple in mind that I thought each step they were just a applied the ah the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian the Egyptians designed their appearance with uh something called they called the set that which is the purely angle\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward and ...\nOh the step shores pyramid angle so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up their case each step is the same and and it's not and and uh and all of a sudden you know just steps gets much thicker\nAnd chew question again there's regularity even to the thickness so when you know it's it's completely positive but of course you know I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces\nAnd we'll get to that or after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are a\nCouple of dozen that earth decker\nThat the orientation for the pyramid that it's still ended up at the right angle on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors well that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension\nWhich which to me I wanted to correct something I said in the shape to block interview I think I said that uh the one to ... I'm sure a shock to in fact we\nPublished that al ... was disappearing or during the twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it wasn't a case in the paper it was a star\nSo it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country and because of that because that constellation ... it was so important to chip shows that the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the ...\nAnd ... why the pyramid ended up in the in the north south orientation\nI got to jump in right there the ... coast to coast and we've got to take a break my new this is ... church we'll be right back stay with us\n[noise] good\nDaily Show updates right to your inbox for free was the ... letters signed up to the ... stadium dot com [noise]\n\n\n\n\nWhat can I can Egypt [noise]\n... on the next episode of this ride global pod cast with Arianna Huffington she discusses our beliefs are influenced by the power of storytelling\nThe effects of the administration of carnival or on clinical signs and cats\nAfter the peak challenged with feline herpes virus why the vet spearheading this study we're laying a contrarian Stevie em\nAnd Michael lap and TV M.

to coast am\nAnd go to the right side scroll down there's a list of published papers right there we're talking about the top one now my new I Want to jump ahead and let everybody know in that PDF\nIf they scroll down to page three twenty six ... three hundred ... a a scrawled on the page three twenty six where you have an illustration there\nOf the layers ... with a cut away showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber and acquaintance chamber the descending passage way and the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery\nAnd so working from the bottom the first layer up a which we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty four\nOf these must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this but these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing that you're right I'm I'm I'm a listing all the ... you know the total number of peaks was twenty three some of these peaks a worst civically noted by ti tree\nTo have surfaced ratios that were round number fractious of twenty fifth so you know six twenty five twenty\nAnd a and those also this that and it turns out that those courses that are associated with these round fractious to run over ceilings that's of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have\nIt seems to be a coronation uh thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber\nAnd based on this this observation\nThat there is seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know those courses that have a surface area that is around ... number fraction of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid where we don't know of any spaces and work but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that there must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at least six if not ten\nNow we're going to get to that ... ... exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away yes you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right but then you have to have some basis for this and clearly\nWe have a I I'm just looking at one two three four five six seven eight absolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example of course not a Twenty one which is a it it that does which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth or Nineteen twenty fifth that aligns with the uh the uh you know the ... ones that are that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the V.\nOr so it is in other words if a soldier with a feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course number thirty four also it has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and\nIt runs right over the ceiling of the queen chamber or then the other courses don't don't have round fracture the twenty fifth and they're not associated with feelings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nOr and that goes across the ceiling of the um off the ground at tower\nI'm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and then twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of relieving chambers in fact that the tower\nUm and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which I marked any or um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted tower but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be will eighty four\nNo role eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly I\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be a you know within the resolution of this scanned that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the ... the big boys\nI got it yes of\nCourse we don't know exactly which is it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know painted that into this illustrations just to give a rough guy\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier\nThat is a pretty important and this is from ...\nYeah and and he says does ah does my new see any connection between a dynastic Egypt she didn't use of the lion\nAnd the use of the lion at go back ... happy and everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things throughout dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shark we are um we're trying but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd we constantly land at ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course uh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the\nUh cataclysmic event the end of the ice age the construction of go Beckley tabby the erosion on the banks all of these things and Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC yet which makes go ... not an accident\nNo within references of course with lines to as low extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely that it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak with authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a question\nLet's go to a I'm going to get to the top half of the

Thomas Say Hi to Manu\nThank you for taking my call Manu ... search you know my question as we have the supply tomorrow and the paramount banks have there been any intention to reconstruct\nThe original pouring a subplot to do and I know that sounds radical but for example the great pyramid is missing the capstone and it just seems to me that\nYou could bring in architects archaeologist perhaps what specialties sub\nRemote viewing and to an intuition and actually reconstruct the temples repair the temples have spent a scarf St\n... yes and as as a great question I'm so there's two answers to that the first one is that uh the minister of antiquities is trying to partially restored a monument so you get a feel for what it may have looked 'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern\nBe construction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do affection\nAnd then they leave the rest on touched\nSo that's the first part of your question but there is something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a a Harvard uh it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this is on the direction of Peter\nOr my new alien um they are basically recreating he's a a a ... in the in the virtual world and I predict\nA few years you'll be able to uh descend into a virtual world and it will be exactly like the way it looked or the the way we think it looked and you'd be able to go into all the chamber's look at the inscriptions and it'll feel like you know uh the real thing and they're working on it\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid where did you come up with the number six or eight\nWhite so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform\nTo this uh you know just a simple rule that the surface area is around fraction of twenty fifth\nAnd so and I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just waste I'm you know energy to create these sticker courses unless there is a purpose for it so for every single of course that has a round fraction of twenty fifth I think there is a space associated with that\nMore and more phone call before the break let's go to let's go out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're next on coast\nHi um I had a quick question about the\nUh selling he'll watch uh I've heard him many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years and yes apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or or to the pyramids in for research and just general public access\nAnd I had heard that after the um spring Arab Spring uprising or he resigned\nWhat is access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better access for research in the general public and I'll take my answer off the air\nGreat question Daniel my new what's it like there now with ... regarding\nTalked about so first of all I have a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous as just the questions and so I've had good experiences with him I've never met in person and he probably doesn't know why I'm\nI'm regarding getting a permit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study of Robert Robert shock and I are um and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed messages so on the one hand it's also like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that the ah they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they won research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and stuff and you can do about it other than you just try it and see what they do\nWell do you think that the the ... one research would be ongoing like it is it ... yeah how was she was still the director there\nHe I think he is actually involved a Jimmy he's on the he sits on the on the uh the board of directors that reviews the data so he is involved or at least not maybe not publicly but behind the scenes he's involved they asking for is at by a is input\nUm you know I think there's sort of mixed\nBack here you know there is the public's eye of us who you know comes on TV and gives announcements and then probably there's the the scientists the archaeologist who loves what he does um you know it's difficult to kind of saw it all out but\nI think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to be searched and I to be honest with you I understand it and you know some of the projects that ah you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monument so I'm\nWell you're being you're being safe and political right now and I understand that might do it and I respect that yeah but there's the other part of this where we have been told for so long that there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved from that stance and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction that's why are they gonna have to open right now are they going to have to back pedal\nYeah so it to the to the listeners question I think I forgot that goes down you I think right yes\nUm yeah so I think what you you said two thousand eleven so I think that has something has changed or they're sort of a you know people are even Egypt causes that talked to some of some of the scholars there the local scholars\nThey feel like you know they have more of a voice that can you know a say or they can research and I think it's been I think it's been good for the country and I think it's\nGood let me jump in right there I knew I going to take a quick network break this is

Monique right here in someone right up the street Monique welcome\nAnd some other features that the basic features that we know about the great pyramid you can find them in the ... in the dimensions of the ... of him you know and you know we don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website\nGo check it out and tell me what you think but I think the answer the question is yes I think this is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website\nAnd one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino and do you know says are there any other pyramids in central and South America that carried the same traits as the ...\nTraits meaning that's just what it says in the winter we don't know yeah um\nI I assume there would be a couple of things that do you knows referencing here one would be size in orientation or to true north in may be uh something astrological ah within the alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched a documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain it\nIf that is true that would definitely they suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nOr has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it well\nLet me help you with this idea\nWhen we look at the the tops of the the the pyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala and Honduras\n'em and believes that the tops of these pyramids there's always something there what about the top of the great pyramid is what do not not the top top but could there be a chamber\nOr something at the at the upper levels\n... as well I think so I think that could be that that could be a space or that um connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a\nDrop off ... pose that the summit of the great pyramid was not at peak was basically a virtual top and a and it would've been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter of that here is a meter\nA it's a very interesting a very interesting theory or and others have proposed similar things\nThere's even a hero cliff I think I'm a this was first mentioned by a state Jeannie in a night in uh Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins\nThat there was this fear on top of the great fear of it so not up to your media buy this year so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it I'm\nNo you've got to anomalies in a a and one is clearly defined ed row one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI I think so\nHow big would it be way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that height um how big could that chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be maybe no more than five feet something like that five feet\nBy eight and hide I'm saying right you know maybe maybe a five\nSix courses or something like that um and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on a on the ... and especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year ... was from the queen chamber\nSo I think in order to protect these spaces you'd have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will the new one scan show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but ah they might not be stocked up um they could be\nKnow like the one for example I mentioned that uh Rudolph guns and bring a is suspecting that will be a
