{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WHO", "content": "Fact that he even got on the field was a fluke because he only got to play because of serious injury to drew Bledsoe\nAnd it really shows you you know that that it's very easy sometimes to not look inside somewhat I mean I think he had great talent and physical talent and you know we've seen many flashes of that Michigan but\nWhat was really lurking inside him was incredible elite leadership ability and you know also great tactical mind and all those things that you know I think scouts too often dismiss\nBrain was tough because you know Brady the complements I Know everyone loves to talk about Brady and a great the patriots but you know until I Believe this season when they made another Super Bowl and and white eight straight AFC Championship games\nYou know their record was very similar to the forty niners in that long stretch or they were very dominant so same number of Super Bowls roughly the same winning percentage so I had a very hard time saying that either one of those teams was unique so initially\nFor the hardcover I didn't put the patriots and but later on I\nAfter they made that Super Bowl I decided to put them in because I thought they were clearly ... paste the forty niners but the thing about Brady that stands out to me the most beyond his leadership qualities is his relationship with his coach and\nThat is something that is fascinating to me and I said the coaches weren't the important factor the crucial factor and I don't think they are but what's really important in these great teams with coaches is that they have a partnership with their captain and I saw this over and over again it wasn't a boss employee\nKind of relationship bill bell checking Tom Brady had this relationship that was unusual it was like the relationship Tim Duncan had an Greg Papa ... to\nIt was very affectionate and there's a lot of of love between them but they knew how to fight and they would fight all the time they would come into conflict about tactics never personally it was always about how he was playing\nYou know a dollar check would would go to the meetings and Rick Brady in front of everyone from mistakes that he ... and ... he would take it and it would tell everyone that no one's above the team but you know Tom Brady to like the super bowl playbook that he was given he would tell them to rip it up and start over so\nThat partnership I think was really under rated if you remember\nThat first season Tom Brady came he was six round draft pick no one thought was or anything and Bill Belichick was the guy who got fired at Cleveland and no one thought had the chops the head coach and together they became two of the legends of football but I don't think you can separate them I don't think\nIt was something that could have achieved individually I think that partnership and their ability to work together was so important and\nI think the message for coaches and people managers and people who are trying to assemble teams with this kind of leadership model is that you got to pick someone to leave that team that you can really Parker with and that you respect that you can ah Willie treated appear\nI think that's true and there was a balance of power you wrote about in a mutual respect and the fighting wasn't a bad thing and you were quite the Greek captains and coaches to married couples I was lucky to see a great marriage my mom and dad would fight like cats and dogs and it was over right after the fights and then I'd see I'm loving each other and then when they disagreed they'd go at it\nAnd it was respect for each other and they taught me how to fight\nWhich is a wonderful thing people who can disagree and then carry on you're giving the greatest gift in the world\nIt's true it's so under rated and\nIt it's funny because especially in sports there's this weird sense that conflict is bad you know there there's there are certain players and the and the thing about these cats as was they were not ... I mean they would push back on anything they didn't think was the best interest of the team but it was something big or small\nThey would push back against the coaches they would push back against a team that says well they were willing to stand apart\nYou talk about courage and you know that's an underrated form of courage and the ability to just dissent from the group and scientists who actually shown that that there is a an element of physical discomfort that\nComes with banning apart so it's something that's not easy to do\nAnd yet it's so crucial you know all the studies that have been done a team performance show\nTeams that really work together and and close ways as they do in sports\nA certain level of conflict is central but there's a different kind of conflict there's two cuts really there's a kind of conflict they called ... conflict which is really about an argument about process about how the team is doing something or how they should do something and there's another form of conflict which is personal conflict\nThis is one the source of the ... is really just I don't like and there's a real difference at all these cabins whenever they introduce conflict in their teams they made a huge point to make\nClear that it wasn't personally never singled out individual and never played any one person\nHe was always about the collect and it was always about the task and the process and it's a huge difference it's so easy to mistake goes to them and look at someone who is creating conflicts or as a bad thing when you're not really necessary looking at why they're doing it or how they're doing it and that was one of the real secrets I feel like a uncovered\nAnd something I had no idea about until I really took a look at it\nSam you wrote something fascinating about all these captains that they were more like jazz musicians than conductors\nAnd that they freely improvised on and off the court to get the job done\nIt was one of the things that I never considered when I think about teams but there was a famous researcher named Richard ... and there was a Harvard psychologist she passed away a few years ago\nHe had all of his career embedded with performance that do things in real time whether airplane cockpit cruise or emergency room units or even symphony orchestras and he would watch the way leadership work and what he discovered\nWas so exact parallels to what I found in these teams which is that\nThe leader of charisma talented not it just wasn't a factor that could have it they could not have it to really make it all that mattered in fact in terms of leadership inside a group is that every single important function of leadership get stuck that's it\nYou know anything that needs to be done in order to help the team from leaders perspective as long as someone does it have to be the leader it could be somebody else and all these great teams what you saw was that these captains\nThat establish themselves as the person who would do anything it says a burning building that no one else wants to go into they're going to go into it and once that stabbed list and basically everyone on the team with or a superstar or a bench player\nUnderstands that they're free to do their jobs and focus on what they do and if they want to contribute to leadership they can they can do it the way they want to do the things that they're good out there it's mentorship [noise]\nYou know being the spark plug her being share for doing something else to help the teams that group and you start to see this happening this beautiful symphony that starts where everyone does what they're good at and everyone pitches and every single auction of leadership is taking care of and\nA great leader will never feel territorial never feel unhappy that someone is doing a leadership function is frankly it's a hard job being a great leader you know sustain a excellence is incredibly taxing and difficult and\n... White House efforts to project an image of stability you with the loss of one of the highest profile women in the administration at a time when women's votes are being vigorously pursued by the White House doctor John Curtis online columnist Tom with us John this was kind of a shocker wasn't it\nWell I mean it's a shocker in the sense that everybody thought that Hillary was a you know so entrenched I'm and she was ... extremely high ... profile I'm I'm un faster in part because she was a governor of a state to more of an executive function so\nShe certainly extremely opinionated in into the you know the Trump\nYou know kind of foreign policy line to AT T I mean I I think you know it's not surprising to the extent that Haley may want to follow the path of perhaps the person that will replace her who is Dina Powell Powell is resume reads like somebody a hundred years of age or even though she's forty\nFive she was with the administration now she's with Goldman Sachs the investments for\nWell I mean not only was she ... this administration she was with the Bush administration ... you know she started off in turning with Kay Bailey Hutchinson and went to Dick Armey I mean this girl really knows how to move and shake and I think if they can wind and you know she's an extremely close associate of ... I think you can really\nUh uh uh ... uh diminish or discount the idea that that uh evocative Trump is going to take this position and she said she's not going to\nKnow and she's not a dog but I think if they can can cook Joel or you know twist Dina Paulos arm to take this it will be far better than Margaret now here's the current ambassador to Germany or this girl is got\nYou know she's got all electricity about her and I I mean to wind up managing partner at Goldman Sachs without a bachelor's degree in finance she's I mean how do you do it ... how did these people\nWhy you know I I Know it's crazy but let me ask you this John because I Know you've been a staunch supporter of this administration have you ever seen more upheaval in two years with members of the cabinets or his own staff\nNow I think it's pretty safe to say that ... there's the turnover rate here is a you know a unprecedented on the other hand you know you want people when they are who are you know better and brighter type folks I think Haley was an outstanding you went in ...\nAh and I think she just had enough of it I think that you know that's a really tough job especially today and you're just button happens all the time I think she wants to kind of move on to other things and pass the baton there was some speculation that you might even run against Trump but you know this is just absolutely hogwash\nThe likely scenario is that she'll probably be Trump's campaign manager in two thousand twenty I mean she completely ... you know the Trump White house and with a ... wouldn't mind seeing him

impactful social media platform on the Web to kill it\nGoogle has announced that it will shut it down and social network after the wall Street Journal reported that the company did not disclose the security vulnerability in the spring and expose private data from hundreds of thousands of Google Plus it counts\nLet's check in with our expert on the Internet luring Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lawrence\nRight that I did consult the Google several years ago so\nNow what is Google Plus for Google Plus\nIs is a Google a social networking platform and it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter is in the Google ... that I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise] um there's going to be missed\nWhat it's going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story for ages oh with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it [noise] really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus and throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored post right these are both things that drives people crazy\nOr his book so there was no separate income stream coming from it in the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have you got to have the sponsored post you got to have these things that are\nAnd they feel it in your your time lines and everything and they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people are kind of regret it given what's going on but sizes everything was social video scale is everything at Google just never really got that scale now\nThis brief that occurred ... all the right at the top of\nThe currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise]\nApparently there is that they really didn't is they found that in a during a if I understand that during their own auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical bought her ability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that we're that we're theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers of financial information nothing like that while the stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's why it's her petition\nAnd they kind of sat on it and write and now of course it kinda makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but ... it convenient are kind of a rationale for setting a demotion the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month\nBut they they should have discussed that publicly of the first place um and uh\nIt would've been a lot better all around if they had in the meantime all of us who've been using Google Plus all these years are trying to find other places to go where experimenting with other things that are mentioned that there the Google commercial versions of Google ...\nOperates further Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month or per head using ...\nThat's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially uh and then we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf with probably not a good idea in the first place\nAt the time that you're right it it seemed at the\nTime well it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out but as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have that an

yes they were very surprised to hear that but I think I Hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before telepathy pre cognition tell the ... cycle ... says you you of course we learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nWhat we find in the study is that there is a very subtle again highly statistically significant effect suggesting that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown seconds before the picture is shown\n[noise] years ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they chew videotapes of various anchor people and ... the ones that showed the most\nIt's remarkable response or from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nUh with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nOr that type of technology that is being used in Greece that's meant experiments measuring skin response\nAmazing work no psycho Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nRight again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the materials paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world\nWhat I found in my research is that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that have been controlled are once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run a Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies\nAnd he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is disability for the mind ... matter\nThe classic study uses random number generators these machines that spit out the heroes and once in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty present heroes and fifty percent one over time what the experiment\nDoes it asks people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room so they say hey\nI'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more one sided heroes again what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up some incredible response is during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one\nThey did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic and in people people have that ability going up\nThat's right George ... those are perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators\nWere set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're generating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is look at the behavior of the machines around the world\nAround event that we know a produce heightened emotions and nine eleven is one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a concentrate basically at a at a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike at nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened\nFor the plane hit the towers before the event that before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to have\nHer in jail or you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did\nFor ... she had the ability to bend spoons and keys and everything else with his mind now there are some who say dollars trickery its magic but if you believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and a\nCandidate B. taught can cycle can ... be taught\n\nWell I've heard of of spoon bending parties which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind and ways to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator works actually\nBending metal for example and early ... as an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in a two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw Keller than spoons\nSo there are many people who have suggested that this is real I'm a side note on your a gal her\nVery interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier\nThere's another document that I clued in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons ending within the context of remote viewing mhm abilities and what they say and this is a direct quote from a classified document\nWhere he was he was put under very I mean they were watching him closely what the documents that is as a result of ... success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability in a convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo\nYou know there has been a lot of debate about him but these documents suggest that studies were run and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the possibility that maybe he was able to do things using his mind that's down totally crazy\nMark would you give out your website and where people

news radio dead forty\nWelcome back Marc ... with us and we'll get to your calls as well this hour works in the near death experiences again and we were talking about whether the brain hallucinates\nShows that light that everybody seems to see going into the tunnel or whether something is really going on here ... is a difficult call isn't it\nI'm Glad you brought this up towards this is a really really important one because if\nIf there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond Lucy nation perhaps it gives us into a window into a reality that we typically don't be with her eyes but I I think we should explore this one further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling pieces of evidence are\nThe cardiac arrest studies known as ... cardiac arrest studies\nSo this is where people have their in cardiac arrest ... and the experimenter as talk to them soon after they're able to uh soon after they've had the experience rather than asking people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nSo these are cardiologist for example Dr ... a ... from Stony Brook is another one that we all scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\nCome back and described is near death experience and why is that significant in cardiac arrest this is severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stops after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later\nI'm One example in particular is from Dr Sam party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen one of the patients in particular had a very vivid out of body experience\nWhere he heard something in the room it was later found to be the defender later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the times were being stamped and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinctive sound\nAnd yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well we're somebody is literally gone through this new experience there floating above their body they see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance\nTalking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body Intel's the attending doctor exactly what he heard and it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experience memories\nAre but what I've found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual studies at the med school has looked at this very closely and Dr Bruce Grayson as one person in particular\nWho's looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you described where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMarquee Iran six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities and markets that the area\nYou can't see those radio signals once they're out there is that a little bit what what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see what they're out there\nThat's such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum\nAnd what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality so I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us at our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible job on this topic you've learned a lot damage you\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut kid ... Connecticut billed by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational atheist Anna materialist\nHowever I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think ah\nThere is this phenomena going on I just think regarding and the ease and uh where where the mind I Would use the word mine not sold but mine are conscious just goes\nUh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious and she was like there is no God or no devil I Would call an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I Would call it may be seeing you ... you know space no time\nA dimension but my question to you is specifically\nI liked it sort of question your whole premise by talking about psych medications explains psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs Claude ... antidepressants or major tranquilizers neural ethics\nThat chemically the brain\nAnd their work they do affect\nChemically the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical you the brain to these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can that can affect the brain is through the headaches going back to ... ...\nIt can affect the brain chemically we know that positively and in the mind that's my first part my second part of the same one question is\nAlzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious as the mines dusting that show it here's my question for you it doesn't that show that\nIf the mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the mine is connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there is a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's ... medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because things are related to one another we can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book [noise]\nImagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene we know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship but the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with the ...\nIt's highly related to consciousness damage the brain you you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected but the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain and conscious experience but\nIt's not the producer of consciousness\nWhat ... what do you think mark reincarnation\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about\nThe studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence\nFor it we we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes verified my medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nAnd in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow in hypnosis they died in the past life by drumming let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another often simply\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm Monique go ahead\nHi George and why I

Maureen would more goals chronicles stories from the wrong with the you know the unexplained the unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic trench medium for as far back as she can remember\nShe is communicated with the deceased at the age of Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who studied with laureen Cabot\nWas the official which obsessed with Massachusetts and she took Moreno under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to not only understand\nBut also control the gift of the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adults say on says she's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years\nMore has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and there's a company the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on the coast to coast Maureen welcome\nOh thank you so much for having me we could afford to this Fifteen Years old all this happened for you yes\nUh I Know as you're reading that I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter]\nTell me about Lori Cabot the official which of Salem [noise]\nYou know he's very a a wonderful\nWoman when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was rarely renowned and the city and she still is um she's known as you know the high priest is salmon and feel often when I was younger I see her walking\nAround town you know dressed in her her garb and very regal looking very um you know she's a big presents for a person and ... at\nThe time people welcome or with open arms you did they go oh my God there's er which\nYeah that's a great question see you know there are many people that welcomed with open arms but\nLet's just say the town and Sam I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it always seems to be at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft\nAnd um so basically she did you know she really changed the whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right\nFor the type of these and then it you know go to Sam I'm so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ... you\nKnow you are a fifth generation psychic ... medium that means we're talking about ... back to your family you said the civility what year who did it start with\nNo my um [noise] it's\nInteresting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if you don't want to scare me she just you know my father though he thought the girls insane [laughter]\nUm but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirit that I was seeing and I to me it was normal it did it seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by um and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water you know just that you know she'd come my father she is normal\nUm but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still\nYou know involved but say in a matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was with talking you know in her sixties she finally told me that she is you know what Marlene\nThis has been from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and\nReadings for them and she said you know I hear the spirit but I just turn up the radio\nSo\nWould you say that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\n\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so\nI never really knew her um but my great grandmother my grandmother rather I did\nKnow and she was the one who really got involved with doing reading for people so I heard that you know she was very trusted in her city or in her town um so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by in my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever passed down stories from one to the other the the you could carry through\nYou know the only thing\nThat I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and she was maybe\nMaybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she you have a picture of her and she looked like a gypsy\nUm and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know that was her true self she was very unique that what you said so that the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about the earth anyway\nYou know you've been with the New England the ghost project Maureen since two thousand one what is that\nA well rounded doing much better than me to tell the story but he started this story\nAfter and a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special course our class that he took\nTo try to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness\nI'm and basically he started doing a cable um you know he's got a cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know doing you know go set his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would look\nOn but it's a team of individuals that you know over the years I've learned is you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get to go out and you look for things that go on for the night you know someone else doesn't really want to\nSee why look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown all you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run in the team\nUm that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain\nAnd people were getting a little freaked out and they need help so it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigations of people it's really going there to to just help them\nHow many people are just a off the wall when you go to their house and there's just losing it\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\nNow show [laughter] terrified has birds I guess\nUm you know as as it says we've done more than a hundred and ...\n... um I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time\nBut we're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command [noise]\nUm so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well there's good reason why you don't see it [noise]\nUm so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street\nYou'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their lives\nWhat have you conclude about what this may be I mean a lot of people have their thoughts about what goes jar what do you think there\nWell I think\nThere are varying degrees of what they could be right so our experience in my experience over the years has been\nYou know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to give before they pass\n'em but then you know you called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs\nItems and being tossed around the house um there's different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door\nTo door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stripped from the stairs\nOn you know all these\nOut she'd have something go on in the oven and she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in oil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her of and um it would wake her up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look in the potatoes underneath on you know on the flames itself\nSo what do I think I think again as many different varying degrees of paranormal activity and not all of it just like you don't have a person that's a hundred percent knife\nDoing just fine\nGet your ticket now go to an evening with you don't\nThat's the evening with new don't go Fox News\nI'm Carmen Robert fear and dread in Florida as the strongest hurricane in panhandle

later found out that that the guy had just been released from prison for murder or a friend of his and ah so he wanted Murray and come back well but that didn't turn out so if there was any fear was then [laughter]\nYeah she was telling us that story before I Would imagine that\nIt's one that's left an impression with us\nI think so what kind of equipment Ron do you bring with you\nA very on on

um\nYou know try to bring the proper equipment that\nYou wouldn't eat for instance if you have reports of a ... and being seen you might\nBring more video equipment or like thermal or I or whatever but you you believe versus a sound equipment or something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the heat um reports manifested by\nAudio than you would bring more audio cut me so it it it varies avoiding according to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization\nThat you've come across a I'm Sorry what was the worst in the visualization of a goal visualization\nUm actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations probably four times um but the interesting part about it a charges that they weren't really well I was ghost hunting but more while I was just doing stuff yeah\nI work with a lot of White House history funds for them and we do you know public goes on and that type of stuff\nAnd there are two separate occasions or one that I Do these goes to his cause I'm On the board of directors of Bush on top of a White House that we do these hard two tours\nIn one time we were in this um [noise]\nIt's a like an observation tower it's a square\nBuilding with glass all around you and sees windows all around you can absolutely see you know three hundred sixty degrees and his wife and daughter in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to them doing my ... and I looked outside and I saw a woman a walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down to the side of the ... you know going towards the door and I I stopped because I didn't want to repeat myself as she came and they didn't want her to miss anything so I stopped and waited for a night I saw her continually\nWalk all the way to do it and I waited and waited and yet\nNobody came in so finally I said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there but yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my field to wait for her to walk it and yet there was no one here and oddly enough\nThat the vocation is where the coast guard 'cause it's on the coast guard base\nA coast guard reports and women walking on the wall in that same location so that was kind of intriguing um\nPerhaps the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we get a public a ghost town on uh what Iowa light hosts and benefit pool meal main we're in the White House ah keep U.S House it was on\nUm renovation at that time we were sitting on the picnic table in a in a room off the kitchen I look towards the kitchen I serve dog all across the door or the

was\nA twenty ... you have to do was knew there was like twenty four in the country and all this like twenty four and a new city but the judge I did want to mention you mentioned the hurricane Michael

when you go on your team when your team gets together how much research do you do before you go\nWell Maureen doesn't do any because half the time she doesn't even know where we're going to use\nYeah she was telling us that you you don't want to ah influence\nI I have to know something about it for instance if you're going especially if you go into a big location you have to know a where to concentrate you're you're investigating for instance if\nI'm there are a lot of noise is coming out of tickle area you might want to concentrate your audio recorder serve\nIf for a visual phenomena are in different locations you certainly want to uh you know put your cameras in there and and so you you ... you have to have a little bit of it I Try to get too much into the details with tour of the coin is for lack of it or\nAre you there to discover the ghost or to cleanse it would what did they ask for\nI Am not I am there for you know strictly investigate\nThat's a popular question 'cause and that was one of the things people will say when they read our first book was like oh you know\nYou know what were they doing you know they're not going they're releasing spirits and you know those are things you hear from people but you know they love the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know some of those parents have been there long before we have\nUm and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know that they want help to move on that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to that they have to\nDoes the person who brings you when do they want that ghost out of there\nI always ask them you know what you want from us you know basically a you know what you expect from us in a in a very at the cases on that if they're looking for someone who watch like a house Clemens is something we're not going to do it though you know or are we from someone else\nUm but if they wanted to investigate this to understand what's going on and try to understand what's going on than will do that type of case\nAll right let's take some calls we both of you let's go to brandy and granted big California Welcome to the program I brandy\nHi thank you for taking my call ...\n... um yeah I had a question and I've had a really really rough year after year that's probably the worst year of my life\nAnd I'm Wondering if you are able to tell me if you see the year next I mean you're being a lot better police things starting to go more my way\nMaureen this would be for you\nThat's for sure yes [laughter] yes it was um okay so Brandi I did pull a couple\nOf cards for you and honestly one of the things that I see is a lot of emotional turmoil right so that you it seems like you're holding onto a lot of hurt that have been happening around you right\nUm and I obviously don't want to get too personal um but you know and the other kind of a poll is you know this was last year in our things that have been happening is like a pressure right so because of all these things going around you it feels like your hands are tied and you're not able to move forward\nOn what I wouldn't tell you is that you can get to a better place you really need to trust you need to let go of some of these things that are you know in your life that I hate to say it but even even if there is um like a health issue that is taking place it's a learning lesson right now for you\nUm and it's a time for you to grow and you have to be able to to trust that it's not going to be this way all the time and I know that might sound cliche but\nI'm calling these cards around you and it tells me that you know you're really trying um but you're having a hard time you're like okay where do I begin to let this go on and you're doing a good job of trying to act the part I feel like you're going through your daily day change are really trying to put on a mask but you're not\nFeeling it is that correct or now a right [noise] yeah yeah okay\nRight so put ... think of it this way right so if you know I see that there's a healing hand that you have and I used to me you have to go to person it feels like a lot of people are the ones that come to you and they have an issue is that correct\n\nThat you tend to be the ear that people talk to like someone I was there\nYeah yeah\nOkay so you need to know that you know\nYou have to have patience with yourself and your situation okay um how many is coming so know that you you are coming to a breakthrough it is going to get better but I think a lot of it is knowing it's going to get better you know you have to put yourself in a place that's like a catch twenty two right see almost have to feel it\nFeel that strength inside of you again which you're kind of like well how do I get that back\nUm and a lot of it is balance right is finding a balancing your life is what you really need to do at this moment\nAlright thanks good luck brand new hope
