Joel radio down in the back\nTo coast to coast will take your calls next hour regardless of your thoughts on whether those global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box told me about the title first of all\nSure well that's this is a book that tells you what your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for a general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase use over and over and think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green bucks because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxer sustainable development there they are forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment and so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse\nA which are overpopulation the idea that humans are growing too fast and and are populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nIn in my presentations should I say this is the or the third station the United states has man since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations and occasionally somebody to come up with the right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nA and they leave built\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow\nAnd that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is on the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ISIS getting thicker in the south pole but on that we've lost a little bit um if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying that huge sheets of ice falling off the shelves melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they knew I knew west\nAntarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about cities that one renewable energy [noise] plus or minus\nYeah this hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional nuclear gas or coal\n... when you put in solar wind or you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system\nSo if you want eighty percent of renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar\nAnd people are saying batteries vast amounts of batteries so this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure\nOr some of the studies say that uh in California for example they were going to triple a the a cost of a wholesale electricity and that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top\nSo this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nLet's talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution I'll\nActually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about in my book you know we talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess\nOn now they are all modern\nThe landfills and in Europe and the U.S are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats another room and the other way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nSix major air pollutants your old down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones I mentioned the carbon monoxide actress oxide sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe at the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining\nSo this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the\nNations that are not able to put energy use effectively um can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNow what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and hey this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming match is yeah yeah\nIt is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times to one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October\nEvery little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite a climate skeptic to climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible a man made climate change and that we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate\nUm and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot which cycles which are of the tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are\nAre they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand two hundred thousand years cycles they cause the ice ages then we have medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that uh scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are the the fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm um the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather\nAnd our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example in their regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycle so the and the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what people participate would you\nSign up now for

Streever wrote a book\nCalled the coming global superstorm and that inspired a movie called the day after tomorrow and when I was wondering was\nOr is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and uh what these protections\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie\nWell as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand well with yellow stone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming in Kentucky or is it very possible that the fans in both of those movies that very well happen [noise]\nYeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve is Yellowstone and that for Kaine although I understand there's a big went under their call during\nThe day after tomorrow is based on the idea that um manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a of the uh\nA global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nUh which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and then it sinks into it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian in the Pacific\nThe the theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a cause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so are there ... there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream Muslim slowing down it's really not happening\nThere was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay this is an actual thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the Keno these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nAll eggs and they'll make you\nStill don't think whoa\nOkay go ahead you're on\nA Monday morning who ah who quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're talking\nAbout wind field when I when I was\nLiving in Oregon okay and I used to drive by the wind you know that they had and I could see out in the field that they had a big fat and it was up by plenty more boy\nBooth flame you know they were were burning off the methane\nGas while we're asking now why don't you put a generator on that\nAnd we'll do ... you know electricity\nNow come back and they had no no no it's going to cost whom I Can't have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that and they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Want to go why hasn't there been anything done about that\nWell I think there are recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nAh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh\nUh agriculture um the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment of three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places they're capturing the gas from landfills\nOr but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext stop let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi are you arguing thank you for having Steve von Loor bumped into spoken to him several times I heard him on many shows\nAnd he has a breath of fresh air in inside and that accuracy or there is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think we should warn are good friends she\nNot to make the same mistake that these are climate change hopes are are are using a ...

growth on the planet force are still shrinking but in two thirds of the world's nations the United states Western Europe Russia China we have forests growth are stable force\nSo there are some good science the trends are good but yeah we're not going to go back to the days when most of the world was uninhabited we at all for us and we had all the vice and that just won't happen\nWhat's happening with rising sea levels\nSo sea levels have been rising for the last twenty thousand years you can go to to NASA or their website and ... and see that data they've written a three hundred and Ninety feet a hundred and twenty meters since the last ice age\nNo scientists can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man made sea level rise began\nUm right now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been going for the last couple of hundred years or any politician who tells you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold onto your wallet oh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop\nThat and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nThat obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there were a if you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey\nA if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about um uh there are some some um indications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well\nUm those are about five miles from the coast with historical accounts peas are used to be a big court or a big uh port\nOn in in a northwest\nItaly an excuse to be a port as well so there was some times when the oceans were higher but again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise so matter what the what they think in California\nRoots in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nGeorge thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like a mention I perhaps for a lot of listeners that aren't aware\nIs a global elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and gum and what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations and news articles scientists that is not the proper word the word is\nAbrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering these are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and even ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosols\nAnd ... they're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky they no doubt this a lot of difference\nAnd what harp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this himself I can tell you how to do it\nFirst of all any time you watch the news you are watching at him manufactured why you're not seeing the real no weather satellite max that we used to the many years ago we're seeing animated cartoon\nBut there is a fight a it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood that this guy is obviously a former meteorologists he keeps anonymous name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm front hurricanes tropical storm low pressure zone coming directly in the California and they're being blocked\nAnd it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up they're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power and can have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees\nThey can steer hurricanes they can start hurricanes they can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure zone and this is what's happening this is not an act of nature it's an act\nOf the military industrial complex would have our with our weather\n... when I hear about it in the new\nLet's Steve's reaction to the Bruce like you\nBruce uh some I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some cloud seeding attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about the climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that's something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he did go ahead [laughter]\nOh well let's go man just said it exactly right I'm One of these conservatives it happens to believe that the weather is being gay oh engineered the camp trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently in gentleman on a show\nTalking about Kim drill team put out a video called Franken's guy and the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the earth blotting out son well people are so much shooting word hate\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said that are going to back off Kim trail well now the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geo engineering this weather\nDown to science I mean it's it's to the point now you can go to the street and on the stock market on the weather if they want are games that they want to intensify the hurricane through the aid of heart\nAnd on top of that then you got the geoengineering of the story on the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct\nAnd I think that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish idea didn't may never come up with a man is not smart enough to harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing\nThat I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham man they want they were doing a script when the oil um industrial nations away describing it ended the pockets of the global elite\nAnd meanwhile China it's over there with their skies completely with pollution not paying a dime and do it either as Russia but the United states of America but going to play the oh I don't know I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLonger he somebody had to wear out of time Steve and ed thank you for your comments Steve thank you good luck with the work outside the green box ... that's the name of it up next let's talk a

creek which was rewarded with toll kind of pointing spruce has inspired a pines\nHe sees something going up and down in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee so he's watching this thing going up and down and thinking to themselves\nWhat on earth is a monkey or a chimpanzee\nDoing up here\nNow he couldn't cross the river and when the thing came down on the tree it went into the the trees the surrounding it a little in other words there were like low gross ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so one that was up in the high tree he could see it\nAnd want to climb down we couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention when he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up\nSits there and won't

other one\nWho knows it's anybody's guess what this little critter was doing maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human terms like when we used to go down to

the Pacific northwest British Columbia Canada here we have a lot of wilderness in Maine we have a lot of wilderness right here in New York state\nAnd so these people had moved from one house to another house in North\nIn Maine [noise] uh the money was right the property was right the people that had lived there before them well gardeners they will gardeners this was like a match made in heaven\nWell as it turns out over time they found they were accusing each other of losing the gardening cools the wife ... ways to shovel wisdom rate was this so finally the husband gets the idea\nThat they're going to gather together with the tools they have ... inventory and then they were going to keep the moral locked up with the exception of two small hand space\nSo having accomplished that they realize they were missing some cools [noise] and they started they left\nTo hand spades on what she called the ... the wife called the he strode table on the patio and they were using them for pot in plants and\nNo sooner had they left them out there a couple of days went by and now these hand spades withdrawn\nThey it actually called the police report depth on the property

the place Rob the place well [laughter] ... bright\nTVs and things like that [laughter] [noise] so\nThey actually went out into the property in the woods\nThey found one of the shovel leaning on the tree\nAnd the wife scope out nine feet off the ground one of the one\nHand garden trials with a rubber handle on it\nShowed into the side of a tree nine feet up nine feet up\nSo they went back to the house they gotta like that gets an iPhone ... took pictures of it they brought a ladder out the husband couldn't Bush this thing it was buried in the tree several inches he couldn't budget [noise]\nSo they had recalled the police and told them the story about finding the show when the woods showed the cop show but when the tree everybody was baffled by you know this turn of events you\nAnyways the long and short of it was\n\nThe Capitol and look if you have any other problems get back to us I'm not sure what happened here I'm going to pass a law to the detectives\nWell\nThey said the long and

snowman the lady from the Himalayas is that the same as the big ... we talk about here in North America\nI don't believe so uh although I'll tell you something really interesting\nUh I had an account of was told to me by all things a Russian professor who was out hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of his vast knowledge of the things botanical\nAnd they formed this unlikely friendship and turned that into a hiking partnership\nThey had run across a couple of big for its messing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them whether they could hear them ...\nAnd the professor said that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was on familiar with now this is a Russian speaking immigrant\nSaying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with\nSo when you talk about the the Eddie in uh the abominable snowman\nIt's hard not to think of the land bridge that was once they're above the Bering Sea\nAnd did these things or or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman a speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard\nA voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing in Minnesota and they parked on a\nPulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought the look clear and they can sit there and rest for a little while and they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there or they will unseen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ...\nAnd they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and the Chinese restaurant and they're shouting orders back and forth to each other so it's very very odd but as far as the ah the ah yesterday and the abominable below\nSnowman I have no idea uh I have a ... book the abominable a snowman come to life\nAnd uh you know that thing is like reading or an encyclopedia on the creature a and yet getting back\nTo what I said earlier none of this stuff means anything to the majority of people around the globe that book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about big foot or a hoax the\nFilm is a hoax all of the uh uh a durable ridges on the footprints taken everything's a hoax to them so\nYou know we have to just keep doing what we do a in spite of uh what the majority of the people out there thinking about it so that's one of the things I Love about coast\nYou know uh uh we all\nTune in because we're hearing things that we can get in a little ... nobody's talking about what you're talking about\nUFOs in big encounters where's the Tania\n[noise] well I've had a couple of them are one of them are called the dead falls incident but one day they'll share with you a was named the orb\nIt's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys all working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them uh to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania to do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that\nAnd and the second day or the focus was on that of ah getting attention being saved so they were spending their time in an open area spelling out the words help than SOS\nUh using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires using a green a green vows\nAnd that night they decided to go on a night hike to see what it was like a navigating\nAround in the dark\nAre now during the day they had climbed up the sides of the mountains to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation\nAnd they had gone up into the same area or at night for the hike well when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was a UFO enthusiast which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear\nHe had a pair of military grade night vision a by knock you lose your own monarch you'll or\nA that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail one or the kid says hey what's sad and they noticed in the distance\nA light moving around in the woods now of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a battery operated lantern\nBut then they realized that this thing started to daughter around in a crazy fashion which immediately told all of them this is no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAs they got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in or around bluish white light moving around in the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even close to their butt trying to get ever closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it finally they got to a place where they believe they were about Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it\nThey can see that it was about two feet wide bluish white or but it was about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was a looming aiding the trees around it\nSo that the parents and the\nWas that bright yeah I mean it it it's a glowing orb of light ... around in the forest and now it's in stationary and what happens next is absolutely out of this world the\nOne scout is holding it and he says to the leader hey Mr so and so you better take a look at this thing it's doing something really weird\nHe described a picture this George a two inch wide let's just say beach ball a two foot wide beach ball he described a globe ... coming out of the size of this thing as being like when you blow bubbles through want as a child okay\nSo this thing is coming out of the side of this or and making its way down to the ground\nAnd what blew their mind was the fact that what was coming out and go into the ground was like twenty times for thirty times the volume of the orbit self and yet the war was on changed and this thing was attached to it\nNow they don't want to see a big foot appearing in secondary glob coming down and they described it as being like in his state of suspended animation that wasn't moving whatsoever but they were certain to what they were looking at\nAt some point the glob separates from the orb and now you have like this power of blue and white like with this big foot in it and the orbit sitting separately it was then that they've\nI think they didn't dominate the planet for a long time until Seventeen Seventy six because the founding fathers decided to form a new form of government one that
