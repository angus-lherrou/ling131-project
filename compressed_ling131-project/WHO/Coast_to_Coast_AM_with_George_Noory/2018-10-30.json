they oh I don't I don't know [laughter] I Hope so yeah\nI'm sure I'm sure they're they're done in a in a very careful manner very logical manner\nI mean that's not what greed another problem all by itself how about the population in terms of men and women fifty fifty what their mind is that a market change\nYeah you know in you know what's interesting about the market is a women right now and and I don't know why and no one's paying attention to this but women are about sixty five percent of of the people in college it's sixty five thirty five men women and in law school at Seventy thirty I mean think\nAbout really isn't that high on that's a flip flip from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I I said listen you want you you want to hassle of women there so you don't do it but what you have to take into consideration is is that women\nAre going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into CEO positions and they're going to want us\nYeah oh excellent and was absolutely excellent ones and and uh\nSo we're we're seeing a major major change in our culture Twenty years from now you won't you won't recognize a commerce you just want because it's going to be run by women\nUm what's happening with the new generation Z what's in what is that\nA generation Z was born ... being born right now is is actually a two thousand five to ... thousand twenty four\nSo in that fully there uh\nBut Gen Z is not going to be entirely different than Gen Y that they're going to be this the same\nCyber reliant generation or they won't be as big because the number of parents that they have is is much smaller in generation X. generation X essentially is the parents of Gen Z a but\nIt's what we're watching is is it's\nA ... a new crop of kids and and I tell folks and if you look at ... ... people say well these these ... they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complain about the morning if they complain about the\nSame you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled to it you know there's all kinds of things that are that I'm hearing about them and he said let alone let them grow up as soon as they have to feed themselves they're going to be find is just going to be just like the hippies that everybody hated as soon as they had to feed themselves and and and face reality\nI'm In my joke is they became Republicans so\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted for that ...\nI don't care listen it is what it is [laughter]\nWell let's listen here here's how it works zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby you want what you want what you want it you want it now you don't you want it for free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have some positions at the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a a liberals or the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing a conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying\nSo oh no we're we're going to be a nation of liberal\nWhy can't people just care about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\n[noise] [noise] yeah what he told me that makes me cringe you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country\nAnd it's horrible yeah it it troubles me early does we maybe not it's\nNot what we're supposed to do I mean when you have a I mean unless it I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but\nWhen you have a president day takes on a porn star in public and they have a fight on Twitter give me a break\nThat's the problem\nThat's and that's part of the new technology again did anybody ever anticipate

hundreds there's more information in a in a single Wall Street journal and somebody would ever think about an individual would think about in the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't know\nWhen you talk about the trends in change this is what we're losing Ken we're losing the ability to debate question discuss without people screaming at each other\nI mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people in a restaurant tonight I'm instead of just talking about something they're screaming at each other because they didn't get ... they didn't agree with each other in I've never seen

saber rattling which is what they're doing\nIt on the go to war\nYeah they well they they they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has won in China's history zero they've never won a war\nI don't know what's gonna happen there but but it's it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is they they don't have enough people to to feed their system there there are the kind of he's not going to work period\nNo it's not let's take some calls this hour come rolling in here for your guinea\nLet's go to ... in Grand Rapids Michigan to get things started Hi Dana\nHi Hi George I hope you're well I Am well I Hope you are too high okay thank you thanks guys hey can I I have I called\nBecause I have a phone compact with you I'm just scare me out and then I'll listen to your response\nSo two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a Twitter war um he's not a ... so all of those politicians that have looked us in the I I Can't do that\nAs a human being or as a Christian but I'm saying this as a Christian and a woman I wanted to say do things you first of all I'm he called her a horse face she was trying to jump start her career uh um the porn star\nBecause she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that lawyer is what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he was he could run and possibly when um the presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for what both of those guys yet and all they had was temporarily side track\n'em a booming economy or try to bring down that's nan but more importantly that man has ten actually a little one still at home I yeah and that little one but a young white include and his wife and\nWe had a president and did something so by all it can even be talked about on on on radio in the oval office while I was paying for him with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did that if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nTrump it's reactionary he doesn't start fights\nYou look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature of the second thing I disagree that is sad is that I'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school but and but I'm I'm not that old either\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than ... and it should be run like a business I have started to successful business is myself it's men and women don't have time for now and then\nYou get a deal done we're not going to have a needing to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then this and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and\nSo the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy diplomacy death and win wars diplomacy doesn't save money we\nNeed a businessman I voted for him because he's a no nonsense is is that anyone that was bankrupt it four times and they had the audacity\nTo get back up yet on the horse\nI that I have incredible admiration for people that are fighters in a dish and he doesn't care if people call him a racist\nBecause God Knows what scientists hard and other people know that ... ... it it doesn't matter about his policy she knows she yes as I as a man on and uh and as a prize of that so I disagree with you on both of those um things\nAnd let's get scared as comments today not in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things what can you want to jump in\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think you need to run a country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country a period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented you're not going to\nThirty thousand dollars for screwdriver or toilets or you know pay the fair market value or even tried to get it for the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business they're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I Would I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but I Would also say that that our country is a Republican with a constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a bit of a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican Ken that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to comment on do you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with um ah the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do\nIn not areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nThat whole new but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm a a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them about what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that was in the punishment would be [laughter] what they've said and and um [noise] uh I I don't know I I think what he has done is dignify or at the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean there was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows but\nRefined topics or something that will cause people to create a major blow in front of the\nListen if you dare

touch it\nWell no I support our truck drivers I don't want to see driverless trucks\nAnd I really don't have enough truck driver you know what that what we\nNow would you like to have a truck behind you would know drivers\nOut or not going to do it might not you know we I have a mini mini as little mini Cooper right\nI Am a mini Cooper GDP which is a heart ride and I'm thinking to myself I the

going to rearrange you and you're out of it in a mini Cooper ... year history\nThat's that's where the truckers are telling me that people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out of school bus it's over it's it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nA lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever they're carrying you know I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway and they're you know the truck is parked there in the truck driver guy is loading everything in the store\nArguing how's how's how's the driverless trucks going to do that\nIt's not it it just not going to do it you know hey hey can I go back to China for just a minute yeah please\nOkay one of the things that are are are is troubling demographers about China right now is there are a from a forty years old and under there are about Ninety million uh um men are males\nOr without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or is simply infanticide\nNinety million where are they they're in the military\nYeah and it's the there is just a ton and and that that's what happens when you have an imbalance in your population so that's another factor that China is dealing\nWith do you see another major war breaking oh\nNo I just I I I ...\nI just don't see any reason to do it well I'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth is the Americans and that is a you know Canada United States Mexico central and South American\n... uh we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need the oil we got water\nYeah we've got water we got fracking where we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water it it just it I don't know I\nAm one of those always missiles alone guinea\n[laughter] yeah yeah but I I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wackos like like a Kim jung on and on North Korea I don't see that happening and if in fact I say I what I see in in Korea is going to be a unification\nOf the north in the south [noise] do you know that the south is not having children there for ... heard that oh you sound like about one to\nHere's my concern though not for my country but from some terrorist groups that obtains a new ... or something like that and they do it and try to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know is is that the one child per couple you cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population you can't possible\nIt has to grow so I don't know what's going to happen here with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... they're they're right or just above replacement level\nFertility Michael in Jamestown North Carolina hey Michael go ahead\nYes Hi uh George and higher against um Hi my question is that uh is the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the north east into like down south and west coast of Florida is now the third most populous state\nOut raking New York state and also in Phoenix has become the largest city out raking I filled out here\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather ...\nThat that that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the profound demographic shifts ahead we cover every single state\nIf you go from Virginia all the way down to Florida go over to ... California Nevada Arizona and New Mexico uh the\nPopulations are going to increase the population of of Florida is going to go from twenty million to thirty million while or buy real estate bite in Florida now\nAnd just sit on it yeah it\nSaid I ... the the uh uh an interesting concept is the fact that the the the senior citizens in Florida are now Seventy five two Ninety five I had a real estate journalist\nOr give me a bus and she said one is the baby boomer influence on Florida real estate going to ... you're not going to ask what if it meant when will begin to you know soften and I told her I said listen it hasn't started if\nYou're not when it does is gonna be huge\n... it's going to be off the charts with the same thing is happening with healthcare elder care and death care\nWhat our Vegas is that a good market shoot\nOff the charts huge can't believe it I it\nIt's a for one uh it it's cheap there are plenty of job or a ...

H.\nWait Joe ... and I hearts radio station and on your age uranium Haiti already ADD\nMorning doubled you wait Joe\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news trapped again severe weather stations news radio ... do you\nWell uh yeah thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love this show\nI'm looking forward to this this is as you got to tell me what I mean what did the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it's the paranormal has been happening to me my whole life it started at age four with my first paranormal experience it was an ... experience a near death experience and just from that point on it just the these things have been happening randomly but quite frequently\nAnd ah I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things and have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to finally put these all these experiences together into a book\nAnd a and then start talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or others but to to students and actually I I teach a class now at the college I'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nA lotta people Bruce or a little hesitant to come out and talk about the paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences has this been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nUh it it hasn't I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear even that they would have it I was a I was afraid of that uh that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously\nOr or that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching 'em to two of my colleagues at at the college so I it's been a very positive experience that I guess the most\nNegative thing I can think about there was a a a friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide\n[laughter]\nYou know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that's something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate advisor\nYou know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the field of the paranormal and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\nI I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had the in the scientific community up of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientist historian\nA but from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance\nTo uh to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend dean rating who's the chief\nScientist at ions good guy he uh\nYeah seven he said they're Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there's only fifty\nFive zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those skeptics so that's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities\nAnd from what he told me there's only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's got to eat all of this ... under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there are still the J. B. Ryan Institute thank God to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's\nBut I I think there is and I come from this with with dean because he's doing and you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research in very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift going on of of gaining acceptance\nAnd I think people are are increasingly professional people are are are increasingly a supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWell and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet uh there are other podcast who's out there dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI ... I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and ah I've I've made a I'd make contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I've just that it's just it as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building at night and he's got some stories so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's\nI I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people uh express their interest in and their support I think it's going to it's going to spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce olive sold ... latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in ... to tell me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner uh because I didn't seem to have much control it just happened randomly these things\nAh it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and it and in the last couple of years that's that has been the the point which to do this\nFirst one did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I Would and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or two\nThe island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for lived there about nine months so it was a wintertime and I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a\nI got very sick very suddenly I I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally stiff I had this fever coming on\nAnd I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know should be baking for a long time and just wanted to take a little nap and it was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBy the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know and they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep a crime myself to sleep and I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was\nThis really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen\nAnd ah it I felt like it it it was an end jelly presents it it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be okay it took away all my fear\nAnd uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first experience and experience and I never question did I just said okay that's\nThat's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing\nPsychic a right to see 'em there's always there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it I\nI I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this is a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a\nA small plane or buy a ferry or vote or there was no bridge to that island so there's very remote there is no hospital so uh you know they they needed the services of folk healers and and and that's what my grandmother did my mother's mother\nThe thing is at stake

just so many different kinds of paranormal stories you had a a lifetime of activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've I've kinda been a a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how it someone described it and I agree with that description\nTell me about the open casket story\nYeah the open casket um\nThe title alone kind of makes you shiver\n[laughter] well I grew up in a in a um [noise] in\nOur region American community and we had this this older man who passed away and he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh\nWe were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral it I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly where my father was a he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me\nAnd as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know the the all the emotion of it all of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket\nAnd he was so close to me and he said ah\nAh Bruce it's it's it's okay I'm okay there's nothing to be afraid of uh uh I'm okay and uh I I I I looked I kinda I looked\nAround and looked at my mom and she you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut ah I didn't actually ask her about it but and then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it and then that typical you know Norwegian accent and uh but I was looking at him and of course he you know he was just in the casket and and dead but\nSo I I definitely heard his voice and um\nIt it it was kind of comforting\nIn a way but very uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre it would be weird wasn't it yeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't quite sure at that time\nI I I think I Know now that are often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to uh appear at their their funerals just to check everybody out\nSee what see who's there very\nCurious I think I Would be curious to [laughter]\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kinda paranormal in and of itself that the college let me do it but uh\nWell do you have to fight for it\nI didn't really have to fight that was that that was the thing now it's a it's a community education course so it's not like for college transfer credit but it is offered it at the\nCollege and I am a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book\nSo I I've always wanted to do this and I I approached them and I said well they said well we've never done this before but we think it might be a pretty popular I said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and\nSo I thought well maybe I'll get maybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get\nBut ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could have accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues and and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California\nOr younger people and and older people of different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it there they all have one thing in common they ... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it but there are a couple\nThat are a little skeptical including one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks in the or seven weeks in the\nCourse into the course um and uh it it it's been a wonderful experience that really what it what it turns out to be is\nYou know I I present different theories about different types of paranormal phenomenon I relate my experiences they they read my book\nAnd we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories and that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories\nAnd it's a safe in an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow we're going to have our last class and we're having a farewell dinner at a haunted location here in a nearby\nA steak house which will be fine ah that's a hunted and I'm so that that that should be a lot of fun tomorrow night\nWednesday night we have our annual goes to goes to your Bruce and it's amazing the amount of colds that come in of ghost stories I mean there is yeah it's amazing to me or scientific explanation of what you think a ghost might be\nWell\nI'll tell you the I've had two full operation experiences\nAnd I believe that those those full body operations are just echoes or um I think there are ... what they would call a residual hunting I suppose\nThey that they weren't interactive with me I couldn't communicate with them it's not like when I you know communicate with with those that are um in the spirit world it's say\nThe ... at least the full body operations that I've seen the to where I could see the translucent ghost in front of me one one was in Austria and a very uh in the Alps was a beautiful location\nAnd the other was in ah in New London New Hampshire when I was on a a
