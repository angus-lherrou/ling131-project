New York stock exchange\nWhich is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to ... Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two\nThat as a sort of happy go lucky enthusiastic energy it's certainly good for anyone whose uh son science ... in general the next year or so uh by the way when you estimate the retrograde\nVenus goes retrograde this Friday I just mentioned that you know which could be the day of the vote up or down and Venus is in ... and it's a ... I wanted to tell people it's affecting anyone who's born around November second or third\nOf any year so those people are going to get an extra dose of Venus over the next several weeks which is focused on love relationship creative artistry social activities money money management and things like that\nMark why does it feel like this year has gone by so darn sure that\nIt does feel that way um well you know part of it\nMight be well one of the things\nThat is happening this is definitely you know have the media is always there there there are amazed because of what's happening with with the president with the tweeting and all the information and so from the political realm it with people like yourself or myself people who are you know tuning into news reports a need to do it for work\nOne of the things that's so weird there's so many events are happening much more so that they are being reported like Lincoln these split hour after hour\nAnd I think that you know people are tired of it and they're exhausted and then we've had like this whole thing about social networking we're you know millions of people like their their passwords here and there\nAnd so it's kind of like a revolution every single day somewhere\nAnd I think that that's making the time go a little faster or maybe we want to make make it go faster to get away from some of the ... the weird problems\nAnd you chart out asking logically I Know you were with me I'm back in July and you're always popping in on New Year's day with us right can you chat to chart the rush to the year for someone in the beginning of the year\n[noise] [noise] yeah well it's an interesting thing New Years in particular is very powerful I mean you could even do today it's October one\nAnd you could in general I mean these things are not usually done you could take a look at the whole month of November by looking at say midnight in in the nation's capital here or wherever the capital is of a particular country and do a truck for that moment now the big one is New Year's at midnight all around the world because\nI'll be on the air with everybody\nWell yeah and what's interesting is at midnight everywhere around the world lever is always a rising and the son is in Capricorn at the bottom of the chart because it's midnight and so\nThere you have to feed and all the other planets like for instance midnight New Year's coming up on two thousand Nineteen the sun and Saturn are coming into a conjunction and Mars is going to enter its home sign of areas which doesn't actually look all that wonderful for the planet\nBecause Mars the traditional positive war will go into its own sign actually late on December thirty one and then the son of Saturn are together now there can be positive things like maybe for sports with with Mars\nAnd um exercise and engineering and different kinds of projects that are more martial but sunlit Saturn at the beginning of year is often you know too many frustrations lotta blocks coming in but I guess it's going to be a testing year two thousand Nineteen for the world\nWhy does it work mark why does astrology war\nBecause here's what's happening it isn't that the planets were throwing down raise this is what the old idea\nExactly and why scientists would say you believe in that foolishness pseudo science mumbo jumbo\nIt inside of us okay so in other words everything depends on something being born at a moment of time like with the person baby it's when you take your first breath it's not coming out of the womb if the village of course still tight it's when that's why you\nKnow we've got to make the baby cry to make sure we know that is really taking in the first spread like the declaration of independence is usually used to leave America's Choice because it was our first\nBreath where we're seeing it gets wedding when we're independent of you were being born okay this is our beginning now not every astrologer works with that chart but most of them do\nSo the reason it works is that wherever the sun is the moon and the various on it it's not that they're making things happen from outer space\nIt's that whatever is born a person a president take an oath of office you buy a new car you get a new job you do if you have the time uh that that happens you put everything into the horoscope and then you can attempt to interpret what does that say about the potential\nMy work at this job being the president of the United states or baby being born\nOr with mark Lerner the astrologers ... new one great barrier enterprises dot com we've got linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com and we come back in the moment we will take your phone calls and he'll do some personal astrological readings for you what do you need from people mark when they call you\nWill fundamentally month day in your birth if they know the time we can try and put that in and or wherever they were born\nDoes the time make it more accurate or you\nWell look I could if somebody said to me I Know when I'm bored ... you know what I don't have the time I Know the town or city actually month in here I could do anything for that person not as exactly ...\nDo it because timing allows us all kinds of things the sunrise birth is is it near noon is at sunset is it\nA midnight we're or the planets falling at that point because the twenty four hours most ... are going to be in the ... they're going to be in the same lines but the moon can change a lot and twenty four hours it could go half of the time\nAnd so the moon has a lot to do with our instinct or mood even reincarnation and looking back who we may have been the qualities were bringing in this lifetime moon has a lot to do with personality the sun is more of the character and kind of a life force\nAnd a connection a little bit more just spirituality but so polarizing and which was sunrise in the east\nThat is the window to the world kind of on the highest level of or spirituality\nAnd uh and tell me this march since you've been doing this we have thirty seconds before the brunt of your what has been the most satisfying thing you've done ever yeah in this field\nWell unfortunately I well there's two things I'm studying the chart for when President Kennedy died okay because I learned so much about astrology and I was there well I wasn't there I was there when it happened twenty two when I got to do the other is on the nuclear at Atomic Energy area\nLet's talk more about that and take phone calls in just a moment right here on the coast to coast day I'm\nAlways on your bones

H. O.\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news trapped again severe weather station news radio ... do you have\nAnd George already back with you here morgue Lerner the astrologer with those mark how long would it take so much to study astrology if they wanted to become an astrologer\nWill I\nOkay it took me one year was kind of like my graduate school where I was twenty two I was studying metaphysics people like Rudolph Steiner George grew G O o than the ... the Alice Bailey teaching and so on\nUm and I found my mentor Dane Rhodes who are who is one of the great astrologers of twenty century and he had studied not just the strategy but philosophy psychology and metaphysics of sauce [noise]\nSo I read all of his books and kind of memorized everything and the reason which if their students out there of the planet mercury which rules mind thinking communication at the time of his birth and Pisces was exactly the same spot where mine was and I knew what his chart was and\nWhen I started reading his books you asked me about psychic was as if I could hear his voice\nIn my head because we were born at the time with with the planet mercury which is very powerful and off and underrated was in the same spot but any rate I took it for a whole year and then I started doing some consultation work in New York City\nAnd but the point is people need quite a number of years to get really good and they've really got to study much more than just an astrology charts they ... they have to learn what's called transits of progression where the planets keep moving on different levels and be able to do that for their clients\nSince since you've been doing this and what was it that got you interested in it and then something happened\nUm I started going medical uh to Columbia University my dad had been doctor he got sick at one point I didn't know what it was going to do I could have\nStudied medicine in college at Michigan State I didn't do it I was into a all kinds of things like social science and he got ill and I thought well maybe I'll take chemistry physics I'll take all the prerequisites I went to Columbia University [noise]\nUh this is part of the psychic weird thing that you asked me about so it's the first date or the first day of chemistry class I'm living in the borough of queens where Donald Trump was born I go home\nAnd just before getting home ice stopping a bookstore and I find my first astrology book which I mentioned to before astrology the space age science\nAnd it's all about people like Isaac Newton Galileo ... all of these great physicist and all these people had studied a more of astronomy telescopes ballet or and so on they were all astrologers\nBut when the biographers would write about the is fantastic people they'd say oh by the way they had one fault the world went to the phony thing of astrology because the the biographers just thought it was foolish and wasteful and they couldn't understand why why was the greatest scientists before noon sir Isaac Newton studying astrology\nYou know how could that possibly be what what's wrong with the guy\n... what they didn't realize is who was a science it was taught in the universe is if Europe a thousand years ago and it goes way back to all these great ... nations Persia Egypt\nRome ... you know all over the world the ancient world and it was even taught in the universe is if you're up\nI'm going to make your work this hour mark so let's go to the calls we will pick it up by going to Bob in New Jersey hears Bob's birth the December twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven twelve twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven okay more than one forty two in the afternoon now\nIn Jersey City now do you when you you want to know the city they were born in or do you want to know exactly the place they were born\nWell that helps I mean just what you just said you know I'm a what I'm doing is just for people out there are not putting on my head I'm actually type it into a computer [noise] and believe it or not I'm able to sort of get that information pretty quick\nIn and you want them to ask you a question\nUm if they want I mean ah if they can say to you and say I'm interested in this era of my life and then I'll just see what I can\nTell them we're going to Bob in New Jersey Hi, Bob\nYou're\nGood welcome to the program turn your radio down a little bit okay yeah I did that you hope to grade you you're on with mark learner and given mark your birth date for your time go ahead mark\nOkay well if he's if he's not asking a particular question what I can say ah of course this individual is born with a Capricorn son and an areas moon and tourists rising and he's born very close to a first quarter moon I'm a ... as I said earlier on the other side of the hour\nPeople don't often study their moon enough because the moon has a lot to do with who we are instinctively so with an areas moon coming from other lives and like instinctively this individual had a lot of assertiveness and forceful illness and kind of an aggressive\nPersonality and that's important for him to sort of live his life on a on a deep level where he he has leadership qualities developed in another ... particularly in the last life and now with the sun and Capricorn kind of to refine that not to be brash but the sort of\nDo things more um grounded more practically in order to sort of rise of the heights and the planet Saturn which rules Capricorn is in the process of Criss crossing over this individual son so it's an extra kind of\nA this year and the and coming into the fall of discipline responsibility being focused and\nHe should be make sure he's strengthens his immune system and stays healthy\nThat um he doesn't become pessimistic about things um but he's also heading for um if he wants to develop this an another career cycle of the next several years as long as he stays healthy and focused and a has a good attitude about things\n... you have a question to\nUh yeah what what if I'm not healthy now [laughter] well if you're not held on now again you want to kind of like um well my feeling is that people should\nStudy things like use your intuition if need be go to a used bookstore you're you're on the show tonight there's a reason why you got on another people didn't good on um go to our website see some of the you know read about my life the books the philosophies and so on and get into something like that philosophy metaphysics\nAstrology the power of numbers numerology is connected to astrology as well and find something that you can kind of a steep yourself in for a while and that can make you accept inwardly excited and then maybe your health we'll get better\nThanks Bob good luck to you and everything you do would you believe in reincarnation mark\nAbsolutely and I've studied that longer than this and that's part of the whole psychic thing\nWe're all psychic world intuitive and we all live many lives now people are different levels so to speak I guess uh how it would work out of why we would see like an Einstein or gundy are different people in mother Theresa [noise] you know how many times people have been around and when you study spiritual\nThings and there's a whole field of esoteric astrology there's\nA whole other kind of idea like in the Casey Casey predictions I Know you've got a lot of people on we'll talk about the no ... trains and Edgar Casey\nThere's a whole sort of spiritual science about humanity being part of the solar system like we're not just on earth I mean we live in the solar system we live in the galaxy we just don't live there physically but spiritually when we're asleep\nPsychic lead people who ... who can meditate and sort of leave their bodies you know Asheville traveling that kind of thing looser dreaming where are we were somewhere else\nSo that's all part of things and definitely that there are multiple lifetimes than I Do believe very strongly that we're all spirits and souls and\nOr incarnations like in the chart we're looking at the like I said the spiritual kind of genetic code of what our game plan to hire destiny is as a spirit or sold to accomplish something with the sun moon the planets in the configuration that we have\n... under a marine reincarnation astrological you speaking yeah we're the born the let's let's say the reincarnated person and the person before that will who they born during the same time period\nOh no no no ... ... ... there's a whole question about\nKind of thing you know people might in the old days I mean a lot of people thought people would reincarnate slowly like maybe once every century or once every couple of centuries or whatever it is according to the spiritual material I ever had my life\nCertain souls or spirits who are doing work like the work that you do okay light worker kind of work at this stage in twenty first century\nMight come back more quickly now everything depends on getting a body from from a man and a woman being able to come into the world Eleanor suspicious time to take advantage of astrological vibration they're to me absolutely in other words the sold the spirit comes in and chooses\nParents and family based on family\nDharma Dharma that kind of a thing and then you're actually choosing when to be born because there are spiritual forces angels teachers masters whoever you want to call it\nI Know you have a lot of people talk about that stuff hoard guiding and bringing in that entity and then you have your own guardian angel with you throughout your whole life I'm a firm believer and all of those things\nExcellent let's go out to Cleveland Donna's with us welcome to the program that's my buddy Geraldo Rivera is in Cleveland now Hi Donna\nHi I was

I've been saying a lot to to everybody do a lot of deep study you are definitely in that camp because then you're going to have a once in a lifetime Pluto\nA movement towards your son and the next like year or two and Saturn which rules Capricorn is heading is already in that sign them Saturn will then contact your son and then between two thousand nine hundred thousand twenty Jupiter will be there so you're going to have three enormously important influences\nIn the Capricorn part of your chart which is your son sign your character your life force kind of the link to hire spirits what the universe is saying is\nDo some big time study psychology philosophy authors or ... it doesn't have to be a study like that I mean it could be art it could be music anything a hobby a craft an activity though that is deep in significant\nSo that you don't get down on yourself are worried we're stressed out and so on then you do have a wonderful moon in Virgo in on the line called the trying which is flowing to your son so being an organizer this is what you you've done in the past\nEfficiency organization service to other people like possibly other lifetimes where you've been nurse or doctor were

astrology but it's also individuals [noise]\nWe've there's been a science for forty plus years in astrology\nIt was originally called astro Qatar graffiti by a fellow named Jim Lewis who many years ago passed away and it's a it's a wonderful tool but you got to know your time of birth and then we can move around from like where you're born from Kuwait City to California or New York or somewhere in the planet's understand what's good and what isn't a California is\nAnd this is another big thing that people don't realize and astrology every state of the union as a chart like September nine Eighteen fifty California and to the union as a sometime Virgo state with a with a Scorpio moon\nSo you as a tourist and find tourists\nThat's an earth fine and you match pretty well with with California okay so that is a match where you're fine and California's earth fine\nOr good okay you also have a good money aspect in your chart I'm not sure what you should use it for but you of mercury with Vesta\nWhich is one of the four main asteroids that says a lot to do with investment\nSo it's not surprising that you would ask that question about what you know something with money investment so there is something that you're supposed to do with all that\nAnd you just have to figure that out the other thing is you have a a moon trying to Venus which is another potential money making energy but the big but here is Venus which goes stationery in retrograde on friday\nIn Scorpio is making kind of an unusual Lima to NATO Venus therefore don't act precipitously\nOkay in in the near future um and because you emerge reason it's home signed a Gemini you want to avoid those mercury retrograde times they can be good for review and reflection but you want to learn more about mercury its retrograde the power of Venus which is your son find ruler and that will really help you\nMark if there's a planet X out there in the solar system somewhere will that affect things\nIn fact uh see I have a whole thing about here is which has a five hundred sixty six year cycle which is on that note when President Trump took office it's an article on earth Aquarius news it was very strong at his inauguration and has a whole lot to do with what's been happening over the last year and a half\nAnd therefore outer planets even beyond Pluto have are now being used a whole lot just as there are a lot of asteroids and little plants like higher on\nThe chart gets over populated that's part of the the complication but you want to use them judiciously and not overwhelming the chart

I walked out into the there was a long half mile here\nOut from the uh belong to the Chesapeake biological laboratory where the protection early meets the Chesapeake Bay and I was sitting there late at night when I saw a large light heading toward me\nThat was coming from the mouth of the Chesapeake then I noticed the outline of a large disc shaped object\nWhich suddenly dove into the water then rose back into the sky and headed straight for me as it flew over me I saw a bottom panel open and New York post spray me with what I called in the book but tux and shower\nMany row straight up and disappeared and frankly the things scare the hell out of me\nAnd then the second citing occurred on April second Nineteen fifty eight I was returning home from Baltimore because I was a student at the Peabody Conservatory of music\nWhen I saw a large white light harboring over a barn and a few minutes later began blinking on and off and follow in my car for most of the remaining miles Solomon's oh and\nThen it stopped and whole Harvard over another barn than a minute or so later started to perform some fantastic maneuvers in an instant it appeared in one end of the sky than a split second later it would appear at the other hand\nIt does it did this for about half a dozen or so times then it stopped and then suddenly I saw brilliant large red light that came out of the sky and merged with the larger light at this point in my car radio admitted allowed screeching Sam\nAs I approached the protection wherever the light cross the river headed headed south and disappeared and then\nOf that same that same year on November twenty of Nineteen fifty eight I was standing outside my father's oyster house that faced took to the river and about five o'clock\nWhen I saw a a a red street lights hanging over the river\nAnd there were about Fifteen or the co workers with when we saw three slender shake are shaped objects that we're moving slowly over the river to St Mary's county on the opposite side than a fourth much larger object to approach\nHim to come out of nowhere and it dwarfs the other three UFOs as we watched the large jobs you began expanding from both ends at once\nAnd it quickly rose up into the sky at an estimated but I estimate of about a twenty thousand feet outlook to than just changed to a silvery desk and disappeared a tremendous speed and\nThe other obvious solitude and I had all these reports and the night cap and we all know is there a fair\nNineteen fifty eight we didn't have any aircraft that could do that that's correct\nWe should know what\n... did

were there at the time\nAnd um he came in and uh just introduce themselves we didn't know who he was and he never said how I became interested in it a\n... at that time at least and is he asked to see a cases he said that he had gotten interested in was wanted to investigate some cases and uh so he went back into our files and spend most of the afternoon back there and then came back and think this than the left and then\nHe started coming into a\nWashington on a fairly a fairly regular basis even had to come away from Arizona which is where he uh he was the uh atmospheric physicist at the

and in the yard but um he uh it just got interested I don't know what really\nUm um [noise]\nWhat really is interest was at the very beginning I I don't remember that he may have ... you may have told us but don't forget this than almost fifty years ago now\nNo because he committed suicide in Nineteen Seventy one or\nAre you sure he did I mean there was a suicide note and everything but how do we know he wasn't just you know I was murdered\nWhile he told us are doing or his last visit there it was it after he left our our house after staying there ah I'm\nOf overnight a and it was it wasn't that long a month maybe too before um his body was found we didn't know that he suffered from depression at the time\nYou you didn't show or did he\nKnow it didn't show it at all and it's hard to believe and even told us at the time that he had been followed\nA buy\n'em on Martin vans didn't have a license plates or something on them a ... throughout the ... and around Phoenix\nAnd he also said at one point that ah he had a um [noise] some UFO material and um it was flying in a plane\nAnd uh and of black briefcase which he laid down on the on the seat um or or or or or he lay down that popped up against the seat the briefcase was when he went to pick it up it was empty somebody had exchange\nSomebody briefcase way the exact same looking briefcase\nAnd uh\nHe said that he had been a said followed around by an unmarked vans and I'm scared I'm a little bit but he is he's still and and that last visit he said that he was ready to again we're writing his book\nAnd just as they said that a human asking about a month later he was gone\nShot him so they say\nThat that's what they say yeah\nEven done a small grants from the office of Naval Research to the phones Denise\nDid he did I think it was a five thousand dollar grant or ten thousand\nWhich is pretty good money back in Nineteen sixty seven\nYeah back in those days it was it wasn't bad that's correct yeah yeah but uh he had um and actually Andrew I helped Andrew ... quite a bit and writing the book I spent many hours at her home at our home back in the mid nineties\nAnd she when she wrote firestorm and she did a
