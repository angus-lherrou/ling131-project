over to what I could see and talk to earth and spirit\nBabies and children can which she didn't realize that when I was four she started taking me to funerals so that I could talk to the relative\nThat died and Italian ... everybody's related somehow and so you know I was grandma special granddaughter they could come in and talk to the dead the only thing and I was never skill to me I mean the person was just standing there and yeah I could see his body and the gas it but\nHe was he was talking to me and uh you know there was no question but would ask the question\nOr the relative would ask the question what they want her to know and I did not have to repeat it because the ghost heard it but they would just give me the answer and then I Would tell whoever asked the question the thing that scared me George and all of this was\nI'm definitely old enough but that back in the day they had ... these\nYoung they did they did hire people who cried and everything else\nOn carried on they did everything but wrong the floor that scared the ... to me it wasn't the dead person alive person 'cause I never understood I thought they were sick I didn't know what was wrong\nWith that [laughter] did you perfect your skills as you progress or did the did you always happen like that\n[noise] [noise] no I think that the older I got the easier of course it was I think the more you do anything the easier it is and then in ... even though I've done this for so long I still learn stuff all the time\nAnd so it it improves every time I I really believe that it does it takes me about three seconds now to open a white light make a big enough for somebody to walk through I can keep it open fairly long if I'm doing a place like a hospital or\nAn airport or restaurant where there are ten Fifteen twenty goes waiting to cross over the county morgue um gosh there was all kinds in there and I just have I learned how to keep it open long enough\nAnd it was it was the last thing you had to learn how to do this and it was trial and error because I really couldn't ask anybody about it and it's crazy is the founder our youngest daughter terror can do this\nAnd that she doesn't do it my way because she does not want to see the people in our eyes she just wants to hear them so everybody does it differently I think everybody has the ability it's how you develop it and how you use it\nEvery time I've talked to you you've been upbeat about everything you do have you ever been scared to death with something that has happened\n[noise] I ... this past year has been unusual and um I was afraid of one thing oh maybe twenty five thirty years ago that happened a ghost actually flipped and a red handled acts\nIn front of my face\nAnd and I wouldn't want to houses if I thought it goes to kill me I Am certainly not stupid but\nI remember I was in the garage and that act skip the concrete floor and slid into a fiberglass garage door he had no idea how loud that was when it hit\nAnd it was the three steps into the house from the attach garage and I remember sitting on the top sitting down and going maryann what are you doing here and then it dawned on me knock it off because all I'm going to do is give them more energy I Can't walk into a house and be afraid\nBecause that's what they don't eat they don't sleep they need human energy I'm not going to feed them and I ... and the bottom line is your dead nominal live I've got a step over you bud and you know I Can't grab throw you into the light it's still free will\nBut you're gonna leave this house one way or the other\nAnd now that I'm older you know when I was fourteen Twenty one twenty five telling a fifty five five Seventy five year old man this is look at me and go ... Gurley not so much anymore now can I tell them to do something they usually listen but I usually older than all of\nThem have you ever okay have you ever come across ... the double\n[noise] I think that I can see him maybe three times or ones that were so evil that they had come from the black\nCool yeah and I\nIf I ever run across that situation now I really try to protect the family the best that I can and I actually get a hold of a religious person somebody that has more training in that field than me\nTo try to get rid of the devil or the demon or whatever it might be exactly\nThat's exactly right and there are people that say their team and now just like they can take care of that more power to him\nYou don't perform exercises and things like that\nI Do not I people have had um possessions where I had done that and I actually stopped doing that because every time I Would do a possession I Would end up leading somewhere I Would get scratched\nOr or looked like I was ... G want something and it's like oh no no no no no no no don't have to do this anymore and that's again something that I Will refer to in order to increase\nThat's probably pretty smart we are going to

a dime I didn't understand why they did it it's like when you go with ...\nWas being shocked for somebody to buy it out there in LA and uh the person that will take me around took me to this this house of a couple of producers that had a ghost in their house and sell it turned out that they knew who the ghost was which is actually sort of unusual because usually the person\nDoesn't know they don't go right and so and I guess he thought it was really important he says to me while I was a person on the ... whore house he says and and uh and I helped\nYou know work on that and I looked at him and I sort of squinting my eyes at him and I said boy do I have a bone to pick with you and he looked at me I says\nWhy did you put flies in the attic what that have to do with anything and he said we had Fifteen seconds to kill\nI said flies have nothing to do is go I you needed to exterminate or not a ghost person I says why did you even do that it it's like people they just they do

somebody flight Fifteen Years later\nIt maybe it depends on how powerful the individual is\nOkay and then um as far as uh uh uh I don't know what it on the idea of energy shopping or something I've noticed that ah in my shop when I feel kinda awkward and uncomfortable or\nAround people if I think to myself that sort of a White House generating not visible light but then for red warm you know and uh you know not choice to draw attention to myself it calms me down and I think it makes people feel better too\nI think so too I'm reading a book on Frank Sinatra and you talk about energy this guy\nEither way either ... direction I mean he was on or off\nWhen he was on a lot of people love to be around him when he was off a lot of people wanting to be away from it\nWas amazing how that kind of energy works both ways positive negative next up we're going to rolling in Springfield, Ohio we used to the Rockies hey Ronan thanks for calling\nMorning our way to day\nWe are fine thank you hope you are too\nOften Yes sir I had a weird experience at a local\nLike I'm not far from where I live probably rather than our\nHas friends come over the person I worked with and said hey ah or going up to the lake you want to go and not a well I just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up and I just spoke\nHated it I thought well no he goes well you might as well get up and move around\nOn a ... as otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh like I said it was about\nAn hour away and we got up that direction and\nHung out with people for a little while and uh they all want to go to a bar probably I don't know maybe another thirty miles from where we were there and uh\nI was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening\nAnd a wintertime and we got up there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into this bar a they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like every body in there that was in that bar well focused on me\nI didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what the heck about\nLike a bar full of empires from something yeah exactly it's like well I mean I felt like a oh I Am a ... right and up on a rope or something\nYeah and and I I got real aren't comfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not very long ago I Need to go so they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean\nThis was an old dad gummed CD bar yeah\nAnd I went in there with them and to this place and that was a bunch of old people that there again I felt that are in the air and I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I've worked with him um and uh yeah they're to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended a knot where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three is no warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in a car and they finally decided well come on let's go well we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know a war off on the farm and the car won't move forward or backward\nRoads there's like six or seven I was in the car and uh they tried pushing couldn't get no no momentum so they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in the ...\nOr I couldn't walk so I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything\nAnd I think that was you know part of what people were sent thing when I was there you know in those places earlier in the evening and the more time went on time went on I started getting nervous around these people and and\nSo I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was\nAh our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name leaves are\nDoing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer\nAnd it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what this dude and I went up there with\nShe looked at me and I wasn't I offering a word she says are you pray him and I said yep [noise] and she goes even better\nShe knew what was going up\nI was like oh my goodness about ten minutes later here come the people at walk up to the house\nAnd says any luck you know the telephone nope instead and I was like wow that was weird so they get in the car started up and pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that we are that's hard pulled out of the bomb when we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept I just kept that that bothers the Lord Jesus in my heart\nWhich we had these strange Myers about nothing\nIs going to be stronger than the the like it in me\nWhat do you think that are rolling what do you think there are game was what were they trying to do\nA lot I don't know maybe trying to um where they were somebody an do um where they're going to kill you [laughter] I don't think so no I I don't I don't think so but I think they may have been trying to um\nWhen me over somehow or another 'em like they wanted your soul yeah it was weird I I had talked to this only to my therapist one other time\nBut I definitely felt an odd president I'm I'm very uh intuitive anyway\nAnd ah it it just something that struck me as odd\nI Hope you didn't hang around with them any other time [noise]\nUh no actually you know I don't want to run into one of them since then and uh they're still around but I'm a while it was where\nYou gotta you gotta be careful lotta times you people

county morgue um gosh there was all kinds in there and I just have I learned how to keep it open\nLong enough and it was it was a learning thing\nYou had to learn how to do this and it was trial and error because I\nReally couldn't ask anybody about it and as crazy as this sounds our youngest daughter terror can do this\nAnd that she doesn't do it my way because she does not want to see the people in our eyes she just wants to hear them so everybody does it differently I think everybody has the ability it's how you develop that oh you use it\nEvery time I've talked to you you been upbeat about everything you do have you ever been scared to death with something that has happened\n[noise] I ... this past year has been unusual and um I was afraid of one thing oh maybe\nTwenty five thirty years ago that happened a ghost actually flipped and a red handled acts in front of my face\nAnd and I wouldn't want to houses if I thought it goes to kill me I Am certainly not stupid but I remember\nI was in the garage and that acts hit the concrete floor and slid into a fiberglass garage door he had no idea how loud that was when it hit\nAnd it was the three steps into the house from the attach garage and I remember sitting on the top sitting down and going maryann what are you doing here and then it dawned on me knock it off because all I'm going to do is give them more energy I Can't walk into a house and be afraid\nBecause that's what they don't eat they don't sleep they need human energy I'm not going to feed them and I ... and the bottom line is your dead nominal live I've got a step over you bud and you know I Can't grab throw you into the light it's still free will\nBut you're gonna leave this health one way or the other\nAnd now that I'm older you know and I was fourteen Twenty one twenty five telling a fifty five five Seventy five year old man this is look at me and go sure girlie not so much anymore now when I tell them to do something they usually listen but I'm usually older and then all of\nThem have you ever okay have you ever come across from around the double\n[noise] I think that and I keep seeing him maybe three times or the ones that were so evil that they had come from the\nBlack cool yeah and I\nIf I ever run across that situation now I really try to protect the family the best that I can and I actually get a hold of a religious person somebody that has more training in that field than me\nTrying to get rid of the double or the demon or whatever it might be exactly\nThat's exactly right and there are people that say they're deem and I'll just that they can take care of that more power to him\nYou don't perform exercises and things like that\nI Do not I people have had um possessions where I had done that and I actually stopped doing that because every time I Would do a possession I Would end up leading somewhere I Would get scratched or\nOr looked like I was bit GE or something and it's like oh no no no no no no no don't have to do this anymore and that's again something that I Would refer to in order to increase\nLoves probably pretty smart we are going to come back and take phone calls with ... stories and questions was Murray\n[noise]\n\nAnd\nWelcome back Marion ... with us Mary and when you were the consultant to the Gulf shores for television show did you have to step in and go no no no that's not how it's done\nI did that every week and I\nSit there on friday night and watch it and they do it anyway you know it's like oh my gosh\nAnd then people would call me and they'd say why did you let them do that it's like they did it on\nThere and they knew better right of course they will love would call me up to date because she always got her her scripts you know like three days before the new one line which she was good with you she liked ... yeah and she would call me up and she'd go\nYou should see what the heaven me do oh no no\nBut yeah no and she she knew that it was the first half hour was usually over the top the second half hour they seemed to bring it back down a little bit but it got the information out there even if they don't all wasn't as hokey as they made it\nTo Dr James van Prague nuts\nWell no because he couldn't see the ones that they were filming when you mean talking about why not love so we're on the phone spears like the ones I saw\nSo no he was a consultant on the show to are also but he did and\nUh but he really couldn't help set the stage because he really didn't know exactly what the heck they were going to do it's like when we were in one of the studios I'm all\nWe're doing a I'm\nA something for one of the talking head magazines I don't know which one it was and we came around the corner and there was a a myth barber stand with standing there [noise]\nAnd I I looked at her and I in my mind went totally blank all I could remember was Victoria Barclay from the big valor\nYeah exactly and when she was classic actually\nAll while and she was a little whip up I think she was so tiny and so and I'm I'm starring because it's like oh my gosh\nAnd uh and she was found and she was so disgusted the way the movies were being made now the way the studios were acting\nAnd she says none of this would have been allowed in James made the mistake of some one of the cameraman said who is that\nIn James Mates mistake of saying some old time movie actor\nOh no oh yeah you know better than that of\nCourse he did but I think he was just let's get this you know let's keep going\nI literally I I had to talk her into letting me make the white light and go into it\nAnd I she says I got to keep things going here and I said and how's that going for you is anybody listening to you and she just looked at me and I says and how many people have you talked to since you've been dead and she just looked at me I said you have no idea how much better you could do if you went to the light\nAnd she said huh and I said have you talked to other people live people\nShe said no and I said so do you think I'm telling you the truth she said yeah go ahead and make it she says I'll go that you show up and talk about an inch you went in the light so I Hope that one of the people that when I get up there she screams\nDo you remember that movie pulled guys in the the little ... little lady kept showing little I don't go home I won't want why did she say that\nI don't know I I had no idea I\nI thought that they possess during tricked or something some strange way to get the only change their personality\nI Know they they turned it on a dime I didn't understand why they did it it's\nLike when he goes was ... was being shocked\nFor somebody to buy it out there in LA and uh the person that will take me around took me to this this house of a couple of producers that had a ghost in their house and sell\nIt turned out that they knew who the Gulf was which is actually sort of unusual because usually the person doesn't know they don't go right\nAnd so and I guess he thought it was really important he says to me while I was person on the ... whore house he says and and uh and I helped you know work on that and I looked at him and I sort of squinting my eyes at him and I said boy\nDo I have a bone to pick with you and he looked at me I says why did you put flies in the attic what that have to do with anything and he said we have Fifteen seconds to kill\nI said flies had nothing to do was go I you needed to exterminate or not a ghost person I says why did you even do that it's like people just do things that they think it's going to be scary or it should be part of that I don't know where they come up with this stuff\nIs a dangerous Marie I'm to dabble with the other side if you really don't know what you're doing\n[noise] I'll tell you one of the biggest pains in my side is we ...\nYeah I agree with that I had no\nIdea what you're inviting in and it's sad because it's usually teenage girls high school who am I going to go to the problem with who am I going to get married\nTo how many it's going to have seriously\nThink somebody's going to know that and the answer well gee we only as to good spirit to come no trends you right\nExactly and some of these ferrets they came to these girls when they were in high school they're forty fifty sixty years old now and they still have this go with them never married are married five times\nIf it does this go is wrong this person's life for forty years and all because they messed with the ...\nLet's go to the phones Marianne when ... with us we'll start by going to wane in Chicago and get things started are wearing\nA your heart your though who are there are low and I did it goes to go family we love all of you like\nAnyway I'm On this one little like disagree with you I'm Sorry go ahead of you know about anybody have curves put on them [noise] a back\n... back in the back in the day when I was like maybe Seventy eighty before cable your nose walking the religious shows like watching them a lot and these Christian pastor who were sitting on the ... and the thing about these Christian ...\nUsed to like go to sleep at night before they became group of girls who goes ... come out of their bodies\n... would lose for legal mess with people in either people or whatever so they used to do this this is workers\nHere now with the during the ... group the minister was about ... or to some of the people that they went to a time her a lot of fires around the ... like in the spirit\n... ... ... and where we're moving to Brooklyn through they couldn't judge them nothing you could Johnston because\nGun or to protect your actual fire around the spiritual far as what do you think about the\nWell you know what there's a lot of stuff I don't know about and that sounds like it could be credible I've never\nExperienced it but that doesn't mean that can't or\nIt happened but the everyday people that I run into now don't have that ability or that resource to go to so if I can only do the best they can\nYou're generally do every time I talk to you beat Maria I've never seen you down or your energy level you've got to be able to battle these things off you like crazy I bet\nWell I I think I can but I think that he has just been what I I made a good shells around myself the older I've gotten it's gotten thicker and I'm more you know confident in what I Do and how I Do it and they're not going to go to my face [laughter]\nThat kind of happened and I and the bottom line is I have to get him out of I they need to stop ruining everybody else's space to or their houses so and you know you go in the house that mess with children or hurt the animals yeah\nYeah yeah that goes right to the top of my list I go find a house that doesn't have dogs are kids in that if you don't like um you know don't don't tortured the dogs are the kids\nTo the Cincinnati, Ohio with Laura and Laura good morning\nOh [laughter] I was calling actually into from that I talked to her I'm Marianne with about a year or so ago and he said that they were than negative energy in my house and I wanted to know [laughter] and one bigger disaster after the other\nAnd I'm here only anything that I suggested you did not do well we did the same\nThey sound like they're in the back room whatever they might be right or harmony how often much [laughter]", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "06"}
