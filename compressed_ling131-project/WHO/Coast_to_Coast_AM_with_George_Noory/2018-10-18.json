wanted to buy buy that place so we'll see what happens here\nUm I could lose that I could very easily it's to me it's hanging in the balance\nBut filtered have one arrow in his quiver that the state of Wyoming didn't know about\nThe had no idea that I had representation at that\nThey thought that he was just some poor Yahoo out there that they could take advantage of\nAnd this wasn't just any old representation at the Institute for justice has forty four attorneys who work full time fighting for the liberties of Americans who don't have the resources\nFight for themselves when they're unjustly targeted by their government\nThese guys have litigated five cases before\nThe Supreme Court\nIn one form Wyoming's government and didn't know this when they violated the rule of law [noise]\nThey had had a hearing in July without letting me know about it and we'd already corresponded about eight times back and forth you know they knew everything they had my addresses they had my phone number of them the emails and everything\nToday this hearing without me decided since I didn't show up to forfeit my money I Would have been there for sure [noise] and so the case was supposedly closed\nThis hearing that we asked for was just to reopen and saying hey we had been a good contact\nOr you should have been able\nTo notify me so you need to reopen [noise]\nAnd we got out there and it turned out that the judge was on a leave of absence his wife was ill so there was a retired judge\nMilitary judge an older guy Seventy some years old I think [noise] and he showed up there and in the morning of the court hearing all of a sudden one of the senators Wyoming is trying to call me one of the house of representatives was trying to call me\nAnd this sudden rush of interest was an accidental the Institute for justice worked with the publication box to have a long expos they on this soccer come out the very beginning of the year\nThe article I dropped it was like ... oh my God and there's\nSo reporters there and everything and right before that hearing because of this article and all this stuff blowing up I Believe the judge told everyone to the side and said hey let's let's just get this done let's now even worry about why the hearing didn't happen in the first place and not you know let's just get this done\nWe we want no part of this now and I think the attorney general in Wyoming I Believe he wanted it to this go away\nAnd then talk about three weeks for fills life's savings to arrive back to the job before [noise] and I'm at and we in time to be able to make smart studios is

Weinstein were the lord and what do you think happened\nYeah go go go with him going to get into the technical details on this day the outage or actually last that I I guess around an hour and a half and that apparently it was a global outage which is pretty that's weird\nWell it it's interesting because um as we know that the the actual video streams to people from YouTube from different locations around the world that that's about all coming from one place\nBut there are centralized system of course so the fact that this was a global outage suggests that there was some kind of access related problem centrally that causes in my own case it was actually the the website itself wouldn't even load properly if I went to YouTube dot com or you normally get all those little thumbnail\nIt would just get the shadows with typically appeared before the video thumbnail felt that with the it wasn't actually get the video\nSo uh it's an interesting situation apparently uh there were people

I should add so that's a a something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in various states\nThere are there are state use three laws in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fair debt collection factors laws\nFederal um a fruit in lending laws uh and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam\n[noise] well the genesis of this the genesis of this really comes back\nTo sort of a swamp the beltway cup ball of bankers ah which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise] uh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes served\nOn the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the Nexus One this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert lowered a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae\nWho had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system so you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nAh like many of the state run Gehring horse in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for parents who use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy writes a and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices truth in lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow\nGo to a private bank get any private line of credit and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type\nOf loan whatever happened in the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know George ... of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices just so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding has cetera\nCan keep up with their budgets um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse\nUniversity has now Seventy thousand dollars a year well I can guarantee you now you're per year\nThat's tuition room board books um for for your course for a four year college and by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year what happened well again\nThe colleges are sitting in the ... seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing\nTo pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices but also really stream the students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the per year cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories\nWhere people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt ... there was a story just recently where\nA guy walked out of dental school with yeah\nAnd when ... in student loans\nNo wonder ... the belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know it really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um after charge huge amounts just to pay off a burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond a gp Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and in many others about how the student loan problem\nIt's really affecting the broader economy I mean when you got Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off that Ninety million dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses scaling entrepreneurship uh it's really starting to be filled\nAll right we're going to check in with you with phone calls with them in college when we come back\nIf you've got a student loan give us a call if you've got a question give us a call if you're an instructor at a university and you want to just give us your feedback on that give us a call as well we'll be back in a moment with Ellen called engineer phone calls right here on

[noise]\nWelcome back to ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loans scam what was that Alan that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um\nI had student loans I've three reason engineering and um I graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for short amount of time\n[noise] uh and I tried everything I could keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera\nUh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there were student loans is falling into\nA is a lineage system that actually want you to default so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is\nWhat happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and [noise]\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nAh and this was a peace with Leslie stall yeah a a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed I might add [laughter] uh and so it's sort of snowball from there I unfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that'll change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits\nOr have a a very difficult time to make payments\nSeemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick\nAnd by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory or that or gear marked for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got these student loans situations in one of the worst icy are these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them with just what you said they want the default so what they'll do is\nThey'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great\nAnalogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I have no student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look how great reviews you go and if you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no break any wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know as far as know breaks what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know\nUh and in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people ... yeah under privileged people people who\nWeren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a\nAnd lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this ... their life um\nI mean they should be getting lower insurance rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the ... and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans\nAnd it's about I mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the Lenny system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs crazy crazy once once the tuition like at Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number\nI mentioned for Syracuse early is probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools but um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within\nI'd say a couple three or four years I should have pushed my kids' sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart yeah that's right well\nYou know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece crazy\nSo this has just gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college will\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid fine\nJust go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge high on a good thank you I got good news for you too man a throw rally over there and a lot of the other day yeah there was a big signs they throw support the seal day there he looked right at the hold that thought\n[laughter] I Love it\nBut uh anyway I I I wanted to drive a little bit of a trade school to\nA ... a former company I used to work where I got trained on big wildly and when a totally went under the under the concept of a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know that it was a sad time but uh we pretty much going on there and they laid everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people do so I Love the perfect job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone and fast or if I was I didn't have that little piece of paper saying to them they would all too\nWell and I said well for a couple of years you know\nYou probably in more and more experience than most people\nThere and I looked at the local school there and they were to forty four thousand dollars just to go it for oh I think it was a two month course there's no well you know it's like there's no way\nSo I ended up going unless the thousand dollars on the grades loaf are learning to drive semi trucks and then I felt like I got shafted on that I found out that it's not up for about half the price now they've been talking\nA let's get your reaction to the cell and where do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket you know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that\nUh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools\nAre as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly think Alan he's the one that pointed out to me that the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I I already knew\nThat the more you subsidize the loans especially the taxpayer on the hook 'em it's going to crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total that his

Do I got my first time you know trying to work on my bachelors\n... well what ... what these companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the list or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Allen aren't they scammers\nYes there are a lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this UTSA company but there are a million of them and the sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for things they're looking for people who are in the fall that they can assure through\nThis loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan and then get a commission off the top of that uh or they're just trying to get you to read your your loans and so we are consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger alone or and make a commission off of that\nSo I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas first time caller Hi James go ahead sir\nGeorge it's pleasure to speak with you on your way I loved your reading of a growing pose a telltale\nHa that job thank you and I'm hoping to hear more of it before Halloween point though I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a my loans and all or a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off my credit report and lo and behold the same way this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nI Hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information is a hundred percent correct the principal was sixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listed a breakdown of all of the uh uh costs that I've heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you give me do I try to negotiate directly with the the oh he tried to go straight with these people I mean there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a few\nSounds like another scam Alan what do you think\nRight I mean first of all I Would I Would\nNever deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for H. are twenty three sixty six and getting out of bankruptcy rates back\nSo that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third third party collection companies I'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent\nOf the lake it alone he'll take it all the you know that somebody you can do but certainly dealing with a question of like like what you describe it and they get\nThe information Ellen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find these are public jak clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good um but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the new rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to cost onto the process\nBy a friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt you've never heard from them again\nWell you have to be very careful these are some be loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead and you\nCan live on the line at least expect it\nThat's right yeah they ... they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having such limitations these things can follow you literally to the grave\nWell what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent typically for order loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original shined\nPromise [laughter] not at all Allen once again thank you for the information truly enjoyed it up next aliens in the Pentagon hall

there thank you for a job\nHe leans at the Pentagon I Love this title so many more\nOkay it's a essentially it is my new documentary that I put out to tell the story all off certainly the Pentagon's\nUFO program a tip but she can text you alliance that story and and really to to try in one don't humane tree to tell as as best as I can the entire story of the U.S government thorny relationship with this\nPhenomenon over what seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of that\nThey are absolutely staggering there's no doubt that this has been the biggest single revelation in in the UFO community for I I think decades I the only story that I think comes\nClose and I would say this wouldn't tie is the kind of suffocation and release of the British Government files but the the revelation that off to decades of denial the U.S government did have a new effort program off to roll and it was run by the ... super secretive defense intelligence\nAgency I'm I'm from an agency of the day and and you're like you say for years they said no no since project we close down we haven't been doing this the snowy ... or no investigations and of course\nThey were and that's what I really focus on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try to train on tangle the numerous threats to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk of\nOf mistreatment pulls the all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this the robot big yellow a Senator Harry Reid told the loans I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up and how do you track all this stuff is coming from all different directions\nI think the on to that one is is very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely in meticulous detail because I think the problem with this story in one sense for years\nPeople have said the problem is that particularly with the gal them we have two little information about what's going on with the aid kit story with with these revelations um we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's it's just about a case for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just that confusing mass if you if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen they are they a landmark story on this on\nDecember sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out to first than a\nThan a third one but now the public has been absolutely bombarded there thinking yeah well this the videos and then there's this rock stone guy and then this this ... millionaire businessman and and struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's\nThat's what I've tried to do to take a step back\nAnd and give people an overview of this from my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nDo me a little bit more about the film we're getting a lot in the course tonight Pentagon but tell us specifically about\nWell I took a long on on on this one and it was quite a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seats and and you've done this of course has ... times yourself you know you sit in the ... said\nA direct to kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and also the question is this and when you see the final product sometimes you think well well you know I've got edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd\nPut that but in and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon and what I did this I teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would ... the thing so I scripted the entire movie that the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and unfold in that way I have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a recording studio you know padded walls and headphones on and I knew right did the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a direct to who's done a brilliant job of putting it all a together I'm Mike alone I but I was very much in the driving seat having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can while I Can't say gosh this is somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure for me it's a completely\nNew role to me I mean there are people of course who are used to this sort of thing or people like Jeremy coal bellicose who just made a ... a great movie but um you know I I it was a departure for me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish with\nFirstly I as I say really to try to go through some of the the confusion about what's been going on and just tell the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this\nI think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field has is it we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand we go on to all the platforms that the young people\nThe watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days so it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food you and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take their subjects not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd but but too young to get people and and another thing is\nYou know it's been a year since termed along ... had his press conference\nWhere he\nGot together with the to the stars of people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nWhen they ask story I I did ... uh you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon I Wonder we ignite the and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization do nowadays like you like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat when when you say the organization M E T I O right yes\nUm well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this the U.S government has said well it always says in these sorts of situations only as little as possible and\nWe we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know whether a chip is still an ongoing project\nI think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it's still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going\nNow other people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told that the\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back in ... more right here on the coast to coast or you\nKnow you can show up dates

Jones\n\nWelcome back to the cultural back with Nick Nick do you think at all but the alien presidents appears to have any kind of threat to us as a human species\nWell are you exactly but what do you think about the late president Ronald Reagan's attempt to get the star wars technology going some people thought it was to protect us from some kind of alien or intervention\nYes and he certainly made of course those remarks\nAre very famously in front of the U.N Security council when he said I occasionally thing how quickly would we would set aside a difference is down here on uh if if we\nFace some alien threat and and of course people read an awful lot into those remarks and then they saw the star wars program and they read read a law into that to\nMy own personal view is that that was much more about just trying to win the Cold War and find crop the Soviet Union which to be fair is exactly the way it pretty much\nPlayed out I'll Try ... there's been there's still talk of disclosure are you you know I I'm arguing Steven bass and all the time I don't think there's going to be the kind of disclosure he expects\nDo you think the the things that are happening now governmental ways trying to soften us up for governmental disclosure or do you think it's never going to happen as I\nYeah I I agree with you I don't think that kind of Steve pass it um disclosure with the big the my fellow Americans people at the world we are not alone I don't think that\nIn in here they are bringing them yeah\nUm and and we've discussed this before one of the big problems of course is is not saying that there extraterrestrial spot if it turns out that we've known about this Seventy years they can be awful lot of questions\nTo answer about that no I I think what's more light clay and I don't believe either this is a kind of softening up in a climate ... program but I Do think that through\nThrough the revelations about how you tip them through the classification and release of the British Government ... files we are seeing government say effectively will lick here is\nOur data or as much of it as we can release you know without compromising\nCertain classified information I'm ... and and the ultimate irony of all this might be ... genuinely governments don't really know what they're dealing with either I'm which takes me back to the mountain Reese\nQuite won't if we all dealing with some things so above and beyond comprehension let's say it would be an allergist to explaining quantum mechanics to a chimpanzee\nYou never know you you never know when you look at Leonardo da Vinci's works or he depicted things that we have today I'm not sure he knew what the what what he was drawing though when you say\nWell he was clearly a fishing reached genius about time travel\n[laughter] well I'm not sure about that but um I guess there are there are a handful of physicists working on that Ronald mail it\nComes to mind yeah but I think\nThere are some some others or you know I I had a job in the ministry of defense where I was paid to sing the unsinkable so I I don't really things out\nDid you get involved in remote viewing or anything like that like you work with the ministry you did\nYes absolutely we had you can't run a UFO program without finding yourself\nThe the focal point for anything\nThat any any one kind of comes to to government about and of course we had we had people who said that they will fight cakes and they wanted to volunteer their services to the intelligence community to help us well you know locate\nSoviet ballistic missile submarines are on mosques by some ... sort of thing\nSo we looked at this as a classic low probability high impact scenario probably when what but if it does the payoff is so big wine on so we actually did have a program the U.S government of course had three over the years\nWe know about ... some street can ministry to go to the briefly in about two thousand and one\nAnd do the study which which was classified I think he quit you Kaylee only it's a fight and only ministry defense website actually on the national archives website I'm not sure where but it's it it wasn't a very good study I have to say\nIt some of the U.S\nProgram because it was an intelligence program the age old problem they they much but they didn't go out to the people that they should have some of the people involved in dog ate fame and from\nWhat do you what do you think of rumors about the congressional hearing on your phone calls as well the Dutch east\nIn your area I think everybody in my back I tell

at seven use radio ten forty W seeing you know let's\nGet back into these talks of congressional hearings would you think could happen in could happen when\nI'm I suspect now it'll be next year because of of course we've we've just had the bruising judge Kavanaugh um ...\nWe coming up to the midterms but as I say we know the Senate Armed Services Committee and health\nUm Services Committee have been looking for the ... have been doing and secondly I think that interest has said wait until the whiter question or you ate pays\nMore generally we actually know in parallel that that a representative Amy para I think it was a has had some discussions with the chair of the uh science technology in space committee\nAnd and the space subcommittee that could actually be a little bit of don't fight about that I mean that's another\nPoint if this congressional interest which we know Israel\nEvolve into formal congressional hearings the\nQuestion arises well where should those hearings the as I say should they should they sit in the armed Services Committee or in the the space subcommittee or the the science technology in space\nMain committee I think I think he will be difficult to get it away from the military frankly hit with a military and intelligence program and I just can't see how you would get it out of of the armed Services Committee and indeed\nOne of the subcommittee is is is the emerging threats and capabilities\nSubcommittee which specifically talks and it terms of reference about unconventional threat well if ever there was like a forum to to discuss the UAE pay\nA mystery it's it's bad so so you know I I think it ... we know as an absolute indisputable fact\nThat there is congressional in traffic we know that there is lobbying going on for formal hearings I've actually I Can't say too much about this but I I applied some briefing myself and I sit and they said that I'd be I'm happy to to testify if my own experience of having done this for the British Government\nWould be useful um but but watch this space one of the other things which I think it is bizarre and fascinating is I think so far they haven't really been\nUm national daily newspaper reports that are actually going into the fight but yes there is this congressional interest in UFOs and you know all four of those articles or in British newspapers\nNot bothering us one us oh no not yet no no\nThank God we do what we do and we have so many good podcaster who's out there doing what they do to get the word out next\n... absolutely but but this is going to transition into the mainstream and and just this week fortunately he got the ... one one of the things is I Know do some work as a freelance journalist myself\nAh it it's kind of like like we said with aliens and again you know if you don't like the way that you you are portrayed on TV sometimes right you're right in documentary well I take the same view newspaper articles\nAnd this this week I had an article published in the guardian newspaper which is is one of the most respected national daily nearing\nIntegrate on line or two\n... yeah I absolutely as they all have to be these days and and my my own you know in the guardian basically um I expose this the Senate Armed Services Committee and ...\nCommittee interest and I I think that things will be going on behind the scenes as a result of that
