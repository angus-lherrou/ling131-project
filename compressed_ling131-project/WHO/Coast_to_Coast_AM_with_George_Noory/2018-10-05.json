companies together and even one not investing in each other's dream of businesses that could make the world better\nAnd and obviously a top people a lot being there because so many of my friends were there left and they started companies like like Dan and Yelp and YouTube and of course the lawn started tests on space accent\nThere really a Fifteen or sixteen billion dollar company started by the people there and I think it was because there's such a create a place where they all learn so quickly that they could take those lessons and bring up their next company\nPretty decent motivation for this kid joke one deal to keep up with them\nI was just a kid there I was one of the youngest guy\nA kid who will go on to build three different companies Adam ... open gold and palate cheer the last of which is valued at Twenty one bill ... dollars\nAnd with this success Joe now free will uses his own capital and that of other investors at a sperm eight to ... to help budding entrepreneurs to or where to be someone with a dream\nAnd in some capital [noise]\nIf you're going to be investing and technology if you want to have big wins it has to be something that's newly possible\nSo you can invest in Google Now it's probably much too late there's already really go to Google if you want to invest in Hoover or less you know ride sharing companies all different possible for ten years have you tried to invest in your branch ... thousand that doesn't make any sense there's no mobile phone ecosystem when Steve Jobs and\nThese guys ... mobile ecosystem over becomes possible some planning the next few years dots when you have to invest in ride sharing right so the question is is an investor\nIs what's possible now\nThat wasn't possible five years ago or ten years ago\nAnd what's possible now in health care is almost unbelievable\nBy simply looking at a sample of your saliva scientists can sequence your unique DNA which means that they can see the order of your genes and see if there's any variations from what's normal it could be a red flag for a disease\nIn one day Joe's friend ... kill brought him even better news\nEvent Joe I think with the with the latest declines in sequencing costs were going to be able to measure people's rest for different types of cancer from types of cardiovascular thing and it's only going to cost a couple of hundred dollars maybe less and right now in the market it costs six thousand\nDollars to get your wrist measures and no one actually knows the rest of it's only a couple of hundred dollars that it'd be worth it for everyone to do it because you'd actually go save a lot of lives that turns out for example two and a half percent a woman have some really ... percent chance of getting cancer and there's ways this you know that that is actionable you could do things to protect yourself you can do things to\nTo to make it so you don't die is young and I was looking at the numbers of him as a wow this is really amazing and he's he's such a town the guy who build build a top team so it led the first major rounded financing along with another big fund coastal at the time [noise]\nAnd he gives me a few free tests as they're coming out it's like we're just starting to task to try it out it checks thirty seven genes and like you know if you have ... universe certain restaurant not and\nI and I talked to tell her bag Joe's why if I had to test at home and she was like all taking us to see what it is just to support it and she took the test and unfortunately I came back\nThat she has an eighty percent chance risk of getting cancer by the time she's in her sixties\nWhich is obviously terrifying out but there's also the counselors they have and they talk to her and as you know all sorts of family planning revealing that's one reason we're having kids sooner of course 'cause you can\nCan see on her and you can take certain actions to protect yourself once you've had kids and so you say wow this is\nReally important you know you have this gene you better have your family check check into it too and so we had several people in our family took the test you know two hundred dollars each is not not at the cost\nAnd and unfortunately her mother came up having a same game which makes sense she got it from the other side and we had no idea that actually we got some cash on her mom's side we had no idea there was this really high risk and that side of the family\nAnd so the her mom and saw her doctor you know they asked you got to the doctor what do I do know is there anything we should know an doctor said oh wow that's that's weird I've never heard of this before someone just go and take the test but it does seem like a risk we should probably take your ovaries that just in case but you know you're totally find you're healthy I wouldn't worry about it but yeah coming next month well how the procedure\nThey do and so she comes in the next month\nHow the procedure and they cut in and take their ovaries out and they discover like stage three beer three see cancer so it's it's not quite stage for but it's pretty late stage cancers terrifying I mean we only found it because she was telling us you know preventative procedure and it turns out fortunately it was early enough that looks like she's okay right now we've got to cut a bunch of it out\nHow to do a bunch of chemo and stuff but she's doing really well she's here taking care of our daughter a lot and interacting with our family and she definitely wouldn't be here with us today if we hadn't done his two hundred dollar test\nAnd if Joe hadn't invested in this life saving company\nThat he wouldn't have known would save the life\nOf someone in his family\nJoe's mom is gone but she was in the front of his mind\nWhen he made the investment\nYou realize that she is still with you in a lot of ways and the other things that she taught me a call ... made you who you are still there even though she's gone so I guess in some way she kind of still fail her a lot [noise]\nAnd great job as always Alex and\nThe company by the way the testing companies color Juno mix\nAnd Joe ... stories the story of capital at work human capital of we're human stories at work to make life better to add value to people's lives and in the end in Joe's case with his mom in mind to save lives his own families and well I'm In societies\nTo everyone's not just in America [noise] across the world and that's what Americans do that to an American capital does in the ended on leashes innovation improves lives adds value\nAnd changes the world's Joel lonsdale story in a way his mom's story here on our American stories and as always are better health at lower cost\nSeries is brought to us by the great folks at this Texan family office and again that was colored journal mixed color dot com to learn more again Joel ones they'll story his mom's story here on our Americans who are [noise]\nYou know and treat the people involved like their metaphors and and ... and not based on the law are due process but just on sort of emotional\nAnd that's scary because that kind of weaponization of the population can take a very places you know I had to when the Gramm had a ramp during the\n... you know I I thought oh my God\nI'm agreeing with Lindsey Graham is truly frightening [laughter] but you know he basically said you turn to the Democrats and he said you you better not get power because he can't handle it\nSo you know it's pretty scary and I I Will say this I think both sides have increasingly done it and the population and increasingly allow them to those to be weaponized so you know the reality is is is you know these people are not metaphors they're individuals and you have to judge them according to the evidence and according to the law\nAnd I'm now where does this come out I think the capital is going to be confirmed\nAnd ... if he isn't confirmed as some of the moderates hold on it because if you you know if you do a deep dive into his record\nWhat it says he's he's a little bit more loyal to the establishment in the constitution so I think he is apt to bend the law to help the ... the establishment of the government go where they want to go\nAnd that's what's going to get some of the moderate you know problems and so but my guess he he's going to be confirmed probably this weekend and what's interesting about this is the impact that will have on the election\nUm and I think one of the things it's done is it's really galvanized the Republican base because there\nAre you know two weeks ago they were concerned about Trump's personality now you know in his tweeting now they're not they're concerned about what would happen if the um you know if the Democrats had the leadership position\nDo we do we all loses people because of all of this\nAny any time any one of a thing talk and support the violation of due process um we we put our whole culture and our whole system in jeopardy and the whole our whole financial markets in jeopardy\nSo you know I think this is we each have a responsibility under the constitution the law\nTo to protect the law and I'll tell you something you know I went through an eleven year highly lawless process where I was targeted and and you know efforts by government evil to frame me mhm and when what saved me George was that I literally you know I went to the process and safe\nAnd what happened was there were so many people inside the FBI or the department of justice or the different agencies involved or my attorneys or the general population who really believed in the law\nAnd it was their belief in the law that ultimately saved me so we need to believe in it it's every one of us and um\nYou know I think I think that a lot of people uh you know who've allow themselves to be weaponized oh oh ah\nOh an apology to everybody involved or everybody had to give testimony and I certainly think the leadership of the Congress does American apology\nWe shall see how this all unfold gatherings website so Larry SOL A.

just trying to keep balance and stay on the cutting edge how\nDid you end up doing what you're doing\nHow does that happen [noise] well it\nStarted when I was a rebellious kid in Detroit and feeling like I wanted to change the world but had no way to do that and I had a couple of experiences started with uh being somewhere I shouldn't have been with somebody I shouldn't have been with\nA closing time at the bar on the back of a motorcycle and we got hit by a drunk\nDriver through my body\nOff the motorcycle and\nUm I had a real physical tangible out of body experience and watched my body tumbling through the air landing on the concrete and I think there was something in that moment that suggest that any way that consciousness is more than just their physical ...\nAnd then I went home to heal and they had talked about possibly amputated my leg and I laid there and I used my imagination to visualize my immune system healing me and I was you know really aware of the tangles up my leg\nYou know now I have two sturdy legs and I think that consciousness is something powerful\nAnd we're going to talk about you your first experience near death experience you were just a year and a half year old weren't you\nKnow that's true I was wandering around my family's house in my ... jamming and being a good in Paris too which means you investigate everything\nWould you have those little feet pajamas I think so I don't really remember them on it\nBut I've heard tales and ah anyway my father had inadvertently left a can of lighter fluid sitting on a kitchen table\nMy God and you know I did what good Eighteen month old kids do and I put it in my mouth and I ended up in and out of intense\nDrinking I drank it and it causes massive pneumonia and\nAlmost didn't make it so I think that there were some seeds planted then too that got me on this path of wanting to understand\nConsciousness somebody once you were wrong I guess that's a nice way to think about\nYou do know I was born in Detroit and raised there and left there when I was twenty eight years old\nI think I knew that but I didn't remember in town now so tell me where was that I was\nBorn in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights\nA war we spent most of my childhood and then uh my first places I was in Taylor, Michigan Farmington Hills and then worked in all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven\nAnd then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to to Nineteen Seventy eight I moved to Minneapolis Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you know\nWell I was right in Detroit right near city airport and ah it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I still have a lot of nostalgia for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference\nThere family still there\nI have some family um they moved out to Harrison township where I had my motor motorcycle accident\nYou're born I really yeah well you\nTell me where cars you must remember this the the street\nOh I don't I doubt who was ... was it a busy street yeah it was a busy street but it was late and I think the trauma kind of over\n... I'm going to I'm going to close my eyes in yes you'll remote feeling now that you were on telegraph road\nMm that sounds that sounds about right\nNear Michigan viewing skill new Michigan avenue\nYeah that sounds about right\nI Can't remember exactly to say for sure but I'm sure there's records\nOf its roots in your back here my gosh\nYeah well thank you my friend I preach\nSuited ... really steer you in the direction where you are now um and you get a PHD and social anthropology you've just been elected a vice president of the Psychological Association will get into that but is this would lead the foundation for you\nWell I think it really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which you'll remember\nI Do and what time versus the Detroit\nUh-huh good one oh really so that is right downtown yeah um well I discovered to books when I got into college and the first one was Thomas Kuhn book\nCalled the structure of scientific revolution and that book said that we live in a paradigm or a worldview kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history and\nThat was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this you know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that\nUm maybe it wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality\nSo that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen out you're not ready\nAnd I didn't apply for the job at no at sciences but it was about Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe so few university no\nThat's right we're looking at ... personal experiences and from a psychological and\nNow what is the trench personal psychology what is the\nStuff you're interested in George it's all that\nKind of\nNotion that there are aspects of our experience that transcend the physical that people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out\nType of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough to understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr Merrill Lynch lunch bill just like the beer right\nIt is really only\nWell it's you know it comes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but uh actually ... brewery what she'll remember remember the Detroit lists\nAnd so the beer that made Milwaukee famous actually is now Detroit beer at least last time I checked\nThe ... college which we're you know I don't know I haven't really ... up minimum yes well I'm sure\nRight although micro breweries have taken over\nWhat what have you know what have you learned about\nNear death experiences above the other side what what can you conclude at this point\nWell I Know that culture takes a big role in defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment\nThat the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and touch and paste a\nSon that's usually what we see and if we are brought up in a world your culture that accepts\nExtended realms of possibility then we're more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe\nVery definitely that there are more aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody met\nYou people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think they can do some remarkable things with that don't you\nI really do I think that if we start to own the power of our intention\nYou know the fact that the intention is a very important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to make up a path or a plan going forward that's an expression of intention\nUh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve something\nYou know beyond our normal capacity that becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across any doing much do ... [laughter]\nEvery day more and more [laughter] I think there's\nJust so many mysteries and again you think about what these different cultures\nExpect from the world and you know being in the Amazon for example I spent some time with the ... are in Ecuador and you know they really do believe that at night they're consciousness leaves the body when they're dreaming and that\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn ah south central Iowa\nHeavy rain over a ... right now and also a former South eastern Iowa and in North central Ohio others heavy rain over Mason city\nIn ah some intercede song gone I thirty five north near\nMason city as well as in Boone and Christian in Newton it's fifty two here in Des Moines Claudia south when the six miles an hour and the Jim ... is still fifty three degrees is news radio Gen forty double the way to\n\n\n\n\n\nDo\n\n\nYou are listening\nTo coast to coast with George Foy hundred and Seventy five people who do and we had Seventy nine\nThousand at ... dot com my goal of course is eighty thousand people\nAnd we've got a couple or get married it's something for you to meet people who understand you've ever go to dinner with somebody and started talking about ghosts they might get up and leave so you want to talk to someone who understands you go to ... dot com it's free to sign up paranormal the\nDodge car\nScience is doing some incredible things these days to make people look even younger\nAging could make a wish for younger day but since we can't go back in time we turned her products to give us a more youthful look now there is instantly ageless with immediate results on bags into your eyes spores roast beef fine\nLine and wrinkle know needle no pay just a simple cream applied lightly it's great for men and women and can easily be applied before makeup doctors agree instantly ageless works like this clip from the doctors\nBut I Want you want to imagine a cream that can certainly remove your under I bag we're going to put into the past with our good friend Dr Sonia ...\nBought a product or even if it works it's called instantly inch less and the idea that it works very quickly if you get paid a very small\nAnd now and then you pay for you might feel a little bit puffy I had just looked at what's in the product and athletic man and one is called ... which is kind of a ... right now at the tide our posts it actually relaxing also come kind of odd it's meant to relax I work like\nThat and I can literally the ... and yeah the active ingredient and still the case which almost like a clay minerals and they're making the tighter is actually increasing tension on the skin to push that tiny and if that had bad right\nInstantly ageless today go to our exclusive website H.

next like possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because he\nWas a person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment when he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there were plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find\n'em but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he felt that was much more important\nTo live a good life and to be a good citizen I'm to be loving unkind toward other people than it was to spend a lot of time worrying about what's going to happen next and I just thought that's you know it's a powerful notion and he was a great man\nUsed their descended of evidence to prove that there's life after death if you were like quarter law and she knew this was challenged debts was challenged could you prove that there's life after death\n[noise] so this wouldn't make a great reality show and lower you Ina courtroom let's do it [laughter]\nSo you have a judge in a jury and you have people representing different points of view on controversial topics so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWith witnesses that come and go\nExactly giving their own personal testimony based on their experiences we ... put it right there and then you get into this question of what one shift people's mind about\nThat question and is it the data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and showed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting\nYou know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something you know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI I think so too Dr Merrill Lynch which were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after death let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it please and its role but it plays with all of this what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWell I think again we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness\nAnd also our lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts\nWe live in a paradigm or a world of you and the interesting thing to me about world views is that we don't even know that we have them\nAnd yet they're the most important thing that shapes her experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt shaped our experiences and so we can't see those things that lie outside of our expectations\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware and that we have what's called an attentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive those parts of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them and I think that that is a remarkable\nUh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of a functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level\nAnd to the extent we can you know turn the light on what those experiences are and what Shapes Our awareness where are we placing our attention that then offers that's the point of liberation into expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe that the consciousness lives outside of the brain\nI Do I think consciousness is something that has intelligence it is self correcting is reflective\nAnd so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in the forest because\nEvery ... is filled with life and with that intention to manifest life and so I I Do believe that consciousness as something much bigger than our individual brain\nI don't think it's an ... phenomenon of the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like you know the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it doesn't mean you've destroyed the consciousness\nOr the signal or the signal exactly\nKeeps coming ... exactly will will science ever meet\nThe spiritual ...\nI think so I mean I think we're getting closer and closer all the time I just spent time with Sophia the Android she's a robot\nNew Hartford her yeah she'd be great for you to interview 'em and see if they would do it in a way that doesn't give me one or is the talk shows that she's done a good I Do worry you're nobody better than your George\nWe're we're coming back with phone calls your calls next on coast

O. hand on the free I heart radio out\nWelcome back Dr Merrill Lynch ... with us Marilyn in this reality court room how do you think the jury would decide based on his third wife after death\n[noise] I think most people believe there's something there I think people have had experiences that\nGive them a sense of that I think that there are a lot of experiences that people report you know\nBeyond the survival of consciousness or identity you know people ... reporting of like pre cognition knowledge of the future\nUh people you know doing what you did about looking into your mind for information about a geographical location hormone viewing paradigm they're all kinds of experiences that people have had that they report regularly and that\nThe majority of our population in including people with\nHigher levels of education report so this isn't just something that people experience and they have no education and you know the critics would say you know they just don't know any better uh in fact what it is it's something that people have very direct personal experiences about and which can change their lives\nAnd you have written in the book how some people's lives have been changed dramatically through this change\n[noise] yeah I wrote a book called living deeply the art and science of transformation and we were very interested in trying to understand how people\nCan gain a perspective on life that is richer and fuller and less filled with stress and anxiety and how can we do that and we know that a lot of people can become very rigid and fixed in their perspective and opinions but it's also possible that people\nYou know begin to shift their perspective and these kinds of experiences\nCan lead to the sense that the world is more expansive and more complex and more\nMysterious then we had previously understood so we started to interview people about it we talked to the mistakes and we talked to the great spiritual leaders and people representing different kinds of\nYou know traditional a ritual practice type of orientation and and that in that we really created kind of a change model that said to us that there are ways in which we can\nBegin to bring our awareness and our intention to creating our life in ways that are are positive are um imbued with meaning and purpose and that ultimately lead to happier healthier experiences\nHow the younger people react to these things now what do you think\nWell I think we have seen a generation of people grow up with the media with video games that expand their sense of what they're capable of ah there's certainly a lot of fascination with\nI you know horror movies I think you were talking about that last program\nYou know I think our imaginations are very fertile I think popular culture has a way of training us and we know that these kinds of topics are extremely interesting for people who choose TV shows or movies to go see\nSo what's that about you know is that about just something that is idle curiosity or is it something that helps them to take a deep dive into their own personal experiences and I think the ladder maybe what's happening\nWell let's take some calls will pick it up going to Giovanni in Los Angeles on the wild card line either Giovanni\nHey how's it going your great I mean it's been a while\nIt has been a while and I'm always
