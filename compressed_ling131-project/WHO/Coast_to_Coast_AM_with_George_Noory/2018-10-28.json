dichotomy of I'm working in the sports world did by day and writing crime at night\nThey were saying that crime stories are very good because they they come from the parts of ourselves that we don't like to talk about you don't normally talk about\nThe man crying I didn't make a river and thought oh entry into the subject I got hooked like\nA I was I saw a documentary about the murders and all this guy called ... girl living with a mystery it's an extremely well done documentary him far above normal levels of crime documentary\nI was interested in it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was messing which is that it's relatively via a couple of years\nOrders are a part of a series so I started I was just going to put an hour and to and to trying to learn more about the series but the the our became\nA weak the weak eventually became five or six years or so but I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a true crime booked sure yes it is yeah you know and that's the interesting piece too is is that true crime\nYou know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers it was the ... circuit riding preachers the ministers that would come to these towns in on the day of somebody's execution\nAnd they would do a sermon just before the execution that we've tried to provide the context for why this person was being executed in wide the community overall would benefit from his or her death and it became became an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the preachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then you know what this will just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their executions sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early bestselling\nTrue crime near and is it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the tree and you're trying to bring in even though it's a hundred plus years later in some cases you're trying to bring\nA kind of um a a a kind of healing anyway I'm not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved but for these communities maybe this this lingering sent some some tragedy that it happened\nMaybe some closure I'm On a new exactly what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nUm ... there were just they vary that happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who ah was\nA a a ... his great great aunt had been was one of the victims of crime engine and he had always believed\nThat uh uh the man who uh was accused of her murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released\nAlways believe that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it in my book that in our book that uh um it wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief to wherever\nThat was that was a shock to me\nHadn't thought about that\nBut it was it was a shy he said he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a\nA random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually gotten away with it it was this other fellow I\nI don't know why it was important to him\nTo go out I understand the understanding sense it was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it and punished I I've I don't know that there's a lot of different but it still didn't have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think I could go ahead go ahead no no please no a lot of the book them a lot of what\nBook is about is is that all all all good books our church for understanding and a lot of the book is is trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred\nThey hurt a hundred years ago and uh I grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these that these murders occur to him\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's ... it's sort of equal distance from me and them\nAnd that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was a watery or what how people lived that they they lived rich meaningful live\nA ... ... people\nIn urban areas today thank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happened to you and me and people in our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired and they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that that\nHappened ... who happen to us happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture unfortunately it is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they died terrible Beth\nI'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live them and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nAnd I think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling a story in proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere of the town or\nThe um the things that people age or the way that houses were constructed in their communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St story telling and a journalism contracts I that's what I really liked what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nThey ... they want it to that that always sticks with me that it okay to party or just banking\nThat has to do with the the taco in the case of taco invented\nThat it uh one of them I think it was sock oh we had an alibi for the time of one of the crime is one of the crime was committed on December twenty four\nOf I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um a he\nHad a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering a to his neighbors and tallying community um a pickle deal\nBecause pickled ... were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflict in testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty seconds or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in on on ice for a couple of days before you eat them\nSee a ... it's a it's a tiny detail that you would right now or never survive I mean if you would never know that that was true of a ... of the way that the Taliban American communities lived a hundred years ago\nExcept that it's important to them a crime story that's what kinds of stories are these little there's a flash of light that illuminates the details\nOf uh uh or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nKnow that I think that brings us very effectively ... Iowa I'm ended the crime story which as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there is\nA killer on the railway tickets tickets through what happened in ...\n[noise] an an item of June nine Nineteen twelve\nOh the lights were out in Alaska\nWow oh that's a scary Hillary as though you're in ... the same thing just listening\nWhich will be ... a lot of weight shots around here here's your a thousand news radio ten forty ...\nBucks news I might be off the Republican Pennsylvania Congressman Keith Ross was shocked by the eleven lives taken as a Pittsburgh synagogue by suspected gunman Robert Bowers you're supposed to stay\nIn a place of worship here ... you should never have this kind of a terror anywhere\nRoss was speaking to Fox News migrants at the border on President Trump's mind\nThat sometimes it gets up to seven thousand people and I say today they said it's really\nGets bigger and bigger and doesn't make any difference because they're not\nComing in [noise] and\nThe president addressing a campaign rally in southern Illinois Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto as off of the migrants shelter\nMedical attention schooling in jobs\nIf they apply [noise] this is talk [noise]\nTo karate is one of the most influential business leaders in our community is also one of the most well known and the most of a new podcast featuring team leaders in double\nThe seas we was Iranian explores the motivations of made them successful and how they're shaping their organizations are city and the economy added sponsored by competitive\nAdvertising specialty manufacturing\nWhen the seasons we was ...

thirty five when the first crime occurred\nBut I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime was or his secret it was it was\nThe most thrilling and the most exciting thing

know the ... the early patterns or not that tight but the\nThe later patterns get closer and closer to the first crime\nThat's exactly what you're so what are you saying that that that's who he was a that's a Italian new himself I I don't doubt that Mr Miller had been the victim of terrible abuse has young person or he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh\nHe had tiny widely spaced teeth or he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look and that he had suffered terrible abuse\nAnd that the terrible abuse replicated itself in his anger and his outrages not that is in any sense of justification for what he did it but I don't doubt that that was true of him\n[noise] and the the pedophilia piece um especially abusing the ... that's what happened\nUm speaks to\nThe age in which he might have been sort of frozen emotionally which makes me wonder whether and I'm sure you've done and this could have been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to you know just some barking income to the United states\nWell I don't know and and you know there is speculation\nIn the book because a lot of things we don't know about in your interview you can have no answer you're gonna have speculated of answer it's up to you\nI wouldn't speculate that he had never killed anyone before you kill the uh the Newt and family and in Eighteen Ninety eight I I ... I wouldn't I don't I doubt they'd ever killed anyone before that because\nThere's an obvious lack of planning and I'm preparation for the event ... I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I just very much would suspect that he had been added inappropriate interactions with young girls\nThat he had a a while you have if you had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't that like a nice guy and then he says he ... his the documentation of his life around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was\nUm it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried it carried a sangre pretty open by the uh ...\nI don't doubt that there were other violent incidents screwing about it live the um uh but I don't think the whole scenario it come together for him before that\nBut it still isn't that that's a great point what year had he gone into the navy do you know we don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town in which she grew up in yes um and then check what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year there had been something which you know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge\n... joining the navy it was a great way to do it so whether it's just one person who was the victim of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm\nA nurse assist sociopath which is what this guy's sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm sociopaths ... are often rage killers and they they just you know they it it's a ... thing and and they they they just they do it as a kind of relief and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut it was not a nurse if there's a ... because it was not um [noise] it it didn't have any charm it was not it was not a ...\nGenerally as a charming right motives often well spoken truly\nMakes a good appearance he didn't do any of that\nIt was it was a true psychopath a\nPsychopath have no fear ... know norm I Do not have normal fear and one thing with a parent about this the ... the ... and the training that\nFrom his crime he it was not even not acting and fear he was he was\nCalm and the middle of events that are horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with it so I\n... I should have made this other point first the\nStory of a Paul Miller andme after the train is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in ten\nYears or Fifteen and going to say well here's what the James's miss they missed this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed the full story about\nThis this crime and it when that guy Illinois [laughter] and uh the I don't we don't have any doubt that they're going to do that and and there'll be right\nBut we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research capacity so we moved on in front of the book but there is still more story to be discovered there\nYeah it's very interesting a Bill James you really take some questions as sure that'd be great okay so we'll give the phone numbers you're coming up just a second demand from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer or you can ask them about the Boston Red Sox would you also so it's quite a bit of a to\nA and I may throw in a strange question about the Boston ... that's been sticking with me up but we'll do all of that after we give you the numbers for you to join the conversation coming up next coast to coast am this is Ian [noise]\nSign up now for ... zone or free email newsletter get it today at coast to coast am Duncan\n[noise]\n\nMatching forces a serious thing to the extent that you can save your marriage you should no one knows that better than the attorneys at Cornell Cornell\nAttorney CPA choke or Dell\nHas many of you know we represent men and domestic relations cases\nAnd most of our clients are captive to a process they didn't choose if they could have they would have saved their marriage but their wives told them they want out suddenly it issue or the assets they've been a lifetime accumulating what's more important the role in their children's lives if you're confronted with a marriage you can't save we hope that you consider Cornell Cornell\nThe attorney said Cordell in Cordell worked\nAt home and maximize their role in their children's lives contact with domestic litigation from of Cordell in court held who scheduling appointments with one of our firms Des Moines area attorney supporting their men can count on five one five\nFive one eight zero zero zero zero on line and Cordell Cordell dot com that's Cordell Cordell downtown Des Moines court Ellen Cordell six Ninety nine walnut street fourth floor Des Moines Iowa five zero three zero nine\nMessage indeed ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur isn't thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text proud to seven nine six four or five\nThat's P R O U D to seven nine six four or five\nStar to your online MBA information management or business analytics master's program from the W.

America's most elusive serial killer Bill James is the author and it's a it's just a terrific read very good writer a and a and yet you know until bill\nThere was not a lot in the ... he ... his not there's not a name that anybody would have mentioned is being the most prolific serial killer in America and as you say we don't know yet or maybe we can never know the numbers the actual numbers\nIt's fair to say that he was the most elusive in the way in which he operated because he was able to get away for so many years just\nAs you know his vocation was I tend to rent longer but his application was definitely somebody who we came to a town with the intent of murder and got away with it for years because really who thinks that there's people out there that do that\nYou know it means like even today we don't think about these people just driving around going up which Tuesday you know I'm really in the mood for murder but there are there are they get to Mike in Roswell New Mexico by two incidents where I'll be driving through and a couple of weeks\nAgo yeah you know I feel I've got a couple of questions the first of all I Need you to answer for me it again over shame eight and ... like one of the axis\nOf every what\nAny of the actual evidence from any of these crime scenes\nThe uh I wouldn't say so I have held held in my hand the acts with which the Alaska murders were committed they ah it it's still\nIt's still around and and uh has been definitively guide to the to the murders and the uh uh but I wouldn't say I have physical evidence now\nAll right uh you know what this palm will gauge by any chance\nNo we don't it disappeared have ... it was never caught my belief is that he probably went back to Europe and my guess would be that he ... he went back to Europe and continued to murder people but that is speculation and we do not know that for sure\nOkay well that's all I had to pick it up you pretty much got it all figured I figured he might have worked for the world rode out he got to every place that he did and maybe Sunday night where they lay overnight or something like that but ah they can for being on the air and I appreciate your story\nThat you might like we see that hey you know actually that's a really good question though about what was the connection to Sunday's why we're why we're most of these murders on a Sunday\n... what ... what a in a modern criminal investigation if a criminal could make the murders on weekends this is taking to be a sign that he's employed or if a ... and if it happens a lot actually out there quite a few serial murderers who will who committed murders on weekends\nOr the or because they they work during the week and I you know they have jobs go to the um Miller probably did it on Sunday nights because he would spend the weekend working himself into the trap stocking as victims although I don't I don't know that it's a lotta stocking\nBut uh the uh just working itself into frame of mind that he could get where he needed to be\nA ... the ... and we do you think he did was just kind of trampling it as a you know and and riding the rails or was do you think he was paying you know cash money for a ticket to get on the ... these trains all over the country you\nKnow he was he was just it wouldn't have paid cash money for a ticket because he would have been seen a ... and ... and he he came into town\nMade no contact with anyone spoke to no one and this pair that was part of his criminal Jane is they ah they ah but ah so it is his first crime and the unplanned crime and Eighteen Ninety eight they did buy a ticket to leave\nThe town and this this led to a trail forming behind him and police followed his where he had gone on the trains are for quite a while but later he was just it was just job as white used to railroad the always\nAlways used at the intersection of two railroad so that would have trained came by the middle of night he could just hop on and he wouldn't be caught waiting you know if you have to hell rode your last chance a year there'll be you'll be stranded waiting for trying to come here\nYeah this is another thing that really forgot what it was\nNo that's an interesting point then it by the way when I told you about the the people that were murdered next to the railroad line in the town where I grew up\nThey um that was the shoe sure the shoreline it was it the the train no longer existed um after Thirty years or so but he used to be the major commuter rail road between\nMilwaukee and a Chicago I think or maybe even went further up north up to Philly Green Bay or something and then\nThe other point the other question I was raised in there up until Nineteen oh eight or thereabouts\nHe a settled in and out for a period of time and committed crimes there that area after night in a way he started just morally more or less trapping it it became a Nineteen Nineteen awake and I can kind of transition to just\nRunning loose cross the country ... bought an interesting thing is that he never stole money it one of the ways you know it's him as the lie this line well up here in the newspaper story about\nMoney and other valuables were found in the room that and that happens all the time that that that there was a hit he he does not steal anything from the crime scene\nYeah and that definitely is was a ... you know there's the accusation about the first crime that\nAh that that guy little was accused of than it was a a robbery and and it yet you know in the in the same time the let me ask you about the acts so the ... why do you think he would leave the is this the murder weapon at the scene I understand like\nIn the godfather right when you wrap the\nHandle and you drop the gun because there's no fingerprints for them to find or whatever but it would seem like even then that would be some evidence to to look for somebody if they're if they leave the ax behind\nWell up fingerprints exploded in the understanding of the American public in Nineteen eighty or Ninety five and his first crime he just drop the accent left his money fingerprints on the on the acts\nUp mud once people became aware of the fact that fingerprints then he would wash the handle the acts in a bucket of water before leaving at the end the crime they did that in ... every every wherever the second half of his of his career\nThey ah ah which proves that he was connected to what was going on I probably read newspapers knew what was going on or see a but it just dropped the acts because it would have been awkward to take it with him while he was playing or if he once he was out of the house he was\nUnconnected to the murders but if he was carrying an accident that would have connected them to the murder\nWell okay so let me just making an argument for that\nThat that still seems odd to me because you can actually say I'm a longer that's why I carry my acts with me right right I mean that there's any occupation where somebody could walk around with an axe that would be either like firefighter or longer [laughter] the only two that you're going up um\nBuying but they all ... among them oh did he work as a matter but then there are some of the I think he did\nAt the ax is that he used the word they lumbering type of axes\n... uh mostly uh like an act that was found in would pile\nAlmost all of the house and I see murders\nWere ah were houses burn wood times\nCoal a buddy either water coal use an ax to split the wood or break up the coal right\nHe would he would use the coal actually the boy that would actually whatever you've found outside the building\nWell see now that answers actually to my previous question about dropping\nWow oh that's a scary Hillary as

the axes were supposedly taken off of the trains and there was I Believe a total of five bodies found\nAnd um I Believe at one point Eliot Ness when he was first getting in to his position he was

to do it or are you familiar with that case at all\nYeah they um uh I I I Know exactly it it's not Chicago technically but the um it's Nineteen thirties I I'm sure that's the case you're according to its Eliot\nNess a after the uh what was hired to try to solve a series of a ... and I'm\nBlanking out on the name by which the yeah prizes\nCrime series is known but they actually started in Newcastle Pennsylvania Nineteen twenty two and then spread the Cleveland in the Nineteen thirties I wrote about that period of crimes at some length in in a popular crime but that is it's not it's not ... they were\nThey were acts murders that were connected to train the but it it's twenty or the or it's twenty five thirty years after\nThe crimes that I wrote about it and it is not connected\nYou know I'm not sure about that he was with um I I I I knew the case you speaking of\nAnd Eliot Ness what's become the public would have to go to public safety officer public safety commissioner of Cleveland

you're killing a LA enough thought that\nUh and I just real quick about a Lizzie Borden she killed or a she if she did it she used the later the act and you said the other guy used to be blunt in so that would be I guess that'd be something else against it but I Want to ask you real quick\nDid they ever have a picture of this guy somebody could have had to if\nYou're given a description of 'em that you know we had newspapers back then you know we had a you know we had a Morse code and tell a type of stuff like that I mean there had been some sort of a picture circulated or something of this guy right to the people knew about it later\nHe just blew into and out of town and do whatever I Want to know who he was you know when you're when you buy but that's a really big on the crime everybody knew everybody knew what he looked like it it was a very unusual looking man but for some reason that we can't figure out\nNo one ever did that we can fine no newspaper that we can fine ever did a drawing of\nAnd then posted it and I don't know why they didn't do it it was common practice and\nAnd the wild west and the same era\nThe it was ... it was common to drawings of criminal in that

I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're ... let out of jail and then it's kind of you if you can test and said yep was really sorry about that then you know what was the only people said no I'm not going to get this and then I'd never been a which those are the people who ended up dying for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them in any\nWay I didn't write ... avenue wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their believe all the things are told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible of such a great work of a literature in place is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhich the or in the population using under about fifty thousand but balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween or ... ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween\nIs is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see the kind of bumped like that or is it just is like it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of getting a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this this October\nThese thirty one days October oh massively I mean some some only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more and more a year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the stuff but for the maritime stuff demanding restaurants in the ninth largest art museum by area in the country\nSo they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their host or to pull a tourist and still happens the biggest one is October which\nWill never go well\nI really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a boots at a state fair and they can make their entire year in the weeks that the state fair is open so I I I Would never guess their shops that are just open for one month in in ...\nYeah but it but other than realizing there's so many tourists coming to say I'm over the course of a year\nBut now we're certainly open longer so if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museum so so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round that film Rosen becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what\nAre the rules a leg or curbs that they that are either written or unwritten about how people are too you know ... or to or how they want ... just to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that is figuring that it actually around that time of year there's not that many curbs but in October for instance they are the barrel route the seventeenth century a graveyard right in the middle of town and Salem and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\nBecause it was just getting over on the people were like using the grave as you know picnic table and climbing on\nThem and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual\nHistorical artifacts that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar in federal part of you couldn't be on the streets so they'll shoot fireworks in the air to kind of how people have the nights over start start heading to the train to start having their cars so there that's\nReally good at ten pm\nYeah I Believe that the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to get for pushing the hundred thousand people to the train and it takes some time so by midnight nobody around an aloe and\nIronic that they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the ... hour\nYeah yeah it was [laughter] it just gets bad [laughter] really bad that\nThey got to get them up

after a gunman stormed a synagogue and opens fire we are dedicating\nThe entire resources of my office so this federal hate crime investigation and prosecution\nSaturday is a pack a tree of life congregation in Pittsburgh a\nAnd one of the things I learned that such true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy\nAnd proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder and the prosecution of potential murderers\nSo the result is a resistance to the expression of sentiment you know the the or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial\n[noise] this is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged in allegedly and how it is choose mainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means stories that inflamed the senses right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses\nEmotions over information risks riling the public up unnecessarily and at one point by the way this is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history not even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a mocking bird\nOr white or black Lynch mob justice\nIs the opposite of the rule of law and journalism understood its place in keeping the public informed but at the same time call\nAnd letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part in the injustices regarding the story\nOf the men from the train [noise] uh but this is the same reason that love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting can go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime is allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to to crime before her death I interviewed I'm a true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing an\nAd rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric the focus on the acts of the killer or a fetish size the details of somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn\nRight they're really into all the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think so I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead\nIn a synagogue where they should have been saying the root cause sham that not run for your life or\nAll because of a story seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell and the unintended consequences that can happen\nOr these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine when we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up torch bearing mobs right\nIntent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes\nTo conspiracy theories as well I'm not waiting into a debate but who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly\nThe majority of the blame rest some the trigger finger of today's shooter but take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind\nYou'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's many other stories in the news this week that attest it up so\nNot everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such things I've ever happen not everything is die hard to not everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about it in fact the media\nWould be focused on what isn't just conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy that old radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today so\nI ask you whenever you talk about murder\nWhenever you talk about up people who you believed to be guilty of some thing\nStave victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today\nSay a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThat even though the story is over a hundred years old it's still not too late to get justice next on
