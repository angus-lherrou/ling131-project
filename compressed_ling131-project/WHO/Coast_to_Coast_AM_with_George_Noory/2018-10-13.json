{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WHO", "content": "So then I I get right outside their house and I finally\nGet attacks from Pam and she says daddy's sitting up in the bad eating breakfast [noise]\nAnd so I said what would it be okay for me to come in and visit with him and she said absolutely please come and so I went in the house and they took me back to the bedroom and there he was sitting up in the bed finishing a McDonald's biscuit that somebody had brought to it [noise]\nAnd then after he finished those ... said where's my donor\nAnd he shared a doughnut and a cup of coffee with me one of the first things he said to me was Jeff\nI Need you to do me a favor I Need you to tell Larry stay gay that I'm probably not going to be at my post Sunday Morning [noise]\nAnd I said Mr Earl I'm not going to tell area thing [noise]\nBecause what I saw yesterday at what I see the day you're liable to be there on Sunday Morning\nWell he had the last word on that\nAnd he was right let me ask you how many people do you know are getting approved for serving with children when they are eighty three years whole\nPearl did two thousand fourteen just three years ago at eighty three he signed up to serve in our children's ministry sports camp\nAnd then in April of of this year at eighty six years of age Earl venture responded to the color of our church to make room in his heart\nFor more people\nAnd he did so by signing up eighty six years old by signing up to serve on our greeter team and less than two weeks before he died he was at his post\nIn is scooter\nAt the equipping hall entrance making people feel welcome does a came for warship\nPearls hardest service well marked his entire life\nBut folks this is not just something that Earl had learned to do in his old age\nAs a younger man when ... was located old spillway road is pastor said many times he would take his lawn more up to the church and for years he mowed the grass at the church he was known by the children there is the candy man\nAs they knew that he had some sweet treats in his pocket and whenever they came to church he would always bless them with some candy and I've thought a lot about the way that oral Fincher sir [noise]\nAnd it occurred to me that there were two qualities of his life and they're going to have to be two qualities of any person's life is going to be devoted to serving others [noise] quality number one\nIs he a surrender [noise] his surrender [noise] I remember the story\nOf when king David was about to die and he was about to hand the kingdom over to his son Solomon the last word some of the last instructions that David gave to Solomon and first chronicles chapter twenty eight or nine were this\nAsk for you my son's Solomon no the God of your father\nAnd served him with a whole heart and wailing mind\nTo serve God with the whole heart into willing mind implies that you've already surrendered\nTo God to let him lead your life and so I asked are all on Tuesday Morning\nOr when did you open your heart to Jesus when did you surrender your life to Jesus Christ and Earl shared with me it happened when he was about junior high school age\nAnd he told me that he a turn for missing and he had trusted Christ as a savior needed surrender do is is life to him folks have is about Seventy three years ago\nWhen Arnold committed his life to Jesus Christ and so if you do anything for Seventy three years chances are you're going to get pretty good at it\nJeff shares the second quality Earl head that helped him serving others\nBut there was a second quality needed if you're going to serve others and that\nIs selflessness of selflessness about\nYou serving others doesn't always happen when it's convenient for you [noise]\nServing others doesn't always fit in with your time schedule\nOr when you think it ought to take place\nFirst Peter for ten reminds us to use whatever gift we have received to serve others\nWhatever give the Holy Spirit has given us where do you use that give to employ it in service to other people and to do this requires an attitude that says put others first\nKaren shared with may just the other day that she can never remember a single\nTime in her life when she needed her daddy [noise] she let him know and he wasn't on his way to help her [noise] he was always\nMaking sure that he did everything he could\nTo serve and to bless his family he was a hard worker Jordan is oldest granddaughter shared this she said in her twenty nine years\nHurt granddaddy showed up at every recital every ball game or anything his grandkids were involved in and then it didn't start with that generation his great grandkids can ...\nThat is the same thing with him just about a week before he died when he was so sick or I was sitting at the ballpark cheering his Joshua on in his baseball game selflessness\nYou finished off with what or would have desired for those are the service\nAt a very real sense oral didn't want this to happen they said just let us see come and pick up my body and let that be done he didn't want to have this gathering and I told the family this isn't for you know this is for you\nBut I Believe that if some way Earl could speak to us right now he would say did you do make a fuss about may tell everyone about my Jesus\nHe's the one who made my life worth living you see are all\nKnew the joy of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and that would be ... desire for you\nToday so close and as not close I'd like to read the scripture the family chose for today they sent this to me in a text on friday

amount while the one on the website that folks can see the number one slot went for a jaw dropping twenty thousand dollars\nUnbelievable yeah yeah pretty amazing stuff are really just just remarkable I guess if you want to own a piece of paranormal history it's going to cost a little\nBit that's the way to do with Tim we'll talk to you next week ...\nSimple all our editor it's coast to coast am dot com he works with the Sean and lax and so many other great staff members [noise]\nThere's some exciting news simply safest now valued at one billion dollars this company used to be just five guys

every ... going on and see the car and get everyone on your nicely nice pricing paid even more risky reborn five ... for every one of the rock star cartel there's any doubt ... figure he'll smaller prices\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there was there they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits\nAre but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while usually these things happen over a period of time\nPeople who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional energy drugs or something I practice something called modern actresses and\nAnd that that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energy is which are unseen but we feel ...\nAnd ... it accumulates and the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative\nSpirits and so they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homeless we clean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpet paint everything\nBut we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments and generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nBoth kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea that first negative emotional energy has to be removed\nBy somebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes\nThe spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first sometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent trees say Sean\nAnd freeze exercises I don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic\nAtheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clarion wasn't touching anybody anyways it's really it's not necessary\nThere's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level it doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us\nIs a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it and it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the\nWorld it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know sometimes there are already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack\nAnd so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have it cleared out once and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies their energy fields\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of the living environment so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply clean her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion and not the only one\nOr that are qualified extra assistance just about every religion\nBut the ... but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that I get people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI help everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of working past lives\nUm I have deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are this universe I said before on on one of my appearances universe is teeming with life you asked me that question\nTo know do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with Christians which calling me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know it they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs help hold on for the rest of the ah we're coming up to the top of the hour we're going to come back we'll talk more Jeffries website starkly or dot com his book is called power

I mean there are thirty or thirty\nWait Joe ... and I arch radios and on your age the radio ...\nMorning doubled you wait Joe\n... American pastor Andrew Brunson released Friday after two years detention in Turkey in a state but they can President Trump for helping to free him with the president saying it was just diplomacy\nThis for years and years and years for use all invitations I finally\nUh they talked me into and I said fine actually stayed over in one of the rooms just they're beautiful you know and ah so ah it was essentially set up for ... to go in and\nUh with real quick and then in and take a look around and everybody everybody found something people who didn't believe in ghost had you know one couple said their hair dryer when flying across one of the rooms and I was staying in most haunted room of all they gave me it was actually the nicest room too but\nAh the first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get some business cards from people on it and uh I was in there you know by myself and it was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called in\nThe fashion learn but very heavy gold she was called the gold room and it went up to get my business cards and this she started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast right in front of me just\nWould not stop I just said you know oh I just you know forget it I went to get my cards and paid no attention I said you know\nThis place is really haunted and the third night I was there um I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters warning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't bite media\nPeople home negative spirit's just new will it\nJanelle to get you later so it was sleeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and I'm Out four feet above me was the misshapen spirit just terrible looking now\nI'm used to know spirits can assume any shape they won so I don't react to the ... you know the say the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately\nOr what this thing was doing was it was singing\n... song\nThat I'd never heard\nReally is I Can't it's strange possible\nTo describe it was not any kind of it sounded like some kind of evil lullaby\nIt was right above me and and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in in the bed woke up and the spirit was was singing hello Patrick week and I could hear it loud and clear this horrific song slowly and I just I you know\n... shot up immediately got up out of my bed at ... kind of went right back into the wall immediately because I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was I did I have no idea how long and had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I had to change me a from being very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick\nI sat up immediately went to the chair sat in my room and he said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at this time I\nWas just you know sleeping after her night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a sneak using and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room you\nKnow you you just have to learn\nAn extra assist is not safe I don't go into homes and uh in in to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits and somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople say so I I go completely on the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely on the clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away a you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly you know in\nTimes immediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clear I mean I Do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone\nOr you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just working negative environments and they need a clearing\nAnd and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I guess that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting\nI feel better at work I'm Better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling drained because they're not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always know what it's subconscious and so people don't know that are getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them are on negative spirit\nAnd so you know people call me families call me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's a media but I always get a caller and email thanks a lot Jeffrey really\nReally helps you know\nVery very seldom out of the thousands of clients that I've helped or the last almost three decades now\nHave not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things in forty five\nMinute already find different things so remarkable it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing as different George depending on what is going on with the client and may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or\nAround ... people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common uh you know and I don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on a business\nOr a house and so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family more arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirits and demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people thing\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep\nMeaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy and also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople go to school I went to this this is the same school both elementary and high school that my parents went to\nIts old very beautiful but I mean think of the moon Leonard she didn't hurt me later and so people will be calling uncomfortable\nThey don't know why and the body picks

able to defend themselves which unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues\nPhysical brain problems a depression anger issues unhappiness\nOr overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that dividing line\nAnd being able to reach into the physical realm and affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across in damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is is not so much of an immediate dug but actually\nBeen working on them for a long time and they can cause physical injuries even happened to me once you know I I woke up\nOne morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work or doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew it I could feel its power suddenly a light shot out from it hit me right in the back\nAnd it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and drive to the hospital and you know have looked at in a you know get some light medication for it\nBecause it ... the demonic Stewart had pulled the muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself so all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is the you know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be a physical because demonic spirits studying how to do these things the non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark rooms that are negative\nVery negative what we might call help and and especially that is very connected to the physical realm of the physical realm as something like the crust of the bread and heaven and the other side being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to the gym in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n... on my question is is\nIt possible for one of these evil spirits to quit being evil or you know the\nTrip pan turtle I gotta go to the other side gets off drugs\nSo many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing exercises ... and teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help the spirits and I said what I say no I Am not a spirit psychologist uh it's\nKind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to ... still your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about while you steal things it's not my job you don't have time for ...\nThat actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are homeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things\nAnd trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me I work for them\nMy job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields I don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that any more than a a physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy in the person who's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's not everybody's disaster anything we just have negative energy issues and also getting if there is some kind of negative spirit\nBut not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or ... or ... whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual is hey\nThis is my main concern not dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions sisters out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things and one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't or other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get rid of them\nGeorge I am I was born with it and at first it was really scary because when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm a mom for that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all this kind of stuff at first it was real scary\nBut actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things in past life helping people that to me is the greatest gift or I could ever be given is the ability to help people it's dangerous work\nBut the idea is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so dream\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they love it\nYou know and it it's just great to hear them say

Prozac panacea\nDora and for Thirty years his research government approved scripture mind altering\nDrugs regarding your previous guest she actually says that ah and I have a name for ... which is one of the holy Bible or pharmacology\nI Believe and [noise]\nAnd he said that that actually among some of the bad effects of these government a per prescription mind altering drugs recruiting efforts horizon ... or that they create\nActual portal or negative dark and even demonic spirits but they also a interfere with people's ability to\nHave a spiritual\nThing positive spiritual experiences including belief in God some people when they go on the trucks stop believing in God [noise]\nThere is a boy who is featured in a Youtube video and like Tracey and I hope everybody can watch why it took them to school and in that he is uh basically describe this way he went on these medications um\nWas waking dream state\nAnd he he didn't know the difference between reality and um you know his delusions and what he was doing and it almost ended up very tragically hit it going to jail for this boy\nPeople do yeah but he he later you know got out or because the people knew that there is really something wrong this this boy didn't belong there they didn't believe that he really was responsible for that and sure enough you know it was going to the medications that he\nHe did but they believed him\nBut the people believe him yeah and and what I'm what I Want to talk about is what he believed that he was experiencing in this waking dream state\nWhich is common and trace is about all these cases and even which includes suicide and domestic violence workplace violence she said only suitcases with the school shootings are involved for kids that were not\nOn not on these drugs\nAnd so the bottom line is what I'm suggesting is that it's possible that because some of the side effects are a dilution hallucinations and I am black Tracy has a false memories center article\nAbout a Roseanne Barr who accused her parents of molesting her\nAnd later and that was after she was on medication that is right and then later she\nShe realized that that was not correct it all and she was really certain that it had happened but uh but but then you know she\nAnd she would only ask one off of that you would have passed a lie detector test because she believed it\nExactly and so this is what a I think is important for people that know and and has has a documented thousands of cases over the thirty years of the things and what I'm saying you know in in my previous call and I I didn't get to\nInclude all of this but I but basically I had a dream in which it was very vivid\nI had mentioned that you know I was told by somebody who had a twenty five days before that he would feed me and Thirteen months and I said how do you know when he said the holy ghost told me [laughter] and\nAnd I I you know I knew it was a dream and but the ... I didn't I didn't know when I was dreamed that it was a dream and it wasn't a loose a tree but afterwards I woke up right after and so sure enough that was only a dream\nBut what I'm curious about is\nSomebody like Dr Ford in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all but she has and consuming news drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with\nA well he can dream surely she hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on 'em\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on any mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ... I've seen in in that case\nThat never came up but ah I'm sure that's a possibility or even though we don't know for sure what it probably happened key thank you for that when we got open line calls let's go next to Jason in Bowling Green Kentucky west of the Rockies Hi Jason\nYou know and you're okay where you\nAre I'm In ... um I had a I'm well thank you and I couldn't believe it I saw before I had a I had done a little bit of the ... and I had gotten to read the Bible a little bit you know\nAnd um and I was in a bone in my life where I didn't really know if God was real or if the devils real all this you know and I started reading the Bible and everything\nAnd then I'm going back to the point when I was out of you know whatever and uh uh as God and I was like ... ...\nYou know your real angels on everything Israel you know show me because I Would like to know I Would like to believe what so ah it's probably ... ... at first nothing really happened except until about a week later than what happened when\nI started seeing these little things like with people like um beagles like these little spinach and stuff and I'm a well I I think this one guy had three of them right and it seemed like everybody and he had freeing the everything he did he touch was no\nI mean you have a one line in you know what I'm saying in and then I think it's one can't he didn't have none okay now these kids that you know a a glass of water without\nKnocking over something breaking it it's something\nTold me that he was willing to get an angel [laughter] but he just didn't have one at that time and I'm leaving it was kind of be just to show me that you know how it works or no and then so I bought a church in a\n... a chemical about it and he was telling me oh you do you go to church you find stuff\nNo and I'm so we go to church\nWell why would they church I won't eat them and I started the ... will will be angels like\nIn the church all over the place all of them\nAround it you know he's like there was a state of behind the Greek you mean um [noise] then you'd call around it\nI had never seen anything like that you know like we will be I mean we think it was my early ... foot tall seemed like\nWaste your time and we won't be either from contests too breaking news alerts sprinting us on Facebook get you a\nAnd we promised no basic science\nSneeze I'm Carmen Roberts the American

rolls\nOver for Tuesday's drawing was six hundred fifty formula [noise]\nSaturday October thirteenth what's new today on the free I our radio as a a\nOnly lasts for decorating the house or just setting a scary movie [laughter]\nSo there's such a thing or a theme of being naive you know you walk the walk into a certain night club then you know it's like expecting people not to be on the trunk or using drugs that's right that's right\nAh but the second thing with that I'd recommend a if you haven't seen it I don't know if you've seen the movie a burn a burn after reading with the ...\nBrothers no I have not\nYet if you can check that out it has spread to George Clooney charm now could fish\nBut what happens is all the characters have a carefully crafted lifestyle and something happens that really like ... or um you know and what they were doing and then they get paranoid and I go into a tailspin\nAnd I can relate this to like road rage I think like from what the guest was saying sometimes people on unfamiliar territory maybe they're not used to getting into a road rage and for them and then what happens they they become like you know and ... almost like the ... got them\nAnd if it was like a more common a car and they ... the is a\nMore more familiar territory they react maybe more calmly\nRoad rage is unbelievable how\nI see it happening all the time it's it's worse here in California than anyplace I sing\nYeah it's pretty bad here in New York but the movie is burn after reading George and I'll give you an example\nGeorge Clooney ... and the movie as a CIA agent but he never actually shot someone\nAnd he gets into this minor thing what Brad Pitt's character shoots them kills them and then after that like he was just like paranoid like all that everybody find out I did this like\nReally good acting performance but you know it shows you how how we had a set routine and John do all the time at a certain time of day\n... location and just this one and for that so to start his lifestyle and it's routine\nI bet it would not do when did they kill off Brad Pitt no movie earlier or later\nA little bit earlier surprisingly commit why\nThey do a flashback kitty came back in or or that was it for a no\nNo ... in other words if that was it for him\nThat's he's laid out too that when ... know them around here\nNo All right Thanks Joe I was a that's Apollo launch a couple of years ago\nHere and Brad Pitt walked in he's from Missouri to and I said hey I'm from St Louis introduced himself to be nice guy I mean very very pleasant and then he went off on his on his way text and tweets Tom what do you have force\nTweet from October Baby George ... maybe that's what he or she says October Baby George what's your biggest fear\nMy biggest fear honestly I

and I'm gonna miss miss him dearly\nWell he's out there somewhere you know that he's here with us now yep absolutely told me about the watchers\nThe watchers incredible story very much very controversial of course there's a wide range of of viewpoints on the watchers ranging from the third demons they're evil they're controlling us people want to know\nThat is their mission and along the way they brought with them they're a sentient teaching state the the ... are very clear that some of the watchers brought in various crafts and technologies with them they clearly taught humankind how to use various tools and\nAnd other implements but along the way they also\nAnd this was a big beef that the church has with the watchers they taught the secrets of heaven and the secrets of heaven are how humans can transform into angels\nRide the cosmic conduit and dwell is God's throne and that's the really big question right there George why would any why would the church have a problem with this why does the establishment church have a problem with a group of beings coming to earth and teaching humans to become angels\nYou'd think they would welcome that\nYou would think they would welcome at the problem is is that you've cut out the church in the scenario you have no need for the pope's and the priest and the whole church establishment because in fact the church doesn't teach\nYou can do it on your own right\nYou can do it on your own and that is the big question can humans\n[noise] take it upon themselves to perfect themselves as the term to become more whole to

to know about these are the secrets of the aluminum ... ultimately\nWell you mentioned something to is there any evil it all connected with the watchers\nWill there isn't in perception I mean the the the the scenes work absolutely clear and their writings that there are two currents or forces of the watchers one was represented by ... Michael who's also sometimes referred to as milk he's a duck\nWho was who established the priesthood which Jesus was a member\nOf the other current or force is led by ... who was referred to later as the anti Christ and they were they were both of the belief that these two forces are currents are active in our consciousness at all times this is kind of the Christian concept of the devil onto your ... on one shoulder and the angel on the other\nAnd it was all about harmonizing these forces and recognizing that through our the power of our own consciousness and our own thoughts\nWe can actually become angels\nIt's an amazing possibility or how did you uncovered this\nActually been on the trail of the watchers for some time I mean I've been of course on the on a knock you trail for Fifteen\nYears or so and then I started researching the Sarah from several years ago these are the highest order of angels and they watch or guard God's throne and in fact during the ... it was a belief was developed at the sheriff and we're actually humans\nWho would transform themselves into angels or affected themselves that the book of papers described the heavenly thrown of God referred to as ... and they tell us that it's inhabited it's an avid I joyful angels and the angels are the lord the watchers and just humans may perfect\nAnd I'm reading this and go why are these people ... what if they know how they affect themselves how did they get to turn into angels and go into well in God's throne and can I can I and that's what started me on this real path of of tried to uncover the secrets of the watchers\n[noise]\nWell I never knew I had margins in my garden and and I never knew there were aliens on my ...

every one of the rats or cartel there's only four figures the smaller pie\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there is there they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits\nAre but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while usually these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed\nPeople who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional energy drug or something I practice something called modern actresses and and that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that\n... homes because people have lived in there that generate both positive and negative emotional energy use which are unseen but we feel about them and it accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments in so doing negative spirits\nAnd so they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homes we\nClean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever and it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me\nFrom the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest is Adam ... would you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a free is I Would say that I'm an independent priest say Sean than priest exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all\nPeople calling me who are agnostic atheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and ah have your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clearing so I wasn't touching anybody anyway it's really it's not necessary\nThere's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level it doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know some times are already in the home sometimes\nThey come into the home they sense of family that having a problem\nBecause of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it it's called maybe a professional habit we're one and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nAnd also how to maintain the clarity of the living environment so it's kind of like having your carpet cleaner come in first and then you can if we create our own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion I'm not the only one\nOr qualified assistant just about every religion\nBut the but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well like I called you know a local parish even though I'm not no I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI Hope everybody so I that's why I don't belong in the religion but I remember doing this kind of work and has lives um I ... a deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around the stars are planets and there are this universe I said before on on one of my appearances universe is teeming with life you asked me that question\nTo know do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working with Christians which haunt me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs help hold on for we're at the ah we're coming up to the top of the hour we're going to come back we'll talk more Jeffries website ... dot com his book is called power protection will come back and take your calls as well perhaps you've had a demon exposed situation should that with us too [noise]\nCalled national debt relief at eight hundred six eight three forty five forty six eight hundred six eight three forty five forty six eight hundred six eight three forty five forty six\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back Jeffrey Schumann with us we'll get to your calls as well as we talk about demons demonic possession what has been for you Jeffrey the scariest or even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in with this\nAh both a just a few years ago um I did a three nights a stand essentially a legitimate haunted mansion and it's very famous I won't mention the name but um it's something I was\nAgainst for years and years and years for us all invitation I finally\nThey talked me into and I said fine actually stayed over in one of the rooms just beautiful you know and uh so\nUh it was essentially set up for Gulf countries to go in and uh with real quick and then in and take a look around and\nEverybody everybody found something people who didn't believe in ghost had you know on a couple of ... their hair dryer went flying across one of the rooms and I was staying in most haunted room of hall they gave me it was actually the nicest room too but\nUh the first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get some business cars are people on it and uh I was in there you know by myself and it was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called the bachelor but very heavy gold she it was called the golden rule\nAnd it went up to get my business cards and this she started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast\nRight in front of me just would not stop I just said you know oh I just you know forget it I went to get my card paid no attention I said you know this place has really haunted and third night I was there um I was sleeping\nAnd uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters warning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't bite me yeah they'll follow people home negative spirit just they will get\nYou know that gets you later so I was sleeping\nI woke up about five o'clock in the morning and I'm Out four feet above me with them is shaping the spirit just terrible looking now I'm used to know spirits can assuming the shape they want I don't react to this you know the say the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately\nOr what this thing was doing was it was singing\nAnd ... song but I'd never heard\nReally I Can't it's strange possible to describe it was not any\nKind of it sounded like some kind of evil law by\nAnd it was right above me and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in bed woke up and the spirit was was singing hello Patrick week and I could hear it loud and clear this horrific song\nSlowly and I just I you know ...\nShot up immediately got up out of my bed it's kind of went right back into the wall immediately 'cause I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was I did I have no idea how long it had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I have to change me a from being very happy and we've been very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick\nI sat up mediate Lee went to the chair sat in my room and he said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at this time\nI was just you know sleeping after hard night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room\nYou know you you just felt it loony ...\nAn extra shift is not safe I don't go into homes and uh and and to entertain people or just to give speeches if there are negative spirits and somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople face so I I go completely on the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely under clients\nWhen did they get back to you Jeffrey I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I I think he got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away or you know sometimes you know a week or so\nLater but on the calls come pretty quickly and not only in times immediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away\nEspecially when I Do a personal clear I mean I Do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone or you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just working negative environments\nAnd they need a clearing and and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting\nI feel better at work and better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling dreamed because I'm not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always know what it's subconscious and so people don't know that are getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them run negative spirit and so you know people call\nMe families call me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's a media but I always get a caller an email thanks a lot Jeffrey really really helped you know\nVery very seldom out of the thousands of clients that I've helped or the last almost three decades now\nHave not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things in forty five\nMinutes already five different things so remarkable it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing as different George depending on what is going on with the client it may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or\nAround ... people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common uh you know and I don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on the\nBusiness or a house and so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family lore arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirits and demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep\nMeaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy and also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople who go to school I went to this this is the same school both elementary and high school that my parents went to its old very beautiful\nBut I mean think of the moon energy didn't elated\nAnd so people will be calling on comfortable they don't know why and the body picks up emotional energy we generated we don't know how to release it I teach people how to do that you know and and so sometimes\nIt's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session it all depends I Do both and you know a clearing session a forty five minutes for a standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nThat's some costs just for you know most all energy more than people do next\nStop let us go to Jay in Minnesota Welcome to the program I DJ\nGood evening gentlemen I appreciate your time\nThank you thanks for calling\nUm George it's always a pleasure I've I've called you a couple of times about ... and everything else but Jeffrey you treat me extremely a great late at night and I
