looked slum whether it be in the old sort of like but I imagine imagine the sediments and everything is produced sort of fertile ground very fertile ground well yeah yeah I don't think that's why the cows and not race offices in it you know the\nFirst thing in the Nineteen seventies once again\nNow spoke to this guy numerous times and recorded it I think that you know\nAnd he did it a bit of poaching in the Nineteen seventies you know catching has and ... and places that they shouldn't be in um private one and um it was a place called Fox ... in green Dale which is\nEight miles from flicks than and he still lives in Glendale and it's an interesting story\nHe said it was with a friend he said and he noted for the past week or two weeks that something was ripping the prey out to be snazzy what my roommates net to catch the rub it in the head and the other game small game\nAnd it was the ice is proper sort of Britain ... born and bred and he's with pretty ragged him out to ... as\nYou said but we couldn't sort of what he was he said we just couldn't understand what was doing it you know still a bit of snow on the ground you could see such a rows of each other as you're looking over towards the ... the the open fields and he's on the edge of folks ... with us if there was doing the poaching\nIn the daytime so there's a large hedge hole forms and things about he said he probably eight to ten ... so I mean what is so to turn round to speak to his friend and call this thing and is peripheral vision and then looked and saw it\nOn the left over the head ... he said and he thought he was a young hopes it meant halls so HBO to bless you want to go ...\n... believe what I was looking at so what we're saying is this thing was as big as a small pony or you you know your house\nIs it and the interesting thing was he left over the edge\nAnd just landed he said wait expert to host a London move forward because the momentum this thing just limited and stuff like a magnet sudden\nSomething not to look at that\nHe said he was the most peculiar thing he'd ever seen he said he glad them before they run away he said what he was on all fours and he said if it's still do it to the being over seven foot and looked like a body builder he said you know\nIt's a tiny waist and the main like a lion in the face of a of a boom\nAnd nothing is ... woods and he said he ... he was almost sort of Britain's gulag you know like a box that dog all the stuff that you both terriers\nAnd not what he ... he says well he said I went to him to the edge of them to try and gifts and stuff it's just to protect myself he says although there's nothing we could have done if this thing I decided they were going to come across to us they said the speed it covered\nCrossing the field and into the world but what quite incredible\nUm you know that's four miles from the coast all the sightings are quite close to the coast county\nAnd if you if you go further down the coast was whole or in the papers probably two years ago there was the beast of bumps and drain the featured in the u._k. papers quite often\nAnd this was said you are supposed to be aware of that was such a ... going the ... into the sea six miles from where I'm ... now so we got this where we'll type creature reported that moving along the coast and they could go for the ... the coast you got\nOld folklore legends old legends of dogs with glowing red eyes the ... bay and raven scout I spoke to them they churn the pot fault\nAnd you know these stories have to have that they've come down the behind the down in time ... ... there's just I think there's grains of truth in the store is so that was the sightseeing\nThe Nineteen seventies and they lived in his life\nAnd he's never seen it\nIs never seen it never seen it which is quite incredible if this thing I Believe his story about this thing was to that you would think it'd be more evidence so much so why are we only see smoke glimpses of it was made\nYeah and that's what you're saying that they pop in and they pop out along the way kind of like\nWhen I talked to people before uh we had um\nA friend of mine Laurie Williams she's a remote viewer in I Would have hurt target Bigfoot and as she targeted she had mentioned how they they are actually didn't know what it was you know she is looking at this esoteric target that I gave her and she's talking about how they had these portals\nAnd they would end time warps and and they would just go through one time warp and then another and you just see them when they pop into that particular one you know in ... where where human would see him\nUm I find I find it also interesting uh when you were saying that Ari ask is there the world's oldest the operational radar base is right there and all this area where all this crazy stuff happens\nAnd I think I remember seeing a pitcher\nThat might be my phone about a coup so people just it it's cutting in and out\nSo well is showing so now I'm a I'm Sorry about this with Joe Mitt to hang up and you got me back up you know well\nWell you're fine right now for sure and will do that if the break for sure but yeah but I can hear you but again I think it I think it's very strange that this operational radar base the oldest one is in the midst of all of these happenings that you're talking about\nGoing in June ... jumping to animal mutilation taking place rate up living miles from stocks that one's close close about Seventy\nSixty eight but he was still operational baseball clean it too and that's on the edge of the audio them to remain\nOkay now he's gone [laughter] so it will definitely contacting back on one of his other phone said he has there isn't that crazy brand new song a brand new batteries and it goes out ... strange isn't it when we talk about some of these things that I don't know I don't know\nYou'll always on the story [laughter] we'll\nJust wing continues here on coast to coast am I'm tiny Willis and

really does have um an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get said panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nTelevision shows around that kind of Halloween and that we are the fun ones the little peanut characters that's the only sign with the great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but that like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nAbout two years ago and he went to the the um the police saying that the ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\n... and ... and when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you that actually\nI was just such an offensive I was like the first of all the ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and of course every year they X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if\nIt makes me I wanted for but I wanted to ask you that are still doing that I remember you know it was always go X ray your candy I mean really do you do people really you know you are the emergency rooms where there's really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen and now I Know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist office\nX. rated the candy and and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually find anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know for something like you know\nIt's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you don't yeah I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious\nYou don't need to make but just toss it the way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look to the candy makers okay but he did it yes so then you can see all the stuff that he wanted\nTo point where the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people are ... of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted house has come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] is it all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily restricts with the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second waves of of the ah the immigrants to the United states\n... and in fact we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course you know part of the uh the with Charles ... have you know they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... and so that for for so certainly for for for many years um\nOf course before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff um you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know boy the horror right you'd actually\nYeah family is coming together to make a kid's costume ... and what you find is that\nThe first um the ... the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years I'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid and you know plastic molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it's big it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you start getting adults who were you know ... doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer costumes or a drag\nYeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right you know Cinderella and you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fun I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet\nBut for for homemade caution that really creative and not just you know something with a mask crap on it\nYeah it's fun for sure um so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you studied it so much and you really continue to to to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\nWell a ... a good question you know I think that um you know\nWhen I mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things change right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the\nMixing it with all the ... and and you were with each interact with each you know a couple of generations change a bit\nAnd I think that um I I think is probably going to more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far in Detroit for example it's it's known all night I mean there's the other like art and stuff it's like scary scary stuff going on\nBut for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that but there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think it really peeling again it's not it's not Easter it's like Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion it's it's something that anybody of any of any of any faith and creed hum when it was like a dress up like a dress up right I mean it you're okay for eighty year old kid like to dress up and so it's\nThere's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still going to be knocking on doors and asking for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or who knows maybe two hundred years now a ... there'll be a sort of your virtual\nGo you know where you got like holographic oh you've got to that because that was this giant thing that would be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we are going to ask them about the seat panic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening because because I Am I'm ... and this is will is to wean tonight\n[noise] never missed a detailed or short just signed up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free coast to coast am dot com\n\nYou're getting which is one of our great conservative by the\nAnd welcoming to the point on I think\nThis is Lee or be host of Alan Gura can stories new will be here for one night only talk about the upcoming elections take your questions and there's a private meeting refer to\nIt will be a special night for a great goals Yorkshire getting back to the doctor will\nWeeknight and forty W why Joe ... thing with news dot com an evening\nThat the evening when you don't\nMatter of fact she feels like pointing sharp pain very intense a head instability I was so frustrated I didn't know what to do\nAnd it was driving past the good feed store I mean why not give it a try they wanted to make sure they sent me with the right thing they brought\nOut several different arch support and gave me the opportunity to try them in shoes and walk around with him until they found the perfect one I really needed relief in my seat and the good feed arch support for what gave me the relief I Need\nTo call five one five to seven oh eight eight to two workers at the store located near Jordan Creek Tom center north of Costco between bar Louie la burgers\nResults were very concerned your medical professional for medical conditions\nThe helping giggling lock better for sixteen years pain relief and comfort to get any budget go in for your free test today Taliban about anything\nYou know what I mean here you know I've interviewed Newt Gingrich a bunch of times but I can tell you that he's one of our great conservative mines and there'll be here in Des Moines bowl one night only on a truck but if they do get to hear him speak you'll get harassed questions you got to make him it'll be a special night brought great goals beget deductible\nSupport our American story weeknight Iran W ... radio oh me that you should only a chicken at an evening with new dot com that's an evening with new don't come right now\n[noise] don't wait Joe Joe ... and I arch radio station and on your HG radio ... to\nAge I'm ...

A. dot com call now\n[noise]\n\n\nCounty Willis here on the coast to coast am our gas tonight on Willis lean is Benjamin Radford we've been talking about the origins of Halloween\nAnd uh oriented ... we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great themes great mysteries that we all lost\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating um goes goes hunting stuff so\nLet's I Want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the will of saline theme of ghost tiny so Ben\nI'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about\nThat let's say panic part of it I mean it can really can get pretty evil\nWith some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know and the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of Halloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness in St panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean it's one of those things where I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creeping from you know a mall haunted house it reached out and grab their grow somebody or whatever I mean it's there are some of that but\nBut you know that's if for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who who just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean as I mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... from the conservative cause a candidate because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything resembling the Christian devil at all I mean they\nIf during summer when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some horn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the idea what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view\nAnd and again you know it was the ... festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of a scene and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's there's tradition of course I mean you look at Texas is twenty two Eighteen\nYou know thou shalt not suffer which to live on and so there's a there's a strong tradition in in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right so this was fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that's that's one of the more uh obviously comes up\nEvery every year coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart to James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking to go to them and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it it said a word you boards are strictly prohibited anyone using ... board will be kicked off the property\nAnd it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners were so\nSo concerned that using the ... board was going to open up you know do you want to ... or whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the rule if you will find this don't use it and so you know typically the concern\nIs uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween it wasn't\nIt wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties\nThat twin because it was centered on kids that were the concern came from and so it was a kid the dresses up as a which are of goal\nWill become interested in witchcraft or Wicca or vehicle because of that and so that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party they have a harvest party\nSo the the the the they make a case to distinguish it from home and this is our way into the harvest party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that they'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something instead of anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy in that like I said again you know black lights and uh\nUh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and\nIt got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest events like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from from back then it was the wacky haunted house\nThere was nothing nothing scary or it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy when it came to Christmas [laughter] just lay allies right down the\nMarathon bars on either right away I assumed\nThose huge freeze those have you ever had them frozen they were great oh I'm sure you're just taking me back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the real or on the back oh man I I mean anything Googled afterward on here\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face with last year for McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way yeah\nYup yup yup never on all the producers were were watching that hey you guys are going on there\nNow are so well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the say panic part and all that good stuff\nNow another element and some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff and now what they do is they go into cemeteries when they go into the woods or they go into you know", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "07"}
