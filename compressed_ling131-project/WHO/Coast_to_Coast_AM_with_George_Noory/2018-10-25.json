his entourage arrived at the garrick theater Detroit Michigan on October twenty fourth Nineteen twenty six he was running a fever two days earlier Houdini had been resting in his dressing room prior to his show in Montreal when a college student named Jay Gordon Whitehead approached him it's difficult to determine exactly what happened\nFrom here his accounts from eyewitnesses are slightly conflicting however the general story seems to be the Whitehead asked Houdini if the claim that he could withstand any punch to the abdomen\nAt any truth to it Houdini assured him that it was true in gave him permission to see for himself Whitehead immediately took several jobs at Houdini mid\n... supposedly didn't have a chance to prepare for the blows from over exuberant Jay Gordon Whitehead the

appendectomy\nDoctors performed the surgery but the damage\nHarry Houdini held on for about a week a grease hospital\nFinally succumbed on October thirty first Nineteen twenty six [noise]\nHe was

[noise]\nUse radios morning doubled you wait Joe [noise]\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news traffic and severe weather stations for news radio ten forty W.\nI'm Gary beret WHM radio news our top story this our President Trump is calling for unity and said his government is going to hunt down whomever is responsible for mailing explosive devices to top Democrat\nYou know a a a something that is coordinated or something that is organic\nBut I can tell you this I Want to get to the bottom I Want to hear what the authorities have to say about this\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing is to try to make Republicans good look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know where everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made you know thing\nYou create an environment for somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that you don't know that we need to wait and get the official verdict from our authorities intelligence communities in the United states\nAnd then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about it a grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroke but we have to understand that at the grassroots level America\nIt's best when we can debate ideas vigorously debate these ideas and then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former presidents\nAnd leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on the way in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this there that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to an end hopefully this a wakeup call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you're giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you been honest I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other\nAnd that's the proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears\nAs you know a little culpability and is we've got to stop demonizing and looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping than I our our adversaries overseas\nAnd those on and the individual or the group that some of these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others he was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's in turn them into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public or if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer\nYou cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep this keeps their mouth shut I think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced\nAnd our law enforcement uh individuals and are individuals and institutions in in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and it won't ever did this\nWith somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again\nWill say again because I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag it'd be somebody on the left\nThat did this and you got most of the media saying that President Trump still this weight shut up wait let the intelligence officials do their jobs then wants their job is completed and they've determined who've done this\nThen we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one country we are the United states of America\nYou know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that's just the way empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew most six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did in in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue unless stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAll right Mike Mullen team joined we will talk this week\nAnd and see the rest of the story unfold hopefully Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman as described the killing of your mall to show me as a heinous crime\nIn his first comments and some of his closest aides were implicated in the Saudi journalist death speaking edited investors conference in Riyadh that has been overshadowed by this crisis been sold them and said that those responsible for the killing would be brought to justice\nFacebook could collapse of the keeps being dogged by scandals or misinformation\nAnd election hacking says the author of a ... book on the company David Kirkpatrick says advertisers could start showing the platform if scandals don't stop after years seemingly endless controversy over misinformation privacy and fake news\nListen to this new development and fiber optics could make Internet speeds up to a hundred times faster my detecting light that has been twisted into a spiral the research published in the journal nature communications\nCan be used to easily upgrade existing networks and significantly boost sufficiency let's check in with our expert Warren Weinstein on the Internet boy this would be amazing born\nBefore I comment on that I I like to make a technical comment on the fence today um I Would I Would estimate that the probability of this thing track down to either the perpetrator or perpetrators of a very short period of time as as being very very high\nUm for purely technical reasons I mean these are all unexploded devices\nThat means all kinds of of trace evidence is available from them and they're all they've all gone are all going to the FBI the UN at some of them were sent through the regular mail for us here\nI just want to know if they're from one city one location or a number of different cities they\nProbably have that all figured out already the entire ah UFP of network is highly computerized they have photos of the packages as they cross through the ...\nThey got pictures of the person if he delivered it to the post office cameras at\nThe post offices ... I mean this is the kind of thing where where if you want it to have the best possible evidence it's almost as if someone wants to be caught so I I think probably within a day or two days or certainly in a short period of time we're going to find out who is behind this and then some of these questions are are going to start to be possible\nAnd she'll say that again about a minute left the optics story real quick\nI I mean this is mostly a a a you know it kind of future kind of issue with it more it it's more involving a inter ISP communications rather than individuals I think the question it always comes up when you when we talk about higher speed Internet is are we going to be able to afford it\nOr the eye of the is going to raise the band with caps enough so that we won't use up our whole allocation for the month and in two minutes\nAnd where it's going to go because right now the ISPs have tended to put the high speed a new advanced system in the ah high rent urban areas they haven't showed a lot of interest and putting them into rural areas so there's that question to are we ever going to actually see it depending on where you live\nOr am I from Lauren thank you so much will be in touch with you this week as well while a lottery ticket holder and South Carolina his scoop the largest jackpot in us history\nMega millions confirmed that was one winner for the one point six billion dollars\nLet's see how that he's probably obviously meeting with his lawyer on accountants or she is and will figure out what's going on in a moment we'll be talking about dark forces demons with a which that's right next on coast to coast am\nOn user reviews ...\nHeart racing shortness of breath or dizziness it's possible you could have a trio relation one of the leading causes that strong\nMind out before new I ... the FDA cleared personal EKG dividing the just Ninety nine dollars to order the Amazon dot com and type ... that the Amazon dot com and type cardio ...

into the causes no one's\nOkay so you probably have ... what is known as the uh called an earth mounds spirit so it can be someone\nSounds like a mischievous spirit [laughter]\nSo it's probably not

that are just lingers wherever\nWell it depends I think all spirits you can get rid of them because you can appease them as well so what happens in that case and that's a very good question George I'm Glad you asked um there are some black magicians who will send an earth\nDown didn't want to be by magicians um [laughter] we'll just leave on edition girls\nI Know I'm Sorry and clarify assuming he

to tell everybody\nWho might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter in Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named stamped and Friedman\nSaw little clipping in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before group\nA at Oakland University and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's a ... you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this there's not going to be overtime for this you want to go up there and interview this guy you do it on your own time

I'm trying to remember bill a there was John Kennedy and Jackie in the back seat\n... there was a secret service agent in the driver's seat and then other and the and there was another in the past year was only four I remember right\nWell no I I remember governor calmly and his wife are as well because I was going to probably with it also is one of the bullets well\nNo you're right the governor's convoy was in front of him because he ... he had one of the bullets\nMagic bullet\nBut where it was a world was his wife\nTo laugh so Conley with the front of Kennedy and his wife was to his\n... but the the car was a front seat back seat right or was there a third seat their third narrow\nStreet there and I can't remember if the if the seat was\nWith Connelly and his wife\nOr you want you know them you know I think con Connelly if I remember the artistic sketches of the shooting were they track the bullet\nConley was sitting in front of the president so he got he bought but what I don't know\nIs whether he was in a bench before him how that seating arrangement was I'm I I think he was sitting in a bench in front of the president\nOr the way I like the front seat I think he was in the front\nAnd so the so governor calmly and his wife or in front of President Kennedy and his wife\nSo there were three people in the front seat\nNo they weren't another so it it would have been another seating there and then a driver\nOr a or the other Secret Service agent was on the passenger side so you would have had six people\nAnd that would have been six that strange run and the Thomas looking at it and what do you need to look to can you turn Tom spike up for just one second Denny to put your speaker downtime and tell me what you're saying\nWell I just I just pulled up to

uh and then a congressman front there I don't see a third row of seats\nI I didn't I don't remember seeing the third row either belt thanks to a guy\nThat's amazing and and again I'm that's why I always thought that it was just Secret Service agents in the front seat and then a second row with Governor crime and his wife and his wife was to his law president Jackie were in the back and Jackie was to his left\nThat's true and I mean I definitely do the secret service agent was on the front driving because everybody accused him of an attorney in around shooting the president uh yeah and I don't believe that happened\nBut I you know again I think about this study that as well because William Cooper is one was saying that I write you know I thought about it I thought okay well the driver would have had Ruben left handed if that's the case and also [noise]\nHe's driving so they'd have to take his eyes off the road to turn and then make perfect shot you know with his left hand\nAnd
