I mean has there ever been reporting of that and not a good experience will be is it not right\nYou know like there has been an Andy's and nightmares in ... leave your fear\nBased if you've been brought up with this concept that there's a whole of or Satan around every corner waiting for you to pounce on you you're going to have light you made likely have negative experience your own fear will create it\nWhen we leave our bodies were entering into a very thought responsive dimensional space\nAnd that's what people forget and I I I say this all the time you know we're not observers of non physical reality we're participants\nEach thought is a creative projection and we are influencing the energy is around us we do it in the physical but slowed down here\nBut when you leave your body through near death experiences\nSame applies to um if you're doing ... San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you and do the experience if your fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a closer look at yourself and your beliefs and to see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative energy if if there is not like there's negative entered its you are going to create it in your mind is going to mold of reality around you\nIf you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness in a negative beings and whatever then you're going to manifest that as well\nWell you are creative powerful beings and when you\nWell your body no matter how it's done you're entering into it incredibly thought response of environment and you have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but the it's the truth well\nI had we had one once where I went it was a specific dream I guess I remember but it could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that he had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got up and let her cycle and took off your helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person don't know anyone that um\nRide their own the motorcycle and it was as it woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who was in it wasn't a projection of anything and it was when I was no there wasn't a premonition of anything that happened it just because it was as if I had gone into a future dimension which\nLooks pretty bleak the honest and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because we care to each other yeah I'd I don't know of that and that as well out of body travel\nLikely mhm well it could have banned\nBut it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there's object there is consensus what I call consensus realities and there is no consensus realities there's that's that's why it's important to learn about a consensus realities are created by a collective group of individuals that all agree on a reality\nAnd they create I Try called consensus\nThere's many types of realities that exist in in a multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to sort them learn nice what is essentially the rules of non physical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here\nWe're used to linear time writers to gravity we're used to their you know when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you know you don't have gravity\nAll the things we're used to have to you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy space\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm In my work shops but it's also in my book but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of our\nContinuing existence yes hit that will be prepared for this transition of consciousness\nI understand I understand they well thank you so much Williams has been great if you go to his website which has asked Trump info dot org you'll find out about all of his

I'm going to scare the ... out of that it's lovely record\nI was thinking about that commercial saying can you really say pee on an original is is that this is Jerry anyway I'll go to the show [laughter] funny\nYeah thank you very much and um thank you very much for being for letting me be on tonight and I've been a long time listener so this is a dream come true\nCause so well you send me your book and we do are you constantly in Colorado during our guys shows and I thought it would be so fascinating 'cause there are so many different pieces of history little pockets of history and it's very unassuming you can\nFind things like that in Colorado and everywhere but where did you what was your first experience where we are normal\nWell I haven't been seen go since I was ... an e high to a grasshopper is what I always say\nI'm and about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening and so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding and after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago\nIt was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not my goal was to try and unite the paranormal can even immunity and also just some outreach to help children better understand\nAnd um so I actually started this paranormal convention and I partnered with my friend or a fence\nAnd she said professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called kindred spirit out of Longmont, Colorado\nAnd so the two of us uh with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from the other people in the community now we've changed the name to spirits in the Rockies paranormal convention and we we call it\nThe ... seats because every year we try to sponsor it in a different community and by doing that we outreach to the historians because we call ourselves haunted historians\nBecause what we do is actual real history so even if you don't believe in ghost or things that go bump in the Knight supposedly this stuff really happened\nAnd I particularly interested in this after I found out about a journalist named Charles for it and I'm sure all your listeners know about him\nThat he was pretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mysteries and he revisited them to see if it was possible that these things really happened and so that's what I decided to do\nAnd interesting enough this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to shift for publishing LCD they actually publish my last book ghosts legends and lord of the Rockies and it is available through shut the ship for publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you let's talk about your Journey Through sure going to buy were cancer and how do you how you reconnected your life would go what were you doing before then\nWell before that\nI like I said I've always been in to the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child\nWe mean seeing it you you know I see it and I actually feel it\nI'm just really like humans to examples that\nWell I can I Know this is going to sound really funny but I can actually sense things\nI'm I'm an impasse I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I'm very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't protect that into the future\nBut what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes and I saw where it was at and we went back in there it was\nSo I'm able to do things like that\nUm but I let's see I think okay so I was a professional storyteller from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast\nIn managing Springs Colorado and he was taunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tours and I open my big huge mansion to the public and I head haunted wine and cheese parties\nYou know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were oh starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this\nWe are oh you're going to love this story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight as a hundred percent true we were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought an old haunted mansions sight unseen I Swear\nThat because we wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast\nAnd I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was in California because she I mean ... Texas because she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband and mind you and your she died\nAnd so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I think it was like I filled out a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address\nAnd he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and uh if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting 'cause my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done and the arts and crafts vile I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really rundown [laughter]\n... extremely run down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us that they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for\nAnd we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans\nAnd said that we've been passed the house and five years after five years we can do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house what what have you well after us you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and I'm an artist\nYou know and it's very severe that I'm In a soothing you can see where this was going roe [laughter] yeah\nI actually called the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude song about that just do what you want\nAnd I said All right thank you very much\nSo I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest state so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything\nLike this while I hired\nTwenty people to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge estate so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you jumping allowed blew everything\nIn the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait till\nThe ghost of surely actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\nRational election do measurements achieved historic progress\nWe think is at stake chop down all the time for information\nRight now now flow of information on your\nNews radio tend toward and forty W.

artist and oil painter hidden lends itself to the shadows does that make sense\nYes the judge and make sure when you see the shadows people and the light changes very fast\nAnd it only I call it the God light it only lasts about ten minutes and in the Rockies we have it it's beautiful because of the way that it bounces off the rocks and the lead into the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is the place that you're living in now onto them did you met with non salute legions of\nGoes follow you\nRight

E. ... to go what did you experience how did you know it just feels\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um\nI was actually in a dorm room a going to college and I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I've realized that was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached beyond that\nOh no I was not ... I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent real when I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings that was my first experience it was relatively brief\nBut it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any money being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may um\nBut they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was ... at the moment was a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about the what I had first stepped into here\nAnd ah over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah\nWell it's it's it's exciting and because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself ... ... that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give me an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experienced some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not\nThe source of consciousness as we've\nBeen trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist\nAnd also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional when I began to experience was or not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a sin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them\nYes and but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I always think you know is incredible as our our world is and\nKnow this incredible globe that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all of the intelligence that we have here and with all the pistons information Janine di why would the universe just create one type of human being and that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that once you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and\nAnd that there is there's trillions of all their life forms yeah\nAnd not all human there has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent than than we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you you have these experiences and union of their meal because especially they ill meal you know he was playing because they're usually not a language to\nReally clearly defined what an entertaining chin is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's\nGenerally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died or I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's by thought and there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols and it's uh it's amazing\nBut that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore yourself and discover the answers for yourself there was no\nUm when I teach my classes there is no um belief systems attached to it\nEach individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves which is very important\nNow you're listening you teach them and

people have there are certain prayed alludes to them vibrations a sleep paralysis by the way is a prelude if it's if you react properly is a wonderful prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm\nAnd react I I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis well\nThat's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWill keep you safe that then you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think it's important people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience or as science has been part of that so many people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up\nIn the middle of the night and there are no I'm all over or their vibrating\nOr they're a hearing strange sounds you know these all can be a prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call them in our signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call him out of body experience now it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean ... when you are when people are going to be travels the game to ... the brain argue make any type of um recording I'm Derek travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth\nThat has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states there was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh ah at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nA matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh there's there's quite a bit of research being done on different\nTypes of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind\nMirror and every person they go through a series of techniques are and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise and in fact I speak it one night it on this class and I talk about how to initiate\nObese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively for instance\nThere's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are taught any more interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings in these wouldn't mind near twenty people kept a mind\nA mind mirror is just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each mind mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved and again\nThat you can tell what is what are you most responding to [noise]\nBut that that that's one of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow to have the experience themselves and not only have it but control it and get the most of it\nMy main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and\nTalking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have the literally connect with Sarah herself with are multi dimensional so right\nAnd have the kind of experiences that that a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about well the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have the ability ourselves because we are all of us are multi dimensional then it's just a matter of beginning to open up to our own potential\nI found some great information on your website and let's say by the way it's astral info astro into dot org and there are great resources on

is William bowling and he's talking\nAbout out of body travel and he's been doing twenty five years of research at the mineral Institute sedative or sixteen thousand participants who have\nGone through the OB e training at than than real Institute Virginia and he's come up with a commonly reported phenomenon associated with these are the least amount of money if you could explain this to our audience [noise]\n[noise] yes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years oh okay but I've been studying nursing\nYou know forty\nOr just to go on my website ... dot org I included\nThe over a period of ten years I did a a number of surveys and I receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way and it's it was amazing how similar\nThe kinds of experiences that people were having were so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance I'm a floating or um vibrations high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring sounds as a as a prelude normally to the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet but there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset\nOf Seventy two percent at some point experience some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted are touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through close dial it if you're seen through your clothes ... at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness\nTo your non physical body because\nYou're having it doesn't mean you've accident your body but it means you're in the process but most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things at\nA for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body\nRight is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body as your fell asleep\nThat gap I ... on because that happened I'm retired I Will switch and I think his muscles ... are you saying that now the money you\nKnow I'm I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this is what I have found\nAnd what many other um experiences have seen and explored\nEvery one when they sleep we all humans are moving out of face from our body sets with sleep is ... we take for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint\nBut what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people\nIt's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the ceiling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a sleep and you can observe this actually during an out of body experience\nSo what does it look ... image you're looking at it's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you want an animal sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream began or they may be running in their non\nPhysical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences or as natural was breathing\nAnd think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're a non physical ... bc it temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWe didn't have any biological machine ... and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just\nIt's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess wordplay and most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game\nBut very few people are aware of it\nAnd you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell if you wanted to ask the question like how did the pyramid game here would you go into and it will be and ask that question and have you ever tried Dennis and I'm curious how did you hear me now in the nation\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience or income\nAnd you can have multiple experiences for instance I had I Begin to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies\nAnd I was still learning what was going on I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master\nWe're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience I Would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar\nBut then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way a lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two\nAnd I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when often will get information given to us or we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just download of information it's presented to us in ... were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOr what's going on\nAnd I think this is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives into I started to have my own\nThat's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated ... anyone other than you are\nRight and it's very important that sets self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAnd very important yes\nBecause all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines\nAnd [noise] you know I always ask somebody that's an avid believer and anything left backed up special your religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born\nIn India a ... were had been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program in to truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share\nA cause and that's an important aspect of this and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience it menu sudden oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and very self empowering\nMm need in now back to the report that you had you talked about the common maybe put it in ... and also\nThe average age of the first Adam ... ... ... years old people Rick recount painting and it's on every day to day and it happens over and over again but he declined\nSpain's during early teenage years why do you think that is really central forget that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit ... based on all my research once you hit puberty everything just starts to\nShut down I think it as an interest just a sec says something to do with it everybody including ... yeah refocusing", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city":
