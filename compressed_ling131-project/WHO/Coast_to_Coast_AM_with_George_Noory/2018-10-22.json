doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an old topic that uh [noise] there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of ...\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know I mean your focus may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last seven eight years focused on missing people but when you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people\nAlways reading\nSee on these first pages of news news articles and such and I started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like Bigfoot when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large and eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic\nIt's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nIt we're going to get into the specifics articles about big wild man and giants and sometimes do the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not lifting ten years ago a when you were first year recap the project how you got started on that what you learned\nAnd how it kind of got its hooks into you know all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they told the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big foot encounter in the mountains of the heroes\nAnd they found each other later in business and in a weird sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked\nThat they each had a similar encounter and they said you know Dave we you have Twenty years as a police officer ... years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace me you know your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially I said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said it's your own pace you can do it\nSo I I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down in the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made in sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approached them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me\nI'm not going to not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nWith a scientist who reads that

I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot studied them year after year\nSo they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the ape gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever but we have Howard while or giant human bone fat\nAnd that's that really makes you think\nYou know some of the descriptions in the articles uh made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no familiar to you but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining\nIt must have been old Fred so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\nThat I [laughter] I traveled with you I Know and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation [noise]\nUm and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows huh how Fred that decided\nTo leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAt and grow hair all over his body like that a thick long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from the late Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nBut said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our car news article about it but I saw other secondary and third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was like yeah\nYeah and\nThe description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and find out what may be some explorers wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so\nBut again and tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where and explore from the Watergate church was\nComing across country on a horse and he wrote in his explore notes that\nThis thing came up to him while he's on his worst and looked him I I actually spoke\nTo him large hairy by ... he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the archives with ... church butter de saint church and it's in there so to say that these things haven't happened ... with\nUh the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques ballet you wrote about it and have a clip from\nSeptember Seventy sixteen eighty it was a report it in his book wonder in the sky a large black wildlife mass landed in a field releasing a huge error covered being that was seen briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive\nUm big what people who think it's an ape just crazy\n[laughter] you know I I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a ... book on a about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this I'm a fellow over and said wow I don't think anybody's ever heard of this\nAnd uh his book which was a Kickstarter project right um which kind of did the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on this big for topic it was a starter I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear that\nYeah I I uh I was part of that project and um and supported it and uh it's a tremendous book and people can find it anywhere they should check it out we're talking with Dave ... about his latest work big foot Wildman and giants archive

all these years later I don't think there's anything quite like it in in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt\nThese look like human faces these are individual faces that he's drawn a forensic drawings based on witness descriptions are\nThey looked like a people are just big hairy people but people\nNo I I think that's a general consensus\nSort of match what other tribes dated all across the U.S and\nWhen you try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and here's an occupied land to find a group or an animal I never could find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm only now listen anything like that just isn't there\nLook back at the Patterson gambling film and it's you know if people can argue about it all they want as far as I'm concerned it has\nAnd I've been to bump but that that being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or ape\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the beings that that that you're you have drawings up in this and the beings that are described in the in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nSo when I did with ah the give them an film it and one thing Harvey has the ability yet\nIs let's say somebody goes into a bank Rob the bank has a beard on has a hat on and they're caught on camera leaving larvae have this innate ability to take the beard off the face so you can see what the face looks like so you can identify the suspect\nSo apply that to the Paterson given one film Harvey took the hair off the face of the Paterson given by pad it's in tribal decry and it's stunning it looks like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made in probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your account the news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female specimens that are seen right\nWell I I think people forget how different humans are\nAre in my presentations at conferences they sometimes will take a variety of photos of Amazon tribal members of people from northern Ukraine of people from China\nAnd I put these pictures up there and it's it's phenomenal how different humans look if they are some type of human as I think they are then it it just follows what with what we understand about our own people\nYeah fewer ... game here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ...\nYou know you might have some trouble or they can't all look like that you know from 'cause we we bury so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a in ... in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with here and there were just signed a playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid who doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds and I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on a ridge line they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things do an unusual things other times or they're seen in a lake playing like kids in the water um it's\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes\nMatch proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well it must be a young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder chased him off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big but that's supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who saw it how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on big for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things [noise]\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did\nAnd since the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say and every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet\nThe myth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and some people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people did not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories are these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say it it never happened it's a completely phony story so as\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get them um just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I Would have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you know there's never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who saw it and why aren't the names there and if somebody is writing about it than fat\nSeems to be a there are instances where and in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only do they described them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context of gay as we use the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to him and\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nOr policemen credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got\nGot skew where they said they started looking like him or apes than animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big for the world that wants to go out and kill one and I don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one maybe some kind of over load on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill one\nIt's not going to happen there are some\n... ah reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and hey invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\n... big foot wild bend the giants as the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your own coast to coast am\nWe\nFind out more about tonight's gifts to log on to coast to coast am dot com\nWere hand in it I just want a thousand dollars [noise] I Am standing not passing dollar every hour all day will not be where it's at another shot at a grass while she\nWaits ready to unleash a world of information whenever you want it all you have to do\nAsk elective bay ten forty W.

I Want everyone to think about what was the percentage of people in the wilderness in Nineteen sixty seven that had the ability to take film\nOf anything while they were in the wilderness it was minute\nNow think about today nobody has ever come close to taking video or film of a ... foot in the wilderness for a minute and a half like they got on that PG film yet today there's probably close to a hundred percent of everybody in the wilderness carrying a smartphone\nWhich has the ability to catch that\nSo I Want everyone to understand that I Do believe the Patterson film is real why haven't we caught despite that on film and that quality of a location in segment like they did in sixty seven\nThere was something phenomenal about that event that caused that female big foot to stay there because every other time they immediately run they won't look at the camera like this when did they won't hang around and linger knowing that people are watching them something unusual happened\nWell again not to take everything back your skin Walker day but it did the comparison is a pretty clear is that ... there was a loose if there are cameras all over the place\nAnd if you uh had activity in one area and set a camera that would move somewhere else and it goes back to sort of the question that one of the callers asked about drones say you had a drone that had heat seeking technology it attached to it\nUm the description from the tribes the you mentioned in your books suggest this thing has camouflage abilities that he can ... the change of shapes and you can

Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history the two authors are Sarah ... and a claim documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis he became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of eleven non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program uh I I'm blown away by your book grey tabby here\n\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on this story at age Thirteen or most teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nBut actually with a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about four and they reduced the story of a ship to a single line which was the ship that carry the bomb and suck\nAnd add to know more about it so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library\n[laughter] imagine that and you know there are looking to what was available at the library I still find anything someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it though I\nYou know I thought out what I could ... I thought you know someone will tell this story before I'm old enough to do it fast forward graduated from college and no one told the story you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Murphy who is the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion\nAnd that's where I actually got to me that the men who survived Indianapolis and yeah I was\nA kid with a meeting her heroes for the first time and\nThey said it all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so they have a couple of years later after I'd spend time with them and visit them at their homes they asked me to be their storyteller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it\nAnd Lynn for you how did you ah hook up with Sarah on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very exciting project for me the way I got involved was I had actually been praying I'm I Do pray about my work and I had been praying\nTo have an opportunity to work on an iconic for over two stories\nAnd all of a sudden in two thousand eleven out of the blue I get this email from this young filmmakers name Sarah Vladeck\nWell let's hear it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis was that um and being Indianapolis a storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay and she actually did that she wrote a an eight part miniseries than she pitched it to a major\nProduction company and they said hey this is the best thing we've seen since ... brothers but we only base mini series\nOn foot so you're going to need ready for a while she and a screenwriter I don't know how to write stuff though for your family and friends she reached out and and made contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I'm a navy veteran she didn't know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one um [noise]\nAnd\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting was advice and I wanted to help her write the book [laughter] so uh my joke\nIs is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or into letting helper but uh eventually over the course of several\nMonths we finally met and then ah\nWe agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest until twenty four and um and then when we did it I guess the project tickets and a half years\nTo Syria where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the people that were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I I knew a small part of that um that was definitely\nPart of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective of it was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she'd been reduced to\nA sinking story or shark story and no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral sprints commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaign that he participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on and so there was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did a besides being sunk [noise]\nI'll tell you you grab ... my father was at ... he drove a landing a craft from those ships took us troops on the shores so of course you know the the fact that they you know was was involved in those conflicts grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes the you describe\nI'm Lynn why don't we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about the the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that did you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned\nWas the fifth the Fifth Fleet flags shift and I'm a small part that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle of us can our where your father drove\nThe landing craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was participating in the shore of environment and during that time and march thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent for on the fateful journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of the world war two specific theaters I'm Victoria said okay now as well as nine other major battle\nIncluding the Japanese point of view in addition to hash amount overhead and for the call and tell me you've got ...

Out of out of everything we tried to present the Japanese point of view in a sympathetic way um [noise] meaning that they were acting\nOut of there since their conscience conviction and so um we were able to make great ...\nUm\nWell with it and then more for published after the war first had a ... nice to have Japanese language and it was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties here in America in English\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two but written from men or ... point of view and there was a chapter on it voted Indianapolis\nThat because we were looking at the larger war in the end of the world war two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot he was a manager who cared for his men\nHe was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese submarines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic Afghan military\nUm he went around saying on doors ask for radar and more technology has that Marines because detonate them or you didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was saying a lot of his brothers that commanders\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and then we're spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked and there was nothing left\nAnd so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers that counts because by the time that the rescue arrived the men were really incoherent they were able to tell or know what was happening by that point\nThe story but you know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks and the face to be able to pull men bored because the shark attacks increased as I guess [laughter] you know I don't know how much sharks realize things but they said it seemed as they were\nPulling the men from the water the shark attack increased and you know this is I Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think saying one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported they were so thick they could walk on their back you know from shark the shark\nThat we're underneath them just swimming there they could stand on them\nThere's one account you have the sailor who you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking down things drugs thinking oh there's mood I'll just reached out and grab some food right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young EMT and by the name of John wolf than he actually took his socks off\nAnd thinking he was going to wiggling toes as bait to lower the sharks in and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realize oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and\nManaged to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSo some of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah everyone knows it's almost the end of the war and they were having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippine see\n'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but it's Sara mentioned there were only a sixteen rap between there were there were four groups within three groups that there were four groups of four rap\nOr three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right so\nSo there were so any water that was available with only available on the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in and the third day and\nThey were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were than men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the those are and the dehydration itself with perversely causing them to\nLose their faculties lose their ability to reason that some of them to come to the idea that they could drain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up a torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into this into his now and thinking that that would strain the salt out well of course that didn't\nAnd then others when you take small heard is that the water I'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just begin gold thing it like they were hoping it out of a mountain stream\nAnd what happened with this is a condition called hyper ... and\nBlood vessels for\nBlood cells ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they die very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself or something else has to be around you that or it without a site all of a sudden and he thinks oh that must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess in immediately that it did sunk that quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a somewhere I was a pilot who ends up testifying at the court marshal later\nA un American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention are we going to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard With Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who had been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit with him and it's a late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see this you know kind of explosion coming from below and there's no reports coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action so he thinks well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah he I guess it seemed kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times\nAnd yeah the army side of things said well let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he's still want to you know he asked a navy personnel at Guam I Believe you know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in the area don't worry about it\nAnd so you know\nThere's actually more to the story with that where you know they his son who you know this gentleman richer live Francis have passed away but his son carries on a story and you know there he\nActually had diary entries of the time and coordinate when he saw this and it did line up with it but he didn't find out and tell a few days after when we're ... released about it that he would\nWe are talking about ... about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history in a moment we'll talk about sort of the aftermath it's amazing that anyone survive but so there were survivors him to what came next is equally amazing we'll be right back\nTo ... just log on to goose the stadium dot com\n\n\nDo crazy after all these years gone it last week to leave your lover and the title track all reached the U.

ingredients\nAnd on your age the radio ...\nMorning doubled you wait Joe\nRight now today Tom stories from Des Moines news trapped again the weather's the news radio didn't forty\nOne eight six six eight three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five [noise]\n\n\nWhen Vincent I Wonder if you could discuss for me in a broad sort of strokes are the sequence of improbable events that seemingly combined or conspired to make things worse as if things just sort of drop through the cracks that made their survival you been more improbable\nWell at their mention there\nIs the the um departure message that didn't go through from ... to the Philippines there was a tenant on the Philippines side who had received a message saying that if\nA ... it's a combat and ship arrived there didn't need to be a report made well he wasn't the brightest guy in the world and as a matter of fact had received a a fitness report saying as much but he thought well\nIf I don't have to report arrivals of combatant ships I guess that means I don't have to report non are rivals either\nAnd then you know to be fair to the navy the entire focus was on the impending invasion of the Japanese home islands so all of these things along with the lack of a distress signals combined to make it says in Indianapolis slip through the cracks\nAnd it wasn't until a PD one venture a bomber piloted by lieutenant check when I'm just happened to be flying over the area that the survivors responded in the water\nThere is a very poignant story you tell when the books are about these pilots do dropped all the supplies and trying to get these uh guys in the water or something you hang onto their they can't do any more they're out of supplies they have to hit back and there was one guy whose wimpy way up\nIn the middle all by himself just swimming is a I don't know where he was swimming do or what he was doing but there was nothing they could do for them\nI mean I imagine that being\nSo terrible to witness you know your did everything you could you find out there's no there's nothing left on your plane to help this little loan swimmer\nAnd you know and then I Believe when they got to land they actually found one more life jacket or something they could have thrown and\nYou know speaking to in a leaves men reading their testimonies later on it affected them the rest of their lives they were devastated about not being able to do more and that was really the sentiment and most of the rescuers you know they were out there feeling like they were playing God you know are these men alive or they\nYou know who do we take for you know our ship or else the VP the landing craft is full what do we do if we can't fit one more man and he's still alive and you know that was a burden they carried till the end of their lives\nYou know it's war time is when the focus is on you know Japan and ending the war and a lot of big stuff going on so things did fall through the cracks but ah [noise] is it an accident that the story was kept out of the newspapers until BJ day well reporters\nAre reporting on at the at reporting on the incident at the times did not believe it was an accident so the rescue occurred beginning on August second\nUh Nineteen forty five and the war ended on August\nFourteenth that between the time zones fourteenth and fifteens Nineteen forty five\nAnd they did not announce that Indianapolis had been sunk the newspapers did not release it Washington not didn't Washington did not release it\nUntil v J day until they announced that Japan had surrendered and that the war was over so if you can imagine huge banner headlines on August fifteenth Nineteen forty five and Seventy two point headlines\nYou know Japan quit the war is over\nAnd then maybe below the fold in a very small article you with us Indianapolis cruiser sunk and reporters that time believed that Washington and the navy specifically did that to divert attention away from this disaster that was\nYou know resulted in the loss of almost nine hundred men\nOn the very brink of the end of the war\nSyria talked to me about the captain McVeigh and what's going through his head and then was the court marshal inevitable let him slide given that the war just did or did they have to pursue this\nWill really there was an enormous pressure from the eight hundred and Seventy nine families who lost loved ones on the ship to have answers to have someone to point a finger at and so you know this is\nA tremendous loss for the navy and you know so many people and it was a very public you know\nLike Clinton said this was announced when the victory of Japan over Japan was announced to the world and people are out celebrating the ... in the streets split their family is now grieving that their son or their brother uncle is not coming home and people wanted answers and so\nYou know it wasn't obvious that a court martial would be taking place I think on the onset\nBut as the investigation started you know revealing things and who was involved in who knew what was happening and what did happen prior to the sinking and how it could have prevented and maybe not the sinking prevented but certainly the fact that no one knew they were missing and that they were left out there to die you know\nSomeone needed to be to blame\nAnd a lot of people got blamed right\nThere were there were a lot of people who were brought in for questioning there was a quarter of inquiry that was done and you know it's revealing that\nThese are pretty important people that had information that could have prevented this situation and so really you know at the time these names the you know admiral king and Bruins limits and all these these men who were\nEssentially the rock stars of that area you know we won the war and\nIn the American public you know holds these men on this high platforms and we can and they are the same time are we supposed to bring them into a courtroom and have them testify and turned her surname sick I don't think\nThat the navy wanted to take that route and essentially you know the captain is responsible for the vessel so the moment that he was\nBrought to cart court marshal there was nothing to do but find him guilty even though it wasn't just\nA little is talking about the court martial of our mentioned earlier uh the unusual step of bringing the the Japanese commanders to justify that had never happened before and then ah I guess the main thrust of the argument against the captain that he failed to the exact the exact thing could have prevented the Japanese from sinking ship\nThat was one of the two churches um and not only was it unprecedented to bring in command her how she voted to testify but it was unprecedented that a captain with the court martialed at all\nFor having his shit sunk in World War two there were hundreds of vessels fund and captain Charles McVeigh was the only cap and he was court martialed\n[noise] excuse me and I'm\nSo glad he did have to charges against him one was and by the way the navy we we found in a records because we went to the national archives we went to the library of Congress Naval War college and so forth and we found these records where the\nNavy was actually casting about to find that charge that they thought would stick\n'em and as Sarah mentioned there were all these leading lights of the Pacific war who were involved in this you know the the commander of specific forces the commander in Guam and these were men who had really been the architects of this new global sea power\nAnd admiral Ernest King who was the fleet admiral\nOur theory is that he didn't want to see all these leading lights dragged into court and so that's why they were casting about for something that would stick with Nick day and so what they charged him with was\nFailure to call a band and shit in a timely manner which was quickly disproven because there were a lot of witnesses who um heard him call abandoned ship and then heard it passed man demand the second shift as you are the second charge rather as you mentioned with failure to think that\n... was an anti submarine warfare tactic worship which they're back and forth across based course\nHoping to throw off the aim of the Japanese seven commander and indeed happened make they did the stick
