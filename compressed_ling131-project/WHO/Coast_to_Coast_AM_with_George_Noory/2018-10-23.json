{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WHO", "content": "After that trip\nI changed and got a lot more serious [noise] she says I was against the war but not against the troops that I can speak for\nEvery Vietnam veteran when I say that we appreciated everything celebrities and entertainers did to keep our spirits up [noise]\nWe were reminded when we left what was back in the world as we called it to return to\nThe usa I'm sure she doesn't remember specifics\nBut I Wonder if you could pass along the note from me\nGary Wagoner chief clerk of the forty fifth mobile unit self contained transporter both hospital [noise]\nI don't know you know whether we were the first hospital she visited or [noise]\nOr whether or not she had already been to other field hospitals but from what I remember just\nThe way she looked after she saw the wounded\nOr that seemed to me like it was quite a shock\nTo her [noise] so God\nBless you missed French is we appreciated your visit\nAnd the time you took away\nFrom your tour to [noise] to entertain us\nOne story and county uh we were just starting to spring that on you but we didn't know how else to do it and we'd love to hear your comment about that story 'cause it's so beautiful\nUh ... can't [noise] whereas you know sit down and so on my line I never think that\nTo me one of those guys are yeah I I don't have a ... one year now [noise] because it was it was just guess guess it is now the gas ...\n...\n... ... ... chance to go around and they were giving ...\nEver writing American ...\n... ... ... ... they had no choice but to Canada or just fight\nThat war and was it was a kid and a lot\nI think a lot of people think that county and by the way we have a second surprise for you this listener Gary Wagoner he's on the phone with us right now county we figured we connect him to you Gary oh why don't you talk to Connie and just to pay your appreciation now all these years later\nOh hi uh can I call you're caught any course I can yeah [laughter] uh not\nBad memory for a guy that can't remember what he had for breakfast right [noise]\nSo how can I can I ask you\nYou saw a number of the ... the hospital's\nWas the forty fifth surgical ... was that the first one that you saw\n... every day I went there first because I live right on in Clinton County and I sat on so I ... I sell\nRight at night and I didn't write it might not again\nBecause I went every gross ...\nWell the reason why I ask is because I remember you walking out of the war\nAnd it was almost like you would never seen\nThe troops will get ...\n... yeah yeah it was almost like you know oh jeez what's going on here\nAnd I was almost embarrassed I remember that bringing you the book to ask you to sign I thought man you know ... I'm sure she doesn't want to sign it not because she doesn't want to sign it but just you know you had a whole bunch of stuff going on in your head that you just viewed\nIn your life and all that right [laughter] right I ...\nYeah I always tell people you know I didn't do much over there I've pounded a typewriter for a year\nBut we did get what happened out in the field\nAnd uh you know when we heard the helicopters coming in much like and I'm sure you've seen match and radar yelling and I mean\nI'm we knew the Ninety nine percent of the time it was not that it'd be good news\nBy so as you said some of the things that uh we had to unload off the helicopters\nWas the stuff that I don't think any of us even what I call the lifers the guys the the thirty and forty year old sergeants that had been in\nThe army forever I mean I don't think they were ... uh yeah yeah I mean and to draftees that really didn't want to be there\nOf which I had a number of friends it was really just something that I'm not surprised that\nWe sent back a drug addicts and\nIn my case alcoholics knock on wood I've stopped but you know people that just couldn't handle the devastation well yes well here's the reason I Am and correct correct\nYeah ... and all of a straight shot they were crazy and what ... ... ... it was actually a rehab ... scale so actually I actually in the house of paychecks game\nYeah yeah well you know again I Want to thank you\nFor taking time out\nEspecially and train them\nWe were we were out in the ... there's no question about the\nThe uh find out what the ... all of that yes ma'am and unfortunately a lot of plastic and\nWell on unfortunately you gotta you gotta big dose of it when you went through the awards by hospital\nAnd I also heard that you really want out of your way when you got names and addresses and phone numbers of the guys and the words and then\nThey got it driving a game called ... that how\nWell you are you know\nWords escaping wonderful doesn't cover it\nWill carry I I really appreciate reaching out to sending that meant so much\nFor joining us in the hour but you know in the end is\nYou it's all those records all those cells but that human touch that show the real heart of county for instance in the end the real heart of America as Americans disagreed about the war\nAnd many good people disagreed the American people or many of them most\nOf them treated our soldiers so poorly in kind of you did not [noise] and it was appreciated by our men in uniform still appreciate it today and thank you to carry thank you to Jerry Wagner and thank you [noise]\nAnd I mean the sincerely if you're ever out in the Los Angeles area\nI Love lunch or dinner [noise]\nScary\nAnd thank you Gary and we bring these kind of stories together your folks [noise]\nOkay for all those you know people that are anti immigrant and all this stuff\nIs it the folks that come across the border illegally on the backbone of the unskilled work force in the United states and every economic factor that you can imagine so if you're talking about a hotel and hospitality and meat packing\nAnd farming and it was just goes on and on of a industries that hire illegals including yes the president Donald Trump hires illegal it really help with the maintenance of his properties and in the construction trade\nSo the idea that this has now become like a great political football form is the flows of immigrants are not going to stop and they reflect the failed states over there there's not going to be any reduction in foreign aid coming from Trump acting great ... a stump speech\nBut it's not going to happen Congress as the one that allocate the money and they're not going to cut the money to these governments because George what they know is that if you create more mash poverty over there\nYou're going to get even greater more immigrants coming\nTo the United states but the fact is that we need these people essentially to give the unskilled labor that nobody is willing to do because the industry is actually in this country right now that they there's no way that they can fill those positions with just the normal US population\nSo are you just saying let the seven thousand illegals just walk right into the United states of course\nNot but what I'm saying is that they when they pay the coyote days you know to bring him across through tunnels or whatever the brake isn't the fences that go on that\nThousands of miles of border that that's going to continue going on and there's nothing in Washington that can stop it\nThere's no immigration reform package up by any kind of bipartisan package that's going to stop the flow of illegal immigration it's purely a function of failed states in Central America and\nThe fact that we have an economy that supports this kind of a labor force and it's going to continue to go on an infant item\nIs is going to be a disaster John I just feel that something's going to happen here uh seven thousand migrants so about a thousand miles away from the U.S border\nThe San Francisco judge denied Monsanto's request to mix the two hundred and fifty million dollar award to a man who said he got terminal cancer from around the weed killer\nBut she's also slashing the bans punitive award down from the two hundred and fifty million to about thirty nine million

five for those that want to know pursuit of this started with ... numbers back in January of Nineteen twenty three just keeping the vote on us to know what we're doing\nBut this was interesting George because if you take a look at the moon obviously now when you're ... it's about two hundred and thirty nine thousand miles away\nBut think of the other way if we were standing on the surface of the moon this is exactly what the earth would look like imagine this George the full earth will be Fifteen times brighter than this magnificent full moon we're going to see and four times larger\nWe can still see remnants of the ... meteor shower and how to do it look I endless outfit for him to sunrise clear skies of course the leftover brilliant star Coby ... the orange ... some years are still

about bitcoin Kevin I was surprised when you called me and said you were also getting into crypto currency is what's going on\nWell George we've set up a specific program that allows people do hold crypto currency inside their IRAs well\nAre you suggesting people have a bitcoin ... gold or silver IRA\nNot at all we give investors the option don't both in their IRA now explain that force when I first heard about it pointed traded for pennies in fact there's an incredible story about how one guy but two pizzas with ten thousand bitcoins that worth about twenty dollars at the\nTime but here's the shocker today those ten thousand bitcoins are worth more than sixty million dollars and with stories like that more people are interested in owning it\nWow that's quite a pizza [laughter] and that's where you come in\nRight bitcoin is a little tricky to buy and holding an IRA so we make it easy we do all the work\nKevin is good coined or currency\nIt can be used as a currency but right now we see it being used as an asset like gold and silver but in digital form\nHow much is bitcoin right now\nJust over sixty five hundred dollars but at one point Georgia was worth over twenty thousand that's why people on on it\nYou say you make it easy to own bitcoin in your IRA talk about that George\nWe do all the work we buy it for you holding insecure account and sell it for you any proceed you accumulate will be retained tax deferred until you take a distribution\nKevin any of our listeners want to learn more about the bitcoin are re what can they do\nThey can call for a free book at

O. two [noise]\nAnd if we produce them on Mars and they called a a floor carping cash is ah we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use in refrigerators and air conditioners um\nThe the uh but we didn't put them in such machines and said we just released them to the atmosphere and we were producing with the same rate we're producing them on earth right now\nIn fifty years we'd warm ours by ten centigrade bats ally okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth and the the uh [noise]\nAnd if you warmed orange that much\nThat warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the soil because it's been sponge to and it would out gas and it was thick in the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this was much ... fresh water in those glaciers is there is a north\nOf Mel oceans will I bet\nWell planet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um [noise] but yes\nThe waters on Mars that's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick steel to atmosphere liquid water rain and then you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be read the Bible\nBut if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent efficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be tariffs foreign within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technology is we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do a thorough what country but\nThe Martians\nOr they're going to do with themselves\nNo when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they watches those I ss and they bring us back a while most of the tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple a cosmopolitan an astronaut that had to abort\nBut I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well uh here's the thing I'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia gonna both face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch companies my guess the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they moved away from command economy\nUm but Russia [noise] the the issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government\nUm and because you know the Russian government is basically a organized crime I mean you know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country and uh the the uh and so if if if they\nAre going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing um hold\nOn brother were at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on coast to coast they\nSign up no go zone or ... ... email newsletter today it goes to goes to I'm done I'm\nTomorrow on Bannon bombing in the morning the grass man in the morning joins is you'll find out who\nWill give you more and more Kansas when one thousand dollars on Dan and body in the morning news radio voting yummy way too\n\n\nWe do sports history or back in Nineteen sixty four for the famous wrong way run the Vikings Jim marshals picked up a fumble and runs sixty six yards in the wrong direction\nFor safety still to this day it is the NFL number one blooper this week in Nineteen Seventy the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers leave their first home game losing to the San Diego rockets one ten Ninety nine\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy one Texas Stadium over in the Dallas Cowboys beat the New England patriots forty four to Twenty one stadiums unique root structure covers all of a steep unless the playing field but those are the elements it was often said that the whole on the roof designs\n...

I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity a if you're going to be a first class power\nOf choice or you have to be first class in space um Russia's gonna have to change and it's interesting I mean you know a a reason is a ... in a certain I mean ... ... the reason why\nThe um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy was and the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways and um so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they tried to launch a weapon or something like that\n[noise] well um I I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons uh the um [noise] you know I'm\nAll us where you hire them to do that\nWell yeah well the ... states that one weapons okay I mean 'cause what after all is a state but it is\nA a military force that exists well a presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I don't think that I mean it's such a different objection people sometimes have is that uh\nYou know if if space becomes totally privatize then gee it'll just be the rich that get to go to Mars well [noise]\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um and also I think that um\nYou know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the workings tips walk to go\nAnd um\nYou know once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income\nLevel in order to fly on airplanes you know do ...\nWhat about propulsion we ever going to do better than the kind of proportions rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now that there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion\nNow earth orbit is is it pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds uh they launch vehicles skip become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen it's not feel\nIf you could get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows a\n... you know the next new kid on the block who may uh you know knock you out in Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion to orbit\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because\nYou know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel\n[noise] um [noise] well um we could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm\nFinished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high\nVelocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you so what are we supposed to talk about the office after I listen to your show like\nI'm enjoying your show delight as though it and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars\nI'm Wondering will inflate yet there if we find someone in your life do we really have the right to invade like the American deal like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK still there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead I'm okay All right well\nHere's the thing um\n[noise] there there is an intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people right and\nYou can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe\nThat while we did destroy some things that were worthwhile we created much more\nAnd I would not undo the settlement of America but on Mars there are new Indians there are no\nBuys in hurts there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks um nobody be\nPicketing Columbus Day parades today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen\nYou know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars can we get the ...\nYeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese blends the mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little um futuristic at this point uh I think though that if we have laws that allow people to state mining\nClaims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail or that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions\nAre being launched a ... in in the very near future that is because a mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now or it has some value and uh\nAnd and and the exchange for those claims and people could get a exploration missions finance mine the asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable\nListen if you do your hair [laughter] coming from the radio\nNews radio ten forty\n...\nFox

Braun and some of those incredible mine's\nWell they had some pretty good wants to uh they had ... ah who was a great rocket engineer\nSo is German technology that help the Soviets to\nWell they they captured some of the two so but uh as did we but I I got to tell you well I mean no I mean there's no question that von Braun and his team\nWe're top notch and and we actually got the real rocket engineers Soviets captured a lot of the two rockets but they they mostly caught the second tier kind of people we we got\nWe got the cream of the crop as they say\nYeah we did um but um you know by the sixties we had developed our own rocket engineers although the German team continued to play a role through about the early seventies hum I've met a few of them\nWhat's amazing to his people who are born in the eighties for example Robert or even the nineties\nNever had a chance to experience what a lot of us went through a lot of people who are listening to the program right now during those incredible time periods I mean the moon landing spot neck all that stuff was just so historical ah we really lived and we have lived through some incredible time several we\nYes but I I like to see America once again to become a country whose Creigh Deeds are to be found in newspapers and not in museums\nJust a you know and so you know like the Apollo Thirteen movie or just now the moody last

of the American flag being in that movie\nWell no they do show the American flag on more on the moon they just don't show them\nPlanting it oh okay okay\n... this movie some people found it a bit slow because there was a lot in there about you know Neil Armstrong's relationship with his kids and his wife and so forth but I thought it was pretty strong especially you know the scenes with the ex Fifteen and the Gemini and Gina flight\nAnd uh the actual moon landing itself I thought were absolutely riveting\nThey really gave you a sense of of the risks that were taken the courage that was needed and just the and the ... nature of of this thing and this this this and the daring of America at that time\nAnd um but anyway I mean that's that's that's who we are that's who we have to be we can't be these people who you know say well we don't know how to go to the moon I'm you know I mean that'd be like them in the sixties saying we don't know how to fly airplanes so\nLet's go to David the Salem mass said David go ahead sir\nI didn't mean to you both and thanks for taking my call George sure thing\nUm okay so it's interesting to me how what you what you're talking about a few minutes ago was really played into my question we you know we've talked about how how life could be sustained and the things on Mars and already might stay in life but we have any plans are there any theories on\nAustin which can lead in an atmosphere where stimulating a life just learning environment um drilling holes that were trapped gas is eating the the atmosphere with everything we have or is there any serious her plans\nFor that well\nWe discuss that earlier in the show but yes terra forming Mars the idea would be if you warm the planet with greenhouse gases she could form a lot of the costs a lot of atmosphere to help us out of the soil\nI've got a book called the case for Mars which um you can get on Amazon and it talks about how we can send people to Mars how we can settle Mars and how we can terra forming Mars that transform it in the way that you are a suggesting because marshals once in a warming planet which means by the way it had a thick atmosphere\nAnd um it could be made so again\nAnd you believe we must go to Mars don't you\n[noise] well I\nMust I I I Believe we should uh\nI Believe that it's going to be much better future if we do I believe that if we do we don't just get another planet we proved to ourselves that we don't need to be fighting over this one because there's an infinite number of world out there for us if we work together\nGood point Arnie in Roseville, California go ahead Arnie\nYeah Hi I'm ... and I just have a question on your thought it'd be leaning towards privatization\nBut are you in Anchorage privatization on the colonization of the ... of the Mars or the planet I mean are you looking at this alone and be a free for all whoever land grabs whatever they can uh are you are you with the government should be some more involved in\nThe ... how a possession of real poverty as it was would be nice if we ever got to the point where travel was easy [noise]\nAll right go ahead Robert minute left her\nOkay well I'd like to see a lot of new governments on Mars I'd like to see people go to Mars and set up city states on Mars with lots of different forms of corporate and so we could see which kind of government works the best because that's how we make progress\nOn earth you know America was a noble experiment we prove the value of democracy and human rights and\nPeople all over the world came here because this was better and other countries around the world eventually copied us because it was better\nWell if if it if you have people go to Mars and they're not forced to be under the U.S government to the Russian government or the Chinese government that they formed their own governments they'll go there with their own ideas of how government should be in some will be good ideas from would be bad ideas and the ones with bad ideas that are not workable those counties will\nFail but the ones with good ideas immigrants will flock there those places will grow and they'll become an example to the rest of

H. her radio news is forty eight degrees in clear or top local story this hour two men are dead after a shooting in Fort\n[laughter]\nHi DVD yeah this is news radio this morning when you each and every I hired radio\n[noise]\nWelcome back to coast to coast George ... with you and our desk Brenda ... with us Brandon is a clinical therapist author purist psychologist residing in the northeastern section of Ohio\nHe has a graduate degree in clinical counseling from the University of Toledo\nPsychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland is research at the University of Pittsburgh centered on E. and maps environmental sensitivity and go sleep donors\nBrandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his work gold ... dos studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nMy guy shot in a clinical therapist get involved in those studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a go from Paris psychology before I was actually a clinical therapist uh-huh yeah so it it actually I actually got a day job and then I study the Paris psychology and goes part of thing\nWell that something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that [laughter] how'd you do by the way not very well\nThat's good what did you see the they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when Donahue apples for your ... at that time it was just a booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teams up their sports wise\nShe'll tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to digest ourselves into the Gulf studies for the give us an overview of what you've been doing Brandon\n[noise] well um you know I\nUh I have a degree in Paris psychology a when I was at University of Edinburgh I studied uh I'm basically ... the environmental sensitivity and go counter um and then when I got back here to the states I got back into the critical part a thing\nAnd then that's what kinda got me going and and I'm interested in in writing a book and that's when I came out with it goes studies and you know I'm sure the listeners to your show no it's it's um no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining goes my encounters\nA oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away as lose the nation interpretations are overactive imagination which you know it's not really true in my eyes so individuals who have these terrifying encounters kind of struggled to find answers and they're kind of left with\nReality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experience is so you know there's millions of people out there including myself who are looking for things are books with more than just go stories tales of locations are outdated views\nUm and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights in the cause of these throwing encounters um it ... the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nOr even experience and you know you know these goats I been taking our interests for millions of years and if and I think we're at the point where there's becoming new perspective on these things and that's what the book really goes over you know there are several firsthand accounts of ghostly encounters\nUm you know I spent years just getting first hand account of going to anyone he would talk to me about goes over conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities and that's what I came up with some of these maybe theories\nAre and that's what I came out with a book so you know I really combined a little bit of my\nI took elements from psychological research clinical interviews I witnessed the cow of and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories of thoughts I also review the right the the greatest or the latest research in a ghost encounters with a book well\nThen you bring a dose of real science to the picture your brand new no I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is it's out there you just got to look a little bit harder um the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some great you know I'm narrow psychology a fitness a physics\nThey're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm In tangle man a non locality\nOut or electricity affects us and um and what it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just you know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find it and read a research article it kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on\nBut I'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding it\nWould have you concluded today brand new about what the ... experience might be for someone real big into their imagination what do you think's happening I actually think\nA majority of it goes the encountered that that are out there I Believe are there is some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to goes like honors it's such a complex process\nAnd there's so many variables going on um you know there's environmental stuff there's um a internal ... electrical stuff going on\nUm but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine and um you know obviously there is some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think a majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes them\nWhy did they help\nMy in my view I take them or a sigh based view on goes\nSo that's a inside it's basically um pull up at the extra sensory perceptions those types of things\nI I really think that a lot of goes link counters that happen out there um the base of it has to do with um ... the or I'm sort of 'em are coming and being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment that other people on\nMy main theories in the book over um what I call a Calif addict distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters a so I really think that\nUm people's telepathy a is a real or it was a real important part of it goes way to counter\nHow important then is the person as opposed to something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um\nIt's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters but I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of the ghosts of encounters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm a death\nOr life threatening events\nOr some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters or so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it sort of\nThere's a lot of things that happened after that and one of those things is um you know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress trauma life threatening you're gonna have all these emotions that are associated with it\nAnd then that leads to sort of these by energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers\nSort of our innate ability to send\nA distress signal to somebody else and and the great classic example of this is the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these\nThis is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a an aberration of my aunt and she says you know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying you\nKnow my aunt passed away right on time that I had that right and I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying and somehow she sent I'm a ... Patrick distressing they'll thing ah to me and I picked up on it and it showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and um you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affect certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nElections Mr Chief justice stores frogs\nThe thing is that state of child down\nPercent of the time for information right\nNow is now ... on your\nNews radio ten forty forty W.

about and it's the idea of wormholes\nPortal tensions\nUm and and that sort of under special conditions I'll call them goes enter into our universe I'm\nSo in this example the witness in a sense was able to access the previous timer dimension universe and she was able to look back and see what's happening that location and maybe the child and the mom saw this woman dressed and futuristic cool futuristic clothing and got terrified and ran away so it's almost like a glimpse into something else\nAnd a lot of times these are perceived as ghostly encounters\nYou ever when you're doing these studies have you ever\nEncountered something where you'd even scared to death\nI'm personally no I haven't been scared that budget I had an experience I'm\nA I live in sort of the country a rural area of Ohio and um [noise] oh one morning I'm Me and my wife was out of town and I'm\nOne morning I had I kept getting these overwhelming feeling like something's wrong like fear like adrenaline and that was sort of drawn to the outside uh we have a four acres and upon and I said why is that why do I feel this way and my dog was feeling the same way to normal she's pretty calm in the morning but she was like scratch and they get outside\nSo I'm like yeah you know my scientific brains gone just take a shower and go to work and don't worry about it and I'm like you know when I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to follow through with this\nSo I open the door the dog and me and went outside in the backyard and she's sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I saw something like in the pond floating\nAnd I started walking and then I started running and it was a neighborhood cat had gotten into the pond and somehow um you know drowned in there by you know I Do in the ... you know all that stuff [laughter]\nBut I Am from myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but\nSomething drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing\nAnd I never got that feeling or that desire to go outside but something happened and I kept that asking myself what what happened what made that day different\nAnd was there is some sort of like distress signal sense to me with the cat and distress and it's kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know but that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kind of like this so many cool things happen there it's really amazing experience\nHow many people are normal experiences occur Brandon because the person who\nDied who comes back\nNever had some unfinished business had they had to tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI\nYou know I don't know a percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there of ghost encounters have to do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like the death of a father or something\nRight you know I'm ... you know you're sort of struggling with death ah there's all these emotions happening um so you know the body sort of\n... the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that sort of sets in motion of plan to sort of hill this\nPsychological wound through what other whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you might use unconventional means you know and if you have collective unconscious or collective consciousness exist and memories\nOf personalities and experiences of all of our humans are sort of stored in the atmosphere um you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like your father showing up and saying don't be sad I'm at a better place\nYou know and and I think the thing I the research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these um bereavement operations associated with their debts spouse one month after their death um so that's a pretty high number eighty percent\nOf the huge no yeah yeah and and perhaps these bereavement operations er visits from the deceive shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual psyche and perhaps ... could be sort of a way\nThe process of emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of the survivor you know a final goodbye from the deceased\nCouldn't help but to move on through crisis or grief\nOr maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of move towards resolution and ... and when I talk to those these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more at ease or accepting of a loved one death after the evaporation\nAnd I think on TV usually go stir negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive um it can come out of it goes the encounter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is\nUm something to look forward to it's just not all negative and demons and things like\nA friend and what have you concluded above the people who are more receptive to these guys are ... others what's so special about that\n[noise] that is a that's a great question I Wish I had a definite answer for that um I think [noise] you know something narrow biologically is different about them you know when they put 'em\nThere's there's some test out their specifically with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like\nThat like human magnet you\nYeah yeah exactly you know the research is kind of sometimes fifty fifty if you want to think about that thing\nWith this phenomenon exist and and it doesn't exist but there's\nSome some really unique experimental designs that um you know where they're actually doing I found out FM our eyes any jeeze and what they're finding is their their brain is actually and their bodies are reacting\nThis electricity at very low levels so there's some\nSort of objective evidence that they can detect things that are more than ... other people and the general population can't\nYou know so and this is true for less than we all we all experienced pain differently right and they've shown that throughout them arise as well so you you know you know I might get\nPoked with a pen and to me it's a horrible painful event for you it's not really that it\nDoesn't hurt at all see what those

Brendan that you don't have the answers you wish you did\nA while I'll be honest with you I think ah any type of um\nHolds her guys activity or recurrent spontaneous psycho cases where objects are moving and I really don't know what's going on in those types of cases\nYou know the do humans have the ability to move objects\nOf their um in distress um\nYou know to me it's hard to fathom you have the ability of like where the poetry guys I'm a you know we'll call it a ghost moving objects when they can physically touch them and things like that\nI really don't know the answers to that um so you know it's it's something I always read about that go back and forth on well maybe that's true maybe that's not but yeah that's one that's always baffled me\nMore new rules seem to move our car keys [laughter]\nI don't know there's a whole book in that George you should get on that\nMr Bush or something else to give us another story if you weren't\nSure um I was lying awake in bed for hours I could not fall asleep when I could not understand why I was very anxious and felt as if something was not right without warning soft glowing light up here next to my bed the light gradually morphed into the form of a man who am I recognize instantly as my ex husband it\nDid not say anything and appear to be just staring at me what was bizarre was that I wasn't scared and I had little reaction aside from being curious\nThe next day I got a call from my son my ex husband's child dating my accent died the night before unexpectedly his death occurred around the same time I saw the image in my room I think he wanted to say goodbye one last time\nSo this is a case of a crisis operation that we talked\nAbout earlier so we've all heard of these but it it illustrates the role of a lot of the er sigh phenomenon and operations so as a man was experiencing a tense emotional shifts related to the process of dying in a in a way set up\nCalif addict distress message to his ex wife who we felt linked with\nIn this case the woman witness I'm the typical soft glowing light operation or those types of things um and what's really fascinating is since his death we don't really know the time of his death you know we know that this happened around the time of his death we aren't sure if this is\nI'm a ghost or pull up to the er ... phenomenon\nBy suspicion is you know as a person is dying and these crisis events they're kind of\nA in a life threatening situation they send something out into the environment like a message hello path ugly if you want to think about it like that and it resonates with people who they are linked with in this case you know the wife may you know maybe the son got a similar experience that night as well\nBut this is a great example of a crisis aberration sigh phenomenon but also bags that question you know was this did this happen after he died or did this happen as he was dying or before he was dying and you can never really pin down the times to the exact moment because obviously we don't know exactly when the guy passed away\nAnd you find that energy and electricity has something to do with this is well\nOh yeah yeah I it's one of the most common themes when it comes to paranormal and um or goes way encounters electricity and it seems to be\nYou know the most prevalent things but the the idea is I mean listen we're we all think electricity comes from you know toasters and street lamps and things like that but you know electricity electrical fields comes from humans as well an animal\nSure does you know any involvement of humans also includes the involvement of electricity because like your city is the basis for our thoughts are emotions are movements or we're all a collection of electrical signals\nI've heard of people who walked by street lights and the lights go out and then as they get on a on a range the lights go back on again\nYeah exactly so we're all sort of traveling around with her own bag of electricity and it's just like sensitivity to environment it's all different for for everyone is walking around in a way [noise]\nUm so it's it's really important when you talk about paranormal experiences because really the only constant in all paranormal experiences is the idea of a human being president to sort of experience it out\nListen if you do air\nComing from the radio\nNews radio
