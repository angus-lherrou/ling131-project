I Love that so the first thing I Want to talk about is number one turn down your thermostat so if you live in a northern state like I Do a considered turning down your heat fight even one or two degrees from where you have it usually in the winter\nNow um I tend to be the person who is hot sometimes in cold some time\nBut in the state that the show is a a resonate it it it is really cold in the winter and in my office a lot of my clients know that I have multiple sweaters behind my door so some are lighter summer heavier\nBecause the temperatures really do change [noise] excuse me even if you don't have freezing temperatures it's likely to get cooler at night so consider programming your thermostat so that you can keep the ... temperature low when you're at home or you're not at home or when you're sleeping\nSo this is interesting to me is that now I can view my temperature in my home on my iPhone so I'm sitting at my desk at work I'm I'm getting preparing to leave work and I just checked to see what my temperature is at home because my\nYou know you want to find here's an example\nSo a Ford Escape actually has twenty four miles per gallon\nI'm which cost about one thousand five hundred and eighty three dollars on average in gas these are ... that that are marketing team found um so the ... the costs a lot of people talk about these Toyota Priuses I don't own one but they have fifty two miles per gallon which has closer to seven\nHundred Ninety dollars so that actually came from Edmond dot com those averages\nSo I think people are cost conscious the only negative and I'm\nGiving my opinion on a lot of these today but the only negative is is typically those cars are smaller and I don't know about you I'm I don't know about you guys but I Am finding that drivers are crazier today than they've ever but\nSo I don't know is that because I'm a little older now and I\nJust think that um people are driving crazier and I'm noticing it but no I really think they're getting crazier and the reason I say that is because\nWe all are running late and we're all trying to get somewhere in a very minimal amount of time but we need to be a pay attention to not only are we\nMay be jeopardizing ourselves and could hurt ourselves but you can hurt other people you know by a driving so crazy so I personally and people may not like this have you here me today I drive the biggest truck there is and I and I'm not kidding I don't get great miles per gallon\nBut I feel safe and I feel safe in this truck because I sit up very high in the truck\nAnd another thing that I I have to watch out for now is pedestrians I said I didn't in the past but I don't tend to seek them you know walking on the streets and and now we're entering winter and now it's hard to see people win it's not completely light out so I'm sitting in my big truck watching for pedestrians\nWatching the traffic um feel a lot more safe or so\nBut now let's talk a little bit about electric cars I actually didn't know this electric cars sold all other types of vehicles meaning oil and steam ah in the Nineteen hundreds of hunger to there was electric cars I had no idea\nThen um then everybody was using gasoline cars but then back in two thousand eight that actually was the first kind of electric car and you might know who that was out there if Tesla\nSo they started this but the problem was is when you did a full battery operated car\nYou actually have to go charge that battery\nAnd filled the they needed these charging station so back in two thousand eight there was barely anywhere that you could go charge 'em that battery which made them very inconvenient now let's fast forward ten years later now there's twenty five different types of battery cars\nPlus there's twenty six different types of hybrid many of you out there no more maybe about hybrid cars\nThan you do about these electric cars then the other comments I'll make is this whole idea about not driving and like getting in your car and then just letting the car drive for you for you I'm a little apprehensive about this whole thing I I I'm\nI question that that maybe I could do it but I'm question whether the roads are um are ready for it\nAnd then I was told last week um I have a friend who actually sell cars\nThat the roads aren't necessarily a hundred percent prepared because you know the lines on the road with the car is doing is reading the line\nAnd if the lines aren't accurate the car really can take you off track so\nIn the beginning when they released\nUm a lot of these cars and and um I Know there's something about twenty twenty or really within three years I think we we're not going to have a lot of options when we go to the car dealer it's going to be I'm very I'm a energy efficient\nThan a you know they they said that we still have to put our hands like we have to put a finger on the wheel to that at least guide the car so we're not going to\nNot be able to pay attention\nA right away when these are released I liked the idea in that memory talked about the crazy drivers earlier I feel like if we're all on the road and we don't have any control to go a hundred versus\nYou know sixty miles an hour or I really do believe there's going to be less accidents um and then the other thing I Do know is right now there's a huge shortage in truck drivers\nAnd so uh they're just thrilled about you know these big trucks being able to have a drive\nBecause with the Amazon's over the world by the way I I I'm order a lot from there but they need to deliver\nAll these good and so they're finding that there's actually a truck driver shortage but I think we'll have a lot long term on having a cars that are electric or trucks that are electric that can drive themselves and then\nThe last one I Want to talk about today is a paperless so lot of my clients get all these statements in the mail and I encourage him when they come in for their reviews\nLet go paper list because they're always asking me what do I do with all the paper\nWhere do I read the paper I don't want my identity stolen what what can I Do\nAnd I encourage him to go paperless so with your bank and your insurance companies and your statements in your brokerage isn't your advisory account all of that you can get paper lift and by the way you can print that statement have you really want that statement\nYou just don't need to get it in the mail every single month so so I went to over a lot a lot of how to save green by going green um but right now we got to take a break and Danny

contributor disappeared earlier this month after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey Turkish officials say ... was murdered Saudi Arabia maintains the allegations are baseless President Trump has said if Shelby was killed there will be severe punishment\nI've listen to your show for many years and was planning to take your advice take Social Security starting at age Seventy well I Know there was a break even point with respect to the amount of Social Security benefit you received\nYou will maximize your benefit by waiting but it would seem that you would always have more money and always make more money by taking your Social Security early [noise]\nThat's a great question we get just a ... million Social Security questions per week in our practice and it is complex and the reason many people asked the question is because it is an irrevocably decision you can't go back to the Social Security administration they\nOh I'd like a redo I think I Know more today than I knew when I started taking Social Security no that's not going to work so so the listeners said um take Social Security like they they said our advice was taking it possibly at Seventy well\nWe don't necessarily tell everybody to wait but there is this thing called the break even point and I'm actually\nI'm impressed that this person knows that term because when it comes to Social Security in general if you die before your break even age ah and you started collecting Social Security early you one thing\nI'm here you either win or you're going to lose so let's just say you took it at sixty two but you died at sixty six pretty obvious right\nSaid you're lucky you took it\nBecause you didn't make it to the uh break even age but what what does this break even age well\nWhat those security did and in the long time\nNow if they give you options they give you options that you could start your Social Security as early as sixty two years old\nOr you can wait all the way till Seventy years old and why would you wait well because Social Security between sixty two and full retirement age\nThey won't pack on six percent per year for that benefit then at full retirement age they will attack on eight percent between full retirement age and aged Seventy\nThis is chump change this is a lot of of growth on that payment\nIf you wait but like I said if you're sixty two and you and you and you took it you're going to get the lowest amount that Social Security will give you\nAnd then if you die at sixty six you're going to say great news I got at least four years' worth otherwise it wouldn't have been any benefit\nSome other general guideline here let's talk about the break even age so if you were born between Nineteen forty three and Nineteen fifty for your full retirement age of sixty six years old\nSo between sixty two years old and sixty six that example that I kept talking about your break even Seventy seven Seventy eight years old so in that example the person died at sixty six so they didn't make it to break even age\nIf you took Social Security at sixty two\nAnd you actually died at Seventy six and a half\nThat actually you're still a winner not by much but any time between sixty two and Seventy seven you would be deemed a winner\nNow if you make it past Seventy eight years old then I'm technically you're losing because when you take the dollar amount from Social Security\nIt's it's the same it's gonna be the same with some inflation rider over time but it's going to be that low payment for the rest of your life not to break even stage for the rest of your life\nSecondly if you're sick if your full retirement age sixty six or through Seventy year break even is around eighty two years old so if I'm sitting to clients sitting with clients you know the break even as one conversation because that\nBased on your health a other considerations are what's your tax\nBracket today so I just had a couple and the other day and um she's still working making really good money he's retired\nBut eligible for Social Security one of the considerations was what their tax bracket well they're in the highest tax bracket or federally and ah they happen to reside in Minnesota in the highest Minnesota\nSo if indeed he took Social Security the lion's share of that is going to go to taxes so my recommendation was to wait not just based on the Social Security a break even but the tax bracket\nThen I talked about the longevity and then how 'bout phone all options so if you're married it's not as easy as saying here's my Social Security what do I want to do what's the best thing for you as a couple\nAnd so we take lots of consideration into those false all options and then lastly here's another complicated ah um thing we have to think about is if you were ... if one of you happen to die\nWhat are the death benefit because what happens is if one of you died you actually get to go to the higher one of the couples so the higher Social Security\nSo they just describe this and I actually think um this was a good way of showing people that it's it is more complex than you think\nI truly advise people to get help when making a decision and if you need help um we do we have this analyze or um it's actually a software that we can plug in all your personal data and then show\nYou what your benefit would be your entire lifetime faith and different ages that you live\nAnd what's your uh grand probability of success in getting the most out of Social Security that you can because quite frankly Social Security happened to be a big part of everyone's I'll ah income they're fixed income out there but you don't want to screw it up\nOr the good if you have a question you can email your questions or your money and wealth and has a dot com bust for the email or cause twenty four seven that's was during the show a age six advice\nYou dated six to three eighty four twenty three but again the email questions we have a bunch of those ocean to your money and wealth and has been a ... there was another one of my question to you ... or email says ah it's just a rules\nIf you follow what you were advised sing in your article if you are retired and keep your hands off your is just say I worry that the rules can change by the time I'm sixty five or with the should the whole game changers\nYeah I'm well thank you thank you for reading our articles a couple of places I'm not sure where this was posted a but you can check once again on wealth and has been dot com if you put a H. S. A. in the search call Amir are are in the search box or whatever\nThen this article I'm sure is going to come up but HFCs stands for health savings I'm the health savings plan\nSo the article we had was if you aren't retired keep your hands off your age I say well\nThat's that's one person's opinion because here's\nOne of the health savings um health savings contributions to do is so I participated in one because our company has a high deductible plans and as a couple of we can put in a seven thousand some odd dollars and I have that money taken out of my\nA paycheck and it's not tax right now it's not packed if indeed I use that money for qualified medical expenses\nThan their earnings that I earned on that money in that particular account our tax free and I don't even have to pay money on that money that I put in there even though I got a tax deduction for it unlike an IRA when I got the tax deduction I got to pay when I dig it out\nThis is where if I use it for qualified medical expenses it's actually going to be tax free on the back end\nSo we like to tell clients and everybody's different so I'm just going to generalize here is um wall year working just keep putting that money in there I personally don't use\nMy health savings account for costs medical costs that I have heat you know during the year day to day I pay that out of pocket\nI Want my health savings accounts to grow so that when I Am sixty five\nOr older you don't have to be sixty five but you get older I Want that to not only have the contributions that I made but I Would love to have the earnings on what the contributions did because what I'm finding is is that health care is only getting more expensive it's not getting cheaper\nAnd as I've witnessed clients having these types of buckets and assisting them in using them for um health reasons like their Medicare premium\nThey're long term care expenses you know when you retire to have this kind of bucket is very helpful when you're looking at cash flow because medical can be a a high percentage of the cost", "show_name": "Your Money with Wealth Enhancement Group", "year": "2018", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "14"}
