in the Minneapolis St Paul metro area the shore rejects Minneapolis or no way of listeners over the country but if you're in the twin cities metro area circus out I'll be a speaking somewhere near you and the very near future Wolfram Hansman\nDot com slash our is VP I'm so in the journal after his workshop pig or do you talk a little bit of both got a job after you retire and there's a lot of things to consider\nWell in retirement I just want to put a little bit of a plug in for you traveling all over the world haired talking in educating people about retirement that has to be probably one of the biggest life changing event that we deal with and we work with people you know as are gainfully employed and the paycheck to continue to come in but\nWhen you transition to actually creating your own paycheck and uh the fact that people are living longer\nEducating yourself about a retirement and the kind of the ... you know before you retire is important so gruesome thanks for travelling all over in educating all sorts of people on that\nBut part time job I'm so working in retirement I like how you set this up because you may be doing it because you want to or you may be doing it because you have to and so the first point I Want to make is\nYou have to educate yourself of what ripple you use that word might come into play if I work so\nI think about Bruce first of all we have a lot of clients that work we uh we happen to work in the city here that has so many fortune five hundred companies and what ... what has happened is is they don't necessarily want to lose\nThe employee because they are very valuable to the company so they retire and then they go into consulting have you heard that we're a ton\n... so do exactly that\nSo when you can also it's like you're starting your own business and so one of the things is we we point out to clients that there are some financial risk that can come into play when you own your own business so\nI'm In and starting your own business consulting doesn't necessarily take a lot of ah you know hard cost you know you probably work from home and you're able to take on job you know you might say what kind of risk do I have well\nWhen you have your own business there's liability with everything you do and so educating yourself a boat that liability you know I I recommend that people talk to an attorney you know should you a forum in El al the unlimited liability Corp for what you do\nBut I get other clients that retire in their stagnant they sit around and they do nothing\nAnd I can see them each before my eyes every review meaning that you know they look way older than they did the last time I saw them so ah I don't know the you know psychological or medical or statistical data I just know from\nDoing this for over thirty five years in my own observation when you retired has to be not from something but to something and what's going to give you purpose in motivation and drive in the next phase your life again that's a brilliant thing to bring up\nWell are are marketing department put here society for personality and social psychology found that in twenty sixteen a study that valley Val valuing time over money is linked to happiness so\nYou know just make sure you're doing something that you enjoy so Bruce when I think about retiring one day it's easier for me to think that I'm never going to retire\nNow um my favorite quote is life is what happens when you're making other plant so you still have to if something were to happen that I couldn't actually do my job full time or part time you know you want to have something in mind as to what you're going to do\nYou know that I recently went on vacation for a week and really tried to disconnect and not check my emails by the way I somewhat failed that [laughter]\nBut um so after a week I couldn't wait to get back to work and when I got back to my team I said you wouldn't believe how energized I Am and that's one week so\nThose are assigned to me that I better think of other things that I'm going to do if I ever retire or I can see because we have flexibility and our job or that I could do this job for very long time and um you know work with clients and we do we have advisors that are in their ...\nYeah I I've said before too though I have no intention of retiring because there's nothing I Do that I like more than ... than doing this\nUm so you know I I feel truly blessed I think retiring\nFrom your job if you don't like your job or your your job and a lot of that is a lot of people I feel it in a bad for him\nBut I Love my job so it doesn't feel like we're somebody smarter than me once said you know if you find something you love to do and you never have to work at the in your life that's how I feel now I also know like you said the my body my mind are circumstances beyond my control may not allow me to do this forever and I hope I\nHave the ... someone tells me Bruce you're just not cutting it any more things are slipping through the cracks and you're forgetting things and you're giving information actually incorrect you you can you you know I I I Hope I Know when I have a right way um but again\nI'm the people that retire and then go get a job\nWell generals for intrinsic rewards are for the paycheck or ball we want to go back we talked a little bit about taxes yeah but we didn't really talk about you know the income and the ripple effect on you know sometimes we talk more ripple effect I think we we report they're hanging on what what are you talking about what's an example of a report you want to talk about\nYeah because a ripple effect is something that you know you have some additional income but then I talked about just generally federal and state brackets you'll pay more in income tax but you also if you're taking your Social Security and even if you're over full retirement age\nI'm your Social Security taxes are based on your income so that might be a ripple\nYou if you're over sixty five you know um there's a Medicare a premium that has to be paid out of your Social Security or if you're not taking for security yet you need to\nUh pay you know Medicare for 'em your supplementing part B I think it said and so that's another ripple because the more you make the more you're going to pay for that premium\nThere's also a consideration that if you're below the lowest tax bracket you know twelve percent is the lowest bracket now that you couldn't get your capital gains at Fifteen Percent so we do a lot of interest year planning because we're aware of these reports\nThat can happen within a because Bruce a lotta times it's not obvious in the tax return 'em that this is going to ripple and so a an actual mock tax return has to be done\nTo find out um you know what what a job might or a part time job and you wouldn't believe like just Fifteen thousand dollars could cost you hand out of the Fifteen thousand you know because of these rebel they can be dramatic\nOr two things to add to that and and that was a good explanation of ripples and there's even others that are more complicated than that that I don't know that it makes sense to go into now but the the Medicare part B the cost for your Medicare\nAs we mentioned is driven by income but the tricky part there is this is based on income two years prayer for those of you that are on Medicare for two two thousand and Eighteen your Medicare part B premium might be something like a ... a hundred and thirty four dollars or whatever but it's based on your income from two thousand and sixteen\nSo pick I'd mentioned this up my summers LA Times I've gotten phone calls from people that are not clients of mine but they know me from radio or TV or whatever they call me up and say Mr ... I got my Medicare part B premium for this year it's way higher than last year and I don't know why\nAnd I'm In my first question usually is well did you sell a piece of farmland or a or a highly appreciate stock or something two years ago or ...\n... what does that have to do with anything will that your your income one way up in the ripple didn't hit your Medicare part B until two years later so good news bad news bad news is there's nothing you can do about it now good news is it's only for one year if your income the next year went back to normal than your Medicare part B premium will go back\nTo this dramatic person's a hundred and thirty four dollars for like four hundred and twenty five or something and that the month so I mean she wrote a book or three thousand\nSix hundred dollars and that's a piece that each person you know both too so yeah I can be a huge ripple\nAll right let's let's let's take a break and then we'll finish our discussion on this after the break and we'll get all the listeners involved in\nThat as usual boosted a couple of ways to get involved call us and said you can use the telephone number twenty four hours a day seven days a week eight eight eight six advice that's eight eight eight six to three eighty four twenty three or send us your email questions so your money and wealth and has meant that cup\nIs your financial plan for retirement based on a one size fits all advice if your advisor isn't in tune with your values and goals your retirement plan won't be complete planning for how you'd like to spend your retirement years is just as important as calculating your future expenses and income I'm Peggy ... host of your money in W.

V. and they're interested in that because versus reading an article on our Web site they actually like just watching a five minute topic that you're going to talk about every week\nAnd I think maybe we all learn a little bit better but if you're somebody discuss it rather than try to read it and that's why a lot of people do books on tape and you know right with that with\nUm before we get listeners involved or an ... and by the way you thanked me for doing these workshops let's be honest I Love doing them and we love it you don't have to thank me for doing what I Love to do I'm\nIn the first time for the show we talked about retiring with a part time job and we don't need to rehash everything that we talked about but I think the key takeaway\nWhen you retire whether it's an actual job or whether it's some other purpose or some other passion that's our point is retired to something to the next phase of your life\nAnd have a reason to get up in the morning have a reason to attack that they have a reason to remain vital and don't become stagnant doesn't have to be a job a vote certainly can be and we talked about some of the things you need to know if it is a job but I think the key takeaway that I Want people to get out of the first half of the show is is that\nDo something even after you leave your main jobs the busy should have a purpose\nI think to Bruce and um my daughter Nicole who many lift there's no she works for wealth and ... as well she said to me it probably already a decade ago and talk about having a passion for your work I tended to ah\nWork many many hours a week and if you enjoy something it doesn't feel like we're but she said to me about a decade ago that if indeed I wanted to retire one day I'm I'm going to need to make time for other people meaning friends and that kind of thing 'cause she said you can't just retire one day and tell people\nHere I Am now I'm retired be my friend\nYou know where I've ignored these people for decades of time 'cause I was working and I thought that was some great advice and I wanted just to a\nA follow up with that and say I would practice kind of you know I'm trying to do other things get a hobby you know make sure you're meeting with friends make sure you're doing things outside of work before you retire I thought that was great advice\nGreat advice recall practice retirement before you do is go go to try some activities in and do some things and see if you like these ... because again\nI always say what for the time you did something for the first time and you did it well why nothing right you've never retired before so how do you do it well there's things you can do to practice for before you get there that's an exceptionally brilliant\nThing what I found out to Bruce says that um people actually really like hanging out with\nMe [laughter]\nWhen you when you work so much your ... you know you have your you have the team you got the round table in all that but then when I got outside of work I went oh people really do like hanging out with me\nIt's like Jimmy ... who was on the show last week journey put a glass of wine and your hands zero\nAnd we're a lot of fun or do you look at who's involved\nYou can call us you can send us your email the phone number again is available twenty four seven that is eight eight eight six advice eight eight eight six to three\nEighty four twenty three again if it is easier to send us your email questions do so at your money and wealth has but it does come again emails go to your money and wealth and has been the outcome was\nSending a Piglet service an emailer or somebody writes him I told my employer that I was considering retirement and they've offered me a part time position\nTo help keep me on it's tempting because I'm a little behind where I'd like to be then my saving and investing for retirement but how can I really weigh the pros and cons between the taxes all oil and the money I could make and this was right on point with where we actually talked about in the first half of the show\nYeah I liked that question and we didn't address this in that we were talking about some of the ripple effects like you're getting a tax more on your Social Security or you're gonna get taxed more on your Medicare or um you're going to go into a higher tax bracket well with all that said\nYou're still going to probably well I'm a hundred percent sure you're going to be in the plot area which means\nYou actually are going to make some money from putting in time at your work yeah it might cost you more money than maybe someone else because of all this ripple effect\nBut bottom line when you talk about the pros and cons I sometimes have to look at my clients and say OK working it still net net Glenn it'd be better for you and your family if you continue to bring money home\nBecause what it does Bruce that allows us to\nFill grow their retirement assets more time\nSocial Security will grow because you're probably not gonna take Social Security and each year that grows\nYou're not going to um even if you're in a higher tax bracket uh you know you're still going to bring net dollars home so I in in I didn't even talk about the mental and physical and the happiness and you'll still get out I'm working as long as you like working for that company\nSo I absolutely see more pros and cons of ... when the emailer said that there are a little short on their savings I think you still want to put a little bit more ... on the cake if you will\nBy I'm working some to have that comfort because I Would have a really hard time\nGoing and retiring if I was nervous about having enough you know for myself and my family long term\nI think that's a great point and you reminded me of something as you're going over the this idea that you know what's the net net so I've got some higher taxes and I've got some costs us up my business but the amount of money or make I'm Still going to have more net we talk about reducing taxes\nAre trying to reduce taxes all the time and I think one of the things that people fear and and we try to prevent this from happening is bracket creep another words I make so much more money that I jumped into a higher tax bracket or what just want to remind people that while we try to prevent that\nIf it does happen it's not being under the world let me explain what I mean by that so if you're a married couple firemen jointly and your combined income is Seventy seven thousand four hundred dollars or last\nYear and a twelve percent federal tax bracket but if you go over Seventy seven thousand four hundred the bracket goes all the way to twenty two\nIt's not a subtle little two percent ... percent and that freaks people out for what you need to remember is so let's say I make Seventy eight thousand dollars six hundred dollars more than Seventy seven thousand four hundred\nI don't pay twenty two percent on the entire Seventy eight thousand are paid twenty two percent on the six hundred dollars over and above Seventy seven thousand four hundred sewing six hundred dollars aren't paying ten percent more now Jim", "year": "2018",
