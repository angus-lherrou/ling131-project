I think if you have a mortgage if it's a lot of times last right\nDown I mean my my basically be breaking even right and the goal is at the end is in the long term that if you have someone else paying off that mortgage though Thirty years from now you basically on a property that somebody else paid for and you have this at that\nAnd of course the beauty with rental properties is the day that come that you have a a rental property that and the mortgages paid off all of a sudden you can have very high ... high relative to the to the overall portfolio the one item I just want to want to highlight though\nIs that I'm entering into real estate as an investment is a kind of a little more precarious today than it was I might have some good family friends that you know they started investing and real estate in the seventies and eighties and interest rates are really high back then and it was a big step\nBut what's happened over the last thirty to forty years interest rates have gone down significantly to all time lows and at the same time you've had inflation go up so rental income and the fact that they collect that have gone up and they're in a really sweet spot today those people who got into this thirty forty years ago\nToday however we're what we're at a place where the interest rates are at all time low so you're not going to make money on refinancing your mortgage at a lower rate\nAt the same time inflation has been relatively stable and whatnot so it's just it's a lot harder to enter in and expect the same types of return that investors have had um who got into this awhile ago\nYeah in fact the discussion while we have a few minutes we're in the first year of tax reform so are there any provision that have affected this rental thing we're talking about here\nThat so that's actually a really big opportunity in the new tax law and so um we know about the reductions individual tax rates that have happened we've talked about that on the show multiple times um we talked about the elimination of deductions and the tax law so maybe let's let's dig in that for for a second\nI'm One of the big items that has impacted people an equally across the country is the limitation on your ability to the doctor your state income taxes\nSo previously you would take all the state income taxes you paid all the real estate taxes you pay down your primary residences and whatnot and you add those up and you would take those as an itemized deductions on your tax return the new tax\nLaw the combination of those who is limited to ten thousand dollars so do you live in a a high income tax state or a state with high price\nPretty taxes you're going to run into that kept fairly quickly especially if you have a second home\nThe what's interesting is that in that calculation any rental properties that you have are not subject to that limitation the property taxes that you pay on a rental property or deduct it against the rental property and income\nAnd not combined with your personal income tax and the the real estate taxes on your personal um return so I Want to clarify that because that is one item that we run into\nThe second item which is going to be a little bit deeper and ... and maybe we'll jump into after the second half of the hour here is is a what's called the new section one Ninety nine a deduction\nAnd this was a brand new provision in the law that all the accountants and attorneys around the world are I'm looking for and trying to understand and are confused and I are us is releasing new regulations\nTo try to provide more clarity but the general concept of that is that if you are a business owner\nIn some sort of fashion have self employed income or whatnot that potentially twenty percent of the income that you have would be exempt from federal tax\nThat's really powerful huge if you think of somebody that a hundred thousand dollars of income they would only have to pay tax on eighty percent of it and this has special provisions that uniquely applied for real estate that we'll dig into here shortly\nYeah so we only have a little bit left but we have a lot more on the outline and thank you Brian because I'm so glad you're in house talking today and what we'll do is when we come back\nI'd like to talk more about this whatever that there's this one Ninety nine a that I Would learn today and then also we want to talk about who do you have a mortgage did you prepare and a couple of other things that are very timely when it comes to real estate so Danny\nYeah let's take a break and we'll be back after

Saudi Arabia says the Washington Post columnist died inside its consulate in Istanbul, Turkey during a fistfight Senate Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky coal Saudi Arabia's reasoning insulting to any one with intelligence\nAnd what's interesting is that they specified two cases where it will\nAnd it is that the first one is that your rental real estate need to be a trade\nOr ... not just an investment\nSo that's kind of a very gray area because I think most um uh individuals who own a rental property what they live in the business owner that's certainly a traitor business to your point I'm the one who answer industry and wake up call to fix the leaky toilet um this is a business I mean you know that I Would qualify for the action\nAnd and that's going to be the gray area and opportunity in this in this tax law is does your rental property qualified as a traitor business or does it not\nIt's really going to be unique to every owners situation\nSo do you think their intent was I have a retail store or I have a building that I go to to do my CPA work or\nIt could be any of them okay um you could on a commercial building\nAnd be the landlord on that building and the example I've given this if your landlord and you're responsible for paying the property taxes and you're responsible for the maintenance the building and you're responsible for any of the rebuild on the inside from your attendance and whatnot so it'll cost and managing that I think that's a fairly strong argument that you're running the\nBusiness do that as a comparison what if I invested in a in a commercial real estate building where somebody else's did all that and all I did was create collapse\nMy check at the end of the day that's actually would be called a triple net lease and I wanted to make the argument that you're really not a traitor business you're just an investor collecting your income check in that case I think you would tied more towards that you wouldn't qualify for us to\nTalk about these v R B o that I mean so many people are saying hey I'm gonna rent my place or when we had the super bowl you know that was the big item where one week taking had ten thousand dollars ...\nYeah that's right and you'd have to look at the the property is to say one um how how long has it available for rent 'cause there's very complex rental rules that are available whether you're renting your your home or a vacation home enough is fourteen days are less certain rules apply if it's more than fourteen days some rules apply if you have any personal use the property certain rules can apply in other parts of messy for us to do\nYeah I might have thrown me off today I don't know I just I've been to the ads have been acting like I I'm just asking you what my clients have been asking recently I'm not only does he want to know about the tax reform but they want to know I hear that my friends getting all this money by doing that to be our meals saying and I caution them always\nYou need to really investigate what the rules are and you know we can help you but there's penalties for not doing it right\nTrack that's certainly something to be aware of\nUm when it come back to the the auction you need to have that trader business requirement and that means your involvement with the property needs to be a regular in continuous and I think the example we just scare the commercial bank of\nBeing involved a commercial business of being involved with the property versus not as a good example the other item where a a a property would qualify for the deduction is that let's say you own your your manufacturing\nBusiness and you also owned the building I mean because it's a commonly controlled um group of businesses that\nWould qualify in this case a further deductions off his business owners listening and that's certainly something you want to talk about your account with or to make sure that you use it permanent\nSo this this part of the law I'm is part of the individual items that I Believe uh this item sunsets I Do believe in in twenty twenty ally and then we'll have to be re upped as part of the the law um there were some inequities between that and a corporate law or maybe we can have it as a follow up items to confirm\nThe yeah I I I just ask you that I 'cause I'm kinda I'm having a hard time keeping track of what's permanent like going to change in twenty twenty deck and when it comes to this rental real estate ah there's always more to come\nSo a couple of items I Want to let 'em real estate investors know is that um to help make the argument that you're running your own trader business I'm keeping track of the amount of time\nThat you spend on a business that maybe something that you didn't do before I that's certainly something that you would want to have documented\nIs going to be hard for the iris to come in and make this distinguishing on just the Oregon auto rental properties that's highly unlikely but in the event that you do get audited that's certainly something that if you have that documented that certainly going to strengthen your case I have\nFound in life in general by and the more you document everything I've only sad when something comes up oh I'm so glad I kept that long you know it takes extra time is right but it pays off\nIn the long run when you need a ... year thankful but I agree that it it is that time balance\nThe other item I Want to attack highlight is when you're trying to qualify for that trader business treatment is that if you own multiple properties that certainly strengthens the argument that you're spending more time in involved in managing a a real estate business as opposed to I'm just kind of a one off property so\nAre there a few tips for investors to consider the application to each of your situations is really going to be a unique and you'll want to clarify that with your tax adviser\nAnd the one other item I Want to highlight on this law is that there are the\nRules for the herbal simple and complex the twenty percent adoption is eligible without any limitations if your taxable income on your return is less than a hundred and fifty seven thousand five hundred dollars if you're single or\nThree hundred and Fifteen thousand dollars if you're married they still pretty simple twenty percent off the top\nOnce you start to go over those dollar amount\nAll of a sudden there's new limitations that can apply if you're a business owner if you're a consultant in a service business you could potentially have this deduction excluded and you're not eligible for it at all\nIf you own rental real estate's there's conflict calculations in terms of if you have employees that you're paying an amount that you're paying those employees as well as what the content of property was that there's just a number of complexity\nIs I think you need to get help if you're involved in this rental that's right that's right because it's quite complex\nAnd the thing is is that all a new investors are Sunni all all CPAs and attorneys there's a new for everyone\nOkay everyone's trying to figure out like they're not going to be any just the fact that here's the best person to do this because everyone is trying to understand what's going on\nA couple of ways to get in touch with us or you can call us twenty four seven eight eight eight six advice eight eight eight six to three eighty four twenty three or ... ... email questions send them to your money and wealth and has been dot com face\nThe first email we have is quite simple should I pay ... pay my mortgage\nSo it's a wonderfully simple question with a lot of interesting impacts so generally I think\nA lot of people want to try to have their mortgage paid off by the time they're retired and that's certainly something that they can do overtime and I think that there's a lot of benefit to doing that over time especially in today's environment because interest rates are at historically low amount so you can borrow this chunk of money and have a\nFour to five percent rate fixed for the next Thirty years\nAnd that provides you a lot of flexibility in terms of cash flow because I deal with this right now at my family of five or maybe I was making an extra extra mortgage payments early on but now I'm at a very expensive time in my life with my kids at the age is that they're at and I can take the gas pedal and not have that high not be locked into a higher payment\nAnd a lot of times they see people advised that oh you should you know refinance down to a Fifteen year mortgage because interest rates a little bit lower\nMaybe it is but that also locks me into a higher payment for the next Fifteen Years I'd rather have a dirty your mortgage and potentially have the flexibility to double pay like a pain in Fifteen Years but keep that flexibility is really valuable\nWhen we think about the tax law the tax laws the kicker and all this now because we have an increase standard deduction which is twenty four thousand dollars if your I'm under age sixty five\nAlready told you earlier to show that our state income tax and property tax deduction is kept at ten thousand dollars so that means if I have that ten thousand darted auction the first fourteen thousand dollars of mortgage interest that I paid I'm not getting in a benefit for because I Would take the twenty four thousand dollar standard adoption\nSo your after tax cost of the mortgage potentially have gone up\nBecause of the new tax laws so the question about pre paying in that case I can actually make argument yes repayment make more sense because instead of your um after tax costs on a five percent mortgage maybe being three and a half percent your mortgage has actually costing you five percent right now\nI'm so it's certainly something once again be unique to everybody there's castle benefits there are these tax benefits all need to be waiting\nFor you and I know you listen to our show every week Brian button person I tend to somewhat agree on that mortgage thing because she is you know leftist mortgage I can make more money on my money and and um if indeed you it it is having a mortgage can actually help you itemize right\nCorrect yeah 'cause because you have the mortgage it creates the mortgage interest deduction which you would add in was your other I mean you still get to keep but once again you're itemized deductions need to read this new higher standard deduction and if they don't you're just not getting any benefit for those deductions\nRight I talk a lot on the radio about the fact that because I've worked with um lots of people over my decade them time doing this job is my most successful people our debt free when they retire\nAnd it's all about cash flow you know so if you don't have to pay a mortgage and retirement you actually get to spend your cash flow on\nMore fun things yeah what I see\nAnd that's exactly where it's like that's why I even feel like the ... the word retirement and the dating because it's like it's all about financial independence in financial independence is not being on the hook to anybody right perfectly in on it with what\nShe's right described eight eight eight six advice is our phone number or send your emails to the your money as well for the house with a cup\nMaybe we should mention the pig a were bruises",
