I ... I don't\nLike it at all but our our our segue as\nWe're talking today about how to have scary financial conversation that you really don't want to have because they're frightening and they're scary but just avoiding the issues just avoiding the topic is even scarier yeah you've got to confront certain things where you're some examples\nYou can't really say that our um job than is quite scary\nIn that we bring up the collar Detroit in the criminal the oh no more fiery for them\nIt's kind of like a um I carry a conversation so yeah let's dive right in because one of the things that I ask people when they come for an introduction meeting and an introduction meeting alone proof\nCan be scary to people because what we do is we send out a packet and we ask them a lot of prince personal information and if you want to make the most to that free introduction meeting\nThen you would uh put together all your financial\nStatements in kind of fill out this outline and ask people fill out that I outline what are the questions on their Bruce's\nWhere does your money and go like what expense to do you have\nAnd I have found that when people come in you know number one they're actually either really scared about how much they really spend because we asked them to go gather the statements of expenses\nAnd then other what other people are just shocked at um how well they're doing expense twice what I find is not everybody actually tracks that\nAre absolutely so I'm just to pick up the throat and the and that is a brilliant place to start actually pick because\nWhen people come to see us first of all scarier it's frightening\nJust the sheer personal financial information with a stranger and I always tell people look I'm not in some of that I don't want to do it either no I've never\nEngaged the financial advisor to share my information with bug or been in your shoes I've had to share my personal financial information with an accountant for what my taxes on correctly I've had to share that information with a maternity if I Want my legal documents drawn\nCorrectly I've had to share personal financial information with a bank or if I Want to borrow money\nTo buy a house so I remember the other side of the table and I know it's scary and it was hard so what we try to do is build comfort building relationship take some of the fear and scaring the side of it don't some trust them and then and help them recognized we can't do our job with all the information we can't give advice for profit information\nBut then the other thing that happens not to be too long winded but the other thing from Fort in point I Want to make is going through the process and there is some effort on their part\nBut going through the process one hundred percent of the time with the people end up being gauging our services or not\nThey told me it was fruit for a while for them to do it because they learn some things and discovered and things that they didn't want to ruin was an eye opening experience for them but the introductory meetings valuable ... regardless of whether or not that engaged our services\nThe other thing that's identified as as a lot of couples come into the U.S or a significant others is that they start to say well you'll you know one who's really spending\nOn line and so we get in\nThe ... I call these scary conversations where I'm at the other side of the table and they're you know going back and forth about but I think it's important for us to go through that exercise and then find out what is maybe unnecessary now I find that term unnecessary maybe the most enjoyable\nIs going up and up and up and now we're going through you know Medicare time where people have to make decisions and there's all sorts of changes in Minnesota and so I'm finding that most clients are going to have to even have more money or for their finances for medical\nThe other thing is is when you think about it\nYou know you want you also have a possible expenses that you might help with grandchildren's college I see this as like a number one thing that our clients really care about is that these kids get at an education and they're seeing how much it costs\nThat you need to just consider that a down the road and then what vehicles are you really putting your savings in this um when when you're saving is it in these health savings plans which are much more tax efficient you know five to nine for college and and how you're doing it so\nI really hard time I'm Talking to people I don't have a hard time talking to people but I Know it's a scary conversation about what things are going to cost in the future when it comes to health care and education that's a scary conversation because\nBruce says you know when we do these financial forecast you know we're running healthcare it about six percent you know compound it and then um college we've been running anywhere between three and six percent you know compounding that scary\nAnd then people can't even imagine what the criminal look like\nYou know five ten and Twenty years down the road but so I Try to say no actual examples of things that can relate to in their life um I remember when gas was twenty five cents a gallon I remember when I could get for loaves of bread for a quarter I I I Know people that you know pay more for the most recent vehicle them their first house\nSo we need to be aware of inflation we can't control it but in terms of our future expenditures and especially if the education and healthcare we have to be aware of the fact that the information or if there is a lot more than what the government\nIs telling us the inflation rate is overall in our economy as measured by the consumer price index oh yeah that's all really really good stuff what are we going to spend in the future and I and I the only thing I ever that is I'm oftentimes in terms of\nSurprising expenses more and more people that they think they got their kids launched\nAnd then they come back right or the kids need financial help even as young adults do you think okay my job's over and it's not and if there's a lot of reasons why the happening today but that's a big one that in terms of expenses that maybe didn't Conan I'm getting your kids fully launched an independent as a challenge\nBruised it not even just their kids their parents friday because people are living longer and we call the sandwich generation you know we've got the kids and the parents and so trying to can sitter and this is scary consider what you've got down the road the next one is prepared for what\nIs unexpected now that's a hard one because these are negative thoughts emergent job loss sudden death you know things that don't doesn't part of our brain just try to block all that negativity out\nYeah and that's one you know and again thanks for bringing up because I think you're you're smart to bring it up plan for the unexpected and I always think about them some go how can we plan for the unexpected by definition I didn't expect it to her you know what to expect\nBut for the unexpected but it's just it's just common sense of logic gifts I always tell people that are good efficient financial plan not only works for the best of circumstances were works for the worst of circumstances\nSo if we have a stock market crashed like two thousand and eight do we have money not stocks do we have cash in church or money that we can use so we don't have to liquidate or sell stocks for income if somebody does lose a job do we have a safety net of cash\nTo cover our expenses for six months that's just common sense when you don't expect to lose a job but it could happen somebody could get sick if somebody could die do we have proper insurance as employees financial planning is not just in\nThat's what marriage but it's all kinds of other things strategies and financial ah solutions to problems and it may include insurance and you just started it's scary and nobody wants to talk about American reason why people don't like insurance is because we think of the alternative ... one of the insurance getting sick\nHaving something happened to my house or my car somebody dyeing those are all negative thing they don't want to think about but not thinking about it and not taking action you're going to help you if something happens so you got you got to look up do you not moving around your capital to protect yourself\nThe next one is huge just huge it's are you on track to retire I mean the numbers of people out there that are looking at the magic day that they're going to be able to retire I think the scariest thing is and I know people are not sleeping because it is to know whether they've saved enough\nAnd you know you have to pay for the future lawyer enjoying today and I find Bruce that a lot of our clients and people who were meeting for the first time they how do I balance saving for retirement but still living for today because I don't even know if I'm going to be around for tomorrow\nIs a fair point but I ... you know you can't assume that you're not going to be so you can't just live for today and you know I've told the story before there's been certain ... certain people over the years or one time a news anchor the so\nI don't want you spoiled all my fun if I Want to go on vacation or a new drug drug I don't want you telling me I Can't do it look we're not against people having fun on we're living for to do but I think with proper planning you can do both you can put away money and plan for your retirement plan for your future and still have fun to their\nWell then I Believe too that if you have a plan and you really have it written down the odds of you creating in making your target are like a thousand percent better\nOkay were bought out of time but I Want to come back and struck him after the show and trying to fill in in the blanks and and redo a little bit of this and they'll give you the listener involved very\nRugged Bruce yesterday a couple of ways to get a vote call us and said you can use this telephone number twenty four seven

brothers at a news conference a short time ago Mayor Bill de Blasio said his city is resilient\nAh you know things like where are you going to lead or you going to have a second home you know what would your um expensive the we help people try to figure that out so I find that this is really scary to people because it's almost easier to ignore\nThat you need to save for retirement and I find that when you hit fifty years old\nThe light bulb goes off and people will come in to us and say okay I've been living life\nBut I just turned the big five all\nAnd now I feel like I've got ten to Fifteen Years to kind of make up for those years that I Lived I Need help and I actually um commend those people for seeking help at that time because it takes some time to prepare and getting the right position to retire successfully\nI'm Glad you brought a goal and again you you you always think of smart things I didn't think of him and I want to pick up on that idea because really everything we've talked about today\nGets back to your core values are specifically the clients core values what's important to you and based on your values you're going to set goals and objectives their dreams things that you want to accomplish nice things you want to do what you want to live and so all of this plant\nAnd so that you can hit those goals ... live your dreams I'm so I'm Glad you brought that up the other thing\nI thought of is you know when we talk about is the retirement plan on track\nIt's not just saving and investing money although again I still think we could talk and ... we've ... shows on how to do that efficiently and effectively the whole\nTaxable taxi for tax advantage short term mid term and long term I'm I don't know that we're going to take the time to go through all the again the day but there's a right and wrong way to save money I mean putting away some money is better than not putting away money\nBut there's ways to do to virtually and affect the way in a lot of people aren't maximizing their efficiency\nBut it also goes beyond\nJust investments that goes it goes also too you know we knew we actually do something for clients hold a reality check and where is your retirement income going to come from\nAnd how much you're going to need to live the way you are so you can actually look at the U.S if you have and you can if you have a pension you can count those income if you're ... you're going to Social Security was the one that number going to be and we put him what we've those expecting sources of income and we put in our expected expenses at first\nAre higher than earn go we got a problem right um so rather know that now\nAre you that that's what I'm saying it's a scary conversation would you rather than on now them after you retire because now you still have time to fix it and do something so that that is not the result\nI find too that I'm being a financial adviser and I might be a little bit biased is that\nUh we our objective so when people come in and they bring their expenses and\nAnd they talk about what you know projections they may have ran on their own or um and I find that a lot of people kind of um over estimate the fact that they are on target and we just happen to have practiced a nice day that slightly but we practice\nOn why the people's lives at well finance or girl because we're known as distributions ...\nReality check for you to sending people money every single month to live on and we have seen things that actually a strategy that work really really well\nAnd by the way we've seen strategies and people's lives not work so well so we also encourage people to come in just because we have a lot of knowledge about what works and doesn't work and that's an objective third party opinion because you yourself\nYou haven't retired before you had to create your own paychecks I mean so you know taking on that job and have never done it and I think getting advice is a good idea\nUm I always tell people in the last time you did something well the first time you did it well you don't retire before the first time you're doing it and you probably aren't going to do it well thought a little bit of help I I'm I'm Glad you added that and again I'm a\nPeople that use an advisor do better than those that don't and you're right there's tons of people listening to us right now\nOn the radio going or you think that until advisor but do some research you can Google it there's a lot there's a moment of evidence out there that would suggest or preclude\nThe people that use a financial advisor do better than those that don't and you can even just do it in a common sense way you don't even have to get on your computer and Google a challenge people do this I think there's somebody that's financially successful maybe somebody you know personally a neighbor the owner of your company\nYour boss or whatever or maybe it's just be somebody you know from afar Warren Buffett Bill Gates just results of Donald Trump Mitt Romney think of somebody that's wealthy no ask yourself do they do it all by themselves or\nPerson going through it all by themselves there's a hundred guys\nRunning around Warren Buffett's home off Omaha Nebraska the guy who was widely regarded as the single greatest smartest investor in America does not do this by himself people using advisor do better than those that don't want to try to plan for your retirement or to try to do comprehensive planning by yourself\nAs a mistake for most people you can't do it as well as you as you can if you get professional home\nOr it is our phone number eight eight eight six advice keep the money you don't have to just use it during the show called twenty four seven eight eight eight six to three eighty four twenty three or you can also send us your email questions just send them to your money and wealth and has been dot com I Know we have a bunch groups\nYeah the emails have been stacking up again so let's let's get after those take somebody writes them\nDo they keep taxing your income for Medicare slash Medicaid at sixty two because I plan on retiring at age sixty two and I'm Wondering if they're still going to tax for Medicare Medicaid since we won't be getting that until age sixty five and we'll be living off retirement savings until then\nYes I think what the emailer is asking is how it is so in our paychecks we actually pay for a couple of things we pay for Social Security taxes\nAnd the way that that works is they take out six point two percent of our money up until a hundred and twenty thousand seven hundred dollars that actually is kind of moving\nI'm number per year so what that means is the maximum if you make a hundred and twenty eight thousand seven hundred the max that they'll take out at seven thousand nine hundred and sixty and you're working well then there's the Medicare tax and the Medicare taxes one point four or five percent\nBut this is the difference between the Medicare tax and stuff security check\nIt unlimited so with me what means as an allergy the example of Barbra Streisand can do a concert\nYou know in charge a thousand dollars a ticket and she probably makes ... millions of twenty five millions of dollars when she does that\nShe has to also pay this one point for four or five you know I'm Medicare tax so\nAh when you're sixty two\nAnd the only way you won't pay that is if you're not working anymore have you're not working they're not going to collect this Medicare tax\nAnd then when you turn a sixty five you're eligible for Medicare\nThey don't necessarily Bruce look and see how much peg Web put in the pool of Medicare tax\nBecause it's not my pool of money\nIt just goes into the general pool and then help pay for medical care as a whole do you remember back then when they change that to unlimited I I mean it's a long time they called I honestly don't I mean it's probably a decade are more but there is an uproar about that because it used to be kept as well\nAnd it was a way that you know if people made more money they were going to put more money into the system for Medicare because Medicare has been touted as not making meat and you know like not balancing the the balance sheet for a long time\nOn the other thing I thought of that was really going to answer and I'm Glad you were here because you knew a number of things there that I don't know or didn't know um but the other thing that that you know occurs to me is\nUm you know the question of the ... do I have to keep paying for their own moon not if you're not working um but the other thing that happens is Medicare when you are eligible and you ... sixty Medicare part B which is the primary part of Medicare\nMany people think Medicare is free but only part ... hospitalizations free part B which covers most of the things that you're gonna need there's a cost for and the cost is the is based on your income but it's based on your income from two years previous\nSo for most people in two thousand and eight team I think as long as you're a modified adjusted gross income from two years ago if you're married couples filing jointly was a hundred and Seventy thousand or less your part B premium is a hundred and thirty four dollars\nBut based on your income that can go up by like quadrupled and go as high as four hundred and something so what I thought of and again you answered the question better than I did but if you're answering it over my head was going down that road that this person was talking about you know retiree of sixty two and living off their investments and not taking Social Security\nThen when they take Medicare or when they ... they're probably also gonna take file for Social Security and then most people pay their Medicare part B premium and just have withheld from their Social Security payments so that flood just to solve it and to get our listeners that haven't gotten there yet marriage probably wouldn't know all these logistic but that's that's where my brain one\nYeah yeah and Medicare actually starts at sixty five that's confusing to people because full retirement age on Social Security is sixty six like they didn't change those are", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Your Money with Wealth Enhancement Group", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "28"}
