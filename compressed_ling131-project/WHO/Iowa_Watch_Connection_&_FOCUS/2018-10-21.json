openness okay\nAll this and common how can we were\n[noise] shifted you have something that\nWell the way you friend your question I think revealed kind of a misunderstanding of what I use the fundamental problem in American society which is really not so much the political problems are solutions but the\nThe fraying social fabric where the American people are looking at one another as enemies are is adversaries versus as friends and neighbors\nAnd so the way you pose the question though how does that move the needle out of the best that will benefit is just the release and pension benefits just looking another human being in the eyes and talking about what's most personal to you and that alone relieves a lot of attention that we're feeling\nSome slick we are talking about is a

greater Des Moines habitat for humanity is on the line you're always busy all year long how's the fault in for you\n[laughter] well it's been a great year and being able to serve families were looking to serve and three hundred families by the end of the year or so which\nBeen a little ... here of late and we're glad to see the funk sunshine out and helping us to get more houses down and more families served or those houses in\nProjects all over the city or\n[noise] yeah we of efforts going on in a poke Dallas and Jasper counties and that is both with our home ownership program on our homeowner occupied ... repair program that we called rock the block\nYeah I wanted to ask you about that were heavy rock to block this year\nHow we have ah been in a three different locations in Dallas County and then um we are actually this week we are in a Jasper County are doing a couple of houses and then\nWe've been in a three major neighborhoods in the Des Moines area and trying to help and lift up those and and just given a little bit of a a hand up so folks can stay and remained in their home\nSo I'm familiar with that program that's kind of wearing just descended on a neighborhood really any distance I Do a whole bunch of work right\nYeah typically will have a large group of volunteers come help us so we do those usually in like a three day events and will be working on twenty to twenty five homes or in one event and so we just finished up on the near north side and the Des Moines area\nAnd that that that's our last major one I'm In the Des Moines area this year and then we're starting to lay out where we'll be active for two thousand Nineteen and being able to do our repair program\nMust be incredibly satisfying after the end of those three days to sit back and look at all the progress right [laughter]\n[noise] well it it is great in both the volunteers and what they accomplish and the impact that it's having that there's clearly a difference made and and homeowners often share a how that's helping them out and so sometimes it's a ramp and access um with the ramp and sometimes it's\nA folks that are just weren't sure how they were ever going to get caught up on their house and being able to to get the repairs done and and having the volunteers and habitat for humanity come alongside them is really something that they are very thankful for\nOn your individual properties the owner hum they help out their sweat equity involved do you do that with rock to block as well as they can help\nYeah we asked folks to do sweat equity when they're doing the rock to block or so it's a shorter amount our on our home ownership program it's four hundred dollars a sweat equity in\nTo block it depends on the size of the project typically is eight hours and then sometimes when we're working with some of the seniors are folks that might have a disability we try to find other ways to incorporate them on the sweat equity so they might not swing a hammer but there may be ways that um they're engaged to be able to do their work\nWe have a huge older housing stock in Des Moines [laughter] you must drive around and think oh boy there's another one I mean there's no shortage of places where you could do some fixing up I'm sure\nThere is a large need and a lot of families that are in in housing that just needs a little bit of fixing up and so I think\nEvery time they were able to do that uh it really does create an opportunity for folks to take off the worries and concerns of of the roof over their heads and be able to focus on other aspects of living life\nYeah and one of the most basic of course this time of year we're thinking about winter rising a home right insulation and that sort of thing\nWe actually do that year round now we have a a component of our repair program is actually a weather is Asian and it gets into the things you think of immediately the ceiling up her home and also the insulation and and and things like\nMaking sure that it's a energy efficient furnace and I work in water heater those fall into those and\nAnd windows and her become a big a piece in there as well when you're thinking about whether is Asia and having a house that operates energy efficiently\nI like to talk about your volunteer crew you had a lot of corporations that people individuals and corporations and join in on this don't you\nGet for all our programs this year there'll be about Eighteen thousand volunteers out helping with habitat for humanity here no central Iowa area this year that's fantastic and uh we need all those folks um at the same time uh uh as it gets colder people\nUm think that maybe we a slow down or stop operation on there and we still have families to serve and we are looking for\nVolunteers throughout the the cold season as well and we have a program just to help a highlight that we call the winter warriors and so that's our volunteers that are willing to get out there and and help us out through some of the cold air months\nThere is no offseason huh do we keep after it and\nThere's plenty of work and need out there and so we want to be able to keep serving families all through the year\nAll right and so those fallen teams they don't have to be professionals at this right\n[noise] yeah we welcome anyone to come a volunteer with habitat on there and so they just have to have a willingness to want to help and uh we'll have a a knowledgeable person on site and those folks can help guide those volunteers so\nWe talk about Eighteen thousand volunteers coming out a Ninety Ninety five percent of those volunteers really don't have much construction experience and so with a little guidance they're able to accomplish a lot and\nUh most folks are at the end of the day stand back and kind of say wow I I really did that so that if it works really well and and being able to match up those knowledgeable with those that just really have a heart to want to make a difference\nAnd tell me a little bit about it you know about the effort in Marshall town with habitat\n[noise] um yeah the tornado affected areas for Marshall town that a habitat for humanity and a greater Des Moines and and other habitats ah went and did some immediate response after\nThe tornado to be able to help button up houses and\nUh it was both clean up and trying to secure homes from the weather and then that effort is continuing there is some additional need a for still getting some of those houses I'm In good shape to be able to make it through the winter and then a habitat for humanity is committed to\nBe able to continue that effort going forward uh for the long run and so [noise]\nUh right now a habitat for humanity is recruiting AmeriCorps to serve in the marsh town and in a disaster response fashion so that's a way of someone has an interest to get involved and then\nUm be looking out particularly in the in the spring for a call out to volunteers to help with a houses that were affected by the tornado\nAnd when we had talked before I Know you had a couple of pretty good ideas for people who maybe don't want to actually do the physical labor but they can support you in a couple of other ways don't you talk about that\nFolks can also be thinking about supporting us financially on there and that uh if if anyone wants to get involved in one of our committee's too that we have a folks that are helping us to be able to work\nWith our families and work with a different aspects of the organization that will be there for our safety and construction or through our restore operation and all those come together to be able to help us do our with our mission and being able to sort of the family\nAnd that restores very popular\nHabitat restore there's two locations and that so we love it when folks are able to bring some donations to us and uh and then if they stop and shop as well and and the researchers are important and what we're trying to do that uh this year or the stores are what they give back to habitat\nThat will be the equivalent of Eighteen habitat homes so oh whether it's an old light fixture or some cabinets that you might be taken out to all those things helped make a difference for habitat and we do have a kitchen cabinet remove all program now so if someone wants to do in a ... for the kitchen\nOr we would love to be able to come and help get those cabinets out of the way and then I Will put those in the store and and that will be transformed into helping habitat for a man whose mission\nWell you had a ... year three hundred and then you're making plans for next year already too\nWe are we're working on two thousand Nineteen plan right now and we hope to be able to go past the the three hundred mark and and ... and more families here and in central Ohio area\nMy
