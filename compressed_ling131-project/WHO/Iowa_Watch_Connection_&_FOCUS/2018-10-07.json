Republicans to do so because they they did that when this thing was originally created\nSo the DNC is not required I Would really slow raw tools as well as diligent equivalent Caesar delegate counts\nSo I wouldn't have Hampshire which with a pack of never crowded each other once we do we lose both both of us will lose are now in a situation where the DNC is set up a conflict with New Hampshire for Iowa that we're gonna have to try to work out but at this point we don't have any resolution of that\nNow the Democratic National Committee has issued guidelines for the twenty twenty Iowa caucuses I spoke to DNC chair Tom perennials on September twenty fours about them\nTo make sure that uh it easier for people\nDissipate if you're a veteran and you're deployed overseas that shouldn't\nUh precluded from participating not only in the Iowa caucus but in any talk if a if you are a person with a disability and you have a mobility impairment should make sure that any caucus site is acceptable\nOr if you are a shift work or or or you have a family care responsibility should be able to participate and we're working very closely with the party and they have been exceedingly responsive\nOr they were part of that group who ah helped us a put together the series of reforms and and what happens when we're making these processes more inclusive is that more people participate\nAnd that's what we want to do Democrats want to make it easier for folks to vote they want to make it easier for folks to participate you look at what Republicans do across this country they passed these horrible voter ID laws to make it harder\nFor folks to participate their their purging voters that ballot boxes uh they're they're doing nothing in the White House in the face\nOf Russian interference with elections are these are really important things that I have great confidence that we're going to see a very robust caucus and twenty twenty and\nIt's got to be far more inclusive everywhere and that excites me because I think that that's that's good for Democrats and it's good for democracy\nSo Iowa and New Hampshire have made peace in terms of the changes in Iowa will will not undermine the New Hampshire process I Know that was one of the concerns that folks and New Hampshire and\nI'm confident we can thread that needle very confident\nThat all may be easier said than done given the possible conflict between longtime allies Iowa and New Hampshire but\nAs Dave Nagl told me on October fest he has some ideas\nOne thought that I had to ... we can release rentals but not until after New Hampshire's oldest process and then try to get to the secretary of New Hampshire to agree that the absentee ballot participation is not the same as or October\nAnd I and hopefully that'll hopefully that'll thread the needle about half the people who supported Sanders think we ought to go to a primary in June\nA because that's a that would be fair and Bernie would have one and a half of them think we shouldn't be first anyway because after all who are we to tell the rest of the country what to do which goes back to the fundamental question why do we start small states and they don't care so we have a division inside her own party\nAnd ... be able to make sure that the results are accurate\nUm those are really kind of the three big buckets that we are are looking at as we go forward here and the other one too is that locking the caucus night result is the final result so what has happened in years past is that you know at the county level if one side doesn't get a their folks out then\nIt can change and then it can change again with the district convention that could change again at the state convention here um\nThe what happens on caucus night will be a is the winner and so from that point forward then everything will be preserved for going up through the chain and so uh if it's projected that candidate acts gets for Delhi gets the DNC well then they'll get for ... so we've got to work through\nIf candidates ... wins that many delegates in Iowa but doesn't make it past South Carolina doesn't make it past Florida if they released their delegates does that then open it up either for free connection or for some sort of a portion meant or am I premature in that\nI think that this is where the devil is going to be the details that we\nAre also starting the process now we're out doing this I'm listening post across the state to try and solicitor feedback on how we might be able to do that and start thinking through this we have until approximately\nYou know springtime a first part is trying to be able to figure all this stuff out getting her delegate selection plans written and submitted to the DNC and so for us we're starting that process to really\nPick up in earnest after after election day but uh but we're in the process right now it's starting to think through that so to answer your specific question I don't know the answer to that yet and uh\nOther states where that has happened when we were going to go take a look at how other states have dealt with this when they have primaries for example you know in New Hampshire there have been candid sue drop out shortly after New Hampshire but they still have so many delegates that they were secure on that night\nSo we just go through that process and civil finger on exactly how to do that [noise]\nOne of the big sticking points of courses then how does Iowa State distinctive from New Hampshire and one of the concerns some had had\nWas if you report raw vote totals than it's starting to look like New Hampshire if you have an absentee process it may be too much like New Hampshire the first question is do you think that our singular identity will remain pure and secondly are the folks New Hampshire happy [laughter]\nWell for us uh again uh we want to preserve the spirit of the Iowa caucuses and so we want to preserve that feeling where folks can come together and actually discuss this you are\nBecause it's one of the few places in politics that you can actually do that anymore and so we do want to make sure that but we also want to make sure that we're giving folks the opportunity to have their\nVoices heard um [noise] uh and for folks who may not be able to participate that's always been a challenge in years past us or we're gonna take a really in earnest looking at how we might be able to make that happen\nIn terms of New Hampshire you know I've traveled out there a a earlier\nThis year and I talked with our secretary of state and I stay in regular communication with my counterpart Hampshire\nAnd so you know we will continue to work with them and make sure that you know as we're going through this process keeps them up to date and you know is there any land mines that uh or challenges that may be further down the road that we're not seeing [noise]\nMake sure that we're keeping folks in the loop on that so that the for early States I've always worked really well together Iowa New Hampshire has definitely work very well together over the last Thirty years [laughter]\nFor sure and so um you know we want to make sure that we are continuing that process and also considering to work with our folks across the aisle here in the state I'm obviously the Republicans Republican process looks different than ours does report raw total 'em and they do allocate their dog it's based upon that and so\nFor us we want to you know is this is a a a lot\nOf conversations go into this process and that's\nNot something that I get to decide a or a you know you're in our FCC just unilaterally gets to decide we're obviously want to make sure that people have a chance to have their voices heard in this conversation if they have thoughts so we haven't even thought about yet and hoping that we can salute or even you know here that feedback can hear those thoughts and be able to put that out there\nTroy price chair of the Iowa Democratic party we spoke in West Des Moines on September twenty seven\nSome final words for context now from former state party chair and former congressman Dave make\nWas Daniel Webster view of the dictionary shame who wrote in the federalist papers most people don't realize he was a constitutional ... before he was a dictionary experts that is important in the Democratic process that we talk to each other\nAs you put people in a room of all the persuasion to all of the candidates\nAnd they talk to each other and they have to declare their preference in public through there for an here why their neighbors are were for somebody else\nThat's that's healthy that's democracy the lowest possible political denomination you can get and I think that's important particularly was important before this even more important now for the things I said we started the show is is we got to start talking to each other we got to start listening to each other\nAnd that brings us to the

feel safe there I feel safe there but at the same time um these are good common sense tips that people should keep in mind I suppose what about carrying things like may or pepper spray something like that\nI mean there's always options for those type of things but what we want to make sure that people understand as well citizens and people that are true is\nThat those things can also be used against them as well as being used for their protection as well so not only can pepper spray you used to um\nTo help you but remember if they take it away they can use it against you and the risk reduction could now be more harmful to you than helpful so we just talk about those that type of thing and there's a class and and just make you aware of different situations in different scenarios\nThings do happen but they are generally rare when you think about the number of people who use our recreational areas right right it's very reassuring however as you say it's certainly a good idea to just be aware of your surroundings and this event of the gay in October\nFive is at the clock aquatic Center for women only\nFor women only the reason why is we don't want those

Melissa and congratulations again on that award this is the time of year when we start to hear more about West Nile virus epidemiologist doctor and garbage has details about this virus and how to avoid it\nSo we really start to see West Nile cases pick up as we get into the late summer early fall months so this is a time that Iowans really need to be taking measures to prevent those mosquito bites\nThe most important things that people can do or making sure that when they're outdoors they're using insect repellent things like the dates a good option because it's also effective against ticks\nThe one thing I Would really recommend is that people check those labels and follow those directions carefully because the percentage of the ingredients you will dictate how long it's effective force you want to make sure that you're applying often enough to make sure you're\nStaying protected other things people can do or making sure that screens are intact to keep those mosquitoes outdoors\nAnd you can do things like dumping out standing water around your house it's bird bath should be changed every couple of days the little things like getting rid of that standing water around your house could really cut down on those populations\nYou've determined that there are some a mosquito pools you test for this a in a while every county I think has some or has there is looking for them and what have you found regarding the presence of West Nile virus\nSure so we have select counties around the state that do surveillance as we get into West Nile season and we have found several pools of mosquitoes that are infected with a virus and so that's even more convincing information to tell us that\nWest Nile activity is started we're seeing it in the mosquitos now is the time to make sure that we're taking measures to protect ourselves what\nDo you think about maybe some other products that might be on the market or available on the Internet that claimed to protect you against mosquitoes\nWe always recommend that Iowans use the EPA approved mosquito repellents and those are deep pit cared and I are thirty five thirty five and oil lemon eucalyptus those are the ones that\nIs determined to be effective and again you really want to look at those labels carefully because some products have\nAge recommendation so some aren't recommended for young children um and again it's important to understand the concentration does impact how long that repellent is effective so you want to make sure you're applying at the right intervals\nYeah and and I think your to your other advice to just you know the environment and dress appropriately and and there are certainly and there are certainly more active at certain times of the day and night aren't they\nAbsolutely so here in Iowa the mosquitoes transmit West Nile virus or most active between ... and on and so that's\nThe most important times to be wearing repellent you can also trying to wear long sleeves pants really making sure you're wearing that repellent especially during those peak hours of activity is important\nHow do you know you have the west Nile virus\nSo eight out of ten people who are infected with West Nile virus won't have any symptoms about one in five will have symptoms and the most common symptoms or fever headache body aches and give me some nausea vomiting\nLesson one percent will have more serious life threatening symptoms can suffer light is a meningitis and so\nThe people who are most at risk because of all those most serious symptoms are people who are over six years of age and people who are immune compromised but anybody that's outdoors\nIn unprotected is at risk and develop infection it's just those groups that are at risk to develop those more severe complications so it's important that everybody's taking those prevention measures\nWhen it sounds like most people who get it though could just shake it off and they might not even know they have it it might just mere another type of virus\nIs sometimes difficult to figure out whether it's West Nile virus or not and so we know that we're only finding just a small proportion of the number of Iowans that are actually infected with a virus there's only a small proportion than her reportage\nThrough the public health system because many people like you say won't have symptoms or if they do have symptoms are more mild and they may not seek health care or be tested\nYeah okay I haven't heard much about the ... virus lately\nSo really can remains an issue that for Iowans that are travelling to those ... impacted areas and so anyone that's traveling needs to make sure they're taking prevention super taking measures to prevent mosquito bites\nAnd again that's something that's important to recognize as a mosquito that transmits a virus and other areas of the world really bite all day long and so if you're traveling to those tropical locations", "show_name": "Iowa Watch Connection & FOCUS", "year":
