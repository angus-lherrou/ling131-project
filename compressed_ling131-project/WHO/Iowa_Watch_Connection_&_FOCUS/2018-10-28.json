ballot that is a low number but significantly more than young Democrats as only twenty five percent of them turned out\nAnd of Eighteen to twenty four year olds who did not hold a party identification both were eligible to vote in Iowa only Eighteen percent did\nTraditionally the percentages of people in various demographic who vote go up in short the older you get the more likely you are to

venues to name just a few issues there is much speculation as to whether the upcoming midterm elections will see an uptick in voters or dismissal of the process\nThis question is especially relevant as we look at the youth vote\nAccording to a twenty ... book called political behavior of the American electorate by Elizabeth these more that tell\nOne demographic group that consistently gets a lot

involved and it's an opportunity not to be ... so I encourage young voters to register and vote\nAccording to a fair vote dot org at its peak in Nineteen sixty six the mid term elections drew forty eight point seven percent of eligible voters\nIn the last one hundred years the worst voter turnout was thirty two point nine percent in Nineteen twenty six in twenty fourteen the most recent midterm election prior to this one the voter turnout came closer to that historic low with thirty five point nine percent\nNotably below us presidential election your turn out in the last century was forty eight point nine percent still higher than the best turn out for the midterms in the nation\nIn the last two elections and twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen Iowa was rank\nThe top ten states of the

in the mid term elections\nSince Nineteen Seventy one the constitution has afforded Americans Eighteen years and older the right to choose the kind of representation they want in government and weigh in on key issues of the time\nWhether they will do that in twenty Eighteen will depend on a variety of issues not the least of which is their own trust in the process apart\nFrom that what I Do see happening in the twenty Eighteen elections\nIs that the national electorate seems a little bit poised for what is being referred to as a blue wave if that happens on the scale that the polls seem to be suggesting what we could see is that the Democrats Democrats will regain a majority control of both the house and the Senate\nThey have to flip about twenty two seats they have to net gain twenty two seats in the Democratic direction in order for that a blue wave I think to be fully realized but that's what I see as at least possible as we head into November\nThis is guy ten and I'm reporting

how do they narrow the field down and and making\nBasically a year long process and it happens every year and the VA system veterans can enter at their local VA in the areas of arts creative writing trauma dance and music\nAnd the winners at the local level are then sent on to a national competition so that the local level we had almost fifty eight hundred entries across the United states\nAnd these are kind of whittled down and we get our national winners there's about three thousand people who enter nationally then it comes down to about a hundred and thirty seven people then from those national winters are invited to attend what they call the festival which is\nThe weeklong events that were hosting a coming up soon\nAnd at the festival these veterans are going to attend workshops and art and creative writing they are going to be doing rehearsals that are working with a professional musician who has she has done compositions for them to sing too and things like that\nWere some of these talents kind of brought out a through this therapy\nYeah I I think there's it's kind of half and half\nSome of the veterans you know maybe already were doing some of these artistic skills on their own or did it for their own enjoyment for some of them when they maybe we're receiving treatment or where an inpatient at a VA facility\nWe have on staff at many of the VA is we have art therapist dance therapist trauma therapists music therapists and they will do groups and sessions with different veterans trying to utilize the arts this therapy and to help them\nOvercome whatever problems they might have which could be P TST or substance abuse depression\nMental health illness or just general physical disability so it's just a another step and trying to help the veterans the creative arts it's just a way that they can\nCommunicate without words that can express themselves and they can put that into a painting or into a creation or they can write their own song lyrics\nThere's all sorts of ways that they can do healthy expression of their feelings and emotions and trying to cope with various things that might be going on in their life\nYou've probably seen some advance pieces that are going to be on display artwork and and maybe you've heard some recordings of some of the music to have you been impressed\nI'm very impressed every year I I've done this event for twenty five years now and every year it's just amazing um we do have some of the artwork on display right now there's a window on the second floor of capital square\nThat's got our posters and some of the artwork as they are on display the artwork is truly things that you might see a museum a lot of it it's just amazing and some of these people you know like I said have overcome physical disabilities a mental health issues\nAnd they've created some amazing pieces of artwork there's like fifty three different categories so there's acrylic painting oil painting water colors photography and black and white and color\nThey're sculpture glass work bead work woodworking just about anything you could think of I'm I've read a lot of the creative writing entries\nThere'll be some books on hand at the event on November first and that the public can take they use and read for themselves\nAnd on the stage show is it's always spectacular um we've got\nLike a saxophone player piano player for flute various original pieces that will be presented some original drama pieces and big coral numbers and some dancing to but it's always very impressive\nAnd some of its patriotic some of it's all over the road I suppose\nCorrect yeah we have a few sections of patriotic pieces but the entire events is not necessarily patriotic but we do pay tribute to the veterans and within the stage show as well\nAnd you described it as family friendly both of these events\nIt's very family friendly yeah\nThe arts you can see some of that now which is nice to know get a sneak peak and then but the main event as you said at the Capitol square atrium tell me the data that again\nThe art and writing exhibition is Thursday November first\nFrom one thirty four thirty PM at the age ... capital square the artists and writers will be on hand during that time and you can actually speak with them find out there a inspiration find out how they created their pieces\nIt'll be up all day so her passing by can still see the artwork in the morning but the veterans themselves will only be there in the afternoon\nI said like to talk about their stuff too don't they they do yes they okay and then the event at heart German place theater remind me of that time on to\nThe live stage show is Sunday November fourth it starts at two PM at Sherman place theater tickets are complementary I think if you show up and don't have a ticket will let you in as long as there's a seat\nI Do think it's going to be full we've given out a lot of tickets but still show up and see if their seats left I think the doors will open up one so as general seating so get there as early as you can get a good seats\nAll right well we want a good crowd to welcome these people from all over the country here to Des Moines so I think that'll be great I appreciate it Suzanne Anderson and offer more details can they learn about this on line somewhere\nOr they can go to W. W. W. dot creative arts festival all one word dot V. A. dot Gov and my phone number again at the VA is five one five three two three one four to seven\nSuzanne Anderson thank you very much that we've Suzanne Anderson is the central Iowa healthcare system\nNext on focus you know the proper rules and recommendations when it comes to making sure your kids are safe when they're traveling in vehicles some of those rules and recommendations have changed I spoke to brandy Thompson about it she's with safe kids grader Des Moines\nNext on focused there been some changes when it comes to child car seat safety Randy towns\nIn his state child passenger safety coordinator you with us they can greater Des Moines and we're hearing unity point Des Moines to talk a little bit about child passenger safety because\nI've seen some knew what I thought were new recommendations that came out and I need some clarity on that Randy so what's the latest recommendations that this is making news these days\nSure I think what most notable is the American Academy of pediatrics has come out with a um we're in vision\nTo a policy statement most specifically as it relates to our rear facing kid does\nAnd so what's most important to know is the message is the same from the old policy to now there were in science policy and and that is to keep ... as long as we possibly can\nAs long as and we want kids to be re are facing till they're Maxine out the weight limit\nOr heightened limit to their rear facing car seat\nI'm here in the age too had been connected to that a\nPolicy if you will and an recommendation on what the American Academy of pediatrics has done now is David removed the word two years of age and I'm just moving forward using rear facing as long as possible\nAnd so that's very exciting for the child passenger safety world on because we do know that she does come in all different shapes and sizes we know that we're facing is five times safer for a child in the event of a motor vehicle crash\nAnd sell the longer we can keep kids we're facing that is the best possible scenario\nSo what's the revision then for the wage and the height of\nThe rings vision isn't so much related to um the maximum weighed in maximum height recommendations does the the nationally maximum\nHeight or actually set forth by each car seat manufacturer\nAnd so what's important to know is that each car seat manufacture can vary until it's very important for parents to look in the manual to their child restraint system\nUm to find that information that that information is also going to be present on labels that are here to their child car seat and that is where they're going to find the maximum wage and maximum height for their car seat as it relates to their child\nThese rules have changed a lot over the years it seems like it used to be just infants only ... and it's changed quite a bit\nAnd they think that a lot of people on just socially what we think of as a rear facing car seat or the infant carrier the ones that have the handles Sarah many many ...\nThey're your son the market that have an upper weight limit of thirty pounds thirty five pounds but what's important to know is if a family starts with that type of car seat which is fine the next step is what's called a convertible car seat\nConvertible car seats can read her face and then we switched to a forward facing mode\nIn rear facing convertible car seats", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Iowa Watch Connection & FOCUS", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "28"}
