W H Joe\nThis week on the Iowa launch connection I never dreamed up serving as long as I did but I never thought I Would ever be a majority\nPolitical battles are hard on\nSomeone to believe that the Republicans could only gain prominence by being much more diverse we put the Democrats\nFinding common ground can be difficult and\nEverything was to go forward and he would with some battles raking would win other bones but they always had a resolution\nA conversation with an Iowa political engine and our topic this week [noise]\nThe I have a watch connection is presented by the I was Center for public affairs journalism on line and I watched dot org here it's just time\nFor Thirty years Jim Leach represented on the one in Congress while living in Davenport and when his congressional district was re aligned in Iowa City he's been out of office now since the start of what the o seven carving a distinguished career in academia and the humanity\nWith all of the talk about a divided country at a fractured political system that frustrates many Americans we decided to check in with leach for some of his thoughts leech a conservative Republican built a reputation while in Congress for his intellect but also congeniality\nHis willingness to work with Democrats on some issues rankled Republicans especially those with school nice barred like Newt Gingrich\nIowa watch executive director end editor Lyle Muller sat down with leach or an extended interview for this program\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] I'm working at my desk and someone shows up at the door with a file folder inside our clips of old newspaper stories I wrote while in college\n\nThe top of this stack of clips is a story I wrote on election night Nineteen eighty it's about Jim Leach winning his third term as a Republican congressman from Iowa\nThe story got me thinking one does leach think of modern day politics especially in Congress and how does it compare with when he served in the U.S house from Nineteen Seventy seven until twenty seven Thirty years before Dave ... defeated him in the twenty six election [noise]\nLeashes at the University of Iowa these days where he holds a chair and public affairs as a visiting professor of law and senior scholar and as a visiting professor of political science he has deep experience in international finance Asian and Pacific affairs China\nHe loves the arts having served as chairman of the national endowment for the humanities and Brock Obama's administration and making ...\nSports analogies when it comes to politics I caught up with him and his university a Bible office in shape or hall where the political science department exist\nFirst of all what's changed in your view as far as the interest you had in public service back then in Congress and what people are dealing with now when they make a decision to run for Congress well a lot has changed and\nThat race was in Nineteen eighty a and I might say it's in ways symbolic of what the question we're asking the opponent was a young lawyer here in Iowa City named Jim neuro terrific young\nMan or a and we ran a a\nWhat I consider to be a very civilized race I frankly truly respect me as father in law was a member of the religion department here a is a a background was a pure quality and ah it was a\nA big horse race above pet time things did begin to change in a not having to do with this particular race but when I\nCame into the Congress in Nineteen ... after the Nineteen Seventy six selection of the Democratic party was dominance had been dominant in Congress for quite a while and in fact\nI never dreamed up serving as long as I did a\nBut I never thought I Would never be in the majority or as a party and I served a\nEighteen years under democratic leadership in pro beers under Republican uh Nineteen eighty was a little bit of a break here because things started to get a stickier and part of it was symbolized by the election of one member of Congress and the prior election and this was Newt Gingrich in Georgia\nNewt is a was it is a very smart or\nIndividual and not very smart tactician a and also a someone that uh\nBelieve that the Republicans could only gain prominence by being much more to deceive with the Democrats and so he inaugurated a program as a young members to\nA present a much pickier set of feelings within the Congress or with the attacks that I thought were of the majority party were um\nUh maybe a bit exaggerated live\nUnderstanding the word maybe uh in my view was that I came in as a classic moderate Republican and the traditions of Eisenhower Bob raid that sort of thing\nAnd I always felt that in the minority my obligation was to present a construct people turn it is to democratic offerings but at the Democratic offerings as the controllers of the house or made sense not to be afraid to vote for them a end to try to modify them if that was a\nAnd so I Would have a whole series of votes that were a\nIs huge\nAnd so to have been tempered a discussion\nAnd it's no accident for example\nEighteen fifty or\nMassachusetts who was for\nColds a fellow senator\nUh for slavery\nAnd because this particular senator\nWho was from
