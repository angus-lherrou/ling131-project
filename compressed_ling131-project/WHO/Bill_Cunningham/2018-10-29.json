what a blood out but unfortunately he's alive now being cared for in a Pittsburgh hospital by Jewish doctor\nMy God and so I look about what happened in the hate this guy exhibited for many many months and I like to know\nAre the people he communicated with\nWas he a friend that was ... who else knew what he ... he was saying the things he was saying\nAnd and by the way he hated Donald Trump because Trump was a great\nFriend of Israel and Bowers also had a Trump because Trump is the only American president in history the Jewish grandchildren his daughter Ivanka has become an observant Jew her husband Jared Kushner\nIs a ah Orthodox Jew the children the president's children are Jews the president has attended many Jewish\nReligious functions is I have and so this guy who\nAh hates Jews and wanted to kill Jews mentally ill no criminal past his neighbor said it was a great guy always very friendly\nAnd went after Trump for loving Jews is now Trump is being attacked by the mainstream media in Washington Post for somehow causing directly or indirectly the murder of Jews one Trump is the best friend Israel and the Jewish people I've ever had\nA few hours ago Sarah Sanders put out a tweet presidential press secretary quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post went out exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh\nWas committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel\nSo oh one headline Saturday yesterday in the Washington Post said bomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump\nTo put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans so that the president's been tried to assassination attempts and the murder of Jews\nNot by some far left wing website is filled with hate but by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post\nThat are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they're not in fact on the day that CNN received\nThe photo bomb in the mail from ...\nThe New York times ran a progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself assassinating President Trump with Russian help it's unbelievable on that day\nAnd in fact CNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know what's a co sponsor of the play in Washington park\nThat simulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare's Julius Caesar they had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and the performance\nAnd uh one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN\nNow can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen\nThat one of the parent company of Fox News had a play in Central Park that simulated this stabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama I Want to know\nThe media reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor see Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar that had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as\nTrump being stabbed to death in fact after James Hodgkinson attempt at the masses assassination of Republican members of Congress resulting in the motor wounds to Stephen ... the Washington Post the next day ran\nA story about stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio even though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate of a Bernie Sanders and also posted many complimentary things about Rachel Maddow\nSo instead of focusing on the fact Hodgkinson actually traveled hundreds of miles to the cap and take the leadership of the house of representatives and it was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter of frequent viewer of MSNBC\nThe Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by right wing talk radio\nOver the last several weeks much like the er the photo bomb sent to about fourteen people\nThere have been at least twenty examples\nOf left wing or ... sending envelopes filled with white powder\nFor many many Republicans in fact all Republicans people like secretary defense James Mattis the president himself\nThe vice president all the adult children of a President Trump have received in the mail envelopes containing white powder simulating rice and in fact the the the rice in like substance was sent to the home of Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh\nSo all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it because all the news that fits they print\nAnd if that doesn't fit and then they don't print it if there is a political violence committed by James Hodgkinson of Illinois they blame conservative right wing talk radio\nOf course we know about Ted Cruz an ID cruise chased out of restaurants\nAnd also when a Senator McConnell was having dinner in a ... restaurant\nA Democrat grabbed his food and threw it in the street other diners came to the assistance of Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio ... and his wife who's in the cabinet and the media\nDoesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one CNN anchor Brett Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised Republicans for using the quote an word\nOne other example whenever a white nationalist they got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street progressive activist cover the words they expressed\nAs violence but win largely violent leftist from in ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all and so this is a long history\nOf radical leftist\nAnd some on the right committing acts of violence that has covered it completely differently by the objective mainstream media the worst in my opinion is Time Warner the parent company of CNN providing money to sponsor a Shakespeare play Julius Caesar\nWhen the main actors dressed up his trumpet he stabbed to death and people apply\nIn fact when Louis ... Louis Farrakhan the left wing nation of Islam began the anti Semite settled a large rally that Jews are termites in thousands in attendance applauded and cheered calling juice termites\nThat is the same person Louis Farrakhan\nWhere President Bill Clinton and Brock Hussein Obama stood next to had pictures taken with at the funeral of Aretha Franklin and in fact a Obama had the political sense to know when he ran for the presidency and overweight\nTo allow the public to know that he was a friend of Louis Farrakhan they ran around together in Chicago and that that's the classic anti Semite that the media completely ignored the relationship between Farrah Khan and Obama because it was bad politically so this whole thing disgust me\nI Hope soon very soon but a few hours is killed either a by lethal injection ... heading electric chair shooting whatever it takes powers has got to go the way it Timothy McVeigh for violence and\nBowers was a Trump hater but the Washington Post has somehow implicitly tied Trump to the murder\nOf God's loving eleven Jews yesterday morning in Pittsburgh\nThe whole thing is disgusting when I get your reaction plus we're gonna have later on David Wray affair to talk about what's happening on the southern border is anyone thought about the public health crisis\nCaused by thousands of immigrants without vaccinations flooding into the southern border with type ... may souls who cough aids pie or a a diarrhea gonorrhea in the health crisis cause anyone think about that\nWow wow that's a scary Hillary as though you're in John be shame thing belly listening\nWhich began with a lot of weight ... here here's your thousand news radio ten forty jelly wait till\nFox News I'm like the opposite world recognition of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting tragedy to\nShow support for even\nCool the French government and the older government across Europe across the U.S [noise]\nTo stay strong and we begin [noise] ride\nSasha goes along the president of the union Jewish students of France calling for solidarity to honor the eleven victims lost their lives at the hands with accused forty six year old shooter Robert Bowers at\nThis week in June and\n[noise]\nBack home the Pittsburgh Steelers with a moment of silence to honor the eleven tree of life synagogue shooting victims before the started their game against the Cleveland Browns sound provided by CBS Sports this because Fox News [noise]\nWhy can't we just called evil Knievel acts of terror acts of terror ... with the analysis you trust how politics is changing the way we view the world let's talk tomorrow would not use radio ten forty\nWhen you meet a veteran you're meeting a hero\nWhen you donate your car to the Purple Heart foundation\nYou deserve a better way to watch for ESPN by force and on the show roaming\nWith the original and the entire thirty percent\nYou or hero someone committed to sing that our veterans get the benefits they've earned it in this or\nGo to my heart Purple Heart dot org like donating your car today to the Purple Heart foundation you're helping a veteran with her ... benefits post traumatic stress\nYou have an old car taking up space be a hero and support our nation's veterans by donating your car to the Purple Heart foundation your car donations for the Purple Heart foundation helps all veterans get the benefits they've earned deserve donate today and I hardly Purple Heart dot org\nThe Asian Institute of maintenance and we trained tomorrow's technician the bureau of Labor Statistics reports the average aircraft technician in the DC area makes over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trained tomorrow dot com or call eight eight eight [noise]\nClearly was thirty four sun shining a southerly read for Monday\nHighschool climb into the middle and upper sixties cloud cover like increased around today on Tuesday and there is a chance for rain across south eastern Iowa\nNoticed at Central I Will look strike by six PM with ... and the ... sixties when they will be partly sunny and cooler you can expect to state and then they slap her safety actually just news radio ten forty WHM speedy weather forecast snow Thirteen near I'll just in brown\nAnd nine thirty four twenty eight degrees in to clear skies newsman you turn forty W.

Thirteen year I'll just in brown\nAnd ten thirty four in Des Moines it's clear in forty eight degrees [noise]\nHighly counting on let's continue with the tragedies the tragedies this week and then when that happened on Saturday ah joining me now is Thomas ... former NYPD investigator and a very knowledgeable about the situation is whether it's an attempt to mass murder\nOr whether it's an anti Semite who kept below the radar most of the reporting on this\nUh on Saturday today or has been along the lines that this is Robert Bowers was just a wonderful guy the NBC News this morning at on a neighbor lived next door to Rome or\nHave you had a woman who said boy kept to himself quite friendly that kinda stuff joining me now is that the same Thomas rescue and former NYPD officer investigator detective and Thomas Redskin welcome again in the bill Cunningham shown Thomas or you\nCould eat very tough situation awful um well when I watch some of the morning\nAnd afternoon coverage of Robert Bowers forty six years old I guess no previous criminal record at all and I hid menial jobs was a truck driver did various other little things next door neighbor a woman said boy he was quiet kind of shy and he said oh goodbye no difficulties\nHe had posted online for quite a while and I met him ranting and raving including hatred for Donald Trump the president because he thought Trump was too uh too nice on Israel didn't like the fact that Trump's grandchildren Jewish\nAnd ah he didn't like the fact that a Trump like the state of Israel nonetheless uh the media is pointing this out somehow Trump's responsible the Washington Post ah yesterday afternoon\nAnd today did ugly reporting saying that uh that done fact Sarah Sanders put out something a few hours ago just said is there any tragedy of the Washington Post war not exploit\nAttack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who\nHated President Trump because Trump is such a on a public defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nSo let's go back from a police perspective some have said uh the analysis the experts come out of the woodwork now saying to Pittsburgh Police should have known the FBI should've known\nHow many thousands or millions I I've been tempered comments rather racial anti Semitic anti woman anti male whatever anti homosexual or ... is on social media like everyday who's going to monitor that monitor that and Tom do you see any followed by by law enforcement in this case\nI seen\nYou know there's always twenty twenty especially in the long course men or the investigative world when I Can't believe no one else was honoring his social media and there's other things that he was hosting it couldn't have alerted only\nWhat the what we always is a few\nThings to say something [laughter]\nYou know one at the scene and could've alerted the police police we find out that the police the FBI or someone who's related she was told about Bowers and do something or look to see this guy does have guns\nOr actually followed him\nWe criticize the police but until that time\nPolice law enforcement agencies even intelligence agencies don't have the manpower the man\nTo be able to follow every single person that they can a complaint\nAnd even sometimes like the shooting in Broward County there was a woman or call FBI numerous people had caught about that Eighteen year old a punk mentally ill insane person that just shot up to high school\nAnd even no call in or the FBI people called in that wasn't followed up on even if those things happen there's no perfection there's no perfection and law enforcement correct\nNo law enforcement you're only as good as yesterday was on course very easy to after the same law enforcement is on so I Know my experience with the NYPD\nWe look back we always at review of what happened and what we could do better at the same way that they're doing with this case the bombings or the bombs that were sent\n'em they're looking back and figuring out what we do better in the future and that's what law enforcement agencies I'm sure in Pittsburgh and the FBI and other agencies are doing towards ... and ... hours\nIn fact a Bowers said a posted just a few hours before the slaughter on Saturday morning quote I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw the optics I'm going in unquote so whoever he was dealing with social media somebody knew or should have known this guy was disintegrating\nAnd I and that person did not do anything now the experts have said because I'm sure there's several thousand individuals sadly in the country like ... hours waiting for a trigger moment\nThat social media exacerbates highlights these kinds of feelings because those of like minded get together and they feed on each other's hate before social media ten twelve years ago\nYou sent letters or you made phone calls but in social media you can befriend hundreds of thousands of people of like minded like those clowns marching around Charlottesville shouting slurs against uh against you\nIt was ... and against African Americans there were several hundred did that they use social media to get together in the they feed on each other and feed on their hate now the media doesn't well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump he he he'd previously road I never voted for Trump nor have I ever owned Warner even touch the mega had\nHe goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish\n... but the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing the president is one of many causing it so when you went and then why do you go back right now the Pittsburgh Police or go back in time and say\nMany have guns now that doesn't mean any of us Tom rescued needs to stop exercising or free speech rights on their constitution\nBut it does mean that that that the media also plays a role in this one I've been watching CNN the past two days\nAll I hear about is Trump and the Republicans responsible\nFor almost a mass murder of two former presidents plus the killing of twelve or fourteen others along with the attempts to to tide Donald Trump to what happened in Pittsburgh even though he's the only president in American history there Jewish grandchildren the only one\nAnd today CNN tried to tee up to us\nOr Israeli ambassador the is the Israeli ambassador to the u._s. I'm Sorry\nAnd he said that the best friend Israel's ever had has been Donald J Trump and that he's been wonderful for Israel and Trump is not responsible for what happened there the president's going to go to Pittsburgh and the next couple of days\nTo meet with those that have been wounded summer mortally wounded not likely to survive the number eleven is likely to go up and the president has said\nThat it's time to lower the rather rhetoric just a little bit but the other side doesn't want to accept that in fact CNN and the Washington Post or indirectly accusing the president\nOf the murders in Pittsburgh and that is despicable man we we've got a calmness down and they look as if that a little overweight for now we're going to have an election may want to gin up the numbers to hurt the president hurt Republicans I Hope it doesn't work\nBut what Tom what you said about calming down relaxing a little bit when you're in New York City and when I had my TV show that for five years completely different I live now in Cincinnati completely different culture a completely different things are going on but one thing that unites is when you talk about our hurricane I Love what you said\nWhen a hurricane happens there is no one on the other side of the fence\nTo argue in favor of the hurricane\nRight now we're in a political hurricane and Americans need to be not red or blue red white and blue would you agree\nI totally agree and what you said even further this as a son who is orthodox and a very religious Jewish guy he has a daughter who converted to Judaism and as you said his grandchildren or Jewish\nSo you know I I don't think it's a matter of\nYou know what you said it's a matter of how we're saying it's a matter for law enforcement standpoint of it has to be held back because you're pressing police departments and agree right they have to be ready\nTo respond to a high school she was a guy goes into Times Square but no one of the reason that he wants to kill innocent people going to the theater in New York City on may ... years ago\nThank God he failed terrorism school and couldn't blow up his own car because he would have killed if not injured hundreds if not thousands of people but they're on not like this around the country it's what keeps law enforcement people up at night\nWorrying about this loan the guy who's not really talking to someone the guy who is sort of a loner a guy who's pretty well thought of in this neighborhood\nWho is capable of grabbing his guns and go into a place in killing innocent people for no other reason than his ideology or his private jeeze\nThomas is out there all the way but Thomas ... and why PT officer thanks for coming on the bill ... show and all of us need to lower the rhetoric just a little bit because there's nuts everywhere Thomas thank you very much\nEveryone stays safe please God blessed\nCharlotte's continue with more blind becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three seven they'll counting on line with you every Sunday night [noise] use radio ten forty W.

mean for litigation investigation instead of legislation and many times in life I say okay who's in favor of that person and it was opposed to that person think of the ones who on Trump to win\nAnd

going on with the mailing in the bombs and all that stuff going on and the victims and and the potential arrest all that stuff something else is happening I think much more important in the southern border the media is covering for obvious reasons\nAnd that is that this is something being used by the mainstream media to attack the Republicans and Donald Trump but you say among other things in his article the caravan of an estimated seven thousand some say it's closer to Fifteen thousand at this point\nOf Central American migrants is now you know well into Mexico with the Claritin ten of reaching us border where the migrants intend to seek political asylum the impetus for this latest caravan is not\nA humanitarian crisis in Central America but rather as accurately described by the wall Street Journal and organize stunt by political agitator is an activist\nWho are intent on using migration is a political weapon to foment border chaos and I might add to the to hurt Donald J Trump I could not conceive on a particular day at a particular time at a particular place all of a sudden\nSeven to ten thousand on doing just showed up together in one place and said let's walk through America two thousand miles away no one believes that so what happened with the political agitator isn't the activist who got this together explained that the mainstream media will deal
