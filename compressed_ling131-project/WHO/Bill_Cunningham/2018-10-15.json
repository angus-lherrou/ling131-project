covering the Trump Administration give me fifty fifty somebody stopped me the other day and said why do you think it is CBS NBC ABC or the New York times Washington Post every big city newspaper

alibi hit the only one that is conservative more or less right now is Fox you know if they're leaning left quite often was Shepard Smith and people like that\nAnd you see what the ratings have Hannity are every night John draws about four million viewers every night so those kinds of interviews I just conducted was their regular event on CBS Evening news or ABC I give up any hope for NBC\nThose ratings would double and triple\nAnd it would become the dominant evening newscast if somehow one of the other ones would say you know what from top to bottom we're going to reflect the values of

was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen\nCity let's talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was or to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious leader and who was a dinner they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we got back I uh we got back many people actually if you look at it as like seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion\nAnd uh we got him back and he's going to be safe very shortly he's in the

happened to them was incredible and he was held hostage but now he's a he's going to be happy I'm sure is very happy right now\nAbout ... trip to Africa sure which is unbelievable what happened there talk about what was the goal in what was accomplished with mummy in Africa\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in the sense of the way people live and she made forceps and she also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise]\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible the level of poverty a it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and I know the kids were beautiful\nThey loved her and she came back and she said I Hope you're going to\nContinue to give a lot of money because they needed is not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just touch on the human

of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what'd you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the trade deal\nAnd we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and\nWe made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada that just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominee you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out [noise] I don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused\nSo we call it the U.S MCA and its works good\nBut we made a great deal is with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they are very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just need to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a a much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea's\nPresident on many jobs you're talking to my retirement Canada Mexico we're talking about a million\nWell you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent ... people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent are are they make a big deal if they have three hundred acts\nThe three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least is fair and are farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers where we can sell into their into into their countries\nThey have tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and onions and we charge him essentially no tax to sort of ... percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we
