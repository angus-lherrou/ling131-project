[noise]\nRight as we hit our busy phones Arlene is in Tampa, Florida Arlene you're on the Sean Hannity show welcome to the swamp known as our nation's capital how are you\nI'm doing great thank you what's going on\nI'm just curious about uh everybody including our side are calling I'm Dr Ford a credible she might be a very sympathetic it'll fall\nYou know I'm ... I'm here or whatever you want to call her but she sympathetic but she's not credible and that goes to abide by the expert opinion of a prosecutor is a specialist in this field prosecutor Mitchell says it just wouldn't\nEven make the minimum requirements to get a warrant let alone presented in court\nWas an I don't really have anything I I I think this is such a serious topic I literally a nothing\nAt all bad to say about professor Ford I don't like that Dianne Feinstein hooked up with a a radical left wing attorney who's known for going after Paula Jones well it was only ten or twelve minutes um that's Bill Clinton\nThen attorney general of Arkansas exposing his penis and saying kiss it uh that ten or twelve minutes she says doesn't meet the definition of sexual harassment in the workplace\nSo you got a political operative all arranged by the Democrats they perfectly the purposely hid this from the Republicans and as he has now been heard but it does in the story\nThe Washington Post said that for the originally claimed there were four boys\nWho tried tried to rape her\nNot one but for boy she said she said she was in her late teens and that's just watched it back to Fifteen Years old\nShe said it happened in the Nineteen eighties and it's just words that back to Nineteen eighty two practical everything she said turn out\nTo be false now you got to be kind to the woman because she's a allegedly a survivor of sexual assault but part of the deal is when you make certain assertions and if they're refuted as they were by Brett Kavanaugh you got to prove it\nSupposedly she was terrified of small spaces\nTerrified of airplanes and then we find out from a boyfriend\nThat they want on John's together basically all over the globe she went to Costa Rica she went to Hawaii she went to ah the south Pacific Island she went to a French Polynesia she went to Israel she went to Central America she went to Europe all by being terrified of airplanes\nThe boyfriend also said during the six years that he dated her in a sworn statement to the Senate committee she never mentioned the sexual assault never mentioned the name Brett Kavanaugh shed no fear of flying in fact the flu around islands on single propeller airplanes sitting next to each other\nThat she uh the the second door theory was a bunch of crap\nBecause he came out that they want it to second door in their home in twenty eight four years before the therapy session because she wanted to provide an entrance to her therapist to conduct their business as a psychologist inside of her home\nShe also coached a friend about how to take a polygraph test she lied about that she also ah stole money from the boyfriend so all these things that she said Dr Christina forward simply fell apart\nAnd now yesterday or today her lawyer Deborah cats came out to say that she doesn't want to pursue the Kavanaugh thing anymore really\nShe's done with it so\nMedia turned out to be liars and thieves in trucks and miscreants whomever every description the second accuser Debbie ...\nA dusting off the memories polling of Bill Clinton on her as a freshman in college no one supported her story either she gave for names and the FBI they checked out the stories of ... Ramirez shaking his junk in her face she must have been thinking of Bill Clinton but basically no one supported her story either\nAnd then one of his silent heroes of this has been the porn lawyer\nMichael Evan Eddie boy he did a great job for the Republicans he came out with such ridiculous antithetical information that no one believed word of what he said in fact the cast light away from\nA weight from a from a doctor forward and Debbie ... put it on sweating and nobody believed in fact here's a quote from\nSenator Collins on Saturday quote\nSome of the allegations Lebanon against judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important I'm thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by professor forward but at the allegation that when he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh drug multiple girls\nAnd use their weaken state to facilitate gang rape\nThis outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence and simply parrot it\nPublic statements of others that such an allegation can find its way into the U.S Supreme Court confirmation process\nIs a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness quote unquote\nSo said the Senator Susan Collins and that was a beautiful comment I Love Susan Collins I Love Lindsey Graham and I think Michael ... he's doing a great job representing the Democratic party needs to keep doing it plus uh\nAs far as supporting the me too movement and standing with Kevin ...\n... I read some way of a expert from the independent women's forum Julie gun like coming up later on but Patrice Lee ... spent on my show many times\nWrote a column a sudden this morning Sunday Morning about supporting survivors and standing with Kevin ... she said those to promote the slogan set up a false dichotomy if you believe that survivors of sexual assault it abuse should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you\nThat you then must believe the allegations of Christine afford therefore you must agree the judge Kevin O's line and you must opposes confirmation she said this is a false choice as a woman I can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse\nBut also care about the facts of each specific case if I was a member of a jury sitting in a rape matter\nMy sympathy would be what the victim\nHowever I Want to hear the evidence or lack of corroboration and inconsistencies to make sure the correct parties identified and she goes on to point out the number of times the Innocence Project and others have exonerated through late DNA testing\nRape rape is to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory counts\nAnd Van Dyke Perry who spent a combine thirty seven years in prison on false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime and the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted that she lied\nOr how about the Hofstra University case\nIn which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from Hofstra their lives ruined about a gang rape of an Eighteen year old fellow student and twenty nine\nThe accuser later admitted that her allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges but the damage to these young men and their families were already done plus innocent projects it go to innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men exonerated\nOf rape charges when later evidence came out why can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent of the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate but ten percent or more are not accurate\nIn other words there are uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock of American Jurisprudence this writer goes on to say as a woman as a mother as a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness and the me too movement these fires are not in competition to treat men\nFairly all victims deserve justice but justice is not one sided due process and fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men\nSo when you look at the allegations of professor Christina forward they completely fall apart they don't exist there is no cooperation\nAnd so you can't say we support the me too movement and we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty those two principles are not in conflict except in the minds of Cory Booker\nKamala Harris and a senator Hirono of Hawaii when asked this morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist to chase down to Republicans in restaurants in elevators and airports she could not say that his wrongful activity she couldn't say that\nIn fact they indirectly demand violence against Republicans and\nShow you where we are Steven cold there of the Late Show as a

Brett Kavanaugh personally to send a message through other Trump nominees this is what waits for you Amy Coney Barrett\nA judge third power of the sixth circuit us court of appeals this or a judge the

H. L. three day weather forecast ... Thirteen year I'll just amber Alexander\nAnd nine thirty forty fifty six degrees and news radio ten forty WHM\nOh there's good and so many years I Can't stand them to rely upon Susan Collins and Lindsey\nGraham to be the key voices the United States Senate\nI didn't think I'd ever see this in my lifetime Susan Collins stood up like a tenfold beginning the night she was brilliant going over for forty five minutes why she was going to support then I I Try to listen and Lisa Murkowski who made no sense at all\nIt seems like slime ball tactics have good consequences as long as you make the slime ball tactics they seem to work Lisa Murkowski in Alaska I mean there was no reason she could not listen to what Susan Collins had to say\nAnd and maybe she hates Trump's so much you could not stand to put one of his nominees when the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I'm so proud of a bright Kevin O's wife his mom and dad as girls and what they had to put up with like he was crucified on the Democratic cross of political correctness in title nine\nThat's what boys go through in college when charged with a girl up some sexual assault the most likely did not happen they get into title nine court and presumption of innocence cross examination of witness confronting your accusers all that kinda stuff doesn't apply\nSo in the minds of Democrats this was the title nine case in which the allegation was made\nAnd therefore you cannot investigate professor Ford once investigated mainly by the conservative media practically everything forward said fell apart including the four eyeball witnesses\nIncluding her river version\nThe facts from twenty twelve and twenty third gene therapy his notes including the front door the fear of flying whatever it was I'm not sure she said anything that was truthful\nAt all nothing and so Lisa Murkowski is stupid the woman from Alaska stupid Susan Collins took some serious flak from the radical left like my friend Bryan kill me did a Fox and friends and she stood up and did what was right I don't know if she's going to run for re election in two years\nBut she ought to but now clowns fools to come out of the woodwork like Valerie Jarrett open ... fame to run against or in Maine have added\nMust continue their calls is go to a Lewis in Chicago Lewis in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Lewis go ahead\nThanks bill I appreciate you taking my call yesterday I just wanted to comment on the relationship of the Democratic party to the pornography industry if you don't mind sure\nYeah though you know the Democrats claim to care about women but uh over the years or one of the largest supporters has been the pornography industry and I'm just wondering if they're really cared about women why did they take money from these people who would like women that way\nAbout Michael evidently the porn lawyer and I I think he did a great job I mean he's got to be on Don Lemon put 'em on CNN MSNBC a lot more times Michael ... is such a loud mouth clown in such an embarrassment he defends porn stars and this guy says he's going to run against the president twenty twenty\nCould we be that lucky for Michael having any run against ...\nI Hope he does bill but I tell you you know if you look back to the Clinton years they they didn't have one criminal prosecution against pornography and that opened the doors to all this I Believe I Believe it open the doors to all this bad stuff there's violence stuff you see out there\nDuring a porn star to porn industry has given millions of dollars to the Democrats along with the abortion industry so killing babies in sub spaghetti women to lie for sexual assault is what the Democratic Party is all about if they if they cared about sexual assault or women\nThan their leader would not be the U.S Congressman Ellison and he would not be the candidate in Minnesota and if they really cared about women and sexual assault Bill Clinton will not serve out his term if they really care and the enabler Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton wouldn't have been the nominee in ... if they really cared about sexual assault correct\nCorrect absolutely right and you know but actually are doing a lot of harm to women these people because uh you know the old effect of the boy who cried wolf you know nobody's going to believe women who are are telling the truth\nWell a if a woman comes forward with ... probably eight or nine times out of ten is correct but every now and then you have the Hofstra every now and then you have the Duke lacrosse team or UBA every now and then you have the Innocence Project that's less than hundreds of men cleared of rape charges\nFrom false allegations and so yeah I'm going to believe a woman a Ninety percent of the time but I Want to hear the story I'm sympathetic with professor forward I Want to hear what happened how it happened\nHow did you get to the party how'd you get home from the party Hoover the eyewitnesses tell me about that second door tell me about the fear of flying all these things Lewis turned out to be a lie or a misstatement or not true you know the truthful thing that happened is I think in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen\nWhen she wants to see her therapist she spoke the truth and she said and twenty ... twenty Thirteen before a Kevin always going to be a nominee she told the therapist that she was a attempted rape by four boys\nIn her late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties\nAnd the reason it didn't fit Kevin Oh it's because he was one boy\nAnd by the mid Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not living in Maryland anymore he moved to Connecticut so she had to tell the fear that it was Kevin Oh but they but the notes of the therapist clearly indicated it could not have been Brett Kavanaugh\nYou see if you go to a therapist or a doctor and they were seeking help psychiatric help or medical assistance\nYou are incentivized to tell the truth you're not going to go to a doctor and say my right arm hurts when Israeli or left foot\nBecause you want treatment so when Dr Ford went to a therapist in twenty ... twenty Thirteen who made copious notes about what she said out of her own mouth she said and twenty twelve that four boys tried to rape me when I was in my late teens and the Nineteen eighties\nTo find the best annuities you need the right information\nTo receive your free

H. B. O. three day weather forecast and penal Thirteen year I'll just amber Alexander\nVenue they're also me up a little over an hour with Julie gun laws of the independent women's forum\nAbout a woman's perspective and I made this point with her about two weeks ago then I'm of course a man and you may be a woman but if you're a woman you're probably married to a man or was married to a man or want to be married to a man your father was a man what kind of feelings damn toward your husband and your dad\nYour brothers are male what kind of feelings damp tore them and you may have male children or grandchildren you want to live in a world where because of your gender your automatically just believed or believed\nIn other words every now and then a woman lives and every now and then a man is not guilty of rape or sexual assault\nHappens all the time so you can't say because a woman speaks we must listen or because the man is charged he's got to shut up there was a line to be\nMurdered merged between the me too movement on one hand and went on a ...\nAcceptance on the other the fact you want to believe a victim of a crime which I naturally would do is a criminal defense attorney\nA take off my hat and I generally believe all of a person's as their car was stolen or a person says my house was burglar eyes or a victim of an arson or a victim of sexual assault naturally want to believe that person but then if a person is charged I Want to live in a world that says\nThat person is due process rights because that is the rigorous\nReaction of substantive and procedural due process that pursues the truth and make sure that those are telling the truth or confirmed and those that are lying or rejected\nAnd Democrats never wanted to put professor forward through a any rigorous process that determined that voice you were saying was accurate now here we are several days later\nAfter she testified what about ten days ago that practically everything she said was false including the number of people got attacked or what had happened how it happened ... how old she was\nThe timeframe that happened in the two front door was the ... the fearing the fly was ridiculous in her boyfriend came out and said she was a safe and some of these other facts come out and you're thinking now wait a minute\nWhat I heard originally is not accurate when\nChris Wallace of Fox News after she testified said the Republicans are in trouble I thought to myself now hold up on that car\nFind out what Brett Kavanaugh has to say and now that she's testified there's going to be a several day process to check out what she says is if it's accurate\nThe two front doors was either a misrepresentation or ally because the front door went in and twenty oh eight not twenty twelve and a one and not because she needed an extra way out but because\nA small business owner a therapist want it to rent a part of her house and she wanted a separate entrance for her patients which was the second front door\nThat had nothing to do with cost her phobia\nAnd the boyfriend follows the affidavit saying we've for little planes all over French Polynesia to Haiti and uh Hawaii we also went on trips to Central America to South America and Europe she had no fear of flying it was a lie\nIn fact there was nothing she said actually that turned out to be accurate but see the Democratic party didn't care about\nFinding the truth they had a ball face mitigated allegation that could not stand the rigors of due process so they quickly ignored instead of you want to get into the veracity pursuit were not with you on that she said\nShe has mainly X chromosomes therefore we believer and the person with the Y chromosomes that's a liar\nBut then the truth came out and it's like well don't don't bother me with the facts that's what caused a writer for the Kobe or CBS late night show to say quote aerial doom is said quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruin Brett Kavanaugh as life unquote\nFat is reflective and indicative of what the Democratic Party thanks today about Brett Kavanaugh we've ruined his life\nWas ruined his wife were ruined his mom and dad and were ruined his daughters\nSo aerial do most of the Steven Kobe or show\nCalled whatever happens I'm just glad we've ruined Brett Kavanaugh's life unquote that's where they are don't care about his qualifications it's constitutional principles is academic scholarship that kind of person he is they want to ruin someone's life\nTo what President Lincoln face as soon as he took office in Nineteen sixty one and that is what I Am afraid of I'm not afraid of democratic control of the house with the Senate or the presidency\nI'm afraid of civil war and we're on that path and unless these people get checked somewhere and I'm not talking about suppression of vote so I'm not talking about\nThe limitations of their First Amendment rights I'm Talking about them actually getting control without any facts\nTo serve born there their case without anything else they will stop at nothing when Democrats and and we're aggressive loopholes in this day and twenty eight team cannot win at the ballot box that goes to court because they can't one of the courts they go to the streets if they can't win in the streets the next thing has bloody revolution\nHere before we go to bed tonight part of the Drudge Report Michael good one\nWho writes for New York or newspapers has a great column about the coming second civil war read that we got to run take a look let's continue let's go now to Mike in Wisconsin Mike in Wisconsin welcome to the bill Cunningham show Mike how are you\nA great really how are you good really I think we need to learn from experience and you had an earlier caller because Brian from India that that was an inspiring phone call because he like he was a traditional Democrat and he's now come over to our side\nHow are we going to get more people to come over our side I think there are three ways number three\nI think are people like Brian who saw\nNot only dishonest they are downright evil they will do nothing to get power\nNumber two the Democrats look socialist progress is incapable of analyzing back whether it be about climate change whether it be the lives that that Dr forward presented in front of the Senate tradition\nProvable lies that still are ignored by the mainstream media provable\nI Want to be ... say they're misconceptions but damn it they were alive because she lied about flying\nShe lied about the second front door she lied about the four boys became one she lied about or late teens now it's Fifteen he lied about the fact that was the mid Nineteen eighty nine Nineteen eighty two because correct Kevin all in the mid eighties was in Connecticut she lied lied lied\nAnd she wasn't covered because she was a woman\nAnd and really let me tell you the most important thing that we learned and that is that we Republicans we didn't stand up to them before they took advantage of our moral character and we learned this time that the only way to like that is by route\nOn his political force hats off to McConnell yeah I talked to college hats off to Lindsey Graham about that political force is the only way that we are going to come and we can avoid a civil war as your last guest said how can we do that by Bruce winning forced by beating them at the ballot\nGot away and you got to vote you got to you know Schumer said one thing Saturday and that was correct you got to vote in the Denver if you take away the Democratic party from the coast and about seven or eight major cities\nThere is no Democrats hardly any where there's a sea of red from the the shining city it say irrelevant minimalist party but the problem is the mainstream media is there a megaphone\nAnd the major media will not cover objectively this president nor any Republican president they didn't cover Alito correctly that didn't cover Roberts you there and look what they did a cabin all look what's next to Amy Coney Barrett ought to be the next Supreme Court justice\nAnd from Notre Dame and when that happens all hell is going to break loose Barbie gene ... meets her maker you watch that fight\nReally didn't get a thank you today to hear Eric\nHolder who scale contempt of Congress to say that now we have to call into question the legitimacy of this of the Supreme Court let me see Billy the last forty years since Nineteen thirty seven says conservatives had a majority on the Supreme Court we never questioned the ... the prime nuts but now all of a sudden when we go through a legitimate process of confirmation\nAll of a sudden they stand up and say we've got to question the whole legitimate you process do you recall outrageous\nRecalling the third debate that Trump made a Trump was asked whether or not if he lost the election if he would accept it\nAnd the media has a meltdown one Trump made a statement to the fact that he might not accept the results in November elections if he felt it was rigged against him and the media Hillary Clinton the New York times jumped on top of Trump because he would not accept the results of the election everyone thought of course Hillary who's gonna win\nTrump won and up to this point Hillary and the major media has not accepted the outcome of the election and\nSo they became what they criticized\nAnd the third debate Trump said I may not accept the outcome of the election because it looked like it it's rigged however\nThe media went after him Hillary one after him Hillary said let's be clear about what are you saying and that means he's talking down American democracy and I'm appalled that someone who's the nominee of one of the two major parties would take that position quote unquote Mallory Clinton\nBut then Trump won and Hillary never considered the election she never accepted the ballot box New York times never accepted the fact that Trump won\nSo they became what they criticize it was nothing but nothing short of a ... and thank you for your call let's continue now with a Joe and New Hampshire it's been there for about an hour show in New Hampshire welcome to the bill Cunningham show Joe go ahead\nI could Mr Cunningham thanks for taking my call um agree with everything that's been said prior to ... and your summation of everything so there's no need for me to repeat any of that but what I'm calling you about tonight is so important to have you ever heard of John and Simon and his book code red about a\n... voting machines Freud in America especially in the cities\nYeah I I think that there is a bunch of him example in the city of Cleveland there were more votes cast for Obama\nThan citizens registered in certain words and and it's because the because Cleveland's in an important state my home state of Ohio I'm sure there's massive voter fraud and Chicago New York and whatever\nBut Ohio in Cleveland Columbus I Would not be surprised at all if there was hundreds or thousands of illegal votes cast because of the tabulation system and there's no check and balance because there's no Republicans in Cleveland\nWell the thing is Mr Cunningham if you're ... code red China concern would be an excellent guess for your show before the terms but here's the thing\nThe way it works with the algorithms in the machine and the companies that I made a fair for the next ... only three or four the entire country and it's done in the cities\nAnd what you would have is a situation where the machine has program where\nThe Democrat as a thousand actual votes cast Republican has an actual votes cast\nThe machine's gonna say eleven hundred for the Democrat nine hundred hundred for the Republican it's programmed in advance and the person that runs the city the Democrats in most cases\nThey're the ones that oversee the installation of the ballots for the terms who's on the ballot what have you and the machine can be corrupted and the algorithm\nWould wait votes from Republican to add to the Democrats\nOr give me the name of the guy in the book again I'm going to talk to my producer\nJonathan Simon and the book is code red and he was a guest on coast to coast a month ago when George ... he was on three hours and it was really riveting and it's been happening for a decade\nLibel I Believe that and I believe in major cities there's massive fraud will look into it let's continue with more of a line becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three seven bill coming in the great American live with
