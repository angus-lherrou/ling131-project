Meryl Streep give their acting lessons you know someone like Meryl Streep has been co chair and co chairing coach you are probably a team of five people coach here for two weeks to make sure that she was so monotone and so calm\nIt's like they had to run for dean and they they act like a little girl I mean that that Senator Whitehouse\nI Swear to God I thought he was going to say do you like a

stand and you and I would have destroyed our bill we would've had or just a apoplectic she wouldn't know what to say her entire case within ripped to shreds\nAbout five minutes and she couldn't get a decent questionnaire and Ken around the five minute questioning\nShe couldn't get it out and you got to see using a true you fly all the time yes or no it isn't it true now you told us too many you needed a break to be able to drive your he isn't it true now you will not give us a there is no she gave the Washington boat isn't it true you align yourself with a foreign ... most of your life\nIsn't it true not one single witness ... boy you said and the guy who came from you isn't there you go\nOn a buddy who\nIsn't it true that you said that in two thousand twelve you finally awakened and what's your psychiatrist because you were redoing your house and that renovation about a security door is what may bring back your memories of this attempted rape\nExcept there's a problem we checked your records and you built the house you did the renovation of two thousand eight not two thousand twelve you're a liar they could have said are you a democratic operative how many Democrats did you speak to who connected you with the top Democrat lawyers and George George lawyers\nTo get involved in this case they could've after a thousand questions they could've after ... well they did after who paid for your lie detector test and I don't know what do you mean you don't know where's the follow up question everyone knows ... why would someone do it for free the whole thing is ridiculous\nThey could've after about a thousand issues like a two thousand twelve when you claim out of the blue you enter repressed memory of rape\nIsn't it true that in two thousand twelve Mitt Romney named three potential people would be a Supreme Court nominees and one of them was Brett Kavanaugh is that how you came to know Brett Kavanaugh and isn't it true that Planned Parenthood two thousand twelve\nTook out ads in newspapers all over the country that said roe versus Wade make believe it was just overturned and they showed the pictures of the night Supreme Court justice and they replaced\nGinsburg's faced with Brett Kavanaugh and they said this is going to be Mitt Romney's Supreme Court nominee overturns roe versus Wade is that how you got to know his name have you decided to become a heroin or the left by making up a story I mean there's a thousand things they could have said is it true your father is CIA\nIs a true your grandfather was CIA is a true your brother was working for a law firm that found a GPS fusion is that possible and you're not a democratic operative where all those questions\nHow bad is it true the bread Kevin O's mother Marilyn said John trial judge Robert bonded over the foreclosure your parents who do you call\nIt kept me on that one because they claim he was never quite for closed down and they got the house back\nSo why she was a young girl she was standing in a in a courtroom singer parents being questioned by a judge\nThat you get incredible power over the future of her family's life and even though eventually they took him to lose out that's my understanding they did not lose the house and the judge actually in the end kind of root for them it doesn't matter you may have developed a deep seated hatred for that judge and found out that that judge his son is now going to be Supreme Court nominee\nThere's a thousand things you could say the CIA one it's amazing that's not a conspiracy theory or dad CIA at her grandfather CIA and her brother is with a company with a law firm founded fusion\nGPS on all things considered and other deep state fraud conspiracy there's no other way about it there's no coincidence any of this stuff\nBut having said all that listen let's forget all that for a minute forget forget he\nThe most beautiful opening statement I've ever heard in my life I cried five times all my friends cried I've spoken to fifty are more women on my radio show my TV show and letters to me over the last three days all said they cry because they've got sons\nAnd they can't believe that there's some was crucified like this I Believe America's on Brett Kavanaugh outside and I believe any pull you see that says ... says otherwise is another democratic ... job another lie another over

I Want to tell you what troubles me greatly about Thursday\nAnd then I Want to get your perspective and I I kind of look towards Fox News often as a place I can go to ... conservative commentary and things of that character and ah after or a doctor forwarded testified the the son of Mike Wallace Chris Wallace did\nForce testimony is extremely emotional extremely Raul extremely credible\nNo uh no one could listen to our delivery delivery of those George and talk about the ... and the impact it at our life and not have your heart grow up to her this is a disaster for the Republicans so started Chris Wallace Thursday Afternoon judge ended up ... generally I respect said I think Dr Ford is exceptionally credible\nKarl Rove the great political theorist said forward as the credible unbelievable\nSo one when I heard those commentaries I thought we were done and then I of course watch Brett Kavanaugh's testimony and is telling us the Democrats showed toward him Thursday Afternoon and everything flipped completely ... but when you have Chris Wallace\nAnd you have an Android Apollo ... and Karl Rove saying that a woman is credible\nWho provide as witness names that turned out not to be witnesses at all when you have ah Christine Ford straight up lying about her and capability of flying which you flew everywhere but every one of the witnesses re future story has no memory of the gathering\nAnd the woman who wants a anonymity to testify turn down the opportunity to be questioned in private then we find out or lawyers never told her she had that opportunity at all so every time I Try to test her credibility making bar at the time\nTurns out to be great grossly lacking so when conservative commentator said she's believable she's credible and clearly she isn't it would completely lost our way\n[laughter] right I think we have birth name to Karl Rove yes completely lost our way because he was the one telling us that Donald Trump never had a chance of winning\nOr the people can see through it I think most people that I was talking to after the testimonies nothing could it's women and men I found Brett Kavanaugh to be believable there was such a raw emotion from a falsely accused innocent\nMan who in the in the court of public opinion in the days leading up to this quote unquote hearing I his life was completely turned upside down his wife was getting death threats\nAnd ah his career with looking to be entirely sabotage and destroyed as well as his reputation and here we have Christine horn and I do believe that something happened to her\nOr she obviously has been in therapy for decades or she has said herself she has two front doors you know anybody that has to crime doorbell\nNo there's no snow\nSo obviously she had issues now just because she says something happened doesn't happen and we have plenty of examples that or that it just because she sends Brett Kavanaugh raped or maybe not but all the evidence that she'd for that so far all started being additives\nIn fact if you presented us in a court of law in which the so called victim provides for names Brett Kavanaugh mark judge PJ Smith labeling Kaiser including her best girlfriend legal in God's or\nWho would have no motivation align are allied all who said I don't even know where I live in all the all of them said the event didn't happen including mark judge you wrote on the floor supposedly with the with bread Kevin on Christine forward he said it did now they'll get discount more judging okay what about\nPJ Smith who simply a classmate\nWho said these events never took place when Christine Ford's said they did and then ... her best girlfriend said they didn't happen but she also said I believer why believer but they didn't happen I don't know\nI don't know how that works at all and then you have are saying that well I I was flabbergasted when Trump running for the president's being twenty sixteen but the name of bread cabin on the Supreme Court list\nFact the matter is he didn't put his name on the list when he was running it didn't happen till November twenty Seventeen so how could you be frightened during the campaign about bread Kevin all getting the Supreme Court what his name one on the list at all\nAnd how can she be believable to those are like you just mentioned Chris Rock Karl Rove and not all the time is up I don't know because\n... ... exactly what were they watching and hear like you said when I had a sexual harassment case it fell short of being an assault case however I had\nThe burden of proof that was my responsibility short order for a present the evidence I had to be cross examined I had a beat the post let me tell you something I wasn't given lawyers\nFrom the defensive side that treated me with kid gloves no okay it was a very uncomfortable hearing solve this talks about equal rights and gender equality what are you know what I was treated not as a woman that as a mad as a person bringing bringing forward charges against another person\nSo to watch that lawyer that the Republicans hired\nTreat her as though she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily poll calls and then many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly us that we find out she was all over the world\nAh and also just the holes in her story said thank thank God
