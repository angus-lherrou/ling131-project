bones Nina is in San Francisco a cast a vote and you know Hi how are you glad you called\nMe for taking my call and I'm calling I think you know\nAnd he can in California and unfortunately I'm surrounded by the crazy people I'm just wondering what are we going to take back California I don't want ... nuisance are gotten me I was living in San Francisco when he became a San Francisco and he gets ruined that city\nWas an eye you have a great Republican candidates out there John Cox he's a great businessman his his problem is simple math\nAnd sort of like New York city although it's happened in New York City is even happened in New Jersey Chris Christie Christie Todd Whitman um and and then all the other occasions Tom Kaine is another example where Republicans were elected after Democrats make a mess\nI guarantee you that Cox could wind now that the sanctuary state of California wants to put up a sign and say free health care for everybody in the world it's assigned you're basically our governor saying\nIllegal legal doesn't matter resident non resident doesn't matter we're going to give you a free health care\nNow if the average California is that is taxed at Thirteen and a half percent statewide on income if you're OK with that good luck to you because it is unsustainable it will bankrupt your state there's my prediction\nBut if people want to experiment with is that you know what ... what am I I'm not there to tell people\nYet and I agree with you and they had um counted on business where the family thinking gotta get out of California you can't afford to pay taxes and the ...\nYeah I mean it's unbelievable look why do you think there's a mass migration out of New York and New Jersey and Illinois to states like Florida Texas in the Carolinas wire Californians all going in Texas you know what what did Democrats on what they're hoping for that California demographic shift\nSo that the people that ruin California and left might do the same thing a Texas\nSo unbelievable which is what the beta ... has been all about from the beginning\nAnyway you know good luck um I Would say John Cox would be a great start and that was done in the world

attacks atrium\nAnd every time you watch ABC or CNN interview one of them they talk about they Jenna mop I'm Talking about what Trump wants you to do and and the F. word all these things are shouted against our president\nThey're they're getting help from sympathetic Mexicans at every turn more for them food and water clothing transportation driving pickup trucks and vans and cargo truck stop to let them clamor aboard the go north\nAnd so over the next several weeks we're going to have tens of thousands of individuals from the most violent place\nOn Mother Earth make their way and the Texas Nevada Arizona and basically the media is telling us we should encourage it and not let and let it occur like Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that she would welcome all of the migrants from Central America all of them\nWell there's about thirty five million who live in Central America there's about a hundred and forty million in Mexico\nThere's another two hundred million in South America polling has indicated given a choice\nSouth American Central Americans and Mexicans somebody like two hundred million would come to America to a hundred million what would that do to our government to our welfare spending ... hospitals do our presidents we wouldn't have a country anymore to hundred million want to come here\nAnd because the way the law is constituted\nThat are the Democrats were not allowed to change it takes ten Democrats\nAnd the Senate to do anything and they won't permit it they will permit\nThat because if you're from other than Mexico to him the other words from Central America and you may go to America there's a magic card that you have to read seeking refugee status and that begins a legal process it will take years\nAnd the meantime you're inside of America waiting for a hearing that cannot take place we are not scaled to have enough camps they have enough judicial officers to have enough lawyers are not scaled for any of this to allow tens of thousands or millions to arrive at our border so far this year until October first which is what about two and a half weeks ago\nWe have a hundred and Seventy five thousand migrants have come to America this year\nFrom a central and South America hundred and Seventy five thousand\nWe don't have the judges the lawyers the courtrooms to hold hearings hundred and seven hundred Seventy five thousand when you have five to ten year backlogs of millions who adopted her jet and so the game being played by the Democrats as extremely serious\nIf you're from Mexico here illegally you mean taken right back immediately if you're from Central America you have the right to hearing that goes on and on and on and never stops so uh I I'm interested to see when and if the media will change their coverage\nTo provide objective information the damages caused by unbridled massive illegal migration from third world poverty driven criminal societies into America and what the impact that has in schools orphanages hospitals\nAnd the rest there's no media coverage of what's happening in Nevada Arizona California Texas New Mexico through legal migration that there's no coverage it doesn't exist the murders of rapes et cetera it does not exist remember\nThat nine of the ten most violent countries in the world or south of the U.S border sixteen of the twenty most violent the other foreign Africa and they're invading our country they don't have uniforms on but they're coming here in mass incentivized by our media by the Democratic party\nI sat in twenty sixteen the reason Trump shocked the world\nWas because of illegal immigration federal judges and the economy right now with Trump is our leader everything is coming up roses it's unbelievable Trump\nHas everyone from North Korea to Russia believing we're about to bust up every new treaty necessary to keep to get America back on even track the trade imbalances are starting to flip he has an economy exceeding five percent GDP\nThe unemployment numbers so not just the ... the lowest they ever could be the or the other three point seven percent of us would not work can be put a gun to their head the terrorists are on the run\nISIS is destroyed Iran is on notice in marginalized and even the Saudis now are doing some soul searching about how they treat people opioid issues prison reform marijuana reform is all coming on the rise this guy is performing magnificently\nBut the media is going to use they think immigration the tank the twenty eight teams to favor the Democrats and the tank this president and twenty twenty now that's not the world that I live and\nMaybe if you live in Connecticut Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego that's the world you live and you want more individual is here with a third grade education Eighteen to twenty eight years old with no marketable skills not able to speak the English you want maybe a few thousand more in your community\nPlease bring them\nAccording to the Democratic party but that's not the word I living in Cincinnati, Ohio I don't think those who think about these issues\nIn Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego Tampa Denver Cincinnati I don't think we think about these issues in ways that the mainstream media can understand I must live in some alternative universe\nBecause according to CNN this is the issue of unbridled migrants walking into America that will cause average Americans living in Wisconsin and Michigan to vote for the Democratic party if that's the case I live in some alternative universe that's not the world in which I live\nI'm Sorry and I wish there was some way through the magic wand that we go to help the two or three hundred million Mexicans\nCentral Americans and south Americans not living a great life that don't have the opportunities that you and I have\nWhere only four percent of the world's population but every year legally through ... says he's we take in legally one point one million foreigners to come into America take the oath of office and become American citizens which is more than the rest of the world put together\nWe already do that one point one million but I'll be damned if I'm going to sit here\nAnd watch hordes\nOf young males from El Salvador Guatemala and Nicaragua Mexico Venezuela Colombia Peru Bolivia Paraguay why Europe why Brazil and Argentina it simply\nMake their way somehow into America claim their quota refugee get in line for hearings five to ten years from now that will never happen this is fundamentally changed our country that is far and it's going to be much worse if in twenty Eighteen one in two weeks two weeks in two days the Democrats take the house and or the Senate\nIf that out if that happens the country we live and will cease to exist do we have the have the wherewithal to take in a hundred million people\nAre the schools coined in such a fashion or the hospitals ready to go ... or the bridges and roads the expressway ready to accept a hundred million more people because the Democratic party says that's what's coming how is this possible\nThat's the most violent places on earth is sending us largely young males to come into America\nI got a Kevin Jackson coming up later an African American leader of great note there is no race or group of people more hurt by legal immigration than African American males especially young African American males they figured out that this is not benefit\nThem at all doesn't benefit American business does it better for the American public education does it benefit the hospital systems that we have\nThe benefit of any part of our does it benefit our jobs economy absolutely not we bring in legally one point one million and I'm proud to say that\nWe are a nation of immigrants but there are illegal immigrants you don't determine for yourself to join the country come in walk into a country which you don't belong to a not a citizen of men demand rights are you kidding me\nI asked you the question tonight is that the issue that's going to cause millions of Americans in two weeks and two days to vote for Democrats do you believe that\nOne eight six six six or seven seven three three seven we continue we have calls from a Chicago Los Vegas Connecticut California San Diego and every place in between coming up later will be Corey Lewandowski\nWho was the Trump campaign manager

they're\nOh it's for me to be there there's just all court\nIf you're from a Dick Blumenthal he's the war hero a state of Connecticut but in Connecticut which is a deep blue state in financial difficulty I does this play well with residents of Connecticut because when I watch CNN or NBC News I'm thinking they're thinking this is\nPlaying horribly for Trump where I live in Ohio\nWe don't want ... will happily take one point one million every year more than the rest of the world put together as legal citizen to take the oath and go through the process we don't want hordes of illegals coming ... most violent places on earth we don't want that is this playing well in Connecticut\nAnd Connecticut there's so many people fleeing the state because of the high taxes I think the typical person in Connecticut is illegal immigrants there's tens of thousands of them here thanks that Governor Malloy ... over the past year and a half the Blumenthal every time he's eager to immigrants ISIS about the court them they hold up to her shirt\nBlumenthal shows up at church or other Congress people from Connecticut in front of the TV cameras and they plead their case these people shouldn't be

gone on cops that are killed on a regular basis no big deal in fact\nThat ... that kind of behavior not part of the world is regular that's what goes on there and I don't like it much but I think CNN doesn't like the fact that Israel is become friendly with Saudi Arabia I mean when I heard Trump and somehow I hear Trump's comments about journalist\nAnd then I hear about ... ... is if Trump indirectly killed the guy that is what CNN get do and why why did why more valuable than a cubs life\nNPR ... which is subsidized by the taxpayers is the same I end up look at the head of the past set

it Guantanamo is too small\nMilitary bases are too small or talking about tens of thousands a month\nComing into America we don't have the money it doesn't work what needs to happen is the federal law needs to be changed with the cooperation of the Democratic party that says when you arrive here illegally you're mainly sent back your country of origin without a hearing that's it no due process because you're not an American\nBut Democrats tend Democrats in the Senate will not allow that to happen they will not allow that change Trump wanted to get the so called dreamers might be twenty million dreamers don't know how many citizenship on the path to in exchange for a border wall to stop it but it can put a cork in a bottle\nBut Democrats wouldn't agree Democrats right now we're not

or the child or or whoever\nYou know on that point in about an hour and twenty minutes I'm gonna call Peter Wallison he's written a book about the bureaucracy the so called deep state how\nThat continues it continues today three thousand new rules and regulations a year hundreds every month it never stops is going on right now Trump's trying to stop but he's going to make that he made the point in his book that I read\nThat that it cannot be stopped that there's a deep state in Washington that will continue even assuming Trump is there for eight years it will not be stopped that's his point he might I really agree with\nI Would agree with that completely and I I Want to tell you you know the ... the correct protested against a governor governor I mean judge Kavanaugh right they were led by the Democratic party first [laughter] reason they don't want constitutional judges on the Supreme\nCourt oh no they don't\nThey don't want a super legislature they they won judges to impose rules and regulations on us that cannot be passed through the Democratic process\nAnd so they've done that the last thirty or forty years and when you got Gorsuch and Kevin all who ... oh I Hope become constitutional judges they're going to say wait a minute if you want to convince your fellow citizens stamp abortion or gay marriage or something else\nGo convince them in the legislature passed a law it's OK don't come to us to services second legislature and I hope that the Kevin O's Gorsuch and Roberts and Alito and and not Thomas I I Hope that's what\nThat's what they do in the

[noise]\nCorey Lewandowski welcome again to the bill cutting Hampshire Corey how are you I'm doing great how are you today\nDoing well you know about a week ago I spent some time with the president privately it was wonderful you spent like\nHundreds or thousands of hours with the guy and I sit on the air the other day that uh there there's a differential between what I see in the media sometimes with the president and how he truly is\nBefore we get on to so many issues going on especially the mobs versus jobs and all that kind of stuff you know give the American people a measure of the man himself\nWell you know I spent so much time with a then candidate Trump and now President Trump and a truly cares about other people he is extremely\nA magnanimous and private he is funny he's gracious he's always asking about how my family is doing and what he can do to help me that's just who he is and if you listen to the media\nYou know they tell you he's the worst human being on the planet but the truth is he's exceptionally gracious I've seen in so many times helping people that never get the story told because he doesn't want the story told but he's always there to help whenever he can\nWhy is that because the media ought to be calling balls and strikes you know they ought to be saying well this is what's going right this is what's going wrong media ... Research Center ... well ... one of my buddies\nEvery few months as the media coverage is Ninety two percent negative Ninety five percent negative the media is protected by the U.S constitution only business in America and that gets constitutional protection the media should call balls and strikes a lot of good stuff a lot of bad stuff why does the media only report the bad enough to good\nThey only report the bad and this administration the Obama administration you would think that our economy is growing at four percent and we had more Americans working than any other time in our nation's history they've conflated those to see the Trump agenda is not what the mainstream media wants to talk about I here's a great example just last week I think it was\nA President Trump did an interview with Leslie stall for sixty minutes she interrupted him sixty five times during that interview had to put that in comparison when sixty minutes during an interview with bronco bomb or a couple of years ago they interrupted him\nFour times and they have their own agenda their agenda is to make the president look bad not to give him credit that he deserves for the successes that he's had because they no longer in the business of reporting the news they're now in the business of making the news and that the big change over the last two decades\nCorey Lewandowski the president or the other night Montana friend it as mobs\nVersus jobs the only difference is the Edmond J and I think that's brilliant on his part because one look at Brett Kavanaugh I look about a trucks that ever trumps sticker on getting burned I look at congressman getting shot I look at a Republican congressman\nRepublican operatives getting beat up and getting stuck into side with and\nI look at how you're confronted in airports in restaurants mobs versus jobs and do you think the average American I think forty percent of what the president forty percent oppose them there's twenty percent going back and forth do you think that the moniker of the president mobs versus jobs is going to stick\nI think it will stick because what the American people see and hear what people like Eric Holder has to say very recently when they're down we kick them and we kicked in the head you know the the calls to violence by the leaders of the Democratic party whether it's\nA Maxine Waters or other is saying if you see them in a gas station if you see them in a restaurant you go after them you don't give them a break you know that's not the way our country is supposed to be and I didn't support proper Obama but never ever ever did I ever remember\nRepublicans or conservatives for that matter going after members of the previous administration when they're eating dinner at a restaurant we've now seen it with\nSarah Huckabee Sanders was secretary Nielsen of da ... we've seen with Senator Ted Cruz we've seen what happened to Congressman Steve ... where he almost lost his life\nBecause the mob violence antifa is so out of control their goal on their desire is destruction it's not can make our country better\nThis president has created I think over for a million new jobs in the last Twenty one months and that's where we should be doing look even if you don't want this president if he didn't want him to succeed you want him to succeed because you want our country and succeed and that's what the differences\nThat Democrats I hate to say this and they hate this president more than they love their country\nOr the other issue the culturally it is acceptable didn't mean to fame and to make fun of and dismay or the president and the first lady you may recall about a week ago TI who's a rapper then I Will watch nonetheless I saw him and TMZ and I did a video in which a look alike millennia Trump\nWas stripping nude in the oval office performing sex act in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure he might sell a lot of lot of his songs and records from that can you imagine three years ago if a country artist\nHad to pick that Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office and performing sex acts in the oval office what would the outcry from the media have been if it was Michelle Obama\nIt wouldn't be front page news for a week on and that wrap that the the country artist would have had his life probably threatened on multiple occasions\nBut look let's go back to just again about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and they asked her I mean do you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was\nNo it was appropriate because she was an adult he was president of the United states leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's behavior can you imagine for one second\nThat was the the converse if Donald Trump has done that with her during the media would be saying oh\nShe did a great job great job by Corey Lewandowski will do it again give me your production in about two weeks house in the Senate give me your production\nUh I think in the set of the Republicans gained four or five seats are increasing the majority and in the house I'm going to say that it's a bold production the Republicans are going to hang on by two or three seats to retain the majority and keep the Trump Pence agenda moving forward\nGod Bless America Corey Lewandowski Trump campaign manager thanks for coming on the bill Cunningham showing my friend will do it again\nThank you have a great

and you're right about that but I think the reason that those women didn't do it was and we didn't get too much introspection end of this but if you look at Christine body for life I bet you we find out\nThat you know there's a history of her\nThat nobody wants to discuss and that's why she's linked the way\nYou know when once it was done oh no I'm not going to put the charges and not enough nobody bother me leave me alone I'm\nGoing to be alone as you know\nIf our cat on I Would have been negotiated a lawsuit against everybody in the food chain including all the congressional gangs\nThat went after him including Chuck Schumer and for the record\nGang for me and not just a a girl it's a guy to and Chuck Schumer is the ... because he's a guy who was complicit in this uh later\nAh from New York there are all people they just want to watch somebody be destroyed over a thick ideology known as left as him and I think it's pathetic and the far reaching ramifications impact the guys like Bill Cosby\nWho sits in print than at the age of Eighteen years old and American icon\nSits in prison in his eighties over allegations that date back for five decades meanwhile\nA guy who vowed then I mean you know denial sex abuser Bill Clinton runs around here campaigning\nI tell you it was amazing ... you had a situation where he actually raped a woman who told us that Juanita Broderick\nWhen Clinton raped her what what the bloody lamp told her a roommate what happened the roommate solved the blood on her lap saw her pantyhose was torn she actually had four or five corroborating witnesses as the event took place and then they also had the so called uh Arkansas state troopers confirming the fact\nThat the Juanita bribery was actually raped and then you have while he's in the White House is president sexually groping and molesting Kathleen Willie in the White House\nAnd that was well known and corroborated but the media completely ignored both of those events because it didn't fit did it but it did go to go to Brett Kavanaugh\nAbsolutely and so that that's the double standard and then the bigger doubled than it has to do more with men\nVisits me too movement and trying to to I Love how the left tries to migrate thing how they try to get us to take ownership so the ownership of me too\nIs a bunch of left this lecture it's Hollywood left east okay it's the Harvey Weinstein of the world with all these young on the news and these old school actresses and all these pop political feminists\nTaking pictures of Harvey going to his party's extending its virtues it awards dinners and so on while enabling him to do exactly what he's been doing for women for a decade\nDating back decades and and all the the ... the trail of women who did exactly what Harvey ask them to do getting their butts ...\nOn the couch and then suddenly when their careers are waning they decide they want to turn states' evidence but then what's interesting to me to\nA ends up being a bill ends up being part of a\nWoman being used against Kavanaugh being used against a high powered CEOs of companies this movement is born of the lectures activities of left us in Hollywood\nThat and and and the entertainment industry where they marginalized objectify women like crazy and suddenly a guy like cabin all they want to make him the poster child I mean it just it pours me\nAnd when it came time for Obama to put his daughters\nOn summer in terms positions with somebody a Brock Hussein Obama and Michelle Obama selected Harvey Weinstein to to take their daughters ended the Hollywood scene when they knew or should have known exactly what was going on from all their connections but they couldn't care less as Harvey Weinstein was a star Harvey Weinstein and access\nHarvey Weinstein was are making millions of dollars and giving millions to Democratic Party including the Obamas\nSo they sent their own daughter's into the character has been in control of Harvey Weinstein and the media didn't cover that either did they\nKnow they didn't but here's what's interesting about that so they know Harvey their daughters are untouchable but you know whose daughter's aren't bill the daughters of ordinary people their daughters that you know that you got to be concerned about because Harvey will take advantage of them but the ... the what the what rock Obama's selling us\nI have so much power I Know that this guy that electorate is left is who will take advantage of women and every time but I could put my daughters with them but don't you dare put yours\nThat's exactly how the left stacks up I can do it you can't because I'm covered but you're not\nAnd and look at it the less than it is a precautionary tale [noise] for many many boys I've said many times what harmless thing is your kid your son going to do at the age of Fifteen some woman's gonna come back twenty five thirty years later and say oh look at what you did that make more if he's not even going to remember it\nHe is not going to be insignificant to him and her but because something may be important in his life she decide I'll take him down for what\nWell you know it was hanging by it\nWe and not just black male to black women to black women are going to be a major factor in his black people in general\nBecause they're getting it and that's a scary prospect I mean they're talking about Trump having now getting into the forty percent of blacks now support him Kanye West of the ... awake and many young hip hop people who weren't paying attention to politics vote or not they're\nGoing to start speaking out and saying you know what I agree with what he said so very dangerous powerful movement developing and I'm Glad to be on the tip of the spear of it\nOf individuals coming from those violent countries on earth\nIs a net negative for the president I Do not believe that\nI think the main reason that Trump won the presidency and twenty sixteen and that Republicans will keep the house and when the keep the house and the Senate in about two weeks will be the fact that this immigration issue is you want to remind Americans what's at stake in this election\nAnd uh the coverage tonight on the nightly

[noise]\n\nI thought like hunting and the great American is continuing to suffer as they were simply continue\nThe other night on Fox I'm watching and uh the speaker made a comment the expert on the administrators agency slashing the Congress\nThat made the comment that every year and matter who's the president something like three thousand new rules are put into effect by the alphabet soup federal government agencies and uh they're simply a room making that becomes law making which is completely different than what the founding fathers intended what the constitution did not intend\nThe consequences that but not necessarily rules and regulations that costs the American economy billions of dollars every year\nThe constitutional separation of powers been compromised in other words\nThe ... the the agencies and the federal government or the state government agencies were mainly the federal government agencies are accountable to no one other time lawsuits are filed might be years before their compromise and you can't even begin to stop three thousand new rules going into effect and that as a consequence we Americans\nAre going to question the legitimacy of their own government when it's completely on accountable a good man Peter Jay Wallace since written a book judicial fortitude or subtitled the last chance to rein in the administrators state\nAnd Peter Wallison welcome for the first time the bill Cunningham show Peter how are you\nI'm fine thanks to go to have you here a couple of weeks ago of course we got a the fifth conservative vote on the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh which is a good thing and in his writings and the second circuit us court of appeals where he was for twelve years\nBrett Kavanaugh often knocked down the administrative state ruled by rule which is a great thing now described as the American people what is the administrator state and how does an impact our lives\nAdminister the aid is all of the federal agencies including everything from the Treasury Department [noise]\nAll the way down to the FCC and their hunger grabbed him\nAnd the way that they impact our lives is that they make a lot of rules and regulations done statute\nIn many cases generations old and those rules and regulations are not only credit for all that is there are many of them\nBut they have a major effect on our lives and the ... percent the book that I have written is to explain that the we have to rein in in in some way\nOr who's ... when the when you when you say we have to train them in who is we\n[noise] uh well the American people have to rain than in and the way to do it is so unfortunately the only way to do it is through the court system and that's why your point about I'm\nBrett Kavanaugh having been confirmed for the record is very important because I think he is the road\nOf the five of the five member majority would be interested in raining in the administrator state by cutting back on the activities and the rules that they're able to make\nCan you give me a concrete example and I think government agencies I think of the FCC I think the IRS\nBut you're telling me there's hundreds of government agencies bureaucrats\nAbout about one point two million strong new every day meeting offices mainly in Washington about our little all over the country and then they got to do something they just can't sit there and drink coffee all day so they sort of not enacting rules because they want because they have some generic piece of legislation giving them real making powers\nAnd then they issue these three thousand new rules that day that must be complied with how much harm is causing is\nWhere I think it's causing a lot of harm in the center for businesses of course it creates a lot of regulations that they have to comply with compliance activities are very extensive for business is one of the estimates that I have in the book\nThat each near it car who really in dollars to comply with government regulations though that ... trillion dollars actually gets passed on to all other Americans who are consumers of the of the products that these businesses produce so\nThat an important factor and in fact a trillion dollars is more than the government actually tax rates are either from businesses or from individuals each year so this is a very\nSignificant thing um but it can be turned back town and they can be reduced give me hold on\nThe [laughter] the idea here and described in the book is that the courts can step in\nAnd began to review carefully the legislation under which all of these rules are made and very frequently\nUm rules are based on laws that were ... years ago sometimes generations ago and they are in perpetrated by the administrative agency to give them the authorities if she were all these new rules and\nThe court can look at that legislation again and say wait a minute you've gone too far the Congress did not give you the authority to make this rule\nAnd there are a number of examples in the book where you can see that the that the agency has gone well beyond what Congress actually authorize so if the court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude is necessary that's why the book is called the digital fortitude they have to have the strength\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations of um of administrative agencies then we can actually began to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington\nPeter Wallison let's go back in time does not hot summer in
