October ... is the bus tour\nWhole coming games uh are everywhere and there should be\nA very entertaining football game is usually is with the guys are and the ... Indiana of course known for its\nWide open the past at the office but they've got a [noise]\nVery good excellent running back they've got good running backs certainly ... got who will talk about with coach or is the best of the lot at Indiana is getting better defensively Tom Allen was the defensive coordinator Diaoyu before taking over for Kevin Wilson\nA couple of years ago a twenty sixteen when Kevin was shown the door down of Bloomington Kevin oddly enough is now the officer coordinator at Ohio State and those two got together last week and\nAh Ohio State pulled away late forty nine twenty six was the final at as Kirk sit down and put the ... that we might as well start there that\nThere was a heck of a football game for about three quarters of the Ohio State was that the EPA that talent are pulled away but I think that uh kept Indiana's he had about how hard they're playing for Coachella\nLiterally well it was on the road in Columbus and uh they do a lot of good things so that to your point you just talked about his background is the ... um you know he's made a real impact I think what's that that a football team that way\nAnd then uh you know they were good authentically last time I played them back and Fifteen when Kevin ironically was around the fence and uh yeah they are on the same field last weekend it it's a small world but you know that they continue to really do well a guy named Mike the burgers or all kinds of\nCoordinator he's a long time a coach excellent coach was at Michigan for quite awhile head coach of central Michigan and\nHe's done a really good job and I think the cattle is there's a quarterback he's a he's a really good player but we we just face the team that has good receivers a dangerous receivers and on our faces another group that I think is is also very very talented and boy they mentioned brick played last week against the house they\nIndeed which jumped off the page and make coaches Ramsey paint Ramsay the quarterback who will talk about his throat to\nEleven touchdown passes to seven different guys so ... it's not like he's lock it in on what guy all game\nNow they spread it around to a well conceived off ... and um [noise] you know he's he's a just a really versatile player\nIt's a little bit like what we saw last week except the quarterback which I used to last week's not a runner you know it's just strictly necessity if he did but uh this guy can pull down and hurt you and if you don't have contain he'll flip out just to show to ... um [noise]\nYou know whatever was ten twelve year again or on the left down to her first not critical first down so he'll put pressure on your throwing the football but it also um you know\nPull down and make a first houses like that type of deal and he's a very very good pass or\nYou know he's built his his dimensions six two two ten to Fifteen remind me of CJ about it a little bit he's built very similar to CJ good runner and this might be one of the one of the better or run through option quarterbacks you'll see all your\nYeah we'll we'll see a couple of many certainly a right there and he did a good job last year he emerged desert started when he started games somewhere in the neighborhood but ah [noise]\nAh anyway he did a really good job last year and I think that they're really building on something right now they're veteran up front and as I mentioned I think they're they're receivers are really good [noise] um ... account for them as well and the one I'm caught him as a matter of well conceived\nHaving a little bit of a trick play against Ohio State for a touchdown long touchdown so yeah they do a really good job and they're very diverse offensively\nHow about ... he's got a a pick it's rare that appear freshman\nA running back that big comes in and put some numbers like he has he's averaging five yards a kick he's got four or five five yards are run he's got for touchdowns or an almost five hundred and fifty yards rushing a young man out of Syracuse to six to two thirty five ah\nAh I Know I was talking to Coachella today and he said he just loves his attitude or they repeated they would they recruited if they weren't sure he wasn't a middle linebacker\nOr because of that but he settled in it running back out his chance to injuries there did look at them\nNow and he's doing a really nice job he had a nice long run against the U.S they that again just a little ... and actually you know he's whatever it was twenty twenty five yards down the field so that they have a lot of big plays against the U.S they both in the run game in um to several the receivers number five at a big game\nAnd they throw the ball down ... so they they hit you basically every\nEvery possible way they're going to try to to try to attack your defense\nHow 'bout that Hoosiers defensively Kirk uh what are they like to do I know we've had to some wild games with them or they they like Minnesota [noise]\nA love due to to blitz whether or not run or a pastor and I'm sure you're expecting that again that Saturday yeah\nWe are the um it's after seeing they they had a very veteran group last year and a few of back and look at that film\nOr they've got to change some of the things they've done skim adequately at least in our in our opinion the habit a lot of new guy so they're trying to make sure I think they're they're trying to be really sound and keep all those guys on the same page it's a little different scheme that will be saying and\nI'm not anything hopefully that we can't handle but but my point there is it's it's a little different unique\nIn terms of communication for us so it's been really imperative all other guys are on the same page when we go against this team and um you know they're welcome saved a they've got guys that are very aggressive and they play a lot of guys they're very um very good about rotating people through keeping them fresh and\nThe thing really jumps out at me about their entire football teams are so hard they play and you know it starts on the ... side coaching owns a very energetic on Tuesday as the guy and you see the personality his show up and they're playing\nSo ironic last year I had to be our by we 'cause I was at home I think uh flipping channels and and I saw them play in Michigan [noise] and it ended up being a really good game twenty seven twenty I think is out and ended up at\nA machine was lucky to get out of Bloomington alive\nBut I remember that they just watching them and and thinking boy these guys are really plan like they were they're wired and then go on and now you know you have a chance to see a lot more ... just one game and that that's what we're saying it's a constant theme or consistent came across the board\nFor a while they have given up a lot of points should yards to to better teams uh they're number one of the big tent with Thirteen takeaways I'm sure that was the last I\nGot a good job there plus for him to take away margin turnover takeaway margin and they've actually given it away more than we have\nAnd that that's something we're we're focused on we need to do a better job protecting the football ugly laws today times they've lost at nine and uh but yeah the jump is because of the takeaways is on a good job there\nLet's talk about I Wish defense to Anthony Nelson other great weeks ... that it wants the team thing but uh three ... three tackles for last let's start up front to five sex son knows ... dead last week or that had to please you\nYeah it does a you know for us to to play well in the sense that really starts up front that's where our our veterans are shrink has been [noise]\nGuys but it's not raining [laughter] yeah\nThat's a that's the best as we've had in a while Carlos ... Kelly celebrating the twentieth anniversary season\nBlock talk make plans to join talk chance here every Wednesday night to honor the wedding his coach\nIn Iowa football history are ... who's with us today Russia ... by Bud Light ... Bush proud friend at a proud supporter of the Iowa hawkish and Hawkeye football related pleased drink responsibly police tailgate responsibility [laughter]\nGot a caller Dick from solar before he got her Kirk or wanted to know ah I I Do I Do kidding oh Keith used a script [noise]\nBecause the first fourteen Fifteen plays about Bryant does he do the same thing yeah I I\nThink it's really kind of become a trend we're we're most coaches do that not all that most do or are they may um [noise]\nA list or ten or twelve plays that they wanna work into the conversation and really the two are almost the same because uh even when you strip plays out if you get to a certain situation you get off the script go to your [noise]\nYour menu if you will of like you know what are we are on thirty one or whatever first time we get in a situation we always have those\nIn a separate category but I I think most uh coordinators are play cars have kind of gotten in that mode and yet brands in the same thing and uh you know they put a lot of thought and time into that that that's a there are certain things are trying to look for typically a you know show multiple formations maybe some motions or shifts those types of things and\nYou know you're trying to trying to get your guys gone but you're also trying to get a feel for the phone it's going to play you on that given day and uh it's amazing how\nA lot of times what you see ... film or you get a different a different recipe when you know when you show up for the games so it's always it's always interesting to see how things are you know in an atlas both ways you know how we're gonna play somebody or vice versa and\nThere's a lot of little little intricacies that are going on in the course of a game on both sides of the ball but you're not draw these plays out of a jar is okay we're going to run this sweep or hopefully not yeah we lived there were ... a full full confession on that but\nBut it's all based on tendencies good is I mean he he you know every team took a has a personality and sometimes the personality as you are going to get a smattering of a and those are those are tough preparations or you know and the better teams tend to you know they have an identity\nAnd the trick is you know okay we know what they're going to do and\nWhat have you but now the trick is to go out and execute against him because they do do it very well and uh so yeah everything's a little bit different there and then as you well know a college football I think one of the beauties of college football is there is a very diverse um way of going about things in in terms of your office of tech your defense of attacking\nYou see a lot more diversity in college football I think that way than it did you tell a not not the you know say there is no diversity there that's not an accurate statement but [noise]\nYou know you you might get a team it's going to Georgia Tech for instance yeah are you won't find that in the NFL or in the ... yeah I Would like cutting six hundred Russian yards up against somebody so\nWe we know that nightmare and we saw those homes so it just um you know it's it's you know one week you may be playing a team like that and then the next week it may be\nA Washington state who's going to throw it all over the joint and\nYou know so I think that's one of the things about college football I think that's one of the reasons fans are so intrigued by the whole whole sports\nCoaches you can imagine the speaking of execution the shrinking gates said field goal attempt a for a touchdown has gotten a lot of play every word is put on her a Twitter page a lot tonight read a coach I Know it's been discussed to death but\nI loved the trick play how much did Brian have to talk\nYou into running that one in iffy a or if or if he had to do the ... and you thought it was about ten to one coaches are against it you are or a coach his favorite you against it but\nI guess so there are a few more they agree with you yeah no I'm just trying to you know play up to the stereotype of being a ... you know ...\nEverything a killer a good idea conservatives are you are a no it's it's it's interesting I think to that point\nUm [noise] you know really\nAnd and it really kind of began after the fourteenth season I think you know obviously we change our practice schedules we ah had long conversations about [noise] you know being a little bit more aggressive on fourth down those kinds of things so [noise] I I think our mindset change a little bit program was and um [noise] you know it continues to be that way but [noise]\nTo to the point of this play or any place like that you know we we all kind of talk about the staff during the week and then on Fridays we kind of a you know [noise]\nCapitalize or ideas a little bit and then you know a case like this that\nThey do we think it's a executed and uh it's the first discussion and then secondly what are the situations where it might show and it just so happens the other day that it was the perfect situation for it or you might go into a game like that with every intention of running that play in that situation doesn't arise so it's it's on the shelf\nOr in some places are only go from a certain hash mark you know that type of thing so he might have the right down to distance figure on the wrong cash or you know ... you know those types of things so there's a lot lot that goes into it but I think the bottom line is our staff communications been really good [noise]\nUm are in that case was responsible for those ideas but you know it might be a temp politic might that might be something they did it North Dakota state that uh you know we throw up on the board and\nIt's worth looking at you know I'll go back to the poll cat it was something that yeah you know we'd look the work that practice for a while and\nWhat we had a chance to execute it can execute it that's that's really the bottom line she can execute it if\nIf ... or Jackson doesn't make a great a cap on it you know throw that out if breaks can't make a great block on the edge you know it's it's good on the board but not very good on the field that teaches pretty gifted it to do it a lot of great things with the football don't don't underestimate the genuine and he's he's really a ...\nA ... a super [noise]\nHe he's shifted that thing left hand is is he capable of doing it with both hands a lot yeah yeah right into the side of the dash bass Vince oh\nWait a minute so blessed with terrific blogs staffers for a lot of reasons the clue over a it\nIt's interesting you know not everything has been perfect for a Nineteen plus years but that is to your point we we have been so good at that position ... Scholten are going way back Twenty years ago uh and and commonality every one of the guys is walk on\nAnd they're kind of all like self made guys you know Daniels was not a big guy when he showed up here\nYou know you hate force fed himself to get up to two Fifteen or twenty what are we always you know he was the guy and he's a little guy when he got here but you know that was part of the deal so he loved to wrestle they they told us has still does they just did that positions are really been [noise] um [noise] you know Casey Crowder\nWe've just had such a good to go to Ronald ... amazing\nYeah and we were talking earlier about Penn State the six for game of state a lot of long steps up trying to think of who are staffer was uh\nWas Cody Cody Cody asked toning down all for the snoring play now or the scoring okay you know I never thought of that came in that way that's very that's a good trivia good step what Radley back that truly are they out there you go ... [laughter]\nWell since you're willing to be a little bit more liberal in the ... or play calling Trevor Trevor\nA Twitter says coach or can we see sergeant run a wild cat play\nHad also see bad cell wrote a few plays well Peyton Manning cell he speaks of the backup quarterback or are they doing just fine right now we paid that's that's good [laughter] hopefully we can see a play a little bit but\nMinnesota obviously had a gigantic six foot two hundred forty pound tight in running wild cat to the guys are pretty talented guy I don't know if you're one of the wildcat or not he is\nHe's only been there for months right now so we'll we'll just let him get sold him and his position [noise] um but yeah I'm not opposed to that and this guy's been reading my mind here because uh [laughter]\nUm I actually saw a prospect during my by week where\nI was at a game and uh [noise]\nYou know saw a lot of passes at night the best one was drawn by a this prospect who was not a quarterback so\nI've already I don't make my recording promises but I told him if he comes here we're going to the ... with them because they hear because he can catch it run it in a was a nice passage right\nYeah I guess a one more before we take a break here uh [noise]\nTied to coach a defense or a [noise]\nA pass interference hold up a a interference holding their all subjective uh there's so much contact\nA receivers of defensive backs or how do you teach it as a better to play the ball or the receiver of normal passed by what's the first what are your first ...\nYou know tons of Arizona men too so you know there's a different component there but\nUh yeah I mean you better understand and appreciate what that man is doing a so you'd better have track to him and uh there's there's a certain time in aspects as far as planned the ball\nHave your own coverage that's a little different but uh yeah you you you got to know where that's where the receivers and that's\nA lot of times when you see guys come open a perfect place\nFor a place where you are and the fans go on like does anybody covering that guy it's usually because people start picking on that that are just a combination of me on the fence\nAnd not only in the back and the guys up front do the same thing you start picking up in the background or the back chilled excuse me and now you get caught up in that and what you're responsible for\nWhether it's a receiver you're covering or a guy that you're supposed to be you know to feeding a block on too much there and you\nEnd up by a ... matter what happens afterwards 'cause you're in a bad position so [noise]\nUh that that's the rule having the discipline to stay with your particular key and every player has them on every play\nUm that that is so important that every position and\nIt's easy to get distracted out there are times you know it doesn't sound very hard but it is you know there's a lot going on but you really have to be focused and discipline on whatever you're given", "year": "2018", "show_name": "iHeartRadio Podcast Premiere", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "11"}
