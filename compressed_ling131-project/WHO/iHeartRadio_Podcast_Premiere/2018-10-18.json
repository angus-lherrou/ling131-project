I don't think we are getting free gummy so maybe\nWhat may have to talk about it and uh we get somebody here the ... can you give a shout out to mom shown to\nWear here celebrating her last day of radiation treatment for breast cancer [noise] she's a lifelong fan has hardly missed a home game she's been a season ticket holder just eighty five where is Joan Joan welcome congratulations John [noise]\nEighty five is a great year she brought us good karma [noise] the Greer [noise] thank you keep redoing\nThose season tickets because have you been a season ticket holder since eighty five that number one versus number two at the hawks urban planning ever since we said the best of luck good watch uh Joan or God Bless you are with the new freshmen rule are there specific players\nThat you want to see a game action in the next few weeks ago hawks that's ... year from a\nA coral bill we've talked about that new rule which really gives you some flexibility [noise] it's any four games yeah\nSo you're you're looking at that shirt every week to see who's played\nIn what game yeah they're they're really like a handful of guys right now are big handful I guess a couple of guys are these they're already\nPlaying you know we made the move with a\nA ... at the corner positions those guys are in the water there in the defense woman away [noise]\nUh but [noise] you know some of the other guys have been in one or two and keeps me two games and you look at a situation like we have right now we've got a couple of linebacker still out [noise] so you're central themes especially start getting run or in a little fan so a guy like villains oil might be working on number two and a special team area\nOf the nice thing about the rule is if if we have to go on and play him you know it's not going to cost him as Europe eligibility [noise] uh but I think in those situations just using him as an illustration [noise]\nAh the more we can hold off on that the better and that way in November it gives us a lot more flexibility goes you know we've we've had some injuries obviously already I'll particle have more November So the more we can bank\nThose games or what the guys that were concerned that's that's kind of our strategy and then uh yeah November I think you'll see [noise] probably you know anywhere from maybe three to five guys actually out there on the field\nOr helping us women hopefully we're not we're not going to put them out there just to put them out there they're they have to be able to help us when\nIt's an interesting approach or Tyrone Tracy's played in one game Nicole regaining who you're really high on a future wide receiver has played into games [noise] Henry guile played early in a couple of games you can kind of holding him out here of lakes ah [noise] and I think that\nThat's a good illustration too because we have free back so we feel comfortable with the job you know plan all three guys are doing a great job unfortunately [noise] or at least one of these men out\nProbably four maybe five of the games I don't know so [noise]\nNow who is your third back in to be here and again we're able to do that without a putting anybody is the ... the risk so I think that's a great role I still think we ought to slip freshman let her by play five years good points and then go from there\nAh every Kelly a hope to have you got to see how he's out of ... so knock on wood so tarnished a a guy\n... I'm not going to call it a three hundred monster yet but you know three pretty solid facts who can all do different things you know\nThey're all doing a good job and they were talking earlier in the program about to inexperience players all three of those guys came in relatively inexperienced and [noise]\nUm you know obviously there are some trepidation there when when you have guys in touching the ball frequently that haven't played a lot [noise]\nAh they were all over that and all three of those guys have really earned our trust and more importantly I think that the maze recognize that we're all really good players and they're all working extremely hard\nCoaches cedar Carlos ... Kelly is a\nTest of painting the when the forecast Saturday I've heard more talk today about the when the that's expected a game time are you practicing outside to get accustomed to the expected windy conditions\nThat we took a drag says that any way so that that's another big issue and it's been breezy the last two days it's been chilling I'll say that you know or a third order words I made eight thirty [noise] um [noise]\nSo it's been chilly but [noise] ah it's been windy but not not to the degree they're talking about and that's yes there is a first I'd heard of that\nGood news it's it's just the ones they announced that things do change but sure that that's part of playing football and uh you know especially in the Midwest and or or the northeast there's certain parts of our country we're going to deal with when during the cold weather so we're like a ... [noise]\nUh and it is I think I think I still believe it's the biggest factor in any outdoor sports uh whether it's golf not that annoying about golf the Gulf football baseball\nOr you know one can be a huge factor in [noise] so it's good to be conditioned to it\nYeah as you adjusted the fly a [noise] a native sure what kind of issues with the Maryland office presented his is similar to Georgia Tech [noise] when we play them on the Orange Bowl uh we were talking before you got here about uh\n[noise] the last two weeks you face pass happy officers some of the city some that's what they do a this was a totally a different game plan is\nVery different and I used the Georgia Tech comparison the other thing I guess yesterday uh seems like three weeks ago [noise] but uh anyway it just um\nIt's it's not going to look like that to to our fans but to what it's going to look at the comparison there is that you really have to know your responsibility and when you play an option to Mike like Georgia Tech is if you don't have a guy covering every base and exactly and the red spots former hit thirty plays on your [noise]\nSo the comparison is with a Maryland in my mind at least these guys do a lot of shifting a lot of motion and other jet sweet package where the guys you know race them through there and obviously that affects the ah what's going on the constantly so first and foremost it starts out with guys recognizing the formations\nAnd then there's a lot of communication has to go on after a call gets made because they're going to be moving around and doing stuff for the words shifting motion and all that stuff requires communication so you gotta love and does it have to get the same\nUh same adjustment in signal and then most importantly they got a point when the ball gets that but it all happens really fast and it's very tough to to stimulate and practice 'cause [noise] you know we we don't do that all that often for SARS go to him to do it uh it's a real challenge\nThe nice thing about Georgia Tech is that we have time to train her Scott teams or or ... got a good look at it [noise]\nUh it's tough for us to duplicate in practice what we're going to see Saturday So\nThat sort of the mental work really comes in you guys have to really do a good job in the meetings and you know the most important when you do what you see on a lot of times because of all this stuff you used to be getting our position above back will break through the line of scrimmage and you know if you don't have good angles to the ball\nAll of a sudden what should be arguing or tenure arguing ends up in the in the end zone and um [noise]\nYou know just that that happens fast so\nUh I Can't remember playing a team that has so many big place you know what I think um [noise]\nBecause I think it's like sixty Dr seuss ... sixteen they've at sixteen drives over sixty yards and all but two of those they've had at least one if not too explosive type poison it so [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "iHeartRadio Podcast Premiere", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "18"}
