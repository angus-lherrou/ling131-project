the yard age particularly through the year most of the season ah except a poor last week and they ran into a a buzz on that Michigan State defense up in East Lansing and I'm sure that\nOccurred

is a fifth year kid\nA Hopkins is a junior and do they know how to find the ... the big thing is it\nA David ... been throwing the ball so much to run they all more or they knew they had a special player when this kid hit campus but think about this she was playing high school football year ago in New Albany, Indiana\nAre they ... they couldn't have been uh uh they couldn't have been convinced that this kid was going to come in and that threw a two thirds of the season that fifty seven catches for over seven hundred yards and a seven touchdowns are catching the mean they use them on the fly sweep\nA he's tremendous ... kick returns he's one of the best for the Big Ten\nA he's a big play a guy and he's five foot nine one Seventy five but man can he fly\nAnd if he uh he gets you into one

I mean Blau David lousy thrown two hundred and thirty passes the allies you send a lot of the backup\nHas thrown it up a forty five times that's\nRoughly two hundred and Seventy five pastors thrown Stanley's showing for two forty five so these are two teams that like to throw the football\nThe ball to makers have a a veteran a front for the five starters returned to the offensive line from a year ago this year led by senator Kirk Barron he's been around a lot of years a fifth year senior from Mishawaka\nIndiana they all go six four to six foot seven six two to six seven three hundred pounds across the front line uh everybody's over three hundred but left tackle grant Herman's who is\nTwo Ninety and he found his way to West Lafayette from Albuquerque which I Know that it has to be an interesting story so it's a veteran ... uh defensively they they play for three but\nThey really fly to the football\nOr they do a lot of run blushing historically a regardless who the coordinator is that's where Purdue does or they try to stop the run first and foremost like most defenses do but they're always in motion coming at you\nAre guys and all that at home a lot of times it's just things kind of like native Saturday but sometimes it can be worse than those guys you know um get substantial injuries that way so it's just one of those perils of playing football unfortunately and\nFortunately we're not talking about that kind of case right now you had any kind of if you got to start wearing stuff on your hand that's not good if you're throwing the ball so there you have it right\nFrom the horse's mouth look for night stand to be on the line up\nA Saturday and throwing the ball a uh well uh that said uh he he was inconsistent on Saturday I think that's being honest to a intern especially in terms of accuracy and we talked about it on the post game show and and and rightly so a Penn State has a very aggressive defense and obviously we're getting in his throwing lanes and\nUh I Know he he he stood up to the TJ Hawkins shouldn't mess on the fourth down which nobody's perfect but on balance what what else did the tapes show you this week\nWell first of all I mean Penn State played well defensively to Saddam all athletes on defense uh they did not play the ... well for the week before and everybody was watching it on TV and it was a televised game\nA could attest to that um you know it's funny how sports are but to Indiana was rendered surely I'm you know a ineffective against us when we play at 'em and then\nWe two weeks later they're they're playing against the Penn State team that's very very athletic and talented and you know they move the ball five hundred plus yard so that is only about college football you just you know every week the different adventure but the the one thing we knew about Penn State was their athletic town and\nThey do Russia pastor well especially when they got to lead a especially with the crowd noise and that's another factor in the U.S rush so you know they made a top that way and a good day Thompson and you know we've got matches so unfortunately we came up on the short end but\nUm you know I talked to more of Monday morning talk to them weekly the kind of pick his brain and he shared a story ... used in the press conference yesterday\nA said Chuck going after a branch I had a bad game one time talked about Nolan Ryan and he says you know ... stands on them out\nA the the rubber as always equal distance from the place that never changes oh he's got as much time as he wants them between pitches and he pitches a ball that's perfectly round and symmetrical football's just the opposite red ... a quarterback got hit in the face 'cause it in the throat\nA they don't have a lot of time and you know so drawing from all kinds of such a goal was saying you know so let me explain you know going abroad no hitter one time and get it can't make it out of the first day in the next time how do you explain [laughter] so why wouldn't you think your quarterback might have a tough game or two and the ... it was a pretty good sir and that's not an ... but I didn't know that store is pretty good\nYou probably haven't heard the last of the great stories from Tom more either up that's all keep calm during a wealth of wisdom great orator indeed All right well let's go get settled in here and sip on his coffee for a couple of minutes and talk to the fans as we take a break here on TALK talk with coach parents were Carlos ...

here at turtles so Kelly's in Iowa City let's take a phone call jury and walk he is checking in with the coach parents I jury good evening\nIt well are we going\nTo try to yeah with a rocky is a really a called a young man I was an outstanding wrestler as well as a you know a good football player and\nUh yeah we we chose to try to recruit him and he chose Michigan State so um you know that that's the way that goes to get a ... state that we offer doesn't always work that way but\nAh to your point he played a really good game obviously we saw that film and made some really nice rose and um you know the Michigan State overall just played a really good dog or the real good game on Saturday\nWhat was the key defensively for the sports I mean blow it had like three consecutive three hundred yards passing games to run do cut a lot of balls but they were short throws it you know they hope he could break and then a a really shut down the running game but I you know Michigan State has historically solid vegetable\nReally are really I'd say since two thousand one Marco then Tony I got there that that's the one thing they've really built their program on and consistently they've been really good at doing that regardless of\nUh what else was going on and that's that's for the most part maybe a blip or two in the radar but yeah they're they're just a very tough aggressive team on defense and uh they make ... make up on everybody basically in a you know even the mess\nAnd tape of a you know if you've watched that game that was a\nThat the score is very misleading there's just a really good defensive team so you got to give them credit and they made a tough on Purdue I think the\nYou know the big challenge of Perdue and uh it it's true of any good sense of football team Marilyn was a different type of team but\nUm you know minimize and those big place and you know they've got some guys that really have some a big play ability whether you want to talk about the running back who's really emerged as a really good player\nOr the freshman a sensation of receiver and he's also returned guys so but they have other guys too that are very gifted merged guilt and on top of that they're very innovative with their attacks so they get the ball to\nA lot of different guys but you know they've got somebody as you better you better try to contain them or else they're gonna you know all of a sudden they're they're running wild run loose on you\nAnd if you're trying to contain them and doing a good job of it they get a pair a couple a couple of tied in to our big and strong and physical and can catch the football and produce historically use those titans\nAnd they do a good job of that and ah you know it's kind of find just was was going through today the state law says he has a couple of times two times in the third second quarter excuse me and uh then they they had a little drag widely thing where they brought the guy across the grand and a quota would then give them to\nThanks to US Bank your banking system and if you quit she was a time to get more done\nMike ... go to the gym condemns or something like the gym and I really like you were

the head football coach at all guys Kurt parents I often wonder till eight o'clock tonight we're taking your tweets your Facebook posts we're taking questions from the audience here if\nYou have a question you'd like to jot down on a piece of paper or a napkin bring it up all up to ask her about it and we're also taking your phone calls a day seven seven four six four to nine five seven a trucker Jim as a mowing his way along the interstate on hold for a while how Jim\nJim hello why on yeah go ahead Jim\nAnyway I just want what you guys a happy Halloween and first of all a little trivia you know as I understand that\nUm what ... really needs is a fully eating which is the eating meat for all states day which is a Catholic holy days so I thought it you'll end up a little trivia but I Do have a\nQuestion a critic question actually and a coach or you know there's lots of football players out there this country and be on the players probably wait and obviously the hospital to evaluate\nOh man I'm I'm just kind of wondering what process that you guys used to first of all\nSort through all the players get it out to a manageable number whether it be a few hundred or maybe a thousand or so\nAnd then from there\n... players to eventually I get it down to the point where your sports arena scholarship so it's kind of curious about trusted coach and good luck a rest of the season\nYou know it's it's really involved and I probably spend hours on it and then um you know we we get priority\nHire a hundred people to uh be involved in it which which a couple of schools in the country actually do that uh I think that's one of the rising concerns we all have about a collegiate football but uh it it's a very expensive process and in your point a couple of things are there are just a\nAn unbelievable amount of prospects that needs to be evaluated if you tried to do it from a national standpoint it would take an army of people so\nI'm most people um you know kind of localized or centralize their recruiting areas we a focus on states pretty\nMuch within a you know five six seven are driving radius of of the um University of Iowa City and um you know trying to break it down ... a geographically so every coach has a region these involved with and then we'll secondary areas to that extent\nInto further reaching you know such as Florida Georgia New Jersey states that aren't necessarily considered mid west\nAnd I'm probably one of things that changed the most is just the the accessibility availability of uh looking her prospects films\nOr when I was here in the eighties you know actually get a get a hold of a\nA VHS tape or a sixteen millimeter tastes really good prospects ... that was a not easy and you would borrow one and uh\nYou know male Pakistan as you could after you've got the appropriate people looked at it so things have changed so much with all everything being online so you know we have a a million people will get a look at it I'm I'm exaggerating a broad use your term but not much you know there are thousands of paint prospects you could look at but it's not physically possible so\nNow you're just kind of screening um and and just start winning your way down but it's a it's very uh Geographic's a Center for us I think that's kinda the way we do it and if you look at a roster it's a you know you can tell the areas that we really focus on\nAnd then you may get referrals to for people that you trust people you know are there might be some kind of connection that might make sense for a\nFor a prospect from an outline state that might have an interest in the university and we'll follow up on those two and then go from there so\nYou know just an awful lot of variables guys come to camp we evaluate them in camps as like we've I wait I'm On tape and uh you think of player like Raleigh moss for instance who you know we liked him a coming out of camp last year like them going into his senior year a ... saw him live last fall\nA on a friday night and then came back and said hey I think this goes a little better than we thought he was so so that's a big part of it to just live exposures watching watching players and their senior years not not all the guys are gonna be really good players are already committed there are a lot of guys out there right now waiting to be found and now we're trying to stay on top of that as well [noise]\nAppreciate the call a gym as always a coach we got a tweet from Tyler Trent who lives down near West Lafayette Tyler uh made it to ... last year and participated in the wave and uh he's in a life a life battle with\nThe cancer terminal cancer but you know terminals a word and he's uh down near Carmel and he tweeted in and I said I'm happy to announce as long as my health allows my family and I will be a cheering on the board of makers that Ross said stadium but uh I'll also always take time to wave\nTo uh the the kids it's dead family children's hospital at the end of the first quarter\nAnd they sent along a nice picture of him and I'm assuming his dad are certainly a relative of the game last year he was featured the evening of the state to Purdue game a great story wonderful young a guy who's in a life and death the struggle with cancer but he took time to tweet us tonight and told her we really appreciate that\nWe do scholar into wish you all the best that I didn't get to see the future I think Tom and all they did it but I did see some of the coverage and and ah you know what a tremendous story and I'm sure there's a real a bond there between all those kids and uh you know we're just to wish you all the best hour and\nA you know appreciate you taking time tonight to to join us indeed\nA title ... let's say a prayer for tighter on Halloween Night to uh to that you know I probably do I don't know two to three radio interviews a week during the season all over the country and I will tell you one of the first things that comes up first before we talk football\nTell us about the wave tell us about him children's hospital of it is really captured the imagination of the country\nI uh it it's interesting I noticed she has a a my headset often heard wave on wave being played the between the quarters at Penn State and top of that to them further you know just acknowledging that but\nUh yeah I mean it's it's received international acclaim not only national claim but international claim a can also joined us down in ah Atlanta last December to uh get ESPN award and uh you know that was really great in fact a movie at the game next a\nNext time we're at home I guess that's next week or a western days so he'll he'll be here for that ball game he and his family and uh yeah it's just it's just you know it's it's it's a great thing you know and the best part about it again it's organic a crusty on having that idea and it grown into something that everybody can\nFeel really good about and it's a it knows no bounds\nSo uh we're thinking about Tatar let's talk to Tom in Des Moines Tommy's that on old Hi Tommy\n... how can I call a core family shot and on the right\nGuy for Pearl now how it actually at Penn State why do you go about it\nWhere you get out you know\nThat's that's a good thought I never thought of like a buzzer or something maybe get buzz buzz in 'cause I'm you know the you know the a replay officials and we won't talk about that but the replay guys can a bus down and they do but I was down to the referee that sets up get stopped there\nWere told they review basically every play at least sort of thing it's revealed bull um so yeah that's that's an interesting concept that would be different than throwing the flag in the NFL you got for the fight the challenger\nThe ruins of it but like you know because it is a little bit challenging when the when the ball is down inside the ten or ... the officials are typically pretty good about keeping an eye out for you and um you know it's just one of those deals but that's a unique autonomy thanks for the call Tommy and let's go to Kevin before we take a break here yeah Kevin good evening\nA yeah a long long long time listener first time caller a really fun to watch you guys this year I'm\nJust really fun to watch you over the years have two quick questions for you and I hope they haven't been covered because I've been out trick or treat me with my kids the first one is good for November is coming up I Know it's a very important Mont\nCan reflect back on what you might consider your best November and why was it your best November and the other question is when it comes to trick or treat can be a ... cat guy or your butter finger guy or your Snickers guy what kind of guy area I'll hang up and let some bank\nOr you know I mean cats are pretty good um baby rooster are pretty good that's money right there but\nI you know Snickers enhance its neck or is there nothing really I mean there's knickers in the house I I have a hard time ha
