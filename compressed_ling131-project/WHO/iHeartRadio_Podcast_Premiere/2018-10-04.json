Illinois and she just didn't just an awesome person probably one of the hardest workers I've ever coached to be honest um she makes me better every day 'cause you just someone that has a very high standard not only for herself and her teammates and so we're very lucky to have her as well ... is our captains that share\nA sign that biomedical engineer engineering major and and you're going to dental school next year where she's going but I talk about days you know very full that she did it have to be on every minute and she just an exceptional do not represent the University of Iowa comic certainly while every day\nBut Sean had a great tournament but you also have five parts in the top you know a freshman and upper class putting a lot to talk about a couple of those of you mentioned the Christian or largely a Stephanie Herzog is a straw for about a learner as a freshman and cause a metal ...\nMan well is around zero zero zero zero tried ... you're you're doing international recruited golfers with international sport as\nIt is I think if we talk on the writer happy now there's a great golf all over the world and\nWe've been very fortunate to attract players from all over

loves the people here she loves the city she loves being a Hawkeye and um she didn't she is amazing I feel like the kind of have a dynamic duo and I'm Donna and meanwhile are they just bring a great energy and\nLove golf I just have a great passion for the game and her team golf and it's just been really just an really infused a lot of energy and dark team in our whole culture which has been great and what are you\nTrying to get we're talking with Matt so I was a women's golf coach or a year [noise] I was doing a fantastic job with the help of heart [noise] what do you try and get out of the fall schedule is more ... more\nWhich is you get ready for the spring and the other thing too\nIs you know I think we feel like we really need to kind of get off to a hot start in the fall and unfortunately we were a little slow at the gate but I think that uh you know in freshmen in line up and we had two great seniors that I think we're maybe trying a little bit too hard rarely trying to put together a great campaign and I know they will um at some time than golf as we all know trying too hard and\nIt's kind of the last thing that you need to do we need to get out there and be comfortable and settling in ... golf so we feel like that kind of happiness last weekend and things are starting to fall into place and we're really trying to get as many rounds under our belt\nIt'd be OK if the ring with you a little bit to help without a little bit on the fall but just really trying to get a lot around them and see a lot of great competition and we just continue to me and all of that every day we're just trying to get a little bit better every day and get stronger and figure out what our weaknesses are in and get to where\nA comeback I'm surprised you're working your teams playing right yeah the pits drivers out there playing ... your ... your way through those out of new there are other postings okay up there [laughter] yeah I'll be okay I'll be okay I get older I don't get upset as I used to it are\nThat are younger than that it's\nNo good good good to see the talking about the titans that's certainly\nGoing to highlight you know we we are really felt like folk Noah and go to jail time has passed away very well sure and so they're doing a really good job or a tremendous young people in their town a gift or they weren't or and or\nThe other really helping our team that's one of the positions I think that the tops of wine and I was running back or through the positions that we feel like we um\nYou know have multiple players complained going there and really play effectively [noise]\nTJ lead you in charge I gained at the ... position course NOAA has the [noise] the four touchdown grabs this year [noise]\nNate Stanley that that's not a bad place to go a few of the quarterback as you continue to develop a wide and she [noise]\nOn a question and ah you know that that's something we've seen over the last two years at progressing [noise]\nUm you know got his feet went a little bit two years ago and then last year had a good year and teach it Richard uh two years ago and\nDid a nice job last year is the first year player so you just hope every player is growing incrementally a with a return of the season that type of thing and um so if he has a book on that they've been really nice job and it does take some pressure off everybody else and\nUh you know when we're playing while we took we spread the ball around a little bit so the defense can because catches load up on the one one particular individual turkey flip\nThings a little bit at the beginning of the pie week you did a lot of the heavy lifting the first two or three days brought the regular said he got some heavy practices in there then gave them some time off of turned the backup should the youngsters are those are the inexperience to to get a lot of reps in that that was a that was planned that was ... it was way so\nIt's it's interesting or no probably you know you you look at everything as your program goes goes along and [noise]\nUh you know we feel pretty comfortable and tell pretty comfortable as your wherever we're bull preparation and our approach to that's changed a little bit over the years uh certainly did after the first Orange Bowl we we just had a disastrous game so we were really a booklet that hard [noise] um but but times have changed too you know now we play after Thanksgiving\nSo my point there is it like you know we look at a ... of our program for obvious reasons but uh the way things it's always a little tricky and are there a couple of variables what what time of year is it when you do have your by a it was Thirteen we have to buy as a whole different discussion\nBut what time of year as it were were ... how the turn all those types of things so we we did spend a lot of time on that back in the off season has a staff disgusting things uh through some ideas that our players and then you don't want to come back and forth on it that you know to your your point and we tried to make the I'm\nThinking like a normal game week if you would [noise] uh we did a practice Tuesday and Wednesday with regarding uh the older guys just lifted on a on Monday that's all they did ... that's all they did but uh we had to go to work out some\nUh ... what the team up a little bit ... younger goes a little bit more extensively\nThat friday or had a very light that you'll everybody and then kept younger goes out for a little bit more work so [noise] uh they were here friday morning we normally tracks on fraud is I'm a a little breaks to the guys that were [noise] local law to them one home guys from far away to go home with a partners that type of thing and [noise]\nThey got back to Sunday but one coming on or usually Sunday practices not very impressive and uh this year it went pretty well so what happened but maybe we maybe with something\nThat you found the right formula there but it's interesting because you mentioned do too [noise]\nAnd I'll never forget the hit your by week after the last football game sees yeah up at the Metrodome therefore you didn't play a game for fifty whatever eight days [noise] and oh by the way here's southern Cal go go beat up and the Orange Bowl which\nThat was a good game for a close game anyway for the better part of the two three quarters [noise] uh so you've had you've had the by week at the end of the year do you have the earliest by we care a three four weeks [noise] end of the season I I'm assuming there's pros and cons with with\nWith each open window\nYeah so we'll look at the positive side right you know to try that right accentuate that but [noise] uh it's interesting last friday night by my count and that's on official was dead center in the middle of our [noise] our town or your for the season starting starting camp for the first friday in August and [noise] you know finishing up on [noise]\nUh I guess over the last friday of whatever it is right I don't know as one next to last one in nova Thanksgiving week that exactly so you know it kinda fits right in the middle of it and we obviously do more heavy lifting in August so we do any other time in the air so\nTechnically uh the energy our guys hearing spend will be much less and the next day weeks than it was the first day weeks\nBut I think it's that that a good point I think you know we played enough where we have a pretty good grip on our team [noise] not not that we're there yet not that we have all the answers are in the I think we have a good picture of what the guys look like a game [noise]\nSituations tough situations and gave us some things to focus on his coaching staff play or something to focus on and [noise] you know we certainly a purpose with our practice last week and then [noise] um I really like where it's at certain now and now we got an eight week season and\nI'm trying to make a last time he played an eight week season in high school ... years but [noise] you know anybody do anything for a week so [noise] uh you know we should be for us we should be arrested and we should be able to um [noise] you know ... to give our best for the next eight weeks and that's that's really the task to him\nWe'll talk Minnesota specifically here as we we press I Want to go back to the Wisconsin game um [noise] I really liked what ivory Kelley Martin showed that night to and and that sort of a kid it was a quite a hundred percent yet these should be pretty close now but man I tell you he he brings some extra weaponry to the to the arsenal if he's healthy\nAnd just on and on the answer just talking about our backs you know we have we might have the quietest group of ... you know at least they are in the building all three of the guys are a little bit on the ... ... ... ... works are in the essence of you to go near [noise] he's really impressed that it's just the way it goes about his business or what have you\nA tour and has a very energetic um you know tough minded player\nBut again not not outspoken her voice or just to us about his work really impressive land because jumped in there and done the same thing so it's a really good about the group but yeah I ... got a good skills ... skills that\nNow he's a little stronger in little tougher maybe you'd think he is and he's pretty nasty and uh you know just kind of knows how to how to do a lot of things pretty well so he he's also a really good start and I would say the same about the other two guys as well [noise]\nHopefully recall of that is a legitimate three headed monster by the end of the season but there's certainly gives you some options there are let let's shift out to the wide receivers because that continues to be a work in progress you got to be that Mars set back and I know you enjoy having his feet out of the battery yeah and he he's a little\nBit more mature physically then he was a year ago certainly and you know ... he's still very and you know all the guys were talking about her young guys all three of the ... the young players a hybrid as a young player in my mind Brandon Smith you know you go right down the list so\nUh you know we've got a lot of guys that don't have a lot of experience but they played a lot Stanley's young player and [noise]\nAnd you know so the only player in my mind and a teacher and so\nI think all these guys are doing a good job the receiver group or you know ... guys got a lot a lot of juice out there is a lot of smart to them and um he's pretty journalist and I think is a consistency now is improving you know you had some uh ups and downs last year and that's what you expect any comic as for Syria\nYou know we're seeing him grow and I would say the name brand and his sidekick you know I'm ...\nI'm using what he's got a little bit better than he did earlier in the season and certainly last year so we're we're scenic or mental growth and you know the veteran in the group is next they only really and then also walk around with their most seniors and those guys have been around the block a little bit and you know a little bit more you know a veteran if you will [noise]\nAnd you're given drone awake a shot out there are legitimate shot a ... a good player who is yeah the unfortunate uh specialties but get a heck of a return there before you go to the football\nThat's that's one of those things is not characteristic of him a I don't I don't share that at all and you know he was trying to make a play and [noise] it's almost kind of freaked out by the way it'll happen but but it happened and that's you know could hurt\n[noise] indeed but uh we move on to Minnesota before we do that you you mentioned the defensive line certainly that has many highlight [noise] on the defensive side of the football\nEpinephrine or everybody wants to talk about ha but Nelson has had a terrific start uh all of them have what I what I like is the deputy been able to develop a new you had sort of potential [laughter] they're going into the season [noise]\nUh and I speak specifically of a lot more and goals to how they have really helped solidify the interior most notably but those are guys can switch out or jump around to\nJust talking about young guys you know center in a plane is that your freshman so he's he's really you know he is a as a junior but he's not a red shirt junior and there's a difference there but I think he's playing his best football really happy about that he's worked extremely hard uh since it started to camp and\nI think he's made a big stride or John seeing on the other hand was coming from further away but I think he's been governed Brownlee\nSince last December and a very very pleased with his development and avatar Asia in there too I Know everybody kind of looked at him\nUh the quarterback is young a first year player but I'll tell you smart enough to go outside of those guys when you're ... to them and they are they both are very very dangerous to outside guys walk as an older guy the other is that your first one number Thirteen and [noise]\nI think one of them are and I think twenty two times they only got twenty but those aren't just little top officer they're throwing the ball\nDown the field that's been their bread and butter because they've lost her ... to ... decision ending injuries that half Rodney Smith a chat on drugs so I thought\nIt was like well who Bush guys you know their early ... foreigners\nOr that you know it's a big loan you lose two quarters of a failed [noise]\nTyler Johnston is the junior receiver you speak of and he's a big guy sticks to about two hundred and five pounds he's from Minneapolis [noise] he's got twenty two passes average is Thirteen and a half yards [noise] and he's got five touchdown passes so obviously ...\nYeah he he's been very productive for them he was a good player last year as well\nAnd I think you know we're talking about are having some balance our team over the last a\nThem are talking about that and [noise]\nUh I guess the thing that's what their teams to them now you got two guys that are really good for us\nUm you know he's a true freshmen out of George\nYou know he gets down to feel pretty pretty well makes a lot of places to seek insisted on\nOn a number six and just you know you got to do it on both of these guys were\nShot they who it is is the true freshman English because they've always got big tied in or they have again this year they've got to a number of freshmen they're playing at the white out along with tighter adjusted the junior what about a brace Williams is a youngster from Florida coach entail back they\nMoved him in there they've been feeding him a whole lot to good size six foot two hundred pure freshman\nBut obviously gets her skills\nAnd he's done a good job and I came in Maryland game and ran really wrong second half so you know he's he's quite nice to front strong and then twenty fours a solid guy too but twenty wants things a little\nLet's go to the phones so we'll get Tony on the line we haven't talked to me in a few weeks\nHe's got a question or comment I timing [noise]\nHow long have you know how\nTo me again and now the ... you can eat guy you know\nThey used to call it kind of good to hear from you know uh [noise] well I don't know that I was players last longer than than other schools and being part of that as a roll the dice does that mean the average NFL careers like four and a half years if if you can stay healthy or you can last now\nA Riley reset a good run brand luggage had a good around Mike Daniels has been terrific but ah [noise]\nAh you know it's an honor to play in the NFL Marshall yet I don't want to forget Marshall either but [noise]\nHave a terrific careers greenway played eleven\nYour ... just retired and right before Amazon Bob who played uh probably Thirteen Years maybe a defensive tackle call it was all that stuff to do in a defensive line you know those guys take a lot a lot of shots from all different directions so [noise]\nUm you know it's I think part of it is a you know the reason they're good players here and we're talking about some of our guys like Corker\nUh yeah those guys just do things they do things right they they show up for work on a daily basis than it sounds pretty Monday in a routine but\nA coach in the NFL for six years it's amazing how many I struggle with that are so used to [noise]\nOr just getting by on their ability and or something like that catches up to you so\nYou know being a pro is is much more than being a really good player it's it's just doing things on our on a consistent basis is true in any profession you have to show up and do work in\nA you know to get knocked on you get back up and you don't don't surrender you get back up and go to work and try to fix the problem is that the deal so [noise]\nI I think our guys are for the most part understand that pretty well when they leave and the um [noise] you know they carry that with them to the NFL hopefully I Know they've done the same thing on their\nPersonal lives and all that kind of stuff and\nWhere are the only program teaching at ... made the salaries\nThe case because you know we've had some really good still are guys on the guys we've all talked about or just a minute ago um [noise] you know just they are they're great guys too I mean they're really good people and a fun to be with them\nYou know so you like to see him do all professionally but more important than doing a good job away from and one thing about football it's going to end it's gonna end pretty soon for everybody so [noise]\nYou know hopefully you a little bit more going forward than just being able to tackle somebody or block somebody say something down talked to a Marshall up a\n... in the spring when he was back [noise] and ah the ... and he said he's feeling the aches and pains says eleven years ah [noise] ah in the in the in the NFL and\nOf course if you are a line on ah you're probably going to feel it more than most because you're getting lead on every staff doesn't matter if you're in the old line\nWhere the defensive line or your bank and helmets shoulder pads all afternoon\nThere's there's really no way to get around that and um [noise]\nYeah football's hard physical game\nAnd uh you know I was told people I said you know the players have really good hours or how many there are are really good or better than yours even okay and um [noise] you know and if you if you wrap it in the auto season and that's gotten less now than they were cause now than they did when I was in the national football league\nTheir hours are really good there pays pretty good even the worst pay guys get paid really well [noise] uh but the one thing the the other part about it especially guys on the answer they get the crap out um it's a really hard job physically um you know so there is a tool that they all pay and\nUh you know if it's not an easy way to make a living by any stretch and it's a very competitive business than a lot of businesses are but\nYou know they don't mind cutting you and then I fell either telling you it's not going to leave so it's a business it's it's part of the deal so that you know those guys going through their eyes wide open and uh there's always risk involved and\nYou know you're also going to compensate for that and he hit nobody's making you do it it's it's not going to choose to do obviously the best at what they do appreciate the call Tony go back to the Gulf or his coach I Want to I Want to say to just leaving Greece Morgan said is Tommy still call\nAnd I said you know we haven't heard from Tom in quite a while so it's good that the atomic all going to get here from a\nTime he was a longtime regular over there in Des Moines and he's a he's a you know he's kind of like an old dog later that we do smarter than he lets a game quite well all sports for that in my memory serves me correctly a Yankees fan too so [noise]\nWell I I think you know ... and he is he tells me is I think Tommy roots for whoever's winning okay I'll I'll I'll be honest with you but I may be wrong on that count as a Minnesota defensively [noise]\nThey had really good the lines of the last few years to start up front there sure what do you like about the Gulf or is they have a young guy out there on the end Carter Coughlin is pretty active\nYou know they play them as a freshman he was very heavily recruited a pretty much what everybody in the county and pretty much nationally chose to stay home he's a local kid and stayed home with the with the I'll go first and\nAnd ah you know really good player so you know he he to me is like the earlier up front they played him as a freshman uh and he was learning on the job played really well last year and\nTease earlier up front so\nOr the other guys are are newer guys or to the scene but if you're a good size up there and those guys to play their defense while they've got to uh\nAlways had good athletes at linebacker Thomas barbers seems like he's been there a few years he's a junior comes from a obviously good bloodlines with Mary Ann Arbor but let's start with him uh what do you like about their backers\nAnd these are center of the middle linebacker center their defense and ah you know again as you said these comes from a football family is very uh um looks like to be an\nOut of the whole the concert does a good job and\nMartin number Twenty one minute outside backers of guys place to the ... a very good player too and cash humans are cutting that's my you know the most veteran group is linebacker cash went into a new start or this year but he's been a really good special teams play or continue to play along special teams so those guys really do a good job at farmers in the middle on the east coast to the center of the whole operation\nThere's a big hole in their secondary coach uh at the Maryland game Antwon\nA wouldn't feel the third [noise]\nSon of the great Ohio State player played the league for fourteen years Antwon Winfield uh a foot surgery this week he's done for the year so they uh they've got they've got some patchwork going out of that secondary but wouldn't feel really was the glue guy there intercept or their big hitter [noise]\nUh he will be missed by the goldfish\nAt stuff when you lose that we went through this last or Bernstein or getting injured and it's just a itself when you lose a guy who's kind of a quarterback back there are clearly leader clearly one of the better players and\nUm you know injuries are part of the game [noise] ah you know we all understand that but it's really sad when a player loses an entire season that's [noise]\nYou know they got these guys work so hard for a year round for the opportunity twelve games and\nYou know ... it's just really a distorted to everybody [noise]\nUnfortunately injuries are part of the game they call football before we take a break your Kirk a question from the audience and the NFL\nShielding by a cornerback or a defensive back has passed interference [noise] even if there is no contact\nPowers shielding called in college if it is [noise] uh that I guess are starting to yeah it's a really good question because I'm not sure I Do is understand the calls that are\nOr aren't made so yeah that's that's a good question right there so it is it in the college rulebook\nYeah it is not supposed to look at tech yeah okay well it's obviously a a judgmental and by the part of the official has this fall placement do we have a question about you know these are smart fans who are the gas ... when the receiver running back goes down [noise]", "show_name": "iHeartRadio Podcast
