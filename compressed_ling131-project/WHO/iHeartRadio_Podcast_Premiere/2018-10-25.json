W is withholding he's down in Burlington or a regular contributor to the show go ahead you're on with our culture is\nHey guys that evening I've got two questions unrelated to each other but that was going to ask 'em what disadvantages indoor advantages at you experience now by having Brian\nUh up in the press box for one season and then down on the field with you uh this season and unrelated to that I was just wondering what the rules and regulations are on you want to recruit a student athlete that might go to school out in Pennsylvania or Ohio when you're visiting\nAnd playing for example this weekend um are you allowed owes player when you were on the road\nThose are both great questions also other courting one uh in any time we're in a visitor stadium and uh it's probably not as as apt to happen in Pennsylvania but as you might imagine in the Midwest a typical you know this especially the surrounding states\nUh there's some guys at the games typically the you know we're we're hurting also the uh the way the rule reads as we're we're not allowed to have any contact at all obviously we can't provide tickets for prospects on the road and we can do to an ... or we can give her a prospect free tickets they sign up for 'em and uh that's that's what there were a lot to give them\nA so the the host institution has to do that\nAnd now we're not supposed to have any verbal contact with them a much much like when we go into a school before a contact period you're not supposed to have an interaction with a record also so the host team can do that and I know and can accuse the RO recruits typically now they're in the south end zone\nAnd pre game they move up once again gets going up into the recruiting section saw and it'll be the same way on the road with all the other institutions so that that's a great question and uh but you know regarding Brian\nIt really I think you know I prefer to do to whoever is called plays into when Ken O'Keefe was here his preference was to be\nOn the field and um you know break prefer to be up in the box it's a little bit more sterile up there are others do you get a better better view of the of the whole scenario and I'm Bryan started up there but I think he just he feels a lot more comfortable down on the sideline where he's able to interact with the players\nAre you know face to face yeah and then I think the key component is you know with him coming down somebody upstairs has to be providing early\nGood information because ah we're all depending on that but especially the guy called plays them in this case to kill them ... moved out there and spend a great job with that so I think he's he's definitely more comfortable working this way and uh you know can be in the quarterbacks coach she's on on the field also I think that is\nUm [noise] you know from my experience I think that that helps a lot on the quarterbacks coach can can see the see the quarterback not just you know talk to them on a phone but actually see him and you know just kind of try to read read the the situation of old and then it gets really beneficial so\nI think we all feel good about that that part of things and uh you know we talked a little bit earlier in a show about the staff working well together and it gets that was probably one more step in this whole process\nIt didn't dawn on me to Kirk until\nThese road games where a concert hall but I see a more thorough than home particularly as figure the coaching staff would you really lay a lot of responsibility on your grad assistance at her up in the booth and down on the field with the as well and I think that's tremendous uh on the job training it\nThat it's critical with those guys do and and uh you know tonight's commentary night I'll give you another one here in a minute but a regret assistance to um you know we ask a lot of them they they do a lot of the managers they do a lot of things behind the scenes as do me out as do the same thing that I'm pack the bags we get back at midnight and\nYou know I mean those guys do all kinds of stuff nobody has any clue\n... do the same thing they make our jobs a lot a lot easier in the ... you know we're able to function early focus on the football part things instead of some logistical stuff\nBut then on top of it yeah they'll they'll coach and um we only have responsibility\nOf all we're doing teen periods they run the ... team which is not an easy job I can tell you that from experience I got to go back you know thirty seven ... it's a really challenging job but it's a very important job\nOr for the team to prepare and then then the individual parents are coaching guy's hands on coaching them group works the same thing and so it is it's a great great we learned suddenly weight or inflict me in our presence in any business I think that's\nThat's how you learn and uh you know we've been fortunate we've had great guys working on that I'll give you another a just a little example of dumb things in this world right so our players when we go to you know for home or a way they get for tickets you know no big deal in the ... same thing [noise] we go to a ballgame aren't\nThey give players six tickets now get so many years you\nNo no they don't get ... are still getting more but they bumped the players they don't bumped the G.
