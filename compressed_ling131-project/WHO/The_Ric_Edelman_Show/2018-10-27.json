Joe\nBrown [noise]\nMorning everybody but I you know improv just dumped her mind\nAnd it does sound terrifying so I was reading we lost our cat last week and a half years how sad no like passed away oh that's so hard so we got\nLike cream needed I Know it's weird and I said I Would never do that I'd like barrier yeah they'll I I'm like okay we're going to barrier and I was talking to Eric today and he's like I read a funny story about Barry and cremation I was like OK and he was telling me and showed me the story\nAbout how they had to make a policy at Disney World because so\nMany people were taking cremated loved ones and dumping it won't even know they\nJust had to make like a policy please don't bring people in here can you believe\nOr did they say yes I can bring me less weird I Know I just\nThought it was like the weirdest thing and so it's like this article and it shows like the top five places where people are dumping it it's it's just ashes and dry you know\nLike I Would not bad and it'll bring you back it's like they're bringing like little vials like box or whatever but I mean I just never thought about that\nBut if enough people do it and ash starts building up in certain areas I can see why that would\nBe a ... what the number one places where people are ... their loved ones okay capital was on there but you know and I said it's a small world it's to hunted mansion\nWord that doesn't mean that is the law I was absolutely shocked that\nYou're just like the word that you would want to be ...\nThat is a yeah that's a little weird yeah I thought so too so do you um I was reading oh well I was reading you know I'm I'm the tech stuff I like the tech stuff we we have to do the vinegar guy in here\nI was reading about the world food prize is your last week yeah last week right\nOr the or something like yeah it was where recently yeah thank you [laughter] and um they revealed some of the revealed a skyscraper farm that the world food prize\nAnd so I interviewed this guy he's a former Army Ranger really cool dude and I got to interview him we sat down in the WTO radio studios last week I think it was last week and a recorded interview about what's skyscraper farm he has this giant it's basically a skyscraper and it has farms inside of\nIt like you know you can grow produce virtually or does not seem like the future like ... I mean like that like in the mid ...\nIt is and he has this special like corkscrew design and he you know shows why like can get in and all angles but we put a video of this whole thing at\nW. H. all radio dot com slash Saturday and he said that they want like whole foods to be in the first four of these things and you could literally go in there and order like a bunch of carrots\nAnd it would come down fresh pick just like seconds before you order that is unbelievable and it'd be crazy um where is it or they don't have any bill yet they just run it will deploy him\nFirst one was built in Iowa I think so I think that'd be really cool and like tie like our local farmers into it somehow\nI asked him if he was going to do that that would be amazing critical a he said we'll talk\n[laughter] you know calling me I'll call you well yeah well they need to get a\nSomeone to fund it right so yeah he he came in I thought it was I thought it was a really really cool experience any kind of talked about that we have the video uploaded that's amazing a one way you can get that interview I Know where you're excited about this as we just put our show on I tuned in ...\nOn I was

just say on my way out uh hey Alexa play AC DC [laughter]\nI I thought that was I thought that was pretty funny\nSo that is pretty funny Alexis about yeah [laughter] up next we're going to talk about block chain it's in the news a lot and what does that exact I have no idea have you seen it in the news though I didn't even know when you talk to me okay I\nI see it in the news all the time and I'm a tech person and I really don't even know what sort of talk about what is locked up next our news radio ten forty WHM [noise]\nDon't want to wait Joe Joe ... and I arch radio station and on your age the radio\nKatie already eight\nDoubling you wait Joe [noise]\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news traffic and severe weather station news radio ten forty do you\nBecause I figured that's just something that probably knew all\nWell right right right right so I ended up asking someone I recently met Don ... and all will introduce hearing him in just a second but he he knows all about block to max asked some tech people who's the block chambers and who do I need to talk to their like you've got to talk of time so we brought great Don thank you for joining us today\nI Do not know everything about black thing but I can translate\nThe I don't even know what it is so in here today is the world's leading expert\nOn boy [laughter]\nOut and go and get really close to the microphone Los ... first of all what are you doing what's what's your business first let's start with that\nOur primary business we buy farms and convert them to organic okay no interest and we work with investors are looking for farmers who were farmers are looking for his masters\nOkay so how let's start here how did you get in to well let's start with what is blocked chain one\nIs that for someone I really don't I've never heard that even hurting\nNo okay can you said it would be the other day I was like I like I I ... like I didn't even know what you\nWere okay me so for the layman ... what is ...\n... is a reminds me of the Internet I mean remember back in Nineteen Ninety four people talk about the Internet as a series of tubes in a single never catch on and oh by the way you know what is it so it's a lot like that and it was on the cover of the economist and twenty Fifteen about its impact on business\nSo block chain is basically everybody counts like you've got a check book you may track how many times you've done the dishes versus how many times your wife or husband has done the dishes\nBut everybody in their brain counts in that county is basically electric it's like having a checkbook a balance a balance sheet in your brain about a lot of things that have to do business in your personal life\nSo it's a technology it's it's not something people are just using by itself someone's not someone doesn't ever say I need I Need to go get the block chain or I Need to use block chain it's a technology that's used with other things with other technology\nExactly it's a suite of technology is confusing because it's one word that describes a lot of different things right but basically it's a ledger I mean you're you're keeping track of information and you keep it in a discrete form and it's called the block\nSo you've got a chain of them and then what happens is is let's say you use that analogy like it's your checkbook\nSo you've got a ledger this kind of information in it and then there's other blocks around at the track to make sure that it's accurate and when it gets updated all get updated it the same time and that chronological stamp makes it really secure 'cause you can't go back and change it\nSure so it's a share it's essentially a shared digital checkbook ledger kind of thing that numerous entities share so if one person is off you obviously know that the fraudsters\nYeah and basically you can tell you it's almost like a ... when you see a chart going up while we're on the left going up to the right\nAnd there's a series of dots and some scientist or economists puts a line right through the middle of it that's ... and it's like that so if you have an outlier because we use that we can use it in farming it can be used\nTo track the changes in farming and soil that occurred daily and there's really nothing else that can do that\nSo explain to me again in layman's terms because this can get really technical and I still have no idea how\nI'm no clue so ... so\nTo to try to summarize this because yeah here in the news all the time and I think it's important to kind of try to tackle this it's basically a shared ledger so it's a it's a technology\nThat a company would use a digital company would use someone doing digital online transactions are commerce they are um maybe\nAnd it's a shared ledger between multiple entities\nProbably wondering what is the goal of it\nWell let me give you some poor analogy okay go up to a bar and you show the bartender your driver's license okay he wants to know that you're Twenty one years old but he's also seeing everything else that's on your driver's license and you really don't you don't need that information all he needs to know is that you're Twenty one and you've just been carded\nSo essentially what happens is is allows you to funnel the technology are funneled the information so that's just what you want when you want it and then it's verified it's almost as if he had seven driver licenses alright Eleanor and they all said the same thing at the same time [noise]\nSo what's the point like chicken balances\nThe point is is it's automatic the point is is that without you having to go in and mess around with it it happens on a network\nJust like the Internet happens on a network and you don't think about all of the computing power that's behind your Google Search but there is a ton that network brings a lot of power so this is really information power brought you buy a network\nSo do I have like do you sign up for what he had only\nCompanies would use it in their technology okay you're very very well may be using apps or something that use ... technology got in the background\nBut this basically I mean I'm assuming done the power of this it it becomes powerful when multiple entities are using this technology obviously if one person was using block chain it would be completely pointless and it it wouldn't do anything\nIt's a networking like ... we see it happening and farming that's my interest in it and what will happen is is at some point a farmer no matter where he or she is located who will be able to sell their goods and trade their goods kind of automatically on this network without having to worry about going to a bank for instance\nSure and that because the bank is essentially the check and balance system in this case but if you have a shared ledger between all these entities there's no need for a moderator\nRight and also it brings trust because you know the information is accurate that's another thing a bank does you trust the bank and you trust the vendors that you're already using yeah so this brings an accurate information and that brings trust with it\nSo how are you using this for your business you you mentioned that farmers are typically make only about eight cents on the dollar for food we eat ... so ... what's your company doing to improve\nThis while we work with farmers so we want to maximize the benefit to farmers and when a farmer sells grains for instance they may have to go through traders they have to go to the local grain elevator and their grades may wind up in somebody else's country we're talking about that earlier\nBut if they can deal with those people directly and there's a level of trust where you basically no you're going to get paid and the customer knows it's going to get shipped on time then it cuts out a lot of the lot of the people in the middle and the proper makes more money\nAnd you're essentially are you using block chained to keep track of that in mentor than\nWe are we're actually going to be creating a platform\nOh you're creating a platform right now right so this is this is what you're working on in collaboration with your other business or is this the whole business\nNow it's not my day job it's not your to your day job day jobs\nIs working with farmers in converting from ... organic\nAnd so this is why you're interested in it because you saw a possible need for this kind of technology brought into farming\nOh yeah it's huge and anything that helps farmers is good for Iowa it's good for us and everybody benefits\nSo darned if people want to learn more about your business and what you're up to how do they reach out to you or find your website\nIt's called ... which means farm manager in Latin so V. I. L. I. C. U. S. capital dot com Phyllis ... capital dot com\nAnd if someone wants to I mean if someone wants to go organic or you could get a call oh yeah and 'cause right now two percent of Iowa's farmland is in organic production that's grown and so that's a lot of cuss potential customers for you\nWell that and the farmers prosper I mean the farmers do very well financed they when they grow Ghana clay but it's a lot more work shirt\nSo again I give give it a Web site at one more time before we let you go sure\n... capital dot com\nDone with it with villages thank you very much for coming in today about farming but also trying to crack into this block chain thing it's confusing as heck and I really appreciate you giving us some insight\nIt's really just a bit of information backed up by more bits of information\n[noise] up next I have one question for you Adrian I wonder whether that's left next to Justin breeding Adrian Branstad a news radio ten forty W.

W. H. O.\n[noise]\nThe only way to go get them on and I arch radio station and on your age the radio ... to [noise]\nMorning doubled you wait Joe [noise]\nRight now today's top stories from Des Moines news propaganda severe weather see news radio ten forty do you have\nI don't know how you spend a hundred thousand dollars a day every single day we're not going to know probably who won the lottery because in South Carolina they let the winners remain anonymous so what could you do with the money well you could probably by the Tampa Bay rays baseball team that's worth about\nA nine hundred million but none of taxes you can only about half the team so no outfielders for you forget about the Yankees they're worth four billion dollars\nYou could um by half of the islands and the British Virgin islands because of the total GDP of the British Virgin islands as about nine hundred million dollars so here seriously what you ought to do if you win the lottery first number one\nTell nobody that you want not even your spouse I especially your spouse don't tell anyone as soon as you tell anyone everyone's going to know and that's really scary because\nNot only you're going to be bombarded by requests for money from family and friends but also\nWe'll strangers your safety is also at risk and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a second so when you win the lottery what you need to do is take that ticket and keep it somewhere safe like bank safe deposit box no not not under your mattress not somewhere and you know what's the group was my house no\nAntibiotics it's positive box do not signed the ticket not yet\nWhat I Want you to do is to photocopy it photocopy both sides and then put it in a safe deposit box then get a lawyer get in the state attorney someone who is expert and experienced in dealing with wealthy families because guess what you're not wealthy\nAnd left the lawyer tell you how you should sign the ticket should use on it and your name only should it be join with your spouse should you put it in a trust should you have an owned by an el ... limited liability company\nYou want to get legal advice tax advice financial advice you need a lawyer needed a CPA and you need a financial planner\nBecause if you don't handle this correctly you got to be aware of the studies that have been done on lottery winners there is a preponderance of bankruptcy we're not going to a lottery winner go bankrupt hey Michael Tyson had three hundred million dollars and ended up bankrupt\nPeople think it's a bottomless pit more okay one point six billion is pretty bottomless but it's not it's only four hundred and Ninety two million ... taxes in a lump sum\nIt's not a bottomless pit like you think it is and when you start going out a lot of money to family and friends in charities you'd be amazed how fast you can plug the cash so a lot of lottery winners end up bankrupt they end up divorced they end up with drug and alcohol abuse they end up with suicide\nThey lose their jobs are friends even their family and if you're going to say I'm going to keep going in my work every day like always know you're not you know why because every time you show up at work all of your co workers are gonna be resentful because they got to be there because they need the money and you don't and they know it and if you're going to go out to lunch and not treat everyone\nYou're going to be a pariah so if you think your life's not going to change Oh yes it absolutely well you're going to lose all your friends you're going to be ostracized with family if you don't give them enough money to satisfy what they believe\nIs how much money you want to give them\nSo in addition to having a lawyer and an accountant and a financial planner you need a personal security team as well the first thing you've got to do is get out of your house because everybody knows where you live he's always do Google your address not only strangers but crux\nMight come and do you harm they might come and challenge threaten your family members in order to uh extort from you blackmail you\nSo you need to go to an undisclosed location choose a sweet ... threats to be with me and have a security detail around your your life is going to change and what did you have never thought possible because you need personal security\nAnd when it comes to gifts to families and friends well let's think about this for a minute how much money you're going to give your mom you just method after tax four hundred and Ninety two million dollars unless you've given them a million bucks you cheap little ... come on you're going to give her\nTen million you just got Ninety two million dollars how much given your mom\nHow much you've given your dad how much you've given your brothers and sisters are much given your children your grandchildren let's say that you decide to give ten people ten million dollars a piece that is a hundred million dollars\nGuess what you didn't give away a hundred million dollars because when you give away a hundred million dollars you know my friend knock them you have to pay a gift tax guess how much the gift tax is\nForty percent which means if you give away a hundred million dollars you incur a forty million dollar gift tax now you've just spent a hundred and forty million dollars so of the four hundred and Ninety two that you did you just gave away a hundred and forty of it you're now down to three fifty we haven't even talked about charity\nLet alone Bentley's do you see my point in my friend you got to recognize that winning the lottery\nRequires a massive change and lifestyle\nMassive calculation and preparation and planning because your relationships are going to change with virtually every one you're not going to be able to trust anyone because they're all going to be wanting to know what you can do for them in whatever you do for them ain't going to be enough in their opinion\nLet me give me another reason why I didn't buy a lottery ticket instead of buying a lottery ticket if you were to say take the money you would have spent on three lottery tickets three dollars a day instead of buying the lottery every single day you take that three dollars and you invested into the S. and P. five hundred stock index and you do that for forty five years\nI'm On a bet you'll have more than a million dollars guess what you'll have won the lottery of course past performances ... future results any social the contras a federal ... supporters and therefore my friend now you know why [noise]\nI didn't buy a lottery ticket\nBecause as I often say to friends and family well okay not friends and family what I often say the enemies may you win the lottery because it's often the worst thing that can never happen to you and I mentioned all of this for one simple reason trying to make you feel better for not having one subject\nAren't you glad that you didn't win the lottery I thought so that's why I'm here to help you make you feel good and the reason I'm trying to make you feel good is because you probably have been noticing that not only did you not win the lottery on Tuesday you saw the stock market meltdown on Wednesday\nAnd you did notice that not only did you get rich you got a little\nPoorer because of the stock markets performance and we're going to talk about the stock market and what it

H. O. three day weather forecasts I'm channel Thirteen meteorologist make and sell\nOff [noise]\n[noise]\nWalking back to the elements show we invite you to send your questions by audio and that's exactly what George did here says question he sent to ask Rick ... dot com\nI read this is George from California\nMy in laws are both over eighty five years old and have an investment balance that likely could pay for a long term care\nFor those is needed my question is should they maintain any stock investments since they could earn over three percent in bonds and it is unlikely their life expectancy will expose them to significant inflation risk\nSo Rick what do you think thanks\nSo that's a great question George and a lot of folks faced this question in my older years I'm In my seventies eighties nineties I have far more money than I Will ever need to spend even find curb massive medical costs are long term care costs\nBetween pensions and Social Security and if money I've accumulated over my lifetime I have lots of cash and I'm not spending it because I live kind of frugally\nSo therefore we would argue traditional financial planning strategy would argue that you should place all of that money in very conservative investments you should put the money into bank accounts you should put the money into treasuries you should put the money into guaranteed\nInvestments that they might not pay much an interesting not only pay one or two or three percent puts so what\nYou don't need to earn high returns it's more important that you have protection of your money than that you try to double your money because doubling it isn't going to change your lifestyle but losing half of it could so traditionally we would argue don't take any more risk\nThan is necessary to achieve your goals\nBut let me turn that inside out and give you a different reason why you might want to consider\nA riskier investment strategy and their strategy that includes investing in stocks to some perhaps even significant degree\nLet's say that you've got a few million dollars saved\nAnd you're hardly touching it and you don't think you'll hardly ever touch any of it because you get plenty of income off of that money you've got plenty of income from pensions and Social Security you only spend a few thousand dollars a month your house is paid for your expenses are low\nAnd you've got this money now ordinarily I Would you know we would say like I said a moment ago\nPut the money into those call today but think about this when you\nDie who gets that money\nWilling to assume that you are going to leave that money to your surviving spouse and ultimately to your children and your grandchildren\nIn other words if you have a very high degree of confidence that this money will outlast view and will ultimately be transferred to your kids and grandkids you could argue\nThat that money really isn't yours it's bears and you are merely the steward of that money you're the custodian your the caretaker of that money\nAnd if you know that you're going to transfer that money to your children and grandchildren who will use it for their lifestyles and their personal financial needs\nAnd the achievement of their financial goals\nWell then maybe we should be investing the money with their goals in mind\nMeaning that if your son or daughter had the million dollars\nThey invested in stocks because they would have a long term time horizon and they would want to earn a return that net of taxes and inflation is growing and real economic terms therefore we could argue you should be investing the money not based on your age\nBut based on ... and if your kids are in their fifties or sixties if your grandkids are in their twenties or thirties then maybe you should invest in a portfolio allocation that mirrors them and not you\nKnow we want to make sure we're not doing so to the point that we are really placing you at financial risk or jeopardy\nBut I think we could strike a healthy balance between protecting you for your lifetime while also having an eye toward the legacy of protecting your children's financial futures\nAs well and on that basis we could in fact argue that you should have stocks in your portfolio to what the ... ten percent of the portfolio fifty percent of the portfolio somewhere in between the only way to know for sure is to meet with us all sit down with one of my colleagues here at the firm\nSo that we can examine the entire family dynamic look at what your true expenses are relative to the income available and the resources and design what that strategy might be taking into consideration\nThe circumstances with your children and grandchildren so don't automatically assume that the older you get you shouldn't have any money in stocks instead look at it as an intergenerational family dynamic because after all that's exactly\nWhat it is so George thanks so much for your question and if you
