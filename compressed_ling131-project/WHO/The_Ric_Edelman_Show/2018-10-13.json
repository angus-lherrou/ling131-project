with Haley equipment incorporated in Carol are incredibly today brings the halfway mark of the season for Iowa football\nIt really goes quick and then the next step will go faster amazingly though you know the first name takes forever to come around it and then once you get into urging they've become pretty quickly but the second half her surely goes faster\nDefensive line a defensive player of the week in the Big Ten Anthony and his three sex rally much the freshmen of the week with to fix a\nDefense continues to to provide a special moments where\nI think both those words are probably represent a of a you know with Anthony the guys up front really good a good job we gave player of the game to the whole group and uh you know he had he had a tremendous skin there's no question about that but the the whole group that are really good job out\nThere and then um same thing with Raul you know we've got some young guys playing in a you know for some of those guys when only their first road trip this year as their first road trip\nPeriod ah in college so [noise] uh you know he did a great job confusion out there we felt like Julius did the same thing on the other side and you know we've got some young guys doing some good things for us so that that really is important that's what's going to take for us to to have a successful here and certainly a you know when any of our Big Ten games\nSo Kirk with ocean Rudy in Hankins healthier [noise]\nThe makeup of your secondary this afternoon\nWe'll go ahead and start to same got started last week so uh you know Brent in in in a mosque are going to get to start but to all for the guys will play\nAnd you know part part of it is a both those guys did a good job they've been doing a good job really since August a obviously a lot to learn\nA starting on August but you know really if you look at the four four guys combined uh there aren't a lot of starts are coming into the season so it's a young group we knew that starting out and uh the good news is maybe a and it wasn't necessarily but by choice\nOr a week and a half ago but maybe the good news is well the chance to develop some depth and I'll come out of the group that to maybe ... can compete well there are the edge\nBoat it's encouraging to see the front of the ... plants are well because you you sure have a mix master of activity going on at linebacker a money certainly is out for the first half a who do you go with the district\nYou know you need a scorecard to keep track of what's going on here this year at linebacker but um for sure with the money out\nOh who's playing all by the way but um you know so he's a judge is going to be a um an demons out so we'll start with current and again on the outside position to the field uh in one that will go with the Welsh a personal being inside their position and then I'm John little play who will position again and\nGet the money back in the second half will help us if we have to dip into the freshman pool we got\nThe ... on a set Bentsen also\nYou know ready to go and um\nYou know we'll just kind of play by ear but I think I'm mixed in some some I'm a substitute package last week would you know stone and moving them on the up and I think that all those game once itself to that opportunity as well too so we'll we'll get mentioned things up and hopefully whoever's in her does a great job and that that's kind of been the the the more we\nWe all kinds of lines given up on the ... all year that that's the best to the west and the Big Ten and as an old old line guy that has to make you very proud given all the new faces and shifting that's going on there\nThat it's a it came to my attention last week somebody brought it up and so you know as you might imagine like a no hitter in the night that I just could not talk about it uh but the good news is I think that you know we just talked about some of the guys on the fence and I think it's worth it spread represent we're a little bit more veteran just overall offensively right now uh\nYou know alert did a nice job last year and a trust in worse than most of its ethical those guys were first year God's Plan and it showed at times uh they're they're not out of the woods yet but they're they're playing a lot better football now on a they've worked extremely hard\nAnd that whole group is not a good job really Keegan sealing us really experienced and they're so those guys are really worked hard and they're doing a good job and um\nI think it's kind of young you know you talk about the two tackles you can look at our receivers the same thing those guys are first year guys last year including neck who was you know a an older guy that first year with us so I just think that experience is really starting to pay off for a little bit who\nGoes to Indiana this up in a will remind you a lot of Minnesota's a fence except they have a much more mobile quarterback and paying Ramsey you\nKnow the the big difference to these guys will throw down the field made little house they'd be numerous times uh they're ... feet deep and other hit a couple of missed a couple but the point is they'll they'll take their shot just like Minnesota will\nOn your point of the biggest differences the quarterback will pull down and run so somebody or we don't keep contain though he's not afraid to support and go get the first down and uh he also can start run around back there and keep his eyes on the field and search it that way so\nHe's he's been a he's a cattle so I think of there are other often to the football team and they're they're good offensive team\nThey got a tale back to measure it a little bit of Jordan Howard is not there yet but a pure freshmen who is number two in the country and cherries only to Jonathan sailor\nDo these guys put up some impressive numbers\nHe's really done a good job and I guess he was hurt last year we put a couple of games but he's a big physical guy has got to bring down and uh you know they've got a really well conceived often he's a part of it certainly the quarterback for the next one player and then I'm impressed that the resumes I think you know they've spread it around a lot of guys with a lot of catch is\nNot surprising that Tom Allen the former defensive coordinator uh when he got here ah under Kevin Wilson uh they've been proved that defense from day one all over the map\nYou know they have and then we missed that he got her and sixteen we played them in Fifteen lunchtime out so it was a little a little bit of a learning process for us going through things and then they graduated some guys so they have a little different look this year but the bottom line is that they play with this person has a very energetic they play hard I'm In that that's been a little bit of a problem\nOr through the years here but I think they've done a really good job of making strides defensively\nYeah while Indiana's making strides defensively Ohio State put up six hundred and nine yards of offense last week a hundred and fifty five on the ground that's why I think the hawks get that running game going today just pounded stay with the consumer clock good a recipe to have on the road\nA Michigan State with a thirty five point effort here at uh Bloomington a couple of weeks ago so while the Indiana defense is improving they've got a ways to go yet her

weeks on the road Indiana return to their memorial stadium homecoming today with the guys who challenged Hoosiers role in Columbus last Saturday thrilled just twenty eight twenty an ass\nAnd thirty five twenty six at the end up three periods before running out of steam and losing to the high powered buckeyes forty nine twenty six Allen who's in his second full year at the helm he was proud of his team's effort\nDisappointing and the fact that we didn't finish some key opportunities we had there late in the third early in the fourth and and that but as you said we're right there with them and our kids or you know we're very tough physical and and I thought we'd get some good things on both sides of the ball you know so you can build off those positives and and and play in that environment very young football team\nAnd so I was really really excited for what they showed they can become and then you've got to be able to to teach off the mistakes that we made the critical areas we made a critical times and\nAnd the execution of the authors and defense and the one one special teams opportunity as well so ... for a team or just ready to keep building keep growing and get keep getting better\nI Know you were excited about titan Ramsey and the recruiting process and he certainly has disappointed sixty seven percent completion percentage spread the ball around but what is it that we don't see about him that you love about this kid\nWhereas preparation you know it just so consistent you know and just as an amazing job off the field the players believe in him and his as mental toughness and the weight room and his great and fight\nA extremely hard worker I'm extremely physically tough kid I'm away from the football field as he prepares and and uh you all the things to do with our guys tend to get them developed he's writing at the ... you know and what you would expect from your leader and\nA guy that uh is is really grown on the field as well this season so I'm really excited about um what he what he brings for us and and the way to ease is destabilizing force for our team\nWhat I like another element that you've introduced this year as freshmen Stevie Scott you're bruising a running back not only is he a terrific runner but he's a heck of a pass a receiver too and I know you're gonna use it more in that area going forward but this has been quite a find at this point out a shirt to show them what is it you liked about him or so about him\nBut there's no question he's been huge you know what I loved about him out of high school was his versatility nobody recruiting as the guy that\nThat when you're going to be a line backer or a running back we really weren't sure he played both in and thought he had a Big Ten running back body and that's something we were looking for needed on this team and so a ... and I didn't ... that doesn't work out we're going to move into line backer and he he was okay with that I just wanted to get on the field so\nThat I think his heart was running back and that's where we started to him and\nYou know obviously got opportunities early in the season with some with an injury in a situation that you're crazy that ah opening for him on our office and he never looked back so um he has trends patients' vision as a runner and as you said he catches the ball well\nOut of the bacteria which is something that we we like to do also so I'm very versatile guy can pass throw as well as always hard for young guys to pick out but he's really developed into a find player\nCoach I Know you're an old defensive coordinator and you've worked hard to improve the Indiana defense or how has it gotten better this year and we are the areas you continue to work on\nBy David biggest area that we're addressing was our death you know we just a year ago we play really well a lot of the time but we get more daylight and games late in the season of painting the guy too many ... so they try to address that recruiting and then player development and play more guys early in the season so we really tried to stick with that\nUm I run the fences improved um it has done a good job defending the past did not do the job we needed to get his Ohio State\nI'm just play a lot of young guys especially on defense so got to continue to grow in maturity ability to communicate and ability to execute it critical times when which can be a challenge when you're playing young guys so are we just gotta keep growing and and and build on that side of the ball 'cause if you gotta you know you want to have a chance when big games you've got ...\nWell they're all big on the Big Ten is you know coach or give us your snapshot your your thoughts on uh on Iowa here today\nYeah just really impressed I've watched them throughout the entire season and all their games and\nAnd just do the balance a day had that run the football or shouldn't be counted quarterback Stanley just big arm has can make all the froze I Love Italian man and just being physical receivers as well as they lock that great after they got receiving around the perimeter good enough to\nTo get to take advantage of famous he gave it to them and and that big alters across the line you know and then I tell you as these guys you mentioned that I really love what they do on the side of the ball is big and physical and fundamentally sound and\nRun to the football as rank top five in the country and defense is is pretty special so that's going to create a big challenge for our team you know both sides and then there's there's solid on special teams and making plays last week in that area so I'm just a I just see a very disciplined well rounded football team that's going to be very difficult to beat but that's what we got a new\nWay Indiana coach Tom Allen is Hoosiers have a solid group of receivers and running backs quarterback Peyton Ramsey with all five starters from a year ago back on that officer line of defense will be
