football you don't see that often just because those are yeah that is it are they really that they're very few kids who who can do that with accuracy um but they ended up forcing overtime\nAppellate goes down and scores a touchdown the extra point ...\nThen scores the touchdown decides to go for the two point conversion\nFor the win and what they ended up doing was I don't know if you saw this last years I'm a Super Bowl but they call it the Phillies special and what it is is it's actually a snap and they threw out to the quarterback\nOr ... what it was the same kind of a play but it was so far the the the person who was throwing the ball got hit and the person who is attempting to catch it fell down or early all the ... players have their hands up there all celebrating\nAnd it was a little bit premature as the ... player from his his back\nWas able to outstretched hand and catch it you know what really helped in this situation\nCall Henry is six foot nine [laughter] anybody yell span is when I was I thought it was when\nThey did they one thirty six thirty five and on a play where both sides it was ... was thinking they just lost because they saw were that ball ended up Bella was saying they just won the officials conferred to point conversion oh\nThere's nothing ... that makes people more ... than thinking un yeah being taken away it's worse than losing\nI yell at people in my volleyball team so much when they think we think we've got the point and I'm like no\n\nThere isn't a YouTube clip that YouTube channel of like don't celebrate too early in his shows like a

Scott thanks for calling fire away with your question\nSo I worked at the company for Twenty years up for one still was a it it's through fidelity and it's about four hundred thousand dollars and a lot of that is tied up in that particular comedy stock\nI Would like to bring that from Fidel on my current uh but somebody mentioned something about the ... comedy because it's the stock and movie that I don't quite understand that\nScott there should not be a penalty but you probably won't be able to transfer the stock from your old employer to your new employer\nSo I don't want to have this years I'd like to sell off this year okay pretty good price right now so I Would like to take the lump sum up but I'm not sure so first of all there's no penalty then what would you suggest I go to what the water thousand\nSo let's talk location first you can sell the stock picked up four hundred grand from the old plan then move it to the new four one K. or you could move that money into something called a roll over IRA with both of those you know we're just dealing with account type\nNow regarding asset allocation\nAnd that's just the investments that you're going to buy with the money right stocks bonds cash within the roll over IRA you openness on an open platform Schwab\nAnd you know theoretically the sky's the limit thousands of stocks bonds mutual funds E. T. S. all at your disposal but if you move the money into your new for all and K plan\nYou'll likely see a much more limited selection of funds or institutional holdings\nThe thing is some plans give you access to a lot\nBut others you only see a handful of investment options\nGreat thank you so much man have a good weekend you till\nWhen you think about it you know folks who change jobs pretty often it's so easy to lose track of old for a one k.'s and I'm guessing that there is a pretty good number of Americans that have for one case that are not being a tend to\nHave slowly it's a common situation and it could end up being a huge issue for investors down the road if you can relate if you could use some help simplifying consolidating investing your savings get over to investing sense dot com start talking with our local team so let's go back\nTo Scott's situation and talk about holding a large position in a stock of the company that you worked for within a four one K. to scare us through those considerations\nWhen my clients hold large positions in their employer stock\nIt's usually a pretty emotional situation yes it's normal yes it's a human reaction but I see this attachment to the stock like I Do not see with any other holding\nThese emotions can sometimes make it kind of difficult to objectively analyzed the risk and the risk has to do with holding a highly concentrated position in one lone stock or even more and written really importantly you've got to take into account where you are in life\nDo you really want to risk most of your retirement ... on the performance an outcome the success or failure of one lone investment there's a just a huge risk here in these situations\nWell and I can hear some people asking well wait a second the risk and holding a concentrated position in stock and go both ways there's the potential for a high reward or return on it just like you mentioned there's also the potential for big big risk\nOh yeah and you know here's two examples let's say you work for Apple you hold a large position in a P L in your four one K. it's done great over the last few years and you've been rewarded for taking that risk\nBut now considered to former American blue chip stocks that General Electric and Sears won a famous industrial giants or the other one of the most\nIconic retail brands in this country if you worked at either of these companies and all you owned was concentrated position in that company stock\nThe risk is that you would not have been able to retire because of all you own was GE or S H O D you probably would have lost a ton of money in your four one\nK. and by the way the broader stock market has been in a bull market for more than nine years and that means an index fund would have been a much better place than either of these two stocks over that same period of time\nOr lighting your money on fire would have been a much better for you know kind of outcome you know worst case scenario is that your stock goes to zero\nAnd even though this doesn't happen very often it can happen I mean remember names like women or WorldCom Enron these companies had employees who held lots of company stock and for one case they loved it when the stock went up but what do you think happened\nWhen it didn't yeah it just went down to zero zero\nOkay and the only defense against this company specific risk is diversification and we build this into all of our clients personalized plans if you could use some help get some help get over to investing sense dot com and and start talking with our local team well\nThat brings us to this week's portfolio review and a quick reminder please consult with an advisor before acting on anything that we discuss and you can find a local advisor in your area by going to investing sense dot com now in future shows if you would like to have Andy review your portfolio here during the show\nAsk Andy at investing sense dot com is the email right portfolio review in the subject line but it's pretty easy ask\nAndy at investing sense dot com so Jackie\nSet us her portfolio last week and she writes I question regarding bond funds and CDs\nWhich is better at this point bond funds seemed destined to lose value in a rising interest rate environment individual bonds pay the state of interest rate is held to a majority but Kerry default risk CDs pay the stated rate it held the maturity and or FDIC insured\nSo this is where the conversation started with Jackie but I wanted to dig a little bit deeper so I ask more about the overall situation\nBecause look planning an income stream and retirement is difficult enough to begin with but now you've got rates where they are where they could be later on the market and the environment or going to get even more difficult and Bob you have you have Jackie's reply\nDo she wrote back I'm retired sixty seven have a pension and drawing Social Security my spouse is also retired and draws Social Security combined we have about a hundred thousand dollars in annual income from those sources and saving a portion so we don't eat into our savings", "show_name": "The Ric Edelman Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Des
