decade of my close\nWe've been doing it for nine ... isn't that hard to believe staged a few years yeah\nNo it's great you guys came up with this three point play All right which is a unique partnership with the University of Iowa and that's not fans in their driveway shooting at three pointer that's like a three point boy and basketball and all kinds of things explain how it works and where the money goes\nAbsolutely so the Walmart three point plays all about eating right moving more feeling better pretty simple right keys to better health\nBut we partner with the guys that means that we're sponsoring every field goal throughout the football season and then every three pointer throughout the men's and women's basketball season\nSo essentially make a journal contribution forever successful field goal in three pointer and that goes into kind of a charitable bank and then we actually asked fans we need hockey fans to participate and it'll be the nominee that community to receive those funds seasons and\nAnd then what will do with those funds is is really invest in the health infrastructure project that can be a park playground trail cool so so far we supported over a nine projects really throughout the state a courtesy of Well Mark in the hot guy so it's been an an absolute when when partnership\nSo I'm driving down the street and I see some kids actually not staring into a screen and playing at the park and throwing a ball around that's ...\nThat's the whole idea yeah so we really think success on the field kind of be get success in the community so that's the design of the of the partnership and and like I said it's been a win win been great for for both ...\nAnd you mentioned we've been doing this for nine years now how much cash in the till\nSo that's that's really the the the point and that's what's incredible to uh to come here to talk about solar over nine seasons we've already raised a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars but we reinvest it back into the community courtesy of well marketing hawks\nAnd that's including twelve thousand dollars last season alone so you can see an aggregate or or the or the span of a partnership that impact has been pretty tremendous and we're works out to talk about\nIt's amazing you mentioned the hundred and twenty five thousand dollars because my daughter just got engaged and I'm thinking that's what the wedding\nIt's gonna cost me about that yeah you're probably right that the going rate is right but let's put that in a park or a playground something a little more well
