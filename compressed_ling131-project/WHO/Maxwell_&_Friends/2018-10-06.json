piece of art for their style space in budget um we do that a lot of different ways\nIt's sometimes I go into people's homes help them find I work with corporations I Do murals around ... in central Iowa\nUm and when I say I do these things I'm commissioning these things so I'm I'm working with the client to find the perfect piece of art is connecting them with the artist doing everything from a to Z\nAnd and then we do a lot of freelance saying we have become our company has grown because of where we are here in Des Moines\nSo we have a lot of opportunities first there were a lot of great blank walls and so we wanted to be able to bring your old to Des Moines and the community really got excited about it and he just did those dancers around the duty answer so we've we've done\nUm a lot of permanent murals and then no wonder what does this dancer thing I mean it's really cute if her explain it so the artist is ... and she took\nPhotos of ballet Des Moines professional dancers and then we plastered them dancing around the streets on buildings around downtown Des Moines really yeah and so but we did it with paper\nAnd basically glued them to the walls like Oh yes and Sony oh yeah so they will like slowly deteriorate some of them have started to already so that's a ... a temporary\nIt's like kind of like a ... style almost ... uh-huh oh you're at it at wrong now that's

people think they've figured out who it is yeah this isn't a lot of speculation but no one actually knows who banks he is he's a UK English she was and he does this uh graffiti art right\nBut it's like acceptable for some reason because he's Banksy\nRight because he has made a name for himself right buildings become more just expensive any valuable because banks he's on them\nPeople wanting
