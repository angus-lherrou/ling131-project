Jeff when I go to when I go to seminars and I got kids coming up to me the ten or twelve years old and they're saying and I had a really nice deer come by the other day was a hundred and fifty inches and he just wasn't big enough I think the wrong message has been sent and [noise]\nYou know I Know people that go their whole lives and never see a hundred and fifty inch dear\nSo you know it's a hunting is about the experience it's you know it's it's about\nUh you know put me in the freezer for your family and you know if you want to you know there's nothing wrong with shooting just does and you know waiting for a a big mature Bach but I'm I'm never we need we don't need to look or nose down at someone who uh shoot something they got I'm excited is what I'm saying\nYeah absolutely I mean let my dad as though it is by the box is about\nIs um is is celebrated everyone you know he's ... used to be attacked with their lists if but if you found it at our base that he always does the last\nFirst one it's like the little little like a five point but it's almost like a bike and like that my favorite one in that but I mean that that together and\nWe remember right where it came from the right way and then there was just I I'm like yeah I just think that there's um there's still a for what we've been given to be able to steward at while I'm In a manager at while and not be\nSo high on the trophy and now you know if you're you have a lot of bigger box and then wait for the one you want a ... and I but I yeah I think\nJust the salad ethical view and also um every person you know the it's the honor to be able to hunt in the ... in the harbor with a ... year round and my wife and I and\nI'm like yeah we um we better than for probably Ninety nine percent of our ... year round and I'm enjoying that aspect of it\nYeah well and you know like I said you know is is that there are folks out there and you know if it you know there's there's nothing wrong with that if they if they want to wait on a\nOn a a mature deer and God Bless you and I have no problem with that I like I said I I think you know like every ... individual hunters and whatever gets you excited as what you what you should focus on so\nI I you know I got I'm after this one nine pointer and I'm going to give it another ten to Fifteen days and if I don't see him again\nThen first a good opportunity I get on a dear I'm going to take it so you know so it just there's certain deer that just get me going and then there's you know like I had a little spike come by yesterday and he walked right by me five yards and it's like a ... I had you see you later [laughter]\nYou know I mean you can fool their nose that's already a success as it is\nBut I I I liked I liked the fact that you guys are police in a you know the site and making sure that good positive things are sent because I see some stuff on Facebook sometimes it's like really you know ... why why why was that even is there to say that\nSo yeah so congratulations and yeah they you\nKnow it is important because I mean a couple of years ago um I had a young man who shot his first turkey what a ball and to take a turkey would oppose an accomplishment anyway\nUm and he shot to Jake and he went to the local um I'm not going to say the place he went to but it was a local gas station and some friends of him that were grabbing some lunch and I'm One of the guys that came out he was shown is turkey in this the other guy came out and he just what'd you shoot out for it to Jake\nAnd that kid said what did I did I Do something wrong here and I'll never forget that email\nAnd a ... and that that next spring we did a contest or you know for a you know for less you know if you shoot a Jake you can enter and it just you know anybody that does that to somebody is is is a ... you know ... there's just no reason for it so\n... what we really enjoy our community and celebrate the outdoors and celebrate you know people are doing and then that are\nOut there to the heart of it\nWell I I Love your app I ah I've been using it for a I I liked the way that you can set you I said all my stands on my blind\nAnd on the on the land that I'm a hunting out and then I could I ... the map section I can actually blow that up and I'm seeing some pinch points and stuff that I didn't see before which is kinda cool are just so thank you for that\nBut then yeah then you can hit the hunt cast\nAnd it gives you when you set up a your pen for your standard you're blind location you put in there the desired when directions that you think are the kind of be the best and then when you hit that hunk cast it actually formulates like you said what that ... that she got on there are the best time of the hunt or the best times to hunt and the best in\nA forest selection and you can even change the time\nFrom whatever time frame that you're hunting I I there's a lot of different things you can do on your that's really neat you guys really put a lot of thought into this\nYeah you know we uh we're a bunch of deer hunters that are are they in fact it's so hopefully I'm Glad it it relates to use the technology that the the um we just you know being a hunter I just wanted something that was was if they use their hunch\nOr just a real confidence that uh no it's not rocket science and a lot of people think like oh there's so many variables and tracking that than that I'm just going to go out when I have time and I totally understand that a lot of time that light mentality as well mhm but the algorithm is a\nIt's not I'm a you know magic thing that we just have all these things going together and is that your number\nIt's taking basic weather pattern that are familiar to hundreds if not um you know when the pressure is moving when the wind up in a certain range um\nYou know the time of year things that are ordered and you know I feel that animals and you know in in order to universe they they move on to order time than have different times that they do there than they respond to weather patterns in a certain way\nAnd so it's not that black box it's just okay here's here's the really good thoughts on experts throughout the years of what they've done a track your movement but we're just going to do it under the hood that you apply to stand 'em and then hit the button\nAnd then they'll say hey Thursday at ... pm that when all these things aligned them both um and we have\nWidow prime as you're going to the um you know\n[laughter] and it's still hot and I mean there's you can't make your do what you're going to do but\nYou know I Would like just like you know picking a stand like I got one here that's mark my rich stand and then you can go on there and you can compare compare your other stand sets with the wind and you just you know you hit compare a compare compare when\nAnd it gives you a ranking of what stands sets with a you know the wind directions you put in\nThat are going to be I mean I I think that's just a neat tool I are and then you pick the date that you're going in the time and\nIt actually rotates and gives you rank one two or three or four or which ones you set and you know you still got to get lucky but yeah I mean just it's a great little tool\nYeah thank you yeah I feel like I'm like one of the things that is most valuable to others though if we can get the planning things that take last time and put you in the right spot or help you at least um you know then your time\nCan be more valuable and hopefully a better chance the fifth or something\nYeah well and for somebody that's new to hunting and there was still learning I mean one direction I mean that's so important and I don't care if you know you know we always talk about sent a\nSin elimination regimens there on the show with lethal products and you know you wash your clothes you take a shower before you go you send free deodorant new spray down and\nBut you know the ... doing all that even using the nose on a lower his own unit there unless you're in a hazmat suit you're not going to cover a hundred percent ... percent so you so you still need to pay attention to the wind direction and uh you know those little tools right there that could really help somebody that's for you know new to hunting and\nI'm In you know for someone that's been hunting for Thirty years like I said I found some pinch points that I didn't

H. will radio studios\nIn thanks Justin ...\nSo what did you when you won some like tech start up entrepreneur thing\nYeah it was a a a a pitch competition at the Cedar Rapids innovation expo um and uh there wasn't much behind that we had a lot of good a lot of good connections that came out of it um and a lot of uh a lot of good conversations with people all over the edge canoe community all over\nThe state so what are you making so we're making a wood based organic agriculture solution so it's a pretty diverse solution\nA what a good deal so our first to market product with it will be a ... stimulus so it's it's basically fertilizer over your partner it with other fertilizers 'cause you need to use less of the fertilizer using because our product makes it work better now is this like it's it's ... vinegar\n... pressing would political somehow in something with vinegar squirts out like what is this stuff from a really\nLike talk to me is if I'm by myself asking vinegar squirts out when you press would I don't know [laughter]\nGoing on I have a lot we have a thank you [laughter] know I\nI have no idea what's going on so yeah me neither like thirty five year old person named Justin Brady who acts like a six year old\n... so the technology behind it actually dates to ancient human kind it's a byproduct of\nCharcoal production it's uh we're doing a little more sophisticated now but basically you take 'em would waste and you heat it under pressure in I'm In a container devoid of oxygen and it breaks down into its component\nParts you end up with a solid liquid in a gas so the liquid part of that as would vinegar see they'll call you all the organic compounds of blood in liquid form\n[noise] see ... I'm Sorry so what do you think to do this like where where did you come up with this\nSo I'm I didn't come up with it I I I came into the scene to try to bring this to market the founder I'm Marty ... Bali or was doing this work in Iran or around charcoal production and realized this byproduct um\nWas more beneficial than the charcoal he was producing some kind of an accident kind of an accident and they started looking into it more and realized that it um it's commonly used in a lot of Asian countries I'm most notably Japan it's got a history dating back to the Nineteen thirties in Japan\nAnd has used from everything from cosmetics to agriculture in Japan\nInteresting so what did the\nPractical uses for the 'cause this is a an egg thing but I mean it it can be used elsewhere as you indicated but what are the primary uses for like Iowa farmers were obviously act people here that gets us excited so what what do they use it for what is it practically good for\nYeah so in um in low concentrations ... diluted with say five hundred parts of water to one part with vinegar it's really useful as the ... stimulus so that's why I talked about earlier that's in hand seen the growth characteristics of the plant so higher yield higher grow faster\nGrowth what is this like on tomato plants at my house\nYeah yeah so we've actually tested on the tomato plant that's one of the pilots who tested on so there's um there's quite a bit of International Research done in a variety of specific plans but we're working with the Iowa State validated for other specific applications\nIt's probably going to be most useful for um organic fruit and vegetable farmers in the state but eventually corn and soybean farmers\nAre you just spray it on them or do you mix it into the soil or that that is part of a fertilizer he just goes in the ... how how do you apply it so you do um\nYou actually do both so um it's best if you apply high concentration to the soil earlier and lower concentrations after you planted in the sea and the plant starts to grow\nCan you use this for more than just plants can you use it for anything else\nYeah so um so it's interesting you bring that up it's got some because of its characteristics that has some interesting non agricultural applications that we're exploring um an example of this is actually a\nFDA approved for use as a food additive to add a smoky flavor to food because if you if you smell would vinegar it's basically a liquid smoke oh I'm so it's a and like I said it's a hundred percent organic and totally safe so that's one of the areas that I'm a little peculiar that actually already approved to be used in\nNow I have a black thumb is if like if I'm On my plants when it's approved and I going to look like you know better homes and gardens was at my house that's a plan [laughter]\n\nPlease give it to her right um yeah I'm going to need to be one of your ad has people you were you were mentioning something about hogs too you can mix it into ... hog manure or how does this work\nYeah so there's then um there's been again some some university studies that have shown that when it's used as a food additive to um to hog production it reduces the um the hydrogen sulfide and missing admissions which is that rotten egg smell\nRight in the newer no one only dogs that you feed the wood vinegar to add up to their food you just added to their food\nAnd it cuts down on that smell we all smelled that yeah and you know that's not exactly pleasant\nYet hilarious like I did they know that was going to happen or they just by the time and that guy actually this is a perk [laughter]\nYeah so it's actually it's it's primary uses it helps the hogs health that helps their um their bacterial process season there got 'em so it makes them healthier but this added benefit is is making the the new or I'm not admit those rotten egg\nSmell it's almost like being for hogs you know what I mean they are that stay on the market still felt in that I Would even more funny um that's great\nThat's really funny um so what does this I'm thinking about like waste wood is this a good also a good solution for all these waste wood particles\nYeah so it's um it's our our business models interesting because we actually tried to solve a solution on both ends of the production process so our input is would waste which can solve problems I'm In a good example in Iowa is the emerald ash\nBorer infestation ... yeah in the same thing that's produced in a lot of wood waste in the state and there's really no nothing to do with it other than to burn it or to dump it in ... I never thought about what happened to the trees so\nInto going to make vinegar on I Am now\nIs that what you're saying we're going to solve the pig farting problem oh my God it's everywhere when when we were everyone in Iowa thank you emerald [laughter] build on ... how do people find out more about this website people can go to\nYeah yeah WWW dot ... dot com and if you're interested we are are taking pre orders\nNow oh world for the with vinegar product we're hoping to bring it to market um early twenty Nineteen and what can sign up in pre order on the Web site\nIn what former you offering the pre orders a like a spray bottle or like a solution basically in a jug or something\nYeah yeah we sell it in in will sell it been multiple sizes so every joke and one gallon two uh two hundred and Seventy five gallon containers\nThere you go Adrian there's your answer any that\nBuild them very well thank you very much for coming in here absolutely fascinating yeah really it's really interesting yes thanks pleasure up next we're going to Paul Pate I Believe him so he calling into the wall in it even if some voting advice he is he's got to tell us what's going on awesome that's next to a news radio ten forty W.
