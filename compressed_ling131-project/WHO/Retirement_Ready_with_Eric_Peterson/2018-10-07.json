I Know and I'm like what is wrong with that that's more than more for me [laughter] the data independently of your apples it was delicious\n... knew he tells near lunchtime 'cause I'm like\nWell yeah I had around ... [laughter] usually do [laughter] yeah what are you cooking with these days fresh out of the garden or do we have been uh getting back into the salad so what they're ...\nThey're finally starting radishes you know I'm not that big students bicycling no not not too much uh ours are Easter egg and French breakfast\nI thought the fridge breakfast is by the way it can be sometimes the ones that we've always had have just not you know maybe an old lady mild and I know well this milk spicy I feel I Can't handle space [laughter] those by making it but my\nI usually have like my quota for the year of a radish is like one radish [laughter] I'm not a big ... for the next so I Am just like them up on a salad that I mean I'll I'll eat them if they're on a salad I won't go to great lengths to put them on a salad I own\nI mean over in France they have radish sandwiches oh I'm just still not\nYou're not there yet I'm just not they're not ... not ... you know with the radical [laughter] I like to grow them because it's like they're done in thirty days and they're really beautiful and a bunch and they do really well they do other people have\nSomebody like me everybody oh the these these fresh carrots and radishes look beautiful and they're tied up in the little bunch and they're so cute and then they sitting in the vegetable drawer for about six months\nAnd then you can finally tell that you think you knew what they were based on what they look like okay so I have to ask you about a year ago we talked about ... yeah and you had never had one ... have you had when I Know what\nWe're getting back into root vegetables the that that is your homework try person that I'm actually allergic to care it in some other vegetables so I have to be even though I like to grow vegetables just keep your ... nearby\nYeah no maybe not that's okay so fine All right you get a pat I get a pass on the person that it's worth trying though it may mean yes they are related so yeah I probably would react to\nWell you know a couple of years ago I started having some reactions going little itchy on some things went in for an allergy test yeah turns out I'm allergic to tomatoes not giving up a lot of tomatoes peas cucumbers cabbage or\nRaspberries egg yolk and soy okay\nAnd I'm thinking like I like to grow all those things so that um how do you deal you just\nDeal I Do so I Love tomatoes and not getting those up I just say do they mail they just make you did to Mickey Mouse it you don't get I get an interesting so I'm fine with that even when I plant them I'm I'm wearing gloves and I'm wearing gloves harvesting on Monday and all of all of that and um\nOh that reminds me speaking of wearing gloves when you're planting something I just remembered those who are planting highest since bulbs remember to wear gloves yeah because they will make you a gee that's a great tip I they do have heard that the hard way yet that mail order catalogue I worked for they were giving away giant bins of of ... that didn't sell and um I like dove in\nWith just the T shirt on and within minutes I was I had to go home it was it was awful cringing what happens we dumpster die for bulbs [laughter]\nI have to pay the piper [laughter] they will make it as like crazy they will only one I Know\nThat has that yes so before more and you know eggplant makes my mouth edge mhm and that we're that that ... I think it's something about the ... vegetables that do that which is tomato plant um peppers a potatoes I don't yeah sweet potatoes I think are\nBullied him anyway [laughter] while we will be back next week to talk more gardening with you on gardening today I think too I'm Melissa for being here thanks to all of our listeners are colors and textures as well make so much for a running the program\nAnd ah we'll see you next week [noise]\nWe do go on and I arch radio station and on your age the radio TV are being\nMorning doubled you wait Joe [noise]\nKnow today's top stories from Des Moines news propaganda severe weather station news radio and forty do hold you\nWith your radio news on for over ... the one weekend continues in Iowa it'll be cloudy to do with some drizzle and scattered\nI'll tell you what I liked the idea of that mowing the grass while listening to some tunes I'm just picture in that scene and Forrest Gump where he finds out he's invested in apple doesn't have to worry anymore and he said\nYou know what a mode that grass for free [laughter] yeah exactly [laughter] great place to find yourself in so there are some opportunities here to be aware of that we've talking about a severance package now let's talk about this idea\nOf pension buyout right you can get a lump sum or you can keep the pension and take the monthly lifetime payout what's the better option there\nAgain in markets can be it really depends and so there's a lot of things get entered into that equation first thing that you really need to look at is\nYou know your health your life expectancy because\nThe one thing is with the pension it's it's you betting that you're going to live a long time as a company that you're not okay those kind of strange that the company is hoping that you know you accept the pension payout men you know next month you or you have an unfortunate event and you you cease to exist because why they'll pay you anymore\nSo if you have a family history of maybe people dying sooner rather than longer or maybe you have some elements that you think are going to shorten your life span\nIt may prove that taking the lump sum may be a better option because you get to control that money if something happens to you prematurely there's money can be left over to your family could impact them significantly\nIs however on the other hand you do have a long life expectancy you have a family history of people living long time maybe have you know aunts and uncles that are made it to a hundred maybe your parents were the nineties things like that\nThe payment of the pension on a monthly basis for the rest of your life may prove to be more beneficial to you so if you try to examine it by saying hey I can take this pension money in and go and replicate that off the shelf which means I can purchase a product that could guarantee me income for the rest of my life and\nSee if it can give me more than the ... gave me at today's those interest rates is probably not going to happen you're ... to replicate the hail function that that pension is giving is going to give you a lot more than what you could replicate up on the\n... off the shelf or when the existing product however comes I'll sit down to the position of control you know can you get something that is similar that meets your income nice but still have control over the money\nBecause people don't like Mark is on a pension is like shoes that pension option unless I just choose a straight life option and something unexpectedly happens to me it stops nothing goes to my spouse that goes to my family I chose that single straight\nOption but if I had it outside of the pension and something happened is Jimmy there may be residual money that could impact my family and so really what you want to do is\nSee what options are out there see what kind of an income gap that you have how much of your money do you need to fill in maybe taking the lump sum my proved to be more beneficial option you just have to run the numbers and see\nWell you were listening to retirement ready with ... Peterson president and founder of Peterson financial group reach out to the team calling five one five to six one finds zero zero five one five two to six one five zero zero we're talking about the idea of a forced retirement\nThat's being of course forced into retirement or the earlier than you planned and while that's kind of a difficult time or can be there's also some opportunities involved but you need to\nKnow what to ask and you need to know how to take advantage of this situation if you find yourself in air could question that folks often ask is should find another job right so you've been forced that one should find another job or just retired earlier start mowing the grass is you talked about earlier\nWell I think what it is or maybe you want to find something else to do maybe you don't have to go and find a mother full time job similar to what you're doing before\nYou know we have enough saved or have enough income coming in and to paint on your expenses that's why us all comes down to it depends on your current financial situation but this opportunity may present a time for you now to make this transition and maybe do something else\nThe thing that people forget is when you reach retirement and you stop working full time is the amount of time but now you have on your hands yes about Fifteen hundred dollars that we spend some people a lot more than that you spend working\nAnd so now you have that time to do whatever you want to do and some people feel connected to community or\nSome people feel connected to people and they just want to be around people or do something else do something this may be creative and constructive those types of things some people just want to hey I just want to chill I just want to play golf or\nYou know sit on the porch or read the paper and have my cup of coffee ... in the morning and that's great to there's no right or wrong answer but if you go through an exercise determine if you want and need to work and then how much you need to make it work\nTo make your plan successful maybe only to work to make you know a thousand bucks a month and maybe you can do that working three days a week maybe a four day weekend every weekend that's pretty nice\nAnd made by the time that fourth day is over of leisurely activities maybe you're ready to go back to some of the little stressed that are working gives you you know the deadlines or you know meeting expectations that kind of stuff so I really have to go through planned like you said every every sometimes crisis or thing that's thrown your way can present an opportunity to do something else\nAnd sometimes it's a a a blessing in disguise\nYeah I think it's really it really all comes down to running the numbers who actually have a family friend who said he wanted to retire but he found out that the state was going to put a highway right through some family land leaving him about ten million dollars isn't that a\nLucky windfall but he said you know what I still want to work and so what are you actually does is he loves golf and so he works at a golf course\nAnd he's the cart guy and then in his free time he gets free around the golf and so he can\nHe's able to do something that he loves and actually monetize that so you might find that maybe you won't get the same level of income you had at your own job but maybe you don't need it it really all just comes down to running the numbers now Eric if you decide that you do need to go back to work\nWhat about the idea of just being too old and I say that I don't I don't mean that a negative way but I Know that we have to ask the question well I have trouble getting a job at this age and maybe you can find what at this age really means anyway\nWell it's probably a you know if you're in this environment you're probably over fifty but there's some kind of a severance package being offered to you or you know being downsized or right size they call it you know to be politically correct\nYou'd probably find yourself that you're over fifty than it used to be a few years ago it was tough in fact people over forty actually protected from discrimination in the workplace you know you are protected class once you reach over forty but the interesting thing is employers would rather hire people that are older now\nIt's because of their work ethic\nYou know as opposed to hiring or people that are of a millennial age or even younger than that and so a lot of times the employer will see somebody that's more season to say you know I Want that person 'cause I Know that they spend a whole lifetime of showing up at a certain time of day you know and doing their job and being held accountable and\nThose kinds of things so I don't think it's hard to find a job at all in fact people that are in our office a prospective clients and clients to him out of work part time they have no no problem finding a a part time job now is if you wanted a full time job at the same level that you're right before\nThat maybe a little more challenging the part time work is not a problem at all and really find out what is that you really need and that's what a full plan can do Marcus what it's a wonderful people come in and meet with us is they can see this you know on this fifty five inch television that we have we take them through this retirement planning software and\nIt's really eye opening to them to see hey I only need to work a little bit to make my plan work right to work at all\nYou know there's always based on really what you're spending and that's what really drives the plan\nAnd a lot of people don't know what they're spending so when they go through a process is kind of ... to them so that sounds good to you if you're out there thinking hey you know I don't know if I'm gonna be able to retire never ran the numbers I just keep throwing money at my four oh one K. and I are re I really don't know how it all works together I called this financial stuff I don't know how it pulls together\nThen you really want to come and meet with us you know pick up the phone and give us a call at five one five to six Fifteen hundred ever get to take

implications on your retirement plan healthcare reform estate taxes all you have to do to get all that information tax the word retirement to five one five to one to two six seven six that's five one five\nTo one to two six seven six\nAll right Eric in this segment I Want you to kind of tell us the story All right there are a lot of emotions that can affect you as you're planning for retirement as you're in retirement and just anytime you go to\nDealing with your finances so I Want you to tell us a few stories that illustrate each of these emotions I'm about to lay out maybe it's a client you've worked with maybe an analogy but just help us to understand how these emotions will affect our retirement plan I think we've all experienced the first one and that's greed\nAbsolutely because um you know the two main things that people have when they're investing is greed and then the other one is here this is all those ... are appealing to you know the advertisers you see in a money magazine or anything\nOn any of the commercials are things like that anything from a financial services company is trying to appeal to this grief side of things you know you need to grow your money you need to grow grow grow\nAnd it's not necessarily what you need to hear but it's what you want to hear because people hit very greedy when markets are well people just want to make more and more and more\nBut they never take the time to find out what is that they need to make\nIt so an example was that we had this very nice couple that came in and you know he told me an interview he said well if I already you know create a spreadsheet and said if I just make seven percent then I'm going to be just fine you know retirement and I was like well most retired projections going to look pretty darn good\nWhen it's seven percent you know that's a pretty decent return however\nTo get seven percent you're probably going to have to be invested the majority of your money and things that are related to the stock market or in the stock market\nAnd sure enough he was all his whole portfolio was in mutual funds\nAnd I said okay so these don't earn seven percent consistently like a CD with seven percent every year you're projecting that but that's not how these or if they're going to vary just give me some years where it's up a lot maybe twenty twenty five percent there's going to senators down twenty twenty five percent right\nSo in our shop where we take him through a tab called the market comparison tab and what this does can compare earning this consistent rate of return\nLike a CD to the very end rates return of the stock market index like the U.S and the five hundred is what we use and it's going to look at it from two thousand two thousand and ten a mark of member that was a pretty pretty daunting time right [noise]\nBut I was kind of every one right now live through well if you're over Eighteen years of age and you live through that timeframe now you know being a baby you probably didn't have any money in the market but most of the people coming to us live through that and so they're very well aware of how things can be volatile and the market now\nWhen you're putting money it's a lot different story when you're buying you like it to go down because you buy it on sale is when you sell it when you take it out is when selling on cell doesn't work so well we show them is here's your plan work in a seven percent\nHere's your plan invested with these very rich richer and you got to take money out because you need it in order to maintain your lifestyle what the differences and for these people after going through those ten years with four negative returns they actually ran out of money five years later that was shocking to them\nBecause they'd never seen that before they never experienced that they were just assuming this flat rate of return so we actually showed them that they didn't need to take on such rate of return to make the plan work by putting some other guarantees and they're very happy with the suggestions that we found out so that's appealing to the great side or helping people under ...\nDan ... is not the right thing to do and all of your money some of your money could still have invested but not all of it needs to be invested\nWell and now let's go to the other end of the spectrum and talk about fear which you could probably also talk about using two thousand eight as an example\nIncorrect so then on the other extreme example of people that come in all their money in ... in savings accounts\nAnd like I don't ever want to go through that again and we run of the same analysis and guess what their plans that going to work either because of this thing called inflation so you'll yes your money you say yes or you're not going to lose from the stock market but also your expenses are going to increase every year now\nInflation is something that's hard to really calculate because governments to one of the reports it to us\nBut in the way you access inflation is by what you spend\nAnd so if you can modify your spending some time to ... doesn't have as big an impact to you but if we assume let's say a three percent increase in your expenses\nThen they'll run out of money too because their money is not growing and keeping up with that so we get shown some ways you can increase your potential returns but still maintain the same safety that you want\nAnd also by having a planned it gives them maybe to convert factor that hey maybe it'll take some of my money and I don't mind investment because I Know I don't need a touch that money for maybe five seven eight years something like that so I can let that move around a little bit but either stuff I Want safe because I'm going to take income from that\nVery easy to do with today's tool so we get appeared that fear as well by helping people understand they still need to grow their money to combat inflation\nAnd have money that's growing for down the road for future changes in life such as you know maybe nursing home or something like that so I Would also leaving money to your kids so you do need some growth and that even in retirement but she wants safe growth is what most people are looking for\nAren't moving along and now want to talk about hope and I think we're talking about the kind of hope that's not I hope that's based in something but more of an unfounded naive optimism hope\nRight and I think most people are somewhat optimistic you know if you're born in America you should be optimistic because yeah we enjoy the highest standard of living of any country in the world America's always kind of done the generations now are doing better the generations before then that's kind of what we do we try to help",
