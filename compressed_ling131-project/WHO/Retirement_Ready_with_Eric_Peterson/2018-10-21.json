H. O. three day weather forecast on channel Thirteen we're all just amber Alexander [noise]\nBack to gardening today Jessica for almost a verdict with you answering your gardening questions than we've had a\nQuite a good selection of a topic today and I\nKind of speaking of the some of those questions we had some text come in\nAll of star was wondering about over wintering asparagus fern so Melissa you're in good company\nAnd he Z to over winter asparagus Vern I'm the person I think they they wanted to try it in their basement but it got to ... yes have tried giving it a good hair cut and keeping it short prefer not to water and then it doesn't do well yeah big well bury the issue yeah yes biggest barriers it's so big and heavy heavy\nA husband doesn't appreciate carrying it to the basement [laughter] so I have heard yelling at but I have to treat it like it and they will yeah so what advice would you give well mine was I Would be um\nAs you're getting ready to to bring it in check it out of its pot and give it a good shaved down on the roots you can down pot plants and as these leaders you cannot possum get yourself a soil knife or and and even just a kitchen knife will be fine and you can just shave an inch\nAll around or even or more depending on how big the plant is you can shave off the bottom a little bit too you'll see those roots for um the little um the little round nodule nodule yeah whatever you want to call those um it it's going to be fine and then re pot it back into a pot and it'll give it a little bit more leg room\nTo grow over the wintertime and remember to keep it watered and if you have daylight in your basement like from from ... new ground level windows that should be just enough for it and it can take a cool it will look scrappy it will make a giant mess with all the little needle foliage\nFalling down just sweep it up and you'll you'll you'll be fined bring it back out again in the spring and a pump it with some liquid fertilizer and it'll bounce right back but I Do\nAnd I kind of asparagus ferns are always interesting for me because when I was in California working with Monrovia that was one of the items they had a they loved growing these they did really well\nThey'd have just fields and blocks up asparagus fern and customers loved him especially in the mid west where it was more of a tropical and once you bring in it you know bringing in of course up at these girls are very well and that's exactly what they did with them because of various ferns can crack containers\nThey can they say the bus it's old math that kind of like make plans yet so so yes that's that's a good tip for a listener we also had a we also have David on the line and ah we want to make sure that we can answer his question about where the show has to be also a good morning David how are you this morning\nI David are you there\nOkay maybe David last time okay well we're going to put him on hold maybe we can come back\nWe think of it are you with someone else Okay David are you there\nI don't know that he's there okay we're gonna David if you if you went away from the phone and you want to come back if you're still listening give us a call back we'll see if we can answer your question in the meantime we do have models of tax that we can answer and one person is wondering whether or not they need to dead head the flowers off of their head ranger going into winter\nAnd the answer is you can but you don't have to I like to leave my head range flowers on all winter long 'cause I think they look really pretty but if you don't like it by all means sniff um right off right below where the uh the the flower brags are I'm at the end of the stem and then the Republican next year ...\nI'm a little line by during that I'm probably going to be leaving until spring mhm as well it looks really nice but the snow on it and it doesn't I mean it doesn't serve a purpose is just kind of a a nice pretty little that's all winter interests something\nInterest and you know if you had to hide ranger that doesn't tend to drop its brackets in spring which usually by the end to bring or by the by the end of winter it's kind of beaten and battered and all those hits pretty well disappeared and and the foliage comes out and hides the old flower stocks\nThat doesn't always happen there are some hide ranges that hang onto their ... and then the new foliage doesn't necessarily cover them up and so you have ... hours at that point you might feel free to to turn them back at that point yes clip them right off [noise] let's see here what are the questions\nThat we got on to another listener said if they shouldn't will change ranges until temps are consistently in the twenties we pull it off the following summer this is Kay in Webster city yes\nAnd we're assuming that this listener is\nA mulching the mop head hide ranges which are marginally hearty here in Iowa they will often die back to the ground and if you put a as a thick pile of mulch on top of them shredded leaves or something along those lines\nIt can help sustain it helps keep those stems alive above ground a little better\nUm yes you want to pull that away and the springtime when what's temperatures are consistently um warming up apple that away spread it around or pull it off to the compost pile and um don't leave it on all winter long or you're going to have some ... issues at the base of your plant that [noise]\nAnd then another text we've just had quite a few lately a golden nugget hennan checks in a smaller pot on the deck how do I over winter it outside or inside they this listener wants to leave it in the pot\n[noise] so I had a lot of him and checks that I'd overt tried to over winter last year and this is one that I put it in my basement on had a like a metal wire rack\nAnd I put it on the top shelf so it was right next to the window which is north facing ground level and do not a lot of light I also forgot to water it repeatedly\nUm some a fifty percent of the pot survived the other half died and I re planted this year I have hands and checks and the same pot I from what I replant it\nAnd I have them on my dining room rack are sheltering system right next to a west facing window so they're going to get a little bit more light it's going to be a little bit warmer\nAnd they'll get a little bit more attention from me sure throughout the throughout the winter so hopefully this is going to help them over winter a lot of people grow hands and checks his house plants they need highlight fairly warm ... not dry not not wet situations so not a lot of water\nAnd they should hopefully do for you and survive so fingers crossed that that both of us have success with our hands and chicks this year\nYes there's so much fun yes and there are so beautiful and especially like you know some of that you've had the chick charms ... yes are you feeling like fifty percent died yeah [laughter] that inexpensive failure for next year you can kind of keep propagating them along and everything like that even if you do lose a few and they do this year\nWas it was so funny my hands and that that part that I had the ... and ... was a favorite spot for the chipmunks to try and Barry seat\nAnd so of course you know these little ... a ... and ... and ... they don't root in very deeply and so the ... every day when they get up and I'd have a little ... and checks everywhere but his would stay in place the checks will go everywhere\nAnd then I took him back into place and try and put it back in and the chipmunk welcome dig it back up again and so finally I shopped online and I found this netting hut as collapsible netting ... that can put over so I had this one pot that was in a cage [laughter]\nThe bottom all summer long and by golly the chipmunk left him alone and so they were able to really rooted and make lots of little ...\nOur savvy financial a radio listeners people that come and see you they've heard the term the financial red zone\nFor a number of years now it's been kind of coins and I think a lot of us might know the football red zone but I'll let you tell us about both of them and how we can see some comparisons well\nFootball rent on course that's you know inside the twenty yard line when you're in prime scoring position and it's your efficiency and the red zone that a lot of coaches\nYou know want to make sure that they are very efficient you know you want to come away with the six point ... not the three point field goal and\nSo officially the red zone as a metric that they judge their ... by in the financial world and the retirement world was actually I think it was potential that kind of a trademark that actually the retirement red zone mhm and uh basically ... you know five to ten years before retirement\nBut it's also the five or ten years after retirement right\nSo unlike in football when you scored a touchdown you know then that that's over you go for your extra point whether that's the one early and tried to two extra points and then kick the ball back to the other team\nIn retirement is a little bit different so just catch you reached that retirement date doesn't mean that you're you're in the clear there's still some radio you still got to take some steps there to make sure that things are going to work correctly\nSo in the years leading up to retirement things that you want to make sure you're looking out for are of course you know replacing your income and risk becomes paramount because\nYou don't want to have all of a sudden you know bad market come up which markets ebb and flow but a bad market the rail your time to retire\nYou know you just don't want to have have the market's down I Can't retire you want to be retiring them regardless what's happening in the market so that just take some planning and then right after you retire to that's where you want to make sure that again from a wrist standpoint but also spending standpoint\nI was going to be spending would make a lot of sense here\nRight because it's a time of the most money the probably ever had any time in your lifetime and sometimes we'll we'll tend to spend more because we have more\nNot realize that money has to last all you know of course is the time to do the things that you are in your bucket list you know a lot of people want to make repairs to their homework at their home ready to kind of we call age in place you know\n... meaning to just have the time to do it of course there's those trips that you've always wanted to do and you know those kids and grandkids and those kinds of things so you just want to make sure that your plan has that built in yeah\nFor sure plane process we take into account you know we say okay you brush retiree go spend probably a little bit more on traveling so how many years and he will do that for and we build that in so just plan for those scenarios but ... years leading up to retirement would be read so but also those few years after retirement\nYou're still not out of the woods you still want to make sure that things are going according to your plan your county for different scenarios and making sure that your plan works\nYeah 'cause if you think about it with football right mistakes are high you know very costly at this point the defenses tightening up it becomes harder to score and while I just got back a couple of years to the super bowl between\nThe sea hawks and the patriots right so they got down there they thought the game was over they get this miraculous catch they get down on the one yard line they can punch it in with the best runner in the game and when the super bowl when they had no place winning it and what did they do they decided to take a chance get risky\nAnd when the whole free world they were going to run it they decided to pass it what happens and they got picked off and they lost the game right\nYou gotta be careful about those red zone turnovers retirements no difference you don't want to get too risky take too many chances and I liked that she pointed out or you know not getting too crazy was spending in those years after retirement\nBecause you don't want to wind up you know short changing yourself for the rest of it so some good analogies there to think about here on retirement ready with Arab Peterson so now it's talking about the hurry up off and says we're still kind of talking about this um I don't know maybe making mistakes side of the game Eric\nOh what the hurry up off and you've got the team trying to usually it's because they're behind right so if you happen to catch the the Sunday night game earlier in the week\nKansas City very high powered off ants got behind they're trying to catch up they're getting kind of crazy throwing some wild stuff out there the same kind of thing a retirement plan it can it get you in trouble\nOh absolutely you know as people ah you know start to look into how much money is going to take to retire and all of a sudden they taking on too much risk right you know because in order to get a decent return these days you're not getting anything on the bank and I can anything and CDs you have to turn to the market\nAnd the markets been phenomenal since the bottom in two thousand nine\nBut it does have some ups and downs to it so taking on that risk to try and increase the amount of your nest egg just this kind of hurry up can have a devastating effect so you want to make sure you're doing it smartly but also this is where a plan comes into place you know planning to replace your income\nThere are ways to generate large amounts of income without the risk is income is the goal that you need\nWhat I find is a lot of people when they come in what they want us to just want to be able to live off of the earnings off of their accumulated mistake they don't disturb the nest they just want to live off of the what it generates it'll that's a nice and goal you really kind of neat ups such a deeply break that apart and say okay what do I need for income and what do I need for growth because\nIf you just try and live off the earnings and you have let's say a bad year it's all in the market just what your count that he's going to go down and then you're going to be selling things that are in a bad market which means you're locking the losses\nUnless you can go and get five percent on a CD is going to be difficult to take off a consistent level of income if you have things that can vary around like mutual funds and stocks and eat chips and those types of things\nBut when you do some income plan and you can actually replace your income and had it from sources that are guaranteed them protected and so you may not have the account value but you always have the income\nAnd so that's really what you need and the plan is income is your goal which in retirement that's most people's ... to ... exactly because he'd replaces paycheck so there's different ways to look at it and it's just having you know having a plan that can show you all the different options to fulfill that plan\nAnd the ... success will be you know some people want to go into retirement and not have a high probability of success there were other kind of roll the dice you know and have a lot of things in the stock market and unfortunately sometimes that doesn't work out or other people didn't want a very high probability successfully turned to things that are more secure\nThere is no right or wrong answers depend on what your individual situation is but the best way to find that out is to come in for planning process so when we you know make this offer on the radio tell people to come up our retirement radius review and what that consist of is seen where you are right now\nDetermine you know what is that she wanted retirement how much income you're going to need based on your budget to see where you're at from a risk standpoint from the standpoint from a tax standpoint\nAnd then we present the findings and that those findings will explain what the issues are explain how we'll fix them\nAnd really that determination for the right people to fix them for you so if you want to know if you want to get a plan in place if you don't have a plan you want to get one or if you have one you just wanna make sure yours is still going to work to get a second opinion if you will then give us a call at five one five to six Fifteen hundred\nThe only thing we asked if you're over age fifty and have at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars towards retirement so if you meet those two criteria and give us a call at five one five to six Fifteen hundred\nGo ahead and jumped yourself on the counter

Peterson president and founder Peter some financial group I was a retirement specialists serving you right here in central Iowa you can find Eric at his office in\nWest Des Moines conveniently right

additional information text the word retirement to five one five to one\nTwo to six seven snakes let me give you that again text the word retirement to five one five to one to two six seven six you'll get a response back with a little form for you to fill out some basic information\nAnd they'll send you out this great report this got a lot of interesting things in there to kind of help you get started as well I'm Talking about low interest rates the stock market I ever present tax implications things of that nature so go ahead and text retirement to five one five to one to\nTwo six seven six and Eric speaking of taxes let's talk about taxes in retirement here on this portion of the program\nWe'll start with kind of a misnomer maybe it's on a misnomer and all you tell me most people assume that their taxes will be lower in retirement how often are we right about that\nWell I Would say that a lot of times is lower retirement but it really kind of depends on what tax bracket you were in you know while you're working guy you're in lower tax brackets is probably going to be the same if you're in a higher tax brackets most of the times is going to come down but what I see as people assume a flat tax rate\nIn case assume hey I'm going to be on the you know they seemed twenty five percent for tax or something like that and the reason why they're kind of condition this way if you get your four one K. statement on a quarterly basis what you'll see is down the bottom left hand side now but they're doing is they're calculating that in a amount of income that you can get\nAnd then they're assuming some kind of growth rate and they're sending sometimes a tax rate as well and they'll say a blend of tax rate of twenty five percent for federal and five percent per state something like that well that's not how it really works in retirement taxes or like a set of stairs\nSo currently in two thousand Eighteen the first step that you step on the money on that step is taxed at ten percent\nThe next step is twelve and the next one is twenty two so although your tax return may say that your overall tax rate was let's say fourteen point seven percent\nThat means that you're on the twenty two percent step but you pay ten percent on some of that money to pay twelve percent on some of the other and then twenty two on the rest so understanding your tax liability is a huge one in retirement\nBut the fact that they go down but people miss there is that while you're working your pain to taxes that you're not going to pay when you're in retirement\nYou're not can be paying Social Security tax to half a Social Security that you pay now unless you're self employed and the pay both sides and the Medicare tax you don't pay those taxes and retirement you just pay ordinary federal income taxes and state income taxes but you don't pay those two taxes the last time your tax rates going to go down in retirement rather than up\nBut it also depends on how much money you have and those tax deferred accounts like for one k.'s and I are raising those types of things because those are just they tax time bomb waiting to go off yeah\nBecause when you pull me out of those it's a hundred percent taxable and then if you don't want to point out of those at a certain point in your life when you reached Seventy to have you have to pull that money out of there and sometimes that can cause a lot of tax issues as well\nYeah kind of act like a WMD in your RMC [laughter] kind of blows you up and put you in a different tax bracket if you're not careful so we're talking about taxes retirement it's a question for you hear a lot of talk this year obviously with a new tax program they've got put in a lower tax rates things of that nature\nPeople been looking at ways to improve their tax strategy is down the road thinking that we're all thinking at some point they have to go up because we're basically taxes are kind of on sale right\nRight and they have to they have to sunset so and twenty twenty eight the tax rates are just implemented\nUnless Congress votes to keep them they automatically sunset and we go back to where we were right so that ten stays at ten to twelve goes to Fifteen to twenty to twenty five and then the twenty four goes to twenty eight and most people that we meet with our phone on those first for tax steps\nSo it's an automatic tax increase so if you want to make sure that you can lock in your your taxes and the best way to convert\nYeah they had to say there's been a lot of talk about conversions right\nRight absolutely 'cause you change it from forever tax money to never tax money\nThe problem is that you got to rip that mandate off that one time and sometimes that's pretty scary right and also you know it you don't have a a do over anymore\nPrior to two thousand and Eighteen maybe did Iraq conversion let's say of an IRA to a rock and then you went to file your taxes and it was shocking to you and you didn't want to pay all that tax you could re characterize it called a do over", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Retirement Ready with Eric Peterson", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "21"}
