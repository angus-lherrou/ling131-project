I\nDon't know I did not cut it I can just banned it [laughter]\nYou know ... ... you know if you use the if you do use the container\nTrimming as little as you can get under the container but ideally you would use something like a old chicken wire cylinder or something like that that would allow you to not have to trim any of it off and that would again um give that plant as much mature those possible to get through the winter\nAnd not um and then if you do have winter kill you don't lose as much of the total plant whereas if you ... back in you lose the top portion of the plant you're losing more than if you didn't ... I lost the same amount\nOf top portion if that makes any sense so um [noise] so if\nWe were going to have a very bad winter you could just leave it\nAlone I Know I Wish I could predict that for you to be great [laughter] look there's going to be bad [laughter] yeah I've heard that\nYou will see but you never know you do in nature if if she has proven anything this this year how it goes she is\nYes shrimp [laughter] okay All right that that I'll do\nAll right thanks for the call Jeanette [laughter]\nAll right and we did I Want to see if we can't get through our questions here because we did get quite a few tax questions that I Want to try to answer them we had a listener um text and salmon urban do asked if there is any a book that tell us how to prune shrubs and bushes and\nAnd um when we need some advice for pruning and the first book that came to my mind was the American horticultural societies um pruning um manual let me get the official name of it here\nA pruning and training the American horticultural societies book pruning and training\nUm is a nice comprehensive guide is got a little bit of everything in it so doesn't matter what you're doing when you've probably find something close to it in that book definitely definitely it's nice and the American culture site is a nice trusted resource for things like that to to have a lot of nice publications\nAnd it's you know it's it's not necessarily an inexpensive book um it's certainly you know when to to have on your\nShelves or you can get it out into the library you can a yeah I mean the book is going to run yeah probably at least Seventy five dollars although I see on ... you can get it for ten it's a used book and that's the kind of book it doesn't matter if it's used cars you also might find interesting notes and the margin yeah [laughter] true [laughter]\nSo hopefully that ah hopefully that helps out Sam there you know we love to talk about pruning now is not the time to prove no but it's so hard to talk about printing over the radio because picture is worth a thousand words when it comes to this topic and so a good trusted sources it's a great way to approach that\nAll right let's see who else we had 'em all out here or someone\nWho has a hen bit ah germinate and can I still controlling or how can I control it and that is\nAn annual it is it looks a lot like creeping Charlie\nRight it's a it's a it's a family it's a it's also known as a dead metal and um [noise] but it because it's an annual it will it will die\nIt will die so your big thing is to do whatever you can do not let it set seed right so I'm cutting it off removing any uh flowers when you see them will help a lot\nSo hopefully I'm all for they've identified as accurately as Henry and it's not actually\nRight right it's always best to pay out the highest interest rate debts first and then go up to the lowest ones and even the ones that are tax deductible or sometimes good [noise] so that's how bad debt good debt type of thing yeah it's always best if you have no debt you don't want to be a a you know you want to do any buddy anything that means is less that you really need to maintain your standard of living but having a mortgage and even\nHaving a mortgage going into retirement is not so bad that the words is that we cannot into retirement if we're carrying a mortgage is not necessarily that bad I've spent a lot of clients and they've actually decided to retire early even though they had a more just because it fits into their budget\nIt all depends on what the budget is right it was all you got the money to cover it it's okay\nOkay well we're playing agree or disagree here on the program you are of course listening to a retirement ready with ... Peterson from Peterson financial group I'm Mark Killian riding along side of days we're talking about are the world's a finance investing in retirement\nAnd so we've got a few more of these have to do a irritable trying to plow through some of these agree or disagree individual bonds are better than bond funds\nAbsolutely agree with that and this is where what people talk about bonds when they come to our workshops or classes and we have a class coming up we'll talk about later they always talking about bonds and bonds are diversification tool because you tend to go more towards bonds closer you get to retirement treated wean off of the risk from the stock market\nBut there's a huge difference between owning an individual bond and they bond fund because when you own an individual bond\nYou're not so concerned with that interest rate changed that's changing the value of your bond 'cause you're probably going to hold that to maturity get back the amount invest it and then click the interest along the way so\nWhat happens is you have to kind of pitcher a teeter totter and interest rates on one side and price on the other one and so one side's down the other side's gonna be up we have a teeter totter that's I mean sometimes it can be perfectly level you know if you have to people the same way [laughter] what's his name of the day so [laughter]\nYeah and so sometimes it might be perfectly but normally time once I was going to be up or down so interest rates go down then the value of a bond increases but if interest rates go up the value of up on decreases\nThat doesn't matter to you if you own individual bond if you're just looking to collect the coupon now most people don't own individual bonds it takes a lot of money to get up properly diversified amount of bonds okay so if people look at our bond funds\nAnd that's what you brokers recommending to some kind of a bond fund says you have to visualize it inside of that bond fund you have hundreds if not thousands of different bonds\nAnd every time the interest rate changed all those bonds change in price and so when they start quoting you or a grocery Turner that bond fund you have to think of it that there's two things to pieces that make that return\nSo they say hey this bond fund return five percent last year okay you've got to fake okay how much is the coupons and then how much was appreciation or the change in the value of the underlying bonds that are in there and so if you go look at the coupons and say okay the coupons were two and a half percent let's say that's the cash coming in from the bonds that are kicking off\nThan the other two and a half percent was coming from the appreciation of those bonds that appreciation is based on the interest rates sub interest rates mood that appreciation goes away gotcha okay\nSo one side is cash the other side we call hope because cash what you're getting at is I Hope it works out so what I see is that if interest rates start to move up from here those could lose have losing position that's not a huge maybe you know what percent negative something like that but\nIt's still a risk but you'd be able to individual bond you'll have to worry about that because you're just worried about the coupons so that's why I agree that if you do you have enough money you can build enough portfolio and you want bonds only individual bond still only bond fund okay where\nWe're talking about agree or disagree here on the program and you know when you're thinking about the bonds or the way I always remember to Eric and someone told me as a while ago with when rates are high bonds die and when rates are low bonds grow as kind of an easy way to remember that for me so absolutely it's going to live right here right\nRight 'cause you buy them at a when rates are low okay then the bond is appreciate and value because it's more attracted to somebody else yeah if you're a bottomless face paint five percent and rates are at three well who doesn't want something paint five if I can only get three somewhere else right but the opposite if rates are five and you're only paying three guests why [laughter]\nIt's not that attractive so you have to discount it so that was that it allows\nYou to get all analogy I get a lot of a lot of things to think about the next one here for your Eric is nobody needs life insurance once they've retired do you agree or disagree with that\nThat could fall in the category of disagree to maybe okay [laughter]\nIt's a ... [laughter] yeah\nYou know so many questions that financial advisors are as can be answered very easily with depends right 'cause every situation is a little bit different now I Will agree with people that you probably don't need life insurance for the reasons why you bought it while you're working you know one of the primary reasons you by life insurance while you're working as a something happens to you\nYou know you can pay off the mortgage you can pay the bills you can still have an income for your spouse and send the kids to college or that kinds of you have to replace the income that you're generating you have a a value if you will you know and a lot of people to calculate life insurance by how much you are making\nSo if you're making fifty thousand dollars a year in each ten years of insurance five hundred thousand dollar policy or something like that now once you reach retirement\nYou probably accumulated some money so if you lost your job which is really retirement is if you think about it right you lose your job yeah [laughter] yeah money to replace the income so you don't need life insurance for that particular reason\nYou know probably is you know most people are tired like to beat is debt free she'll have any bills to pay for hopefully knock on wood the kids are out of school [laughter] and independent mum on their own them off the payroll right\nYeah yeah we hope that we can get retired and went with a clean slate\nSo you don't need it for those reasons however\nBefore you throw the baby out with the bathwater as I tell people is that you want to take a look and see can I use this for a tax arbitrage so\nLife insurance is a very unique titled the tool it does a lot of things but one of his main components that it is a tax free asset so when life insurance pays out the debt that pays out those are going to be tax free now you can also be tax free distributions if you do it correctly but\nIt's well the only three things that is tax free the other two are going to be Roth IRAs and the interest on municipal bonds\nSo it's not that you need it for the original reasons you bought it but maybe a need for this tax arbitrage I think we're the biggest threats to people in retirement\nIs the taxes that are going to be levied on them you can't control does and the government spends a heck of a lot of money and may need to raise them down the road and you have no control in most of your assets are a hundred percent tax and when they come out so\nHe needs to look at life insurance with an open mind and retirement and see how ... strategically as opposed to just look at the way you traditionally bought it\nYeah it's gonna be another ... possible component to a retirement plan an overall plan but again you have to look at the situation you have to sit down and talk with an advisor and find out if it's going to be right for you this is retirement ready with Eric Peterson five one five to six Fifteen hundred again five one five to six Fifteen hundred if you've got questions and concerns things you'd like to ask Eric and his team\nGet yourself on the counter five one five due to six Fifteen hundred okay so speaking of another component that may or may not work for some people I'm going to get a crazy here and use the a word on the radio\n[laughter] and that's the new and have some I agree or disagree where Eric is annuities are they rip off\nAbsolutely disagree with that okay but the funny thing is is that there are some people that have\nI guess what can be considered ripped off by buying annuities [noise] an annuity as a tool and then it's not a tool suited for everybody was a lot of people out there that I think it's a tool that everyone should have and they'll do any matter anyway they can to sell you that tool they'll make it sound like the greatest thing since sliced bread\nPeg in a round hole thing right\nExactly if I had to sell is that I'm going to go round make sure everyone has one whether you think you need it or not you know the other night my wife and I I wanted some Chinese renewed for that and so in our town\nAnd they can either is a great place that we like to go to and the first things that don't have an actual website so\nI just go with it real fast I just wanted to see I Can't remember what it is but I just wanted to make sure that the names of things so rife it took me to a website called ... and that had their menu on their okay these are two things that we want but I scroll down a little bit and I saw the comments from people that is a place we've got you for\nGosh Fifteen Years you know while it's always great that's why we always go there and write and I was just shocked at some of the negative reviews I mean the one person that had a review on there was like there's no way he walked into the same restaurant\n[laughter] it is kinda that way that two people could buy the exact same product or had the exact same experience\nIt cut with totally different outcomes ... interesting way of looking at is that yeah so that's how I knew what he sometimes are you know sometimes you hear the story of somebody that purchased one and I think it was probably sold incorrectly and so they feel like they were ripped off right but other people may buy one I think it's the greatest thing to help them in their retirement\nSo a very simple analogy that I use in my classes I tell people is don't look at a new witty unless you need a pill in retirement no but I Am so think about pill P. I. L. L. so each one of those stands for different word so pi\nIf you're worried about protection of your principal that's when duties could do especially fixed annuities they can preserve your principal alright\nGave you're not concerned with that then don't look at him\nOne five to six one five zero zero that's five one five to six one five zero zero\nFive eve visit news radio forty eight Sao hand on every I learnt radio [noise]\nNews I'm Karen McHugh this appearance possible murder of journalist you're Monica show the in Istanbul's complicating relations between the U.S in Saudi Arabia turkey says Riyadh is to blame reports\nOut there that there is some sort of audio video evidence of what occurred if that were to emerge or any other ... or ... or frankly of questions here aren't answered a there is no video from leaving that facility or there's got to be a big problem\nGOP Senator Marco Rubio on CBS tough talk marine Ian president Hassan Rouhani aimed at the U.S\nBeing broadcast on state TV Sunday Rowhani called the Trump Administration the most spiteful American government towards Iran in the past forty years running appear to be responding to some of President Trump's remarks from the U.N General assembly last month or President Trump called the current Iranian regime that corrupt\nDictatorship and when Rowhani spoke Sunday he told a group of university students at the United states is seeking regime change in our ...\nThis is Fox News [noise]\nTemperature starting off today in the low forties dropping into the mid thirties through the day and the rain snow makes at times when we'll be breezy from the north tonight will seek clearing overnight with a freeze morning from one AM until ten am temperatures dropping to twenty nine degrees\nTomorrow sunny and cool with the highest forty six on channel Thirteen urologist ...\nIn the morning right now at twelve thirty two cloudy skies thirty eight degrees and rain approaching Des Moines at news radio ten forty W.

in central Iowa five one five two to six\nOne five zero zero that's your number to call to get yourself on the appointment calendar no cost her obligation to do so just reach out five one five two to six one five is zero zero his officers located in West Des Moines conveniently near right off of eight street so get yourself on the calendar today\nWe're going to take some questions from the around the area here on the mailbag stopped by ask Arab Peterson dot com if you'd like to submit your own questions to the show\nAsk Eric Peterson dot com or just asking questions because you want to get some answers there can be certainly glad to help you out there as well our first one for you hear Erich is from Karen and Karen's in Altoona and says Eric what's your opinion of all the robo advisers stuff I keep hearing about is it something worth checking out\nWill care and what I Will say is that the the robo advisers and is that like ah there's a robot on the other and that's you know pushing\nBut I just the robocop doing it you know I'm a child the eighties the robocop in there\nYeah or the one from a ... danger real Robin\n... oh yeah yeah yeah yeah lots of space yeah yeah yeah of course I don't think I was a computer 'cause his hands were like a like a spinning hooks or something yeah a knock it and give you\nWhat role do is basically an algorithm so the way you answer some questions puts in the variables so you have your age you have a time horizon we have the money that you're going to need again based on that percentage of your current wages type of thing and then it comes up with an allocation for you so you can go on the Web sites and they'll give us allocation\nAnd I will say that it's a way to accumulate assets on relatively cheap basis and so some of these walls to adjust to so for taxes or as you age they'll change their risk profile\nSo if you're not working with anybody it's a actually a way to get a decent asset allocation information\nAnd a little bit of financial planning on a very very inexpensive basis so for people in the accumulation of stage of life I say hey it's not not so bad yeah understand that it is a algorithm so it is mathematically\nHas takes out all of the emotions out of it which means that the markets are going down it's not going to really change that much so you're going to go down just because you have algorithms 'cause you have financial biases not prevent you from losing money okay\nWas meant to do is keep you kind of focused on what their long term goals are yeah so is it good for people that are entry in retirement and I would say no because one thing that an algorithm can't do is know what's going on between the six inches between your ears okay\nIt doesn't end they'll your behavior okay that's what advisor really does\nAlthough we do a lot of other things and helping people prepare for retirement and crappy stretch like us up all the best guess ways we added value as has been proven by vanguard did a study on this is the main thing that visors add to relationship is help preventing people from doing the wrong thing at the wrong time by keeping them focused on their plan\nJust like being a coach helping athletes perform at a higher level that's what we're doing in the algorithm can't do that a robo can't do that but a human being can so I was safe or accumulation side not a bad take a look at for distribution side the retirements I definitely not you definitely need to be with a professional such as us\nThere's a ... because we've done it before the algorithms I've been retired before we've helped hunters salmon are successful\nAt it a great way of looking at it actually yeah\nWe know the road that they're going down in the ... those are new I mean the only been in the last couple of years you mentioned earlier mark about you know there are some people out there never seen a down market yet right and so the robot doesn't do that either he hasn't been a dumb are because they're just relatively new but it is an inexpensive way for not working with anyone is not bad on the accumulation site but not on the distribution side\nAll right well great question care and we certainly appreciate it reach out to Eric and talk more definitely if you'd like five one five two to six Fifteen hundred you've got questions or concerns not just about the robo advisers are just in general get yourself on areas counter five one five to six Fifteen hundred were kind of\nOut of time here but we didn't have a quick question from Gabe I don't know if you can answer this fast or not but we'll see\nHe says uh and by the way he's over in Grimes he says our retirement savings is spread out Eric amongst all four one K. two IRAs a raw several mutual funds that are purchased with after tax dollars he wants to know which accounts should he start withdrawing from first\nWill Gabby it's not like you go from a to beat a CD and just take a ... we have to look at us all these ... in different tax bucket you basically have three\nYou have taxable get tax deferred and you have tax free so you're taxed for it's gonna be the four oh one K. and the IRAs the tax free of courses the rock and the taxable is gonna be the ... the mutual funds\nSosa looking to like to play one the other should ladle from all three in the most tax efficient way possible probably not touching bucket three to down the road but bucket to in coordination with bucket one in a taxi efficient way because of you can take money out of your ... twelve percent tax rate\nThat's pretty good and then if you turn the bucket won it could be long term capital gains if you're at a twelve percent tax rate could be zero depending on your taxes so that's what it's just having somebody that knows the tax ramifications of different investment decisions and that's where things were very very good at here so if you want to\nHave somebody that can can educate you on the most tax efficient ways to do things and\nGive us a call five oh five to six Fifteen\nInch yourself a retirement rated his review today with air Peterson ...
