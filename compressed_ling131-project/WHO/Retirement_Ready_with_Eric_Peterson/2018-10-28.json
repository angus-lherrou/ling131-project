H. O. three day weather forecast on channel Thirteen meteorologist like in South la [noise]\nGardening today here in Studio\nWit and style and this show has gone so quick I Know they always do well they I mean when it goes by callers from the very very first second true it's true and we we still have a few questions to get you on the tax flying uh so it should definitely get work on some of those\nWe had um [noise] let's see we'll start with well actually we should finish Sylvia Sylvia we were we were talking with Sylvia via text before the break and uh she sent us another photo of a a Hindu wrote plant or Korea\nUm which is a an interesting kind of\nI of all the real plants in the world I feel like ... is the most ... most likely be mistaken for a plastic one [laughter]\nIt's a very interesting book called wax plant yeah yeah\nAnd even the flowers I think the flowers look absolutely fake yeah it does bloom they look absolutely like like the worst Nineteen sixties plastic cluster of flowers you can imagine is what the flowers looked like on this planet is so fascinating\nAs she sent us a photo of it that is growing like crazy and how do I contain that\nUh and so ... does really well in hanging basket from pedestals it's a kind of mining plant I don't think it's a very good whining or a rent I'm pointing plant\nAnd so you know you could put a little trouble is in there but you would have to be the person that kinda guides it along on to that trust if you wanted to do that yeah and it and it and it does you know vine down it's not an upper yeah yeah yeah\nAnd so the other option is to just trim it back in her roots very easily from cutting so and you can take cutting anytime of the year so you could trim it back usually I I mean I Would use about at least four inch piece\nTo route so with at least two sets of leaves if not three sets of leaves remove the bottom set or the bottom two sets mhm and stick them in the soil or let him route in and start growing again\nUh you could do that or you could just cut it off and give them to a friend or you could just cut 'em off and get rid of them although I Am remembering\n'em I mean this is you know deep deep memory of somebody who had it in in their office and actually had string going across like bookcase the job that I had a growing kind of ... along right up up and across um so it was\nYou know became a green roof yeah in the office and and I do apologize Sylvia 'cause I hadn't realized there were two photos and when I was reacting to was was not the ponytail one at all yeah that's right the voyage and that that ponytail I mean that is a great cage with the outdoor fencing\n... the issue is the the whole in the you know in the fencing would be just perfect for some [noise] for your sweet sweet boy to get his pot and and just I'm going to knock the whole thing over\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah you'd have to weigh it down to [noise] yeah [noise] so hopefully that helps out so the I think um you know finding a place for it to ramble or cutting it back as kind of you to read it but it\nCertainly I mean it's beautiful and lush and you know sort of hate I hate to cut it back\nYeah I Would agree yeah ah we also have I think you have a good answer for this one cat the is it too soon to start getting the Christmas cactus ah it's ready to bloom like as a too soon for Christmas captive to bloom well\nI I and I'm assuming that yes this person has one and it's and it's but it up and no I mean there are quote Thanksgiving cactus Christmas cactus Easter Cash Cab yeah my Christmas cactus would start blooming at Thanksgiving after a year or two\nUm no it's not too early but the big thing is once it set those but you really don't want to move it because\nYeah they just are they're happy where they are\nAnd that they may drop the but they may drop out of\nBuds which is really unfortunate the other thing you want to do is while most of the year you can let your Christmas cactus dry out between watering wants it sets those but do not let it dry right out between watering um or it'll drop the buds to yeah and you can you know sort of put it in a saucer and let it also take up\nYou know water from yeah from the bottom and if anything's left after half a day you can get rid of it then right yeah yeah that's a good idea to\nI Know I I often refer to these not as Christmas cactus but as a holiday cactus not because I'm being PC right it's because they do bloom in a wide range of a time periods ... I'm usually in the winter\nBut ... you know it can be as early as Thanksgiving and it can be as late as Easter depending on the species and the variety and there are other factors that play into this two day our photo periodic so there's a short day factor which is why they Loomis time here but there's also some other things like temperature\nUm that play a role in this too so it's not just the short day that brings it to flower it's the short day plus a certain temperature kind of regime um which we typically reach in our homes without doing anything special um which is why they bloom but all those things come together\nThe time of year the day length the temperatures to make this plant bloom and so the reason we see variation is that all those things don't always come together exactly the same week every year\nRight and I used to keep mine outside in the in the summertime and then the moment I saw any little indication that it was starting to but you know bring it inside yeah\nI have I have one it blooms later and I love it it's it's an enormous um\nAnd there are so pretty it's on like a a small and table they're so pretty on a pedestal or small table because of the way that they grow right um I had it in a hanging basket but I was having a hard time keeping water in the bath yeah so I moved on to a pedestal with a saucer\nAnd it really loved it yeah I really loved it because even though it is a Christmas cactus\nIt it doesn't want to be necessarily bone dry time\nIt's a secular I mean it ... yeah and um I remember was it last year the year before there was somebody that had I Believe that had been I mean they had a cutting from I think it was their grandmother\nFifty years old and yeah the ...\nAnd and uh they are very long lived plan you know a ... or like that too and once you find the right spot for it they will just grow and live and grow and live and just do its thing for you or without any fuss which I think is why they\nYou know have people like I had somebody\nI have a good friend who works in\nA plant a plant collections I'm at the Denver botanical garden and they had somebody wants to offer them a Christmas cactus that literally came over in a covered wagon oh my God [laughter] and I thought wow one that they know that that's a thing\nAnd to that that's been around that long also amazing and the question\nIs why were they giving it up I you know the same reason everybody gives them up they inherited from my aunt Milly right and they just can't imagine getting rid of it but they also don't have\nA place or you know they live their life in a way that they ...\nThe U.S government can listen to a very unique position one it can print its own money\nThey can sell its own debt it controls the\nInterest rate it pays on its debt right right that's the interest rates and uh that's the primary those kinds of things and it's long standing credit worthiness you know there's a reason why the economy's in countries all over the world by us debt because it's a very very very safe so\nI think it's something to be concerned with around taxation but don't let it force you to get into a panic\nOr uh put you in a place we won't do anything you know you still need to invest your money you still need to have a plan you still need to have a strategy\nAnd how to deal with this will be called long term tax liability to kill a tax bill you're going to have in retirement some ways to reduce that and that's one of the specialties that we do here Peterson financial group is we're always looking at things with a tax NGO how we can reduce that tax as much as possible\nYou know at slot who's a mentor of mine his famous things that's changed those forever taxed accounts to never tax accounts as soon as possible and then you're on the road to easy street if you don't pay taxes so getting rid of tax liability is a huge thing and that's something that we look at a an implement here Peterson federal do very well for our clients\nYeah and when you're thinking about that obviously you know when it comes to the spending and all that at some point we assumed the taxes are going to have to go up so you want to make sure that your we've talked about this before on the show the taxes are kind of on sale now so you want to be having that conversation as it relates to your financial planning implications\nAnd of course Eric and the team are here to help you five one five to six Fifteen hundred\nFive one five to six Fifteen hundred to get yourself on the calendar on him in for that consultation and talk about some of these things in real fast before we jump into our main topic to start to show Eric I\nSaw a quote that I thought we could kind of just discuss real fast I thought it was kind of a fun little quota the weak able lemons former college basketball coach I think it was I think he was Oklahoma City Texas I think a couple of life as it goes but anyway he had a great line he said the trouble with retirement is you never get a day off\n[laughter] that's true because every day's a holiday\nDays of Saturday everyday right you spend more money on the weekends all that good stuff\nWell actually I Know retirement people that are they avoid you know shopping on weekends they avoid avoid go to ... to the mall or their eyes on all the employ people without fail good point yeah I'd like to go on a Monday right I I like skeleton crew consumer standpoint\nSo that is true then all of a little story to this is sometimes it's hard to enjoy time off without a little bit of stress in your life you know are hard to enjoy downtime you know we call\nThe famous Italian St ... day which means a sweetness of doing nothing or just to kind of gather your thoughts and just be free from stress\nAs a little fun story a was we were down the Ozarks with ah the family our neighbors are from there so we went down with them and run their boat and my daughter and her boyfriend wanted to write a jet ski\nSo are they know someone that that has jet skis for rent a friend of theirs so we rented jet ski for them at a resort and so ah they took the jet ski out for a few hours we're in the boat with their family we decided to go to lunch someplace so we went ... and the Lakers are such huge\nSo uh we're done with lunch and my daughter texted me and says well we're done with Jesse can get as I said well yeah but we're pretty far away will be there probably about an hour\nYou know just hang out at the resort and use the pool you can swim in the lake you can you know get some snacks and just hang out and she's with her boyfriend to so and she text back worst parents ever [laughter]\nAnd my wife and I was just laughing each other doing you know it she's there with her boyfriend it's a beautiful day they can swim that can be in the water but we're the worst parents because we're giving them some time alone you know\nRight what's wrong with you\nYeah they they couldn't enjoy just this you know downtime because they don't have stress in their life it's always that way you know they're always got all this unlimited time so I thought that was a funny story but yes retirement people you know you don't get a day off\nYeah very true you're not working so neat enjoy all those days treat 'em like retired but I was one of the things are also about retirement that people need to get accustomed to\nIs sometimes they kind of need that little bit of stress and that's why a lot of people when they retire like to work part time is not necessarily the money certainly money helps there's also just having a little something that\nYou got to be on a schedule you got to be here to certain time a little structure right a little structure yet but they don't want to all the days maybe a few days interact with people you know have a deadline have something that\nMakes you use those skills you've had and so\nYou don't want to have retirement that you have to work but if you want to work it's more like 'cause you just want to have a little bit of a structure in your life and then enjoy those days off a mentally more fortunate as opposed to every day being off so if you're worried about this retirement if you're worried about all of a sudden being you know having all these days off\nHow to fill your days a lot of people stress out about the money side of it and the money part is important\nHowever is not as important as mentally preparing for retirement you what are you going to do with your time what do you do this additional think about almost Fifteen hundred hours a year that you're going to be granted\nAnd that's what you basically work what do you do with all that time you need to think these things through the money can help your planning process can really help you so that's one of the wonderful things that we offer to people that call from the radio is only two are planning process we called her retirement readiness review\nBecause very athletic

said let's talk a little bit about our grandmothers for section on the show they can All right where the where we go with this\nAh but think about it right that was always have great things and ah we all have hurt I'll go with them is a big cliche things that we've all gotten from my grandmothers and I'll let you kind of turned those into how we can apply it towards the financial planning side I guess grandma was that a lot of good stuff and I don't know about yours but mine was always spouting off\nThings little old southern lady a rural southern lady it was about four foot ten I think that's all it was she's a tiny little thing and uh but she had some good ones and we'll start with something that everybody probably has hurt and that's when it rains it pours and you know my grandmother would say that all the time when she was going to tell me that I had yet another chore to do [laughter]\nShe was like bad news it rains it pours I got something else for you to do\nAnd I always thought that was just the tagline for more than salt and other stuff happening with the big things when it was humid out it was still pour out of the thing no one is just means about news you know send rhymes you get to a lot of good news especially when the pertain to financial markets you know we had\nYou know good GDP numbers low unemployment was just up in the markets just you know going up and up and then all of a sudden there's some bad news and seemed to pile on\nYou know and that's why also I blame the media itself because they have to fill twenty four hours a day of news and bad news always cells\nSo they have to sensationalize everything in the markets are based on supply and demand and what creates that demand or crates that supply is going to be whether people are buying or selling in that mood is dictated by how they're feeling which is then influenced by that's new those types of things right\nMid term analysis talking about this wave fan reaction Rand way

mostly clear with a low of thirty eight and tomorrow sunny and sixty five on channel Thirteen year I'll just make and sell off sunny windy and fifty nine at W. H.\nI. V. news radio forty age how hand on every I heart radio\n[noise] ...\nRather than doing in reds beginning this is retirement ready\nBack here with us on retirement ready with Arab Peterson president and founder and Peterson financial group I was retirement specialists and they're serving us here in the central Iowa area from their offices in West\nDes Moines a conveniently right off of eight street there find Eric and the team on line at ask Eric Peterson dot com that's ask Eric Peterson dot com or you can give them a jingle at five one five to six Fifteen hundred at five one five two to six one five\nZero zero and ... before we get into our next topic we were talking off line before they became back you're on the show and you're talking about the fact that uh you know your last name being Peterson I somebody you met you met with the same name and they they had named their kid Peter was that correct\nOh no no no that was a David Walker\nOr the control if I'm comfortable he works for the Peterson Jay Peters gotcha Peter Jay Peterson foundation yeah it's a mouthful at the low yeah and as as as somebody whose last name as Peterson I and I had my son that never entered even the top one hundred names that we're considering [laughter] hours on that just seems kinda strange you have a peak\nSo Peter Peterson says even hard\nYeah even hard as they are and we got kinda spit on on that because I was telling me about my cousin who I mentioned in our grandma's segment\nHis name is Joe Joseph why my sister named him Joe when his last name was it was if I have no idea what in the proper biblical named Joseph Joseph yeah that would really be an interesting right you have interesting I was cool with it well it on Joe squared ads re Joe Joe Joe do [laughter]\nOh let's dive into our next category here Eric\nThat's four O. one K. mistakes look four one K. is a great vehicle right it's easy it's painless it's a good way to build your retirement savings on and get your thoughts on this but because it is so easy and painless it can also be easy to ignore it for long periods of time it's kind of a set it and forget it for a lot of people type of mentality\nSo I'll give you a few things here and you just kind of tell us some areas to be on the lookout so that we don't step in any uh any pitfalls here or a so for example maybe we've transitions to another company and all the times I think they're called orphaned accounts were you leave the money invested it in a former employers four one K. plan instead of rolling it over to like an hour a\nLot of people do that and there's really only one reason I could think to do that and that's the only if you have attained the age of fifty five okay but see if you got to take another job and you're going to work somebody else so this fifty five over loophole in the ten percent tax penalty is no longer available so only the place where you leave work from\nSo there's really no reason to leave it in the old plan in my opinion because when you leave it Neal plan you're limited to the options that the plan has\nWhich the vast majority of our mutual funds and you know you don't really have a lot ... than a money market may be a fixed interest account maybe paying you know one percent or something like that\nAlso if that planned decides to move to new CFO comes in and his buddy as a you know broker or somewhere else and they want to move to plan your money moves along with it\nSo it's just such it's easier if you just take control over that and you move that to an IRA it's tax free transportation IRA and then in the world of the IRA you can get whatever you want you can diversified as much as you want you can all kinds of different assets as opposed to just what the plant allow so\nI've never been a fan of leave it in the plant and less you're over fifty five you separate from service from the place you're contributing to that plan and you want to keep money there that you can access without the additional ... percent tax penalty because when you moved to an IRA\nNow that that the United and a half becomes that age where you can access without the temperature of tax penalty\nFifty five and over is if you leave it if you take from the planet you retired farmer separate from service from\nBut if you go to a job because of limited that so just understand what all the aspects of leaving the plant are moving it are and they work with somebody qualified that can help you out with those choices\nAnd that's what we're talking about here some four O. one K. mistakes or missteps maybe maybe mistake sounds like too harsh a word I don't know but either way we're talking about some of these rebalancing I think that's another place Eric tell us a little bit about how we can have a misstep here if we fail to rebalance our four one K. often enough well what happens isn't it\nAnd like your own investments that you're going to have you know thirty percent in this stock fund and twenty percent in the small ... and ... percent in this bond fund and things like that you don't ... says markets go up and go down those allegations are going to change that you want to stick to that allocation yet to go in there and rebalancing\nAnd a lot of times if our own case make it really easy there's a couple of screens you click and they'll they'll automatically do that for you she can set that up on your own but you need to monitor that you know ... to make sure that your your check it out as a plans that really got to do that for us you set it up automatically also you know in my opinion\nThe way you're contributing your money actually should be kind of different than the way that you have your balance invested because\nAs you're contributing money as you're putting money into the market whether that's on a nearby weekly basis or once a month you want to take advantage of dips in the market because I mean you find it on sale dollar cost averaging works when you're buying as you want to take advantage of all different market conditions even when it's down\nAnd so if you're contributing you really should be having things that are more volatile which should be stock phones now maybe your balance you want that little more protective especially based on your age because you don't want as much volatility on your whole balance and then maybe ... once a year or something like that but\nYou should have the your contributions going into things are a little more aggressive take advantage of market volatility\nAnd when we're talking about these different kinds of borrowing mistakes but you can step into is always a good idea to make sure that your second one that qualify professional before you take any action and of course Eric and his team are here to help you reach out to them five one five to six Fifteen hundred and five one five to six one five zero zero as his retirement ready we're talking about these four one K. missteps\nEric what about sticking all of our money in target date funds OK so a lot of us\nAgain it's another easy kind of set in forget we say well twenty thirty five that's my target date for retirement and you just kind of assumed that by doing that well it's now customized for what you need\nWell it's not really customized because it's the same one for every one\n... but we get that false feeling maybe\nRight and actually the reason they target date funds came out is that the\nMutual fund families that provide the underlying investments or the planned providers which are the you know the company holding the plan\nWas calling them saying hey you got to help us with this ah investment advice that we have this ... Sherry liability that we have is the providers at the plan as the employer were on the hook for this investment advice for our um employees\nAnd we need an easy way to fix that they came up with target date funds what those are meant to do is the closer you get to that target date it's going to wean off of risk so it's going to move for more stock funds to more bonds and fixed income type of investments [noise]\nSo you have to look at the target date funds in one and see if it's to that target date and it's in the static from that point going forward or even manages through retirement about what it's supposed to do is just you know move from stocks bonds closer gets that date\nSo if you choose to retire and twenty thirty five you choose a twenty thirty five fun it's kind of on auto pilot rights can write outlets to find them reach ... ballots\nSo it is an easy option and then you'd have to go in there and physically rebalance things and monitor you got somebody watching that for you but again like I mentioned earlier that might be a good option on your balance but your contributions should probably still be taken advantage of market turbulence and buy on sale\nSo yeah these are not doesn't recommendations had an idea I think about but you definitely I talked to somebody qualified\nLike us here Peter's from that you have to help with the ... case but targeting funds are\nThey are good option but you have to look at it you know you got to read about what is it supposed to do what's his own a lot of times they're fun to funds which means they just own let's say it's a you'll find family like fidelity and has a target date of twenty twenty five well it's going to own probably seven or eight different Fidel defunds inside of there\nIs there going out and buying individual securities are buying different funds and then the allocation will change basic as close to that age so us understand what it is but it is not an option if you just want you to not have to worry about it have somebody moving your portfolio around the closer you get to retirement", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Retirement Ready with Eric Peterson", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "28"}
