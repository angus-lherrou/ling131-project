soul friendships\nMany people don't have that kind of person in their lives it's not surprising there's so much loneliness in America today especially among men variety of reasons that make that a reality\nThere's so many barriers to developing true and lasting friendships is the pace of life for the distractions of life like television on the Internet videogames there's no mobility of life people move frequently from job to job from area to area the isolation of life we\nDrive toward jobs and drive home and close the garage door and sit by ourselves in front of a screen typically each night\nThe cynicism of life to we just trust people and are reluctant to let our guard down and we'd get too busy to nurture relationships it's hard to love someone when you're in a hurry\nSad thing is though is missing out on this kind of friendship is missing out on a richer life because everyone needs someone like that at three AM friend\nAs a Christian you might be thinking well I had the lord God in my life he's my friend and I'm Glad that is the case but sometimes we need God was skin on\n[noise] I remember a little story about a young little girl that woke up in the middle of the night to crying she had a bad dream mother goes into comfort her\nAnd uh she thinks she's got to calm down and she's headed back to her own bedroom and the little girl says you're leaving me don't leave me and ... mother says well God is with you and the little girl said I Need God with skin on right now\nIt's true sometimes we need God with skin on we need that human touch in our lives we\nHuman beings are always have needed God with skin on when you think about it from Adam in the garden of Eden when God says it's not good for men to be alone\nKing David who is surrounded himself with friends through the hard times as well as the good Jesus himself valued friendship didn't as he called the twelve to be with him and his ministry we find the apostle Paul was experiencing that same sort of need a in our ...\nHey pass each for the day\nPause time of departures coming soon he's on death row in Rome there's no get out of jail free card\nIs far from the familiar from his homeland he's uncomfortable he's chained\nTo soldiers he's he's in a prison he's he's cold physically winter is coming he needs is coat he's hungry not just physically buddies hungry for God's word he mentions that he needs as books that have been left behind in Troy has never done learning with the word of God you know\nMostly he's feeling abandoned and alone\nYeah he's experienced the power the lord standing by him he mentions that in our passage today strengthening him as he stood trial before his enemies but right now Paul needs God was skin on he means his friends\nHe had many friends it sounds like from the endings of his various letters and the New Testament when he he would send greetings to various individuals he understood the value of friendship and support any he needed a friend\nThen in this letter to Timothy but not just any friend though he needed his three am friend\nAnd that would be Tennessee\nWe seem appealing to his friend Timothy in this letter do your best to come to me soon\nThat's a big ask\nOn pause part by the way not very convenient at all for Timothy\nIt would take some sacrifice some doing on his part he would be putting himself out there for Paul he'd be risking his own life or perhaps his freedom as he identifies with ball as a friend in Christ is the cost of the\nTime and the energy is a thousand miles away and the resources it would take to make the trip and worried about his congregation that have been given him trouble [noise] what would happen with the church where this fall apart while he's gone\n[laughter]\nTo your best to come to me soon Timothy ... pleads question for you to consider do you suppose Timothy came as Paul requested I bet my bottom dollar that he did and here's why\nThere was a special bond between these two men a deep friendship between an older man is the mentor and a younger man who's learning the roads they were so friends\nAnd how did he come up about\nHow did that the relationship develop how does that kind of friendship happen in one's life well as you look through the whole litter second Timothy you find some clothes that are helpful to consider for our own friendship building for one deep so friendships take time\nAnd being present as I say with an is\nPaul and Timothy shared all kinds of experiences\nYou look at second Timothy chapter three says now you've observed my teaching Timothy my conduct my life my faith my patients my love my steadfast sniffed my persecution my suffering the things that happened to me and ... what persecution I endured yet the lord rescued me from all of them\nThere with to get together in good times and bad\nThey traveled a lot together on these missionary journeys\nThere are good times in hard times there's lots of conversation opportunities to observe one another as they serve Christ together they spent time composing letters to the various churches we see as we look at the other letters they stayed in touch when separated that usually leads to something\nVery profound and special\nI had a special friend like that\nThe former speaker for this radio ministry Homer Larson and I traveled a lot together he was my best friend\nWe traveled to preaching conferences together and evangelists some conferences we spent a lot of time traveling together and I am so much richer to have known him and shared life with him that way and even to this day I feel the loss of him not being around\nAnd I have other individuals\nThat I Would call three am friends is Robin who I call on a on a weekly basis and talk to are we text back and forth and there's days when we socialize together as well as served together and there's a certain bond there\nIf you want to deep soul friendship you need to\nCommit to that time and presidents with someone of another thing they had was a there is some transparency deep soul friendships involve self disclosure\nCultivating transparency they knew each other's personal histories well Paul knew about\nTimothy ... mom and grandma unison Lois and his background and what kind of a father we had\nAnd Tim knew of Paul's sorted past nothing was hidden from one another and as you read the whole letter to Timothy Paul openly shares his heart and his soul his affections he doesn't hide anything he says I'm dying my mother raised the end of my race has come and I need you here with me\nAnd obviously as he's encouraging Timothy throughout this personal letter about his own ministry it's apparent that Tim is shared some of his own fears and weaknesses as a fellow minister and Paul knows his strengths and weaknesses and he addresses those in this letter\nDeep so friendships require willingness to show yourself to be perhaps what you would say vulnerable with each other they're deep so friendship had expressions of affection\nThere's a lot of affection being expressed in this letter there's tenderness and love and care being expressed by Paul I'm praying for you Timothy I'm grateful to God whenever I remember you and my prayers and I'm constantly praying for you Knight and day and oh how I long to see you because when I see you\nThat fills me with joy pauses", "year": "2018",
