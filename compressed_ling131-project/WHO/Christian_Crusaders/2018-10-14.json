were made and redeemed for communion with\nHim through prayer it's an important part of the process of walking with God and growing in our relationship with God and serving him in this world yet sometimes we struggle with prayer don't way perhaps out of ...\nTwo point lead from past attempts at it we set it aside or maybe there's a lack of discipline in our lives are just plain old forgetful in this life gets busy and we get distracted and we're all the poor for it when we do that\nOur series theme is a a couple of great reasons to pray for answering the question why bother with brain in last week's message we learned a great reason to pray is because near my a parade and look what happened\nAnd today is the answer to that question is because the early church did\nEarlier we read a story from acts chapter twelve rather exciting story it's a time of persecution and violence against the early church in Jerusalem\nWas now not only under attack from a Jewish population that didn't want them around now it was under attack by the government it appears that\nJames the brother of John was arrested and be headed by a king named Herod why because heritage approval ratings need to go up amongst the Jewish population is run happy times there was a famine he they didn't like the Romans anyway and he's looking for ways to keep the Jewish majority happy\nAnd peaceful he knew their dislike of Christians so getting rid of one of the leaders of the church would causes approval ratings to soar among the population\nIt works so well we see in our story for the day that he had Peter arrested another leader and scheduled to go on trial and be beheaded\nRefined Peters surrounded by sixteen soldiers in a prison he's in chains things are in a bad way the leadership of the church is\nOn the line the future of the kingdom cars seem to be in question so what did these early Christians do did they panic and scatter\nNo the church gathered and prayed for Peter it says\nNow the night before Peterson trial and execution while the churches praying for God's help and this and and an intervention of some ... we're told [laughter] theater sound asleep while they're praying\nPeter sleeping but God wasn't Peter so\nShowing with a bright lights suddenly in an angel poked Peter and the side woke him up to get up let's go get dressed and three miracles occurred the chains fell off his hands and feet\nAll sixteen of the guards that were supposed to keep an eye on him slapped is Peter walked right by them\nAll the while thinking that he was just happy to dream big iron gate open all by itself and Peter and his rescue we're headed down the street\nBut Peter turned to say something to his escape partner\nPartner disappeared and then Peter realizes\nThis wasn't a dream the Lord's rescued me so he runs to the house church it's been praying for him and the doors are locked he can hear them praying inside I imagine Peter knocks on the door\nCalls out a little servant lady named Rhoda who would come to the door here's his voice as he's calling out and she's so surprising overjoyed she runs to tell the others but leaves Peter standing outside the door she tells the other's\nAbout this and they tell her you're out of your mind you're out of touch with reality you're just seeing things maybe it's Peter saying job maybe he's dead already\nIn the meantime Peter keeps knocking on Mary store looking over his shoulder I imagine sweating bullets by now because he thought there'd be a search party out looking for him to arrest him again\nFinally they listened to road and they go to the door and they open it and their stance Peter and everyone there is shocked\nTo see Peter standing there alive and well they start talking amongst themselves and then he silences them and he tells them about how the lord brought him out of the prison\nAnd he then instructed them to go into James the brother of Jesus who was also a big leader in the church at that time like Peter and tell other believers as well so that they might be encouraged by it\nThat they might be renewed by the thought that God really is with us and for us in all of this even during ... times and then Peter went on his way to do ministry elsewhere\nIt's an amazing story\nBut this is more than just a great adventure stories to entertain us\nTo cause us to enjoy and marvel at how God used to do these sorts of things it's not safe for entertainment friends it's safe for our vacation is God's people in Christ as part of his church\nBecause first of all it serves as a wonderful reminder to us of the great lesson faithfulness of the gods to whom we pray\nThis God here's an answers prayer he is active in this world there is no hands off approach on the part of God\nAnd as the him says this is my father's world he is in charge his will will be done at the wrong seems also strong God is the ruler yet\nYou see this little episode is part of a bigger story\nRemember the beginning of the book of act when Jesus said to his disciples now wait in Jerusalem for that power to come from on high and then you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and Judy and all the ends of the earth\nIn other words he told them God has plans for this good news to be spread all over the world it's going to happen\nAnd then this story as we find God's church under duress where the king thinks he's in charge and going to shut this thing down at with the league leader Peter being captive to him God steps in\nIn the end of this story as you read on Herod dies doesn't he ends eaten by worms and Peter is alive\nThe gospel continues to spread to the ends of the earth and more and more people come to trust in Jesus Christ when all is said and done by the end of this episode God his one\nAlways has always does he always well his purposes will not be thwarted the gospel the good news of Christ life and death and resurrection\nCould not be silenced and cannot be silenced it just keeps going\nOn and on\nAnd we see that God loves his church it's a theme that comes out in this story se involves himself with his people\nSo the first thing is is great picture of a faithful God who's in charge the next thing that comes up in the story I think it's meant to it's meant to encourage us to pray\nMore boldly to anticipate God's answers to be on the lookout for them\nThe\nSurprises these praying Christians in the story when Peter shows up the house church shows that they weren't expecting anything to come up they're praying maybe they just thought this was to impossible of a situation so when they hear that Peter's at the door they go you're out of your mind\nBut they were again taught that our God is lord of the impossible didn't day he specializes in great escape say I mean look at the
