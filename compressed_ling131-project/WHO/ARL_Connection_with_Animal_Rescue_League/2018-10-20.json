S. is not proud of but every nation has involved been involved and covert activities\nThat the things that I Know I don't talk about 'em and you know but\nYou know we we need national leaders that clearly understand the the sobering reality of\nThe powers that the exercise and they need to do it uh with the eyes wide open now with our national interests involved and and do it in a way as humanely as possible um you know arguably you know what we did in the in the wake of nine eleven\nAnd which you know a allegedly a use these words that we took captive certain individuals uh that were threatening the United states and of course we've from ... to some in Guantanamo been there a and elsewhere perhaps\nBlacks sites around the world um those are covert activities um were they in the national interest of the Bush administration thought so others disagreed but nations do these sorts of things and they have to to protect themselves\nIs it fair to say that countries have no friends they only have interests\nAbsolutely\nAll right Susan thank you for that let's say Hi to ah Wayne is in Chicago\nGo on the wild card line Wayne good morning welcome to coast to coast am\nVery much for rent [noise] you're always ... ... ... the most with that well thank you are good because\nIf you comment then I have a course in the theater and um [noise] we promise board junkie there we would not advance I'm no way no how\nAll we've been doing ever draw the country as we mentioned earlier like over in Romania Hungary Balkan history will just corn weapons and who ... who those countries we've been to Norway so we're trying to around ...\n... what were your response to be there were were when we are around there were all start um [noise] the thing about Russia they do not treat crime here to Crimea people will greet\nNinety or one of them agreed to join Russia because they didn't want anything to do with the Ukrainian government factors government the court about United agree um\nIran\nOr most of the day Ninety degree of ... we got rid of him because you're you're all that he wanted to keep it was all for his own people so we are the ones who are\nThe ... the destruction of with weapons around the world trying to be the world's policeman\nAnd you know use the bathroom where where do you what my actually my question earlier um\nWhy do we call all these other countries evil\nRonald Reagan the evil empire run your George W. Bush draw wrong a runner and North Korea back the legal now your book is very evil but we weren't perpetrate evil around the world where the weapons of destruction everywhere even theory or\nOr or or not did not do one you're going to tell people you're with their lives during that he did ... ...\n[noise] yeah well I sort of question in their Richard it it is it is perspective um yeah I think that the the history of the Russian a Soviet Union\nCertainly where they killed millions are under mouth and China where they kill millions a and their foreign policy where they\nProvoked all sorts of proxy wars um the the types of values that they support uh yeah we do sell weapons are defense security cooperation agency has done a robust year this year double what we did last year\nOh we we made mistakes with some of our alliances and the like uh we've helped topple governments perhaps in the past and and and did it for our own national interest so I think what you said moments ago Richard is absolutely correct and that is\nA we don't have any friends we just have interest and those interests are going to shift from time to time given what\nThe United states needs to secure itself and to prosper\nUm sometimes uh in the eyes of the beholder it is is evil or certainly in my perspective and I have no label Russia and China as an alliance of evil I looked at their history and I look for the one today and it's certainly not what my country wants\nAnd I do believe a United States\nIs not perfect but it's doing you know some pretty good things around the world and I I tend to want to respect and a cure for our interests over there's\nParticularly because you know people talk about democracy and and how that is really what protects a freedom but it's not really democracy it's it's the rule of law and we have the rule of law in North America thank God in western civilization as you look around at Seventy eighty percent of the rest of the world\nThey don't have rule of law it is the wild west and there are no protections afforded the individual you can be literally swept off the street in the middle of the night and executed\nUh for for no reason in most places in the world\nAre and to me that's evil\nYou know you're you know there are a million Muslims that are incarcerated in West\nAnd a western China today and that's a un report or somebody can look it up here\nIn the last week or so why are they doing that because they they say that there are extremist well you know we don't do that the United states now yes we have a history of incarcerated in Japanese under FDR a that was wrong and we've acknowledge that\nWe do bad things but the rest of the world you know I I have\nI've gone through I think five passports have been all over the world I've seen some pretty bad places um and yet you know it's always wonderful to come back home to the United states where we enjoy the rule\nOf law we are in a phrase Richard's points out of being arrested him pulled out of bed and shot him they had 'em for families being carted away and yet unfortunately we're seeing that elsewhere in the world and\nYou know the likes of the Chinese are doing some of that to their own people and so they're all\nGotta jump in here and thank you so much for spending two hours with this\nAlliance of evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War thank you so much Bob here's the kinks the time song taking us into the break on the other side two hours of open line the phone for the phone lines are yours you're on the coast to coast am\n\nWhen there you go

looks like Wayne's on the phone let's go and talk yeah in this morning Hi Wayne morning line\nI'm doing well great you have a question for us yeah perfect about three years ago\nYeah my my wife and I were adopted by a Beagle\n[laughter]\nAnd he has been a delight but recently\nMy daughter has moved in with us for a temporary work if I read in the area yeah rocker staffordshire terrier along\nOkay the dog get along very well except the little one eagle tries to mount a staffordshire okay and won't leave again oppose alone\nOkay alright what can we do yeah um [noise] is the Steffi spite\nYeah yeah okay I was just thinking there might be more going on there so um what we would do is try and be proactive so if we see\nIf they certain times when she does it like if they get exhausted or rouse United applying what we want to try and do is interrupt that and redirected into a more desirable behavior\nSo if you see them getting um is it happening when they're applying all you know if there's excitement or is it risque time I'm well how would you describe it for me\nWere were playing with them yeah it's off the ball and they're running after it and um both of them are male yup oh I ... and the little one just won't leave the big one alone yeah\nAnd it happens after a certain amount of throws imply you think when they're more excited yeah yeah so what we do is um\nWe try and find that mock all that point where they're just starting to get to arouse the nice stop all the stuff he stops and then the bagel does its thing so what we do that in ... actually\n... ah finished the game and direct the Beagle into something else so like a\nA fun too um you know calling with Pina bought a so when I stopped 'cause that could be just an offload of arousal low of excitement and that's how\nYou doing it does that make sense yes it does\nYeah so I Try and find that ... you know it's going a little bit too far in that behavior starts and then what we do is bring it back a little bit uh in that game before that behavior starts and redirect that into a more desirable\nBy yeah All right we will try that yeah 'cause it let us know how you go without wine right thank you thank you very much\n\nIt's interesting what dogs had like ... sorry I didn't explain that as well it's an offload of arousal or excitement to you know you see dogs plying or running around and then\nI'm going to go do something because of the play you might have one of the dogs might have caught and down and he's like I'm Still a wound up I'm Still wound up and off they find something as a release\nYeah so we just need to put that somewhere else yeah make that productive yeah yeah\nSo I was on CNN this morning and there's a headline that reads Meg Pisces in why Australia hands tied for birds every spring yeah yeah Maggie's so what's the deal with that they're just too many I mean why would I Try and hide from these birds\nAre they sweep you oh they swoop you yeah okay oh yeah [laughter] so
