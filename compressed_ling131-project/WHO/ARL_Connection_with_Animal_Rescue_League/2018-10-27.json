{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WHO", "content": "And that was I remember that yeah yeah they\nThey won't have soles God didn't make them they won't have soles there'll be like zombies there'll\nBe like and it was like no they weren't so I mean I think some of it as an education piece and and I think that's were great science writing in science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful 'cause it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you're you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right Kenya right after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book maybe totally irrelevant right because by that time the beds and you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is the end of life as we know what let me go to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into our DNA when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense then ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be talking about the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will yeah\nYeah ... it'll give it a little plug for an up [laughter] and how they're I think you you were talking\nAbout immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality and when the wrath of God is or out of a finance high and\nIt says that they will pray that they would die and they were not able to and they asked for the the mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this this theory that you're talking where we've achieved get more Callow\nThis is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse I'm you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on Michael\nWell it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible\nThat might give us some glimpse are some hint as to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe\nWith what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating\nEr and and so I I I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of um of a mental a question or a mental experiment that people talk about a lot ... it will reach a point where we create\nArtificial intelligence being whether it's in the form of a big computer server and the in the body of a a monkey Alyssa a kind of a role of human like robot but get so complex\nAnd so the non ... you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYou know it's like the guy net running it's like\nRunning on on energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the ... thing or from the crush souls\nOf the people in the dumps on on you know getting going to get itself coffee yeah I get that I think that happens\nWith some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop\nYou know that that piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and oh I don't like it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher thinks\nSo Jack Lew is exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them\nSo keep that in my let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona on coast to coast a I'm David\nGoing hey my question for example and the ethical and moral conflict created by June ... artificial intelligence\nUm one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing it gives it sounds like a really good\nQuestion [laughter] yeah and if they do we just leave them\nAnd we just left\nA no we'll James's in the in the Washington Let's try to him well we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nYeah I uh enjoy your show but um [noise] I've been on a machine going on forty five years yes or\nNo or macular degeneration I'd like you know from your guest or when you feel that the shoe will be overcome through ... or or a maybe a genetically modified pig I'll take my answer off the air\nAnd hang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine is\nHe on he's on dialysis is on kidney ... and ...\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful um they they are making enormous strides now or with restoring people fight with macular degeneration I've actually interviewed a woman\nWho had the operation and you know even though her\nFight is still not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but\nWe're making enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that are is already working on a second\nGeneration a that will help actually restore sight and people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney from I don't think we need that creates these same era\nA there's a lot of great research and I've reported on off for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cell or ... it might create a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very helpful\nAnd that's where we left ended with Michael ... book picks up the rest of the thank you so much for your time and uh through your joyful spirit and looking forward to carrying on a with open lines next on coast to coast am this

station and on your age the radio Katie ...\nRadios morning doubled you wait Joe\n... Fox News\nYeah yeah we were just the guy was just looking on the Web site actually see kind of what small pets we had south originally got into a conversation about reptiles I Know nothing about them and it's fascinating ah yeah but like birds were in talking about this little bit more you really need to know\nWhat you're doing with them you can't just get one and put it in a cage [noise]\nRight right or they oftentimes of more specialized care than the what the average pet owners used to with cats and dogs even if you've never really had when you generally have an idea of how to take care of those animals yep uh like I said like reptiles or birds or a little bit more specialized you have to worry about like the heating requirements of reptiles and\nA new birds there's a lot more social interaction that you have\nHave with them yeah and I also noticed with these fish on here and I grew up with fish I'm actually considered myself to be somewhat of a fish you know experts for about\nThree out of there you go yes oh that's cute but I'm On it or was it [laughter]\nMake makes is you know that it was very good thing um [noise]\nWith that tropical fish for years but um so I think it's neat we actually have fish for adoption\nThat we don't get 'em and super often I'm ... but when we do ah we usually find homes for 'em relatively\nYeah absolutely I remember as a kid having goldfish on my table soy my bedside table all up room I'd have a goldfish or a black Mormon is that my remembering the correct name for those so almost goldfish but black and taller with bold you guys right yeah\nOkay ... do you think we probably don't see them\nVery often not very often I think he might have had one come at a few years ago yeah they're not super comment on the shoulder\nYeah yeah very cute [noise]\nAll right it looks like we have a call already this morning so let's go ahead and get Brian\nOn and Brian and Brian how's it going Brian\nYeah hey Brian how you doing on your your [laughter] you got a question for us if you want to know what's amazing yes gold you're you're like oh yeah yep barrel reality and other bad [laughter] okay you know here's my ears my worst on that yeah\nMy oldest boy recently passed away and you're still down there and live your girl\nIn right do you think she's chewing they never were now\nWhat can happen I'm Sorry for your loss um\nIs that animals can go through a grieving purses which includes the strays acting out or I wouldn't say acting out but I Need to offload those um what would you go\nThe anxiety the stress of it all and chewing is one way animals do relieves stress so what you can do there is\nA is a certain time she doing a rhino just whenever she gets a chance\nTime and it actually I work right\nDuring the day so when I All right there you know when you're when I go work it's between that time and your clock when I get up\nOkay um first thing we do I know it sounds simple but we try and take all the shoes ups shouldn't get the chance to do it but then when you go to bed actually um give her something to occupy a so when you have ... the comb with the peanut butter and all the rest of it\nOr you know you can even feed her out of that you can put her morning meal in that I'm with a bit of peanut butter or something to bonded together and as she gets ... I'm\nMore familiar and into eating that you can then report in the refrigerator so it's a little bit for ... takes a little bit longer and then you can get to the point where you freeze it so it's actually giving so she's redirecting that need into inappropriate on them\nOkay we'll do that than I Will call you want to thank you very much\nNow I got one more quick yeah I have a ten year old daughter grew one guy what I heard what should I start or out\nGood cool that's a good question Dana get and I'm going to hang that I've been a William [noise] uh yeah\nSo there there are a number of good options were kind of started or birds um especially where people are really enthusiastic about getting into him\nI'd recommend things like parakeets or ... um they tend to be readily available of course uh we get a number of them and and the shelter every single year\nUm they're easier to handle they've got decent life span so it's not a you know an animal you start to become attached with and I mean what's gone they they do have long lifespan so you can really get attached to him spend time with them\nOn both birds are also a very capable of learning all sorts of fun ah sounds of do mimic um they're even capable of imitating speech sometimes I'm so they could be a lot of fun ... requirements are a lot simpler than let's say some of the larger birds like a among car cockatoo\nAll right so uh yeah because she's young and I want her to get a quick I don't want to major\nBut I Want her to have fun with it I got ya yeah so I Know this is going to end up on a lot of okay [laughter] so\nOne that's going to be here with her and one that's going to respond to her playing music in our bedroom okay I think that's what she likes to do\nYeah parakeets and ... they are really good served birds and and you really can't go wrong with them\nAll right and now we can adopt or\nYou know let me double check we just have a group of parakeets in but I Know some of them got adopted\nLooks like at the moment they they'd probably got adopted last night it looks like yep um but we do get 'em and fairly often I'd say probably get maybe half a dozen every month so just keep a new checking on our website and we probably have some available you're pretty quick\nAll righty thank you not a problem fantastic spraying you take it you're saying thank you bye\nYeah I think that's a great thing to for people who are looking for a a bird to add to their family that is you know to visit the animal rescue league we have birds often as William said plus any shelters in Area C off neighbors to me up for adoption William we're lucky to have William Madame rescue legally and expertise with regard\nTo exotic some small animals and including burnt so\nUm this week we did see that we had taken in a grouping of different birds um different species of birds and some of those are available for adoption cameras can we have about\nMinute before a break so maybe we can start just conversation but I'm tells a little bit about um what but still available for adoption of the birds that we received\nAlready uh so um we had a number of of love birds coming around Nineteen of him so that we we put up for adoption on Thursday um we've adopted out a few of those but we still have more available for adoption ourselves which now are those ones that are available for visiting at any time you could just walk in the um\nAnd if you decide you want to adopt you could start that process right then and there and adopt him that\nDay and those were adopting out his pairs since they're\nAngel she [laughter]\nShe makes a dachshund and a blue ... that's ... [laughter]\nYeah I Would call her a blue any anyway [laughter] [laughter] well we\nGot what we noticed over the last well it's been a couple of months now is that where we let her outside she actually will not go out into the\nDoor thing somebody somebody's out there okay she'll she'll watch shows than modern door she'll bark and back and let you go out and you say okay go go and then she will run out there you're four or five steps look back go drink another five six steps look back yet and ensure darts or look back\nAnd then take some time that you go to the bathroom and you know all those things were golly what what could we do\nYeah um does she when she finishes does she run back to you and back inside pretty quick\nYeah yeah uh yeah I Would say on the unknown to us that something front and are out there\nUh I've had it with my own that I have to do exactly what you do now\nAnd what I've been doing what we can do with that is as they go out like you said keep coach in good go and just take half a step back and a little bit back more and even throw a couple of treats out in the yard so she's being rewarded for going out on her own and then build that distance up again\nThen when she goes out on her own and comes goes party then comes back in Jack Potter\nSo it's like super good job you're going to get paid for with a super trait\nOkay I've uh I've tried the first part of that right yeah well a washer should go out and then when she kind of gets\nKind of remind wash you'd want to do all backup at all are going to the house but then as soon as she looks up emergency anything anybody actually comes yeah and it gets a little [laughter] gets a little or dating\nSometimes yeah if I just a little bit to ... biggest stamps to go back in ... she's getting paid for going out and we should get some ah good success [noise] a think tank and I say thank you thinks everyone Conan we will be back in just a minute [noise]\n\n\nFox News I'm Karen McHugh chalk up one for the record books in game three of the world series\nTeen innings the longest game in the world series history not only by innings but also by time seven hours in twenty minutes after a game three began here at Dodger Stadium max Muncie hit a game winning home run into the seats and Los Angeles beat Boston three to two\nLocks you Jared ... leads the series two games to one the FBI arrest an ardent supporter of the president who suspected of sending more than a dozen bombs to prominent Democrats\nAre saying is in a federal detention center here in Miami on Monday he will go before a federal judge he faces five federal charges which could end up with forty eight years spent in prison investigators are saying the case still continues\nThey're trying to determine if there could be more explosive devices out there and if they had any\nHelp boxers Steve Harris again this is Fox News [noise]\n[noise] whether you call the regular old\nRegan coal guy he's moving has closed the fish and if you're listening to some\nOf these calls you and I walk I Do believe salutes bands of all sizes Hansi I Am\nAfter some of the stories we're hearing to you'll find your side and\nGreat price range selection great experience\nWhat is unexpected is how hard we work after the sale to keep your\nHonesty integrity discipline\nThe core values or why we grow every year and why we continue to inquire more dealerships experienced a shot and proclaim dealing and come visit our new Ford dealership in Indian on\nAt nova or faculty or rock stars we're talking best selling author who writes scholars and professionals with deep industry experience [noise] don't teach adults don't you start up here for patients boil a cyber attack I\nDon't think you're settling with an education\nMostly not haver twenty four and never heard that one of my family county rallies on that\nPerfect sense that companies the most around here there's a shortage of nurses computer engineers in cybersecurity experts [noise] guess who's filling these job no regrets\nMany often get to pick from multiple job offers [noise] don't think you're settling with a Nobel educate\nFreeze overnight and it will get breezy Sunday will be a windy day partly sunny skies in a high a fifty eight strong winds out of the northwest at ten to twenty miles per hour and on Monday day three sunny and warm or again with the highest sixty three that's the latest news radio ten forty W.

I got ... are coming out could come up with a lot like a little more pure\nGray um usually a\nGloves doesn't necessarily help all that much if it's ... if it's a case of she is mistaking what you're putting in the caves as being a a treat potentially um it's pretty common for for guinea pigs\nUm to identify anything that's coming in the cage as being like a toy or treat that they're going to chew on um I Know a lot of different uh\nFolks and then we actually do in the league is well we'll give them treats and things like small carrots and whatnot so any of those things that are coming in they they automatically assume was food and they don't have the best eyesight so I'd be willing to sort of low should everything like that on your hands\nA lot um\nOkay well I'm not really okay I Want to work ... ... ... ... was more um\nGotcha um sometimes what they'll do is go through their eyesight isn't all that that great but I have a very good sense of smell um they'll smell some of those chemicals and even maybe doesn't smell like food to us if they can smell it even through the gloves or they might try to to take a bite thinking that it's food\nUm so what I recommend doing this makes your hands are nice and clean and don't have any any a new center on there\nA blazing the smells fruity or anything like that\nUm and I tried bringing 'em out and then I bring them out of the cage and maybe have like a little play pin or having sitting in your lap and interact with them that way and see how they're doing or if there's a difference between a hand going in the cage and then how they are just outside of the cage I'm\nLike I said sometimes they'll build that association with things coming in you must be food so they're going to try it especially that happens to smell like it to him\nOh well\nThanks Judy and if you if you still have trouble and you have other questions you just reach out to us um when you get you hooked up with William at south courage to answer more questions for you and help you with that they can\nKeep working through it sometimes it takes you know a few things um tried it and then at that historically try something else ... and get back with us um if need be [noise]\nI wanted to do a shadow of smart um yeah it's a luck to shut up to say hello to doors Anderson from Nevada oh awesome yeah go to know from this week said thank you very much doors and thank you for listening and everyone else of course yeah it's awesome yeah just wanted to say Hi that's awesome so do we want to go trivia", "show_name": "ARL Connection with Animal Rescue League", "year": "2018", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "27"}
