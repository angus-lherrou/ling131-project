another very ... about what you need to be doing to set them up\nSo as it gets colder colder they are comfortable as comfortable can be it's safe so um and you know that talking about a housing even for our community cats that are out there providing some sort of\nHousing and you can do lots of really creative things with that or even you know dog houses that you put drawing and stuff that the cats can actually go in those community cats or you know you can take a plastic\nA storage containers and cut a hole out and again but ... straw and so they can go in\nOr towels or blankets and get

the cost of living in a neighborhood that are doing well right um but may not have a designated I'm\nRight in the community cares for these cats so\nWell sometimes on knowing what you might think it's your cat but it's five other people's can write on\nI've heard that story many times a\nA N best thing you can do with those cats I mean those are cats they want to and are\nWanting to live outside like they have been for years if you look at him they're very healthy they're groomed their you know it getting food like you said um\nYou maybe the net and the two neighbors two doors down can be feeding it but getting those animals spade or neutered to help with the elation control of them but continue to feed them and give them water and again shelter here as it gets cold your community cares for these cats\nIt's cool yeah because like you said they live at the that's the laws yeah they look good then everything's going well right and the worst thing you can do for those causes pull him out of that environment yep list they want to come into your house than yet boil McCain's right but yeah\nAnd that being said if you have a house cat set for some reason or another you cannot keep\nThe answer is not to take your house cat that's been sleeping on your couch in your bag\nAnd using the litter box and sitting by you at the table and put them outside\nBecause you don't want them inside anymore you don't want the cat anymore though that's not we're talking about here we're talking about community cats that can be feral that could be semi Farrell they can be cats that I've been living outside in the community and maybe people of tame them over a period of time\nUm those cats are are outside cats were so don't take your inside cat and put 'em outside a\nDarn code so you know don't have the laws don't have the survival skills right you know just because the cat and it's got close doesn't mean okay now it's going to adopt tomorrow and survive it's going to go through a very ... a lot of hardship and come as no good\nRight yep so those cats you need to re home or take to a shelter show that they can be cared for and re homed yeah do different things humanity cats
