Sunday Morning\nAnd are just right around the corner we're going to be starting to talk about prostate yes garden preparation maybe some task and some tourists to do before that quite happens and um you know I was looking through some of the Iowa State extension research\nAnd it looks like you know average frost date is going to be kind of France central Iowa\nOf I'll get a mid October so that is just knocking at our doorstep oh yeah it is right around the corner [laughter] have you kind of amazing I don't know where the summer when I just it's gone and spring I feel like spring summer and I the whole the whole gardening season this year it was really challenging so\nHopefully you're able to persevere throughout all of our challenges but it is it is hard to believe it's\nBeen a ... year for sure and I think the farmers are none too thrilled with all this rain that we're getting now\nWhich we could have had earlier in the summertime so but they're getting out there and and doing what they can and I guess home gardeners are probably winding up their harvest as well now you mentioned you've still got some potatoes big what are what other fruits and vegetables are you still harvesting\nSo um we have to do some potatoes and it just seems like the window of opportunity on that this especially in the last couple of weeks has been so sparse yeah I Know it's raining we'd have like one day or you have like half a day where you can maybe do it if you can\nKind of the most challenging frustrating thing this season so far so we have a potatoes and we also have some pepper still that look great\nUm I like to freeze peppers actually so I like to to do just do dice them up and freedom okay yes okay or if it's like a bell pepper I like to uh go ahead and you know cut the tops off the seed and cut them into strips of the heat a tease them throughout the winter\nSmart yes he's well they do freeze very well and actually I like to use 'em some onions as well with that and then I have a feed a mixed ready to go just ready to stir fry a\nVeto sounds good I Know yeah it's called burger getting hungry [laughter]\nSo that's what we have to do a little bit of a remaining there's always some herbs that I always feel like I Would like to dry town of ... I haven't quite done that yet\nYeah so do do you are you seeing things like a lettuce cabbage kale carrots radish what what\nAre you yeah eating right now so we're not really were pretty much done seeding but we're harvesting radishes were also harvesting kale probably in the next week or two it's still pretty small baby kill\nAnd it just has it been growing as well with the temperatures that we've been I met a lot of sunlight either ... you know it's a little on the low side a lettuce is will have also baby lettuce is and spinach\nSo we're trying to have some of those cool season crops that are really pulling through ... the whole time I feel like\nIt just was spring not really having a lot of greens ... is our opportunity to have them but it's been raining like every other day when excuse to not eat ... [laughter] rainy so they've they've been doing great there just needs some sunlight to kind of\nPush them alone [laughter] oh that's funny now we did have someone had joined us on the phone we've got filled with a question good morning Phil how can we help yeah\nMorning I was just going to say a march on green beans and ... ... accurate went they just\nEnd up there that I wrote it well\nWhat do you think do you think it's the the season that has made the difference or is it a special cult a bar or some some green green thumb you have\nYeah we we well I think about my\nBut the um the Dahlia tumors dried out too much [laughter] so this year but I'm going to do I have I just happened to have a bunch of chopped straw\nAnd my garage is nice and dry and once I dig them clean them off a little bit let them dry out just just to the surface dry out\nAnd then I'll pack away and that strong hopefully that'll help them\nOr keep a little bit of moisture but not be too moist so that they get moldy and mhm and yang gross so I Will have to check on him throughout the winter time just to see how they're doing and if there's any critters that find their way for sure 'cause dry straw was a wonderful nesting material for all sorts of little\nLittle creatures that might live in the basement so ask have keep it keep it clean and tidy so\nYou talked about the elephant ears Dahlia is yet also to ... you can do this\nWith as well ... as well and now there are a few others that you like to say can I come to mind handles do well\nUm there are those are the main ... idioms you can do short dwell anything if it's something that you might buy from in the little bags from the display at the front of the the lows are Home Depot you know the things that the big colorful cardboard pictures attached to them things coming back so those are the thing the types of things that you might over winter\nUh down in down in your basement I'm\nSo that that's that's typically what I Do remember to label your boxes [laughter] when you put things in there\nAnd so you know what it is that you're pulling out I had that issue with my dad is I just kinda threw them all in a box and they were all very different things and three live ... three died one lived and I don't know which one it is 'cause I didn't get it to bloom this year [laughter] ahah though it's still a mystery it might be a multi year mystery [laughter]\nWhen he was kind of shy or let's see uh we have someone who's joined us on the phone lines yes good morning Myrtle year on W.

canning jars that they don't do it\nYou know you you get caught in the ... or\nYeah yeah yeah yeah\nI'd hoped that light and the problem like you know keep the ... drove over a\n... that's a good and I I like that a lot uh the chicken wire has worked pretty well for me although it's kind of a pain to cause I I buy the chicken wire and then I cut it the links that I I Want to go around my plant and then I have to fold it over and then I have to get on my sharp ends of the cut wire folded in and\nIt's it's a bit of a cottage industry to create these little kj I'll go around I play live\n... ...

appreciate that [laughter]\nThey this oh go she remembers a lot of her mother says\nOh fantastic oh look at I Love about gardening just that just passing it along from generation to generation to the next\nOkay bye thank you heard of him where it'll\nBe a pretty good tip I've not heard that with the ... and that the research that a little bit sure but if it works it works I guess there's probably something I preservative or something I don't know interesting yeah I have to look it up\nBut I Do I Do love learning about gardening from the people who who came before from my grandparents and my parents that are being passed down in\nYour family yes actually started gardening with a became interested in it when I Would help my great grandma and she had so many ... she was known for ... and I'm all you know all sorts of colors you'd save them year after year mhm and I just keep those growing on and actually still when I met the farm\nThe one thing that really takes me back is the smell of bill\nOkay has that is something that I'm like oh that's kind of use it but that was that was from you know remind me so much of her gardens and everything like that what about you\n[noise] um I yeah I definitely learned from my parents and my grandparents that come from an agricultural background and the kind of like the the smell of deal for you this one day this past summer of a friend brought in\nUm some cherry tomatoes that he had just picked off the vine and I popped one in my mouth and it was just it was like being transported um I I went straight back to\nMy family's vegetable patch my grandparents vegetable patching it just it took me right back they're so pretty strong pretty powerful associations with gardening and family especially like when you get one of those nice like sun ripened hills dorm mhm ... yeah that's exactly what this was and it was just magical [laughter] slowly magical\nSo wonderful yeah yes and I'm sure a lot of our listeners have stories like that as well and uh\nWe're ready you know looking forward to the next growing season I Am a little bit of time to take a little bit of a break though for winter and before you know what you know seed catalogs are going to be coming in and throughout the gardening today program especially in the wintertime we always have a lead a guest on that have interesting topics that we'd like to talk about\nAnd uh we have some fun ones lined up as well we we do and\nAnd we there's a lot of local people who are the providers who we tend to bring in um that's a a lot of fun to find out who's growing what nearby that we can that we can grow here and um I've I've over bought\nOn quite a few things that I get so excited on the show I did too [laughter]\nAll right well we have to take the break for the national news and weather and\nIn a few minutes to take more phone calls in a while but I think so [noise]\nTo wait to go ... and I arch radio station and on your age the radio Katie are being\nRevealed morning doubled you wait Joe [noise]\nI Know today's top stories from Des Moines news propaganda severe weather species news radio and forty do hold you\nGrateful for what we can continue\nChemicals\nChemicals are okay so one of the things that I've had success with is doing a fall application of herbicides on turf where I Want to build a new bed and um it kills it off pretty well in the fall and then when spring rolls around you don't have to have to deal with it's pretty much dead\nNow there are things that if you don't want to use chemicals we would say you know put black plastic over it or heavy landscape cloth and try and kill off the grass that way [noise]\nOkay so that that's or or use a spade a spade the turf where you want to put up\nAnd then in spring depending on the kind of soil that you have you may not need to do much of anything\nWhat I discovered when I built my rose bed I thought I was going to tell it I I went to great lengths to find a pillar to borrow to let my bed and then finally just stuck shoveling the ground and discovered that I've got basically like brownie mix it's it's perfect black soil I didn't need to tell anything I just dug holes and put my roses and [noise]\nUm you you might want to tell a lot of experts are saying avoid the Tiller as much as possible these days because it just it's like a ... like sending a tornado through your neighborhood it just it just a release stirs up all of the\nThe macro rise a little plant life and and microscopic ecosystem that's in the soil and is so good and we were the plants and we'd see do you just bring 'em right up what\nJessica what do you do when you build a new bed so for us you know what the farm it was previously corn and soybeans a but also at our home garden I've done a like card putting out cardboard\nBasically in the fall just kind of pending it down with like landscape a pen and now we're going to kind of mother that grass as well and then this will be like Melissa's that easy to be work work when you're ready to work it\nSo that is a tip that that I use otherwise you could use you know like the guy said to kill the grass yeah she's
