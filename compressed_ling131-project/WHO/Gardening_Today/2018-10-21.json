place to get a hold of us and we'd love to help you out we've been talking a lot about fall color right now you know today as well as helping out some of our listeners but maybe some Trump's suggestion mhm it's a great time will be the planting knows\nIt is it is a good time to plant those um and some of the trees as well we're getting towards the tail end of the planting season but you do still have a few weeks left\nOr to get those things in the ground so if you are like me maybe they've been lingering spring and need to go in you can do it now or\nYou can go out and see what you can find at the garden centers that's a great day to grab a pumpkin spiced latte and uh and go just go to where the garden centers and and have a good time a wonderful day of it\nAnd see what you can find now don't necessarily expect there to be a lot of deals right now there will be some deals but since it is prime\nAnd he thinks he's in the things that are super duper and fall are going to be full price right now so just be prepared for that [laughter] now we had a listener who texted him with a question about how to get rid of dailies with out spraying them with herb aside and do without Jane them up\nOh sorry that backwards without digging them up [noise]\nNow a lot of people take a daily loses this one little plant that you pop in the ground but they're they're often instances where daily naturalized I had a patch a couple of ... like this at my house\nAnd they don't flower very well there's too much shade and even when they do flower they're not the most exciting ... in the world I call them ditch lilies\nAnd ah so I've been working on getting rid of him and I'm not digging them up because it's a huge pass like a ten by ten Patrick ...\nUm and so what I've been using his round up spring with round up and ah that I Need to go back and do another spray falls a great time to use herbicides\nIf you don't like using chemicals there are options um though if you don't like using a you know the synthetic herbicides you can use or beside all vinegar\nWhich is a um high concentration of vinegar usually have to buy it at a specialty shop is not just like kitchen miner sure though that something you can try which of course there's still a chemical even though it's it's a little bit more natural or organic\nUm another thing you might try is covering it in black plastic very thick heavy black plastic covered over maybe some bricks or rocks to weigh it down so it doesn't um doesn't fly away and the wind\nAnd you might have to keep that on for a year yet there's basically smothering these plant yeah ... keeping them I'm deprived of light\nAnd water from rainfall and snow and um and that will eventually kill them off now a lotta people recommend this it's not my absolute favorite because you're also kill or drive out other things like the\nThe floor at the micro Flora and fauna that are in your soil worms will move out of there because there's the ecosystem is getting a little lack of due so um I ... it can be done and it is chemical free and it is a completely valid way to get rid of large patches of plants you don't want [noise]\nBut um but you may have some other side effects that are in his shoe\nGas to keep that in mind hopefully work for you yes [noise]\nAnd it looks like we also have a Sylvie on the line good morning Sylvia you're on gardening today\nThey brought up a quick question then I remembered so if I may be a good time to get rid of this ah this patch of poison ivy that developed about two years ago and I never seem to be quite able to get on top of it\n[noise] phone fault is assigned time no poison ivy right now it's got some pretty spectacular fall color [laughter] and um\nWell it does bring the family it's a pretty place\nIs gorgeous and then you know and then wildlife absolutely loves it too it's just it's if it's right where you're going to be spending a lot of time in your garden with you know flip flops it's something you don't necessarily want around so falls to find time to spray 'em and the reason we say\nWe say that is because in fall plants are preparing to go dormant for the winter or their trends locating a lot of carbohydrates or from the foliage down into the roots\nAnd so rather than going roots up to the leaves are going the other direction and so they're taking up that chemical and really distributing it very well down to the roof and you get a better kill good\nThat being said it will pop up again one once once we're able not doing it sound like you've been battling they were like yeah you're going to have more than one\nI've had a problem it in a month like my daily and shake garden yeah you know\nAfter we read that are are we had our laundry done for a project with Easter like watershed okay do they totally read that are a lot and I'm not saying that brought it in the most part I'm not saying that but it just about ... ...\nYeah probably there may have been a Caesar roots and the and the the soil already they just right and birds right up crazy too and I and I've\nBeen I tried the hot water thing and I'm\nNot saying it didn't work but you know I was always worried about getting it on me you know yeah yeah so I kind of like a natural thing so any advice now that you know when it came to you and I had a professional calm and I told him to be real careful just you know that was early in the air just spray the poison ivy but you know it just seems to keep coming\nBack yeah it does yeah so are are you open to spraying yourself ... doing the same herself and are you open to a systemic or beside like glyphosate\nWell yeah I mean well I tell all my other stuff\nYes you're going to be very careful with it you can use it yeah I have very on contact on that poisoned\nAnd I have a piece of advice on what might help with that they have um if you have a spray or just a little hand held sprayer with a wand of course you can get a cone that goes over the novel that really directs that and if you don't if you can't find a cone here's what you do you get a soda bottle\nAnd you cut the bottom of it off so you have the the the the the opening part the spout and spout goes over the end of your watering want your ... your your spray one and then you tape it on with with Pedro taper duct tape or something like that you spray it on and so then you have this very very focused\nCone that you can put right down over the little piece of of poison ivy or or plant that your spring we that you're spraying spray and that should keep the spray in within the cone guess of of of of contact now be careful though because when you\nAh move your ... to the next plant there will be liquid\n... that has sprayed and hit the edge of the cone and it will drip so be careful with your drip and maybe get a little tap and shake it off right over the poison ivy and then you can move on to your next bottom should I\nKept pointing at first and like put just make sure I get it on that dam that goes into the ground or no\n[noise] you you can do that that's what we call cutting treat however I\nMy I myself would not do that number one because you have to be so careful with the poison and also right now if you have foliage the foliage will do a good job of catching up that chemical are just more surface area to look it up All right yeah\nAnd other than real quick 'cause I Know you run out of time real quick if I don't see myself doing that\nAnd the other advice\nLearn to love poison ivy [laughter] if we\nThink of anything will certainly it will certainly mentioned it after all right because we're getting ready for that day and brought it All right good luck with it until the Arctic provide [noise] yeah it is a shame that poison ivy is such a fair [noise]\nIt is a lovely yet and it's not invasive it's like if you think about a\nA Virginia ... which is also lovely but it goes everywhere poison ivy\nMinds of manners a lot better than that but yeah you sure don't want to go through the tulips if you have poison ivy\nSo [laughter] so we're going to take a break for the national news and be back after that to start our our gardening today and we hope to stay with us and\nPose the question\nThe only way to do more and I arch radios and on your age the radio DDR being\nDublin you wait Joe [noise]\nYou know today's top stories from Des Moines news traffic jam severe weather station news radio morning\nThere was a ... a fantastic pumpkins I mean we couldn't go ten feet without finding like the perfect pumpkin and then another ten feet oh no this is the perfect pumpkin and then no this is the perfect pumpkin and so we walked away with the way more pumpkins than we need [laughter]\nBut we had to have them so\nIt it was it was a street so what are you going to do with the Irish are gonna are you going to paint are you going to car when I Would like to do the ah how old we will\nCar some level of the bigger ones but we also got some small ones will probably pay those [noise] and just have fun with them yeah I don't know if I'm going to cook any maybe\nI Do actually [laughter] actually I just pulled out a bunch of pumpkin puree from the freezer and they've been in the deep freeze since last year mhm and uh so I have I've been asked by the family to make pumpkin cheesecake [noise]\nAlthough that sounds fantastic ... finally proved that as well okay I don't have a recipe for it yet I'll just find one and hopefully it'll work out for me\nAnd also just like pumpkin scones and pumpkin is so easy to cook with as well as just takes a long time to roast and basically like a squashed like an acorn squash or butter or not you're going to ... get some holes in it so and then just put it in your oven at high heat from a really long time in because until it becomes tender\nYes now last year when I when I made my pumpkin puree it took me to try the first try I did not roasted right I um I just cut it up and put it on a a baking pan is stuck in in the oven and it just dried out it got better and it just it did not work\nAnd then I tried again and what I did the second time was cut them these were pumpkins made for baking so they sound like a pie pumpkin pie pumpkin yeah and I cut it in half put the ... side down\nPut the water in the pan and then covered it with foil OK I didn't put that in there and that kept it ... in in drought didn't get better and it just did absolutely perfectly\nAnd from there as it was easy just you know\nSet up and throw in the food processor and you're going to go\nYes and one of our regular guest on the program Nicole Jonas with red granite farms yeah\nThey always have a super selection of you know the little heirloom like the French skins and yeah\nAll of those are the Cinderella pumpkin yeah people might know demands and so they've been bringing like their trailer full of all these assorted different pumpkins and you know orange and different shades of orange and blue and white Lou even like the blue pumpkins and like funky fucking dreamy blue yes yes\nYes they look like Frankenstein pumpkin leaves you and and if you've ever picked any of these like French pumpkins up their heavy they're solid yeah I mean it's like all good meeting there can meet [laughter] yes full flow they've you've probably seen some of those at garden centers as well even grocery stores\nHave been starting to carry some more if the specialty pumpkins and it's always fun to see the diversity there and I always like to pick up a few\nIt is remarkable diversity because a pumpkin is of course a squash and if you think about diversity and than decorative squash and ornamental cords and it's all it's all in the same family and so there's a lot of genetics to work with there and get some fun mix ups\nAnd we did find one really cool kind of a long\nUm um striped one is yellow and pale yellow striped with ... all over it man uncle and then it was just out there that ... the pumpkin ranch they they kind of do a mix of things out in the field so it's now not all the classic orange pumpkin you'll find the little tiny white ones are the little um [noise] the goose neck\nUm boards and um the the funky reddish orange seen as dark reddish orange pumpkin yes those things are so cool and then of course the Frankenstein pumpkins which is not their actual name but that's what I call them tons of on out there lots of fun to be at\nThis time of year in our neck of the woods yes to the season Republicans\nMy favorite season [laughter] wait at all here for this you know quite honestly [laughter]\nSo good I'm Glad it's finally here so yes we have yet to what we've we always gross and pumpkins at the farm nothing too serious of course but the we have a few that we will ... and you have a tip and I remember you share to tip with our listeners this last year it leave hips I\nI've I have not tried and so I have to put that disclaimer on there but when you carve your jak and lanterns a ... they often get pretty rotten pretty quick can that can be an issue so some of the tips that I have found\nTo prolong the life of your jak Leonard is to dip it in I'm In a diluted bleach so do the carving yes carpet you know just as you normally would\nAnd then get a big five gallon bucket if your pumpkin fits in that if not you may have may have to up size your your bucket\nAnd put a dilution of bleach and I don't know what the delusion is but it's just enough to make the water kind of a a decent disinfectant\nAnd ... the pumpkin and there and make sure it gets soaked all around inside and out and then take it out you know let it drip drip dry and um and then that kills the bacteria\nThat is on the surface of the pumpkin from your hands from the field from the the carving utensils and things like that and and we'll hope prolong the life of your pumpkin\nAnother tip that I have seen it seems to make a lot of sense when you carve your pumpkin\nTake Vaseline mhm and cover that those cuts edges so you know the love triangle eyes and the jagged teeth\nCover those with petroleum jelly and that will help or retain moisture so you don't get your little soggy liar so your your pumpkin needs dentures yeah you know they have occurred in the cause they they get dried out and and kind of limp\nSo that's another thing to try also seen 'em once you had at carved\nTicket die Lucian of Lysol and\nIn a spray bottle and spread it down and that's another disinfectant trying bacteria and then spray it fairly regularly um until you're ready to check it into the compost bin yes so things to try and I'd be interested if anybody if any of our listeners have tried any of these pumpkins these Jack o' lantern preservation techniques\nTo give us a call and let us know what works for you or what does not work\nOr if you've tried something and it was an absolute flop let us know because that's that's helpful information and ah\nAnd looks like we're going to take the next break if our program ... back in just a few moments to talk more with you on gardening today\n\nLike that too many worthless off of the coffee mugs old you're going to

Joe\nGardening today in the beautiful fall day Jessica ... with you\nIn certain lots of great questions was kind of been all over the gardening map this morning and really\nWe had had some great texts that came in we also want to remind our listeners if you do have any text or questions for us we would love to hear from you\nFive one five to eat for ten forty and also give us the text it five one five nine eight nine ten forty and uh we will get their talk with you on the air force and that's the text if you're a little bit shy so either way I have to wait to get a hold of us\nAnd uh some of the tax that we've had a one of our listeners\nWas wondering if there's a chemical for nematodes the fall forked carrots and the new location where a disappointment so first off if you've had and the ... and carrots you're going to see there might be a little misshapen you might have some little call like things on them\nYou know little little ... not ... yes the classic yeah that's that's a sign of ... and ... is a very small worm like parasite that it travels through the soil through moisture in the soil and their microscopic and um there are good the Mentos and there are a bad knee Mentos\nAnd if you have any ... situation it's it's pretty easy to tell because you will see those route not now of course a carrot is a route crop so you'll see I ... looked like works on the carrot or is that what I mean look like yeah I'm\nThere are products called me mad aside that you can use there are some products that are they're they're chemical and then there's some that are rated organic and a quick Google Search will will easily get you to both kinds so you have options and either either route\nAnother thing you can try is a trap crop have you ever used a trap crop for nematodes and and you're\nNot for us we have been very lucky and we haven't had to really deal with them and knock on wood I Know exactly my time is probably coming to an had nothing to do\nSo a written ... are often an issue on tomatoes and but people will do sometimes near tomatoes or other crops that may have maybe affected by the ... is the plant a trap crop\nI'm an marigolds make an excellent trap crops will get a vigorous kind of a a toll growing marigolds\nLike that just the classic French or the African marigolds and plant those in a row near your tomatoes and the the idea is that ... they like both but they like miracles more some of them go to the merits\nSchools and you can trap them and then you you pull the mirror gold out once it's you know towards the end of the the the whole the whole thing roots and all and that'll take that the name of toes with it hopefully and so you've trapped them and that trap crop and you bundle it up and don't put it in your compost noodles survive\nJust send it out with a garbage and that and then hopefully you have decreased the NATO population now I have heard some people that speculate\nMight be made few planted two things that neighborhoods like maybe you'll end up with double the nematodes but I Do hear some pretty good feedback that that trap crops works pretty well for them so that might be one to try if you don't want to spring for chemicals or or even the organic treatments a plus you get marital no\nYou can't beat that yeah and Kathy we want us to say miracles are edible [laughter]\nSo we got that in it's actually pretty spicy if you ever had one\nI have not know their race now but they have a you know a certain a certain smell to them I've seen them sometimes and cut flowers you know sometimes not ah but\nI always have marigolds when I had my miracle but yeah that it's a very unique and very particular smell it doesn't really pop up and perfumes much but um it if you if you smell near a gold you know you knew exactly what it", "show_name": "Gardening Today", "year": "2018", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "21"}
