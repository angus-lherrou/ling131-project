so I mean it just came and\nEasier to host things off before you bring the\nIs and some of it I did you know and interestingly um it was a little difficult to bring all this stuff in only it was also heavy because it's been raining so much so everything was very well watered and and for the most part pretty clean so that part was really nice but some of my bigger things like my brother Manziel hole\nThat sucker was so heavy I mean still very only a match and you know I over winter that won by a cutting it back just to stumps basically like um I think it's standing ... they probably have like twenty four or thirty inch branches you know and there are about\nAdam now two inches around and as a as a plant I've had for many years yeah and I just laugh it off and then I put it in the semi doormen see by stop stop watering and write well normally it's dry when I bring it in ... so it's going to take a while for it I'm sure it's going to sprout back out again and all that but [noise]\nIt's okay we'll be okay [noise] yeah\nI mean that's something you almost wonder whether you're better off waiting to lump it off until the soil ... well I wouldn't\nFit in my house so well is

nice if you're digging them when the soil is not absolutely saturated I Know and it's been so wet it's kinda bizarre yeah how wet it's been this fall\nAnd it's all my fault because I've been complaining about you know having to you know carry my gallon jugs out to water at reaping all so\nWith that although I have to say my shoulders are so grateful for the rain\nYeah well and you know typically fall is pretty uh a lot drier than spraying in particular and I ... when I I often plant a lot in the fall mostly because I just I tend to be busier and the spring and I don't get it done and whatever but uh\nI got all this stuff planted this fall at a great time first part of September ... and I thought oh it's going to be a lot of work this fall I'm going to have to water water water

I had regular pineapple stage and then the golden pineapple stage and it gets\nThese spikes beautiful bright red flowers how I've had pretty much and they're they're sweet and there's like a little hint of but it does taste like pineapple e mixed with a bit a bit of stage\nSo I'm I brought in the whole flower for you to just ... I Know our itself\nAnd then I made pineapple sage corn freighters\nAnd also pineapple sage pineapple salsa which is slightly spicy it's got some uh supposedly pepper in it smells delicious and it it is delicious so\n[laughter] I mean I just try to yes these fritter so we have a picture of these up on our website at W. H. O. radio dot com so there's like a use the leaf then and these\nAre hell you're flour I our unusually at all on minimum age I mean other people do and I can see the flour and this also too yes yeah and ... it's so pretty and\nI'm a a friend of mine came over the other day and she has I she taste is oh I can hear the crunch crunch up I'm like good\nI Love this kind of stuff Cathy you're okay thank you this was one of the hardest recipes in a way for my animal flowers book\nMy stepmother was a horrific cook which she inherited from her mother\nAnd I mean some we I learned to cook very early on because if my father or I cooked\nBefore she got home from work then you know we knew we I mean she would take hamburger meat and just needed and mix it shouldn't put anything into it\nBut you know two and then cook it in the oven until it turn gray I mean it was just you know nasty and tough and ... but she made one thing there were a few things that she made that were really good and sometimes on a on a friday night\nJust cook bacon and then she'd make corn freighters and of course I'm In the bacon fat which you know I couldn't couldn't be better that's delicious yeah and um but she had no memory of them so I mean for years I searched for acorn fritter in a recipe\nAnd that was as good and finally ended up creating this the one thing I forgot when I was doing it yesterday 'cause it's been over a year since I made these 'cause the recipe in the book said frozen corn ... [noise]\nWhat I forget what I have to you know we're right in everything is yes you get frozen corn but you let it\nSaw [laughter] and I did and uh you know so you're putting this you know mixture this batter that you know it's still for an as its\nThawing of course it's getting more liquidity now shut 'em but an oil in oil yeah which is and that's a problem yeah had to [laughter] you know to swap family and higher kitchen of but that's also has some spice to it too that's good yeah\nI'll thank for bringing that in ... well it yeah the salsa has has a\nCrushed pineapple and you know minus the Jews and it has um\nSweetened lemon juice and there's a a brand name I forget what it's called but it's usually used in cocktails okay as we did I say lemon lime juice ... and I'm ... peppers that has the pineapple phage flowers and then some\nUm red onion chopped up also for for a little tang and for some more color yeah no it's ...\nIt was good that was a really good it's common cause that's going to get me hopefully get me to lunch here you know [laughter] you know we all primed up now\nAll right well we didn't get a couple of questions I thought it would be good for us to see if we can address some of these because um I think a lot of these are on some people's minds here one of them are they came in with a listener text and is now a good time to get rid of creeping Charlie and how\nAnd uh the short answer is yes are now is a good time to apply apply broadly herbicides to lawns if you have creeping Charlie in flower beds uh this'll be a very different tactic 'cause you can't put a broadly herbicide down you would kill\nMany other things in your perennial border right at the same time ah but in the lawn yes it is now and the thought behind that is this time of year\nThe plants are starting to go dormant so cripple Charlie's perennial they're starting to go dormant they're pulling more carbohydrates down into the root systems than they normally would be so when you apply a herbicide it brings that down and has a more complete kill [laughter]\nAh that's the that's the idea behind it and so applying this time of year can be really good usually about mid October I think is when we usually say well through October\nIs when you can do this work and so um you still have time to get it done the problem lately it's been it's just been raining too much right um it's been really difficult because you usually have to have a couple of days before a couple of days after where you don't think it's gonna rain um to apply\nSome of this herbicide well and and in in a flower bed with it as ... as it's been you also may have some luck better luck digging it up yeah I mean you know it just it\nPolls right out when it's this wet um hopefully you could get a huge chunk of it just um you know 'cause it's all trailing and train ride together so if you find a piece of it you just start polling and making sure you're not doing it so rough that you're breaking it apart and you can you can follow that thing all the way through [laughter]\nUh so that's also an option too and of course in those situations if it's really bad you can also apply a non selective herbicide something that kills anything that it touches but you'd have to do that very carefully right yeah [noise]\nType in Charlie's difficult you know if you don't get every last piece of it it will come back\nI like to take an approach I like uh like do both of these things so I'll go through in hand remove as much as I can wait like maybe a couple of weeks to see if or what grows back and then I hit it yeah what what little there\nI don't know and it is an edible herb as well I've heard that and yeah it's a limited family have a square stumps out of that really fragrant right if it's got a flower that looks just like a lot of different ...\nYeah and a witch and ms family also means that it\nSpreads yes but it's like meant then does yes which reminds me I have to one thing I have to do is that that's in a pot is move my a chocolate mint\nFrom on my porch into into the ground to the ... into the raised bed once the pineapple sage dies ban yeah now plant my my boats to\nOh yeah and I got a great great deal on on bulbs yeah you were saying you found some nice bombs yeah I did at a fair way of all places\nYeah and um and I have a garlic and I always inter plant I don't bother with ... with daffodils because the critters don't go after that but um all the other built a new plan garlic with it and so then I got garlic growing and it keeps the critters\nHelps keep the charisma and yeah it's great and of course now is perfect time to be planting both yes yeah while remind folks out there that you can always you're the program on our podcast it's available I W H A radio dot com as well as on the radio app\nUm so that's that's something that could be causing them moss um ideally you can always just dig it out but most of the time even if you do that if you don't correct the environmental condition that's favoring the mosque from being there you'll probably get it back\nAnd so that's why we are talking about so a shade is one of those things if you can print up and get more light in the area\nThat's an option sometimes if you have really low fertility in the lawn you can see more and more on his so applying some fertilizer may be good and they're still actually the best time\nIf you're only going to do one application of fertilizer one of the best times to do that is the end of October first part of November So uh you could do that and using a lawn type fertilizer apply it based on the directions on bag um based on the size of your lawn and that's always an option that could help\nBut if you are fertilizing at all this is not likely something that would help you know with the moss\nRight well the other thing is is that it's not well drained yeah and you know certainly air eating it can can help drainage is another one and the other thing is embraced the moss\nYeah you can always do that and I knew\nWe were talking during during the break about you know where they're trying to grow a mosque garden in a public garden and having a real challenge for it and you know sometimes you know if it if it grows celebrate it and and grow different kinds of sauces and they're such beautiful different yeah they are they can be really fun\nAlthough this year has been one that is certainly ideal from authors I don't know if this has been our our listeners issue in in the past or if it's unique to this year\nRight yeah and and so usually like in my experience I typically have in a lawn when I have a lotta moss it's because of poor drainage or compacted soil then leads to pour drainage so\nIf the soil is not particularly compacted but it's like a spot where down spout comes down or a spot that's maybe low that is slow to drain like figuring out how to change drainage patterns might help\nBut if it's it's likely that it's also compacted too so corporations can help a lot with that to help 'em get better infiltration and it may be all three right yeah so um\nYou can always dig and remove it but if you don't address the environmental conditions that are of favoring the moss you'll likely see it again so I'm able to be important to look into those things to let's see I think we can do one more question here and then we have oh no we have bathrooms ready\nLet's see if we can talk to best real quick here and I answer her questions good morning best you're on W. H. O.\nYeah I'm I have an Irish thing that has just well Gail and I just don't know how to bring an end and then try to get it off or how do we get that off before I bring it in\n[laughter] that's a tough situation scale is notoriously very difficult to get rid of and if it is exceptionally bad\nI'm the first thing that comes to mind isn't going to be ideal is to get rid of the plant and start again um because it's so difficult and you wouldn't want to bring it in and potentially has it caused issues on other plants that are indoors well should I take\nIt kinda wipe it off the slip and then how would I start\nOh ah like cutting and a little ... if you can get clean cut ... um you could do that I'm about\nTwo to three inches um remove the lower half of the ... on the lower half of that piece slow move the leaves use a little rooting hormone and stick a man I'd be worried though that you would still have the scale\nEspecially you know in between the league is [noise]\nYeah they are worried I don't get it to go\nOn it that that particular plant um isn't going to a propagate I'm from leaf pieces\nShowing that really need to get rid of the scale of this on the loose with well a lotta times\nYeah you could but they can also be on the stem to so\nWell I I don't like them off the dam and then just throw\nYeah you could try it um I Would definitely keep it isolated from everything else and and watch it very carefully\nAnd edit ... maybe ... you know pulling longer than\nI Would use a a either sand or well drained pouting soil too I\nThink will in water\nYeah water some plants ... a roof and water but they're never as the roots are never as good as they are we right now\nOr I take it in the party so\nI don't know probably not I mean the other thing is you know if you think that you've gotten it all off I'm also maybe spray it with horticultural oil and that that would that would\nBe anywhere any a a retail for ...\nYeah the summer weight horticultural oil yeah when I taught in a in a ... like insecticide area where they say other guys\nJust slipped on the cutting off at that point to the break the joint or bike route\n[noise] so the new routes will form out of that node or ... or the joint so you want to ... a little bit below that I'm\nBetter than just cutting it off in the middle\n[noise] yeah I ... you would want to cut it maybe leave like a quarter of an inch below that node maybe a little bit less\nWell that create your own ... thank you very much You're welcome good luck best okay Bye bye\nYeah so and ... plant it's a very a colorful uh sometimes they call it\nBeef steak plant right right and I don't like because it looks like it's that color yeah the color of meat\n[laughter]\nI really think this and it's got like a ... taxi drivers yeah I think that's why they call it that I don't I I didn't ... I ended up being a Midwest name\n[laughter] uh yeah I'm not going to go there [laughter]\nAll right well we do have to take our next break on the program we'll be back we have several folks who have sent us tax will keep working on that list if you have a tax or a question you like answered nine eight nine ten forty\nNumbered attacks to wait for ten forty is the number to call will be back here and just a couple of minutes on gardening today news radio ten forty W.
