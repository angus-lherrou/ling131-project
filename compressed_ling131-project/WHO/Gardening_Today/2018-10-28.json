especially turning yellow especially if the veins are still green\nUm that's like classic iron deficiencies and and if you did a soil test you'd probably find that your soil has plenty of iron in it the issue is that the ph is such that that iron can't be used by the plants we have to supplement it with a form that can be so that's usually like a\nA key elated form of iron you can find it kind of

H. O. three a weather forecast on channel Thirteen meteorologist against the law [noise]\nMorning it is it's gorgeous sunny morning and I'm Cathy Wilkinson bearish here in the studio with Aaron\nStyle and we've got just people calling in and texting in time I Know I think gardening is on the mind it it really is from from the moment we started out and you can can cause locally it to wait for ten forty or out of\nThe area toll free at eight hundred for six nine forty two Ninety five or ... number of people have and we're trying to\nAnd now we actually were less ... I think we should power okay somebody because I think these are some really good topics Gwen sent us attacks that she has some very large piece of cardboard that she's planning to put down on the garden for winter\nUh assuming I'm trying to set up some new garden bed or clean up a garden bed or something\nUm I mowed down the garden and I can assume that the clumps of grass that grew in the garden will be taken care of by spring using cardboard is that correct it is as well anything else yeah you will you're smothering the garden yeah you're gonna smother the garden\nAnd I think the best way to do this is to lay the cardboard down and then put mulch on top of it mhm it'll help hold the cardboard and place it won't look so funny\nUm and while you will see the cowboys started to break down not a lot of that work happens over the winter but you can still get a lot of that smothering done yeah and you can even what the cardboard to yet before that would help that would help it stick to the ground the end of the mulch right mulch from blowing off or something like that too right yeah\nSo it's a it's a it's a a you can also use six to eight layers of newspaper in the same effect\nUm again wedding it and putting something on top of it like mulch to hold it in place um all of these are great ways and fall is a great time to start this project for spring\nAnd you can also start I'm a ... started as a thing that she called lasagna gardening\nAnd she starts with a layer of cardboard and then I'm a layer of just compost are mulch and then adds a layer of newspaper I'm she builds up to to about a foot or more high\nLA I'm leaves that over winter and by spring a you have something that you can start planting\nIt yeah something very nice yeah start playing yeah yeah so hopefully I Hope so Gwen with her a question we also had somebody fit a text and that they are finishing landscaping their new home and we'd like to put ... material before winter is it too late\nIf you have it already you need to plant it or at least ... in somewhere yeah but if you don't have it either way not filtering by anything\nYeah especially I mean when we say fault planting we're talking September yeah a late August September for most plants um which I hate because it's a little feels a little bit of a misnomer\nUm you know the best time to do this will be Labor Day weekend and that does not feel like fall well and it isn't technically by any means yeah so a fall planting when we say that is a little misleading most of the time we'd like to see it done especially things like perennials and evergreens much earlier like the very beginning of fall late summer\nYou can plant dormant woody plants usually with success\nBut selection right now isn't the greatest walk better selection in the spring\nAnd the plants will likely a performed a little bit better\nBecause it is getting late for that kind of and and you do need to you know the the soil is\nYou know it's still not really dry it out yet from all the ... have been really wet so you don't want to be planting in soil that's just you know Sunday and water law I really got some bulbs put on the ground and I may end up just doing it because I don't know what else to do it but it is kind of wet to be planting yeah well and I have a\nI have a two pineapples sage plants that have basically taken over one whole four by four raised bed and there is there's a ... which I Want to get rid of I don't care for the taste that much in that doesn't bloom so than kind of a waste\nI'm In a tiny little maple ... but the um gold and pineapple sage really got hit by by frost and stopped blooming some polling that out the other one that that\nThe regular pineapple stage is still blooming\nAnd and I love those flowers and yeah it has I may just you know cut them cut them off and and keep them in a a container outside with water and let them you know have more flowers mature on the on the spy\nUm but I Need to pull those up so I can play at my bulbs yeah because it's the raised bed it dried out better it's much in yeah my\nBig difference [noise] ah we also got a question this is good because we've been talking a little bit about dogwoods today on all things which is kinda nice\nUm we had a listener text in a that they've had three pogo to dogwoods in Twenty years from different local suppliers ... go to the dog would is a lovely\nKind of small tree large shrub depending on how you want to describe it has a very layered appearance which is really pretty I think that's where the name comes from two yes [noise] um\nBut ah they've they've all failed and I'm from the same thing the leader dies which moved down the tree seedlings from this ah second tree has survived with no issue\nBut I'm the layering as more open presumably not as maybe as attractive justice for flowering replacement back corner under twenty foot\nFeet neighbors privacy fence on the east side so\nThis is a common issue with the dog would um we've had big issues with it up at Ryman gardens um it's a I don't know if it's a vascular disease or a K anchor both that causes um stem die back mhm a kind of in a big way [noise]\nAnd I go to ... dog would is particularly susceptible so some things that you\nCould use the the the first thing that popped in my mind as does a very similar appearance but would not be impacted by the same diseases is double file by Burnham\nUm which I think it's a gorgeous place yeah and it has that same layered appearance yes and it has flowers roughly the same time as ... dog would um it's maybe about the same size I was gonna say maybe a little bit bigger but no it's probably about the same size so I Would look for a double filed by by\nBurnham and yeah it is I've forgotten about them 'cause you don't see them around much\nAt all I have one in my yard and I loved it so pretty especially in bloom um it's called double file 'cause the flowers kind of line up and two lines down the length of the stem [noise]\nIt's really attractive when that happened to get free and all that [noise] All right\nWell with that hopefully it helps our listener there with that dilemma\nWe are going to break
