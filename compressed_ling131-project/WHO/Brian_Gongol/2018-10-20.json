Canada\nIs a great job Iowa a very very good football team goes for instance a tremendous job appreciate the way they play the fundamental\nSoundness they had was an entire football team always have great place to play a great environment to play in um obviously we didn't play on all things with the same sound this we had only had three driving the first half\nI'm the first one in ... the second one started with a penalty\nOr when it was a turnover on defense they had we had to do that for Syria to defend them to feel goals they got the one touched down late there\nAnd then we got on the ... so they did a great job obviously the ... was windy and I thought they did a tremendous job of managing that run the ball and get moving stand you know getting the first person down on all things we didn't do that and you got to defensive guy sitting here\nAre ... on the field a long time we've obviously got to get them off the field a little bit like they did convert some third downs but on all things we've got to play better and uh it comes back to sound as it comes back to the to not shooting yourself in the foot so that falls directly on me\nAnd I will do a better job and we will come back next week and we'll place down or\nThat you know we often look like the same actually got off to do sort of throwing the ball or even under those conditions\nI guess is how to get there were a number of Dr hurt him or\nDoes that play into you know with your office where you have especially in a row where you have a place to go see if\nYou have to make poison um\nYou know I think as a quarterback when you sometimes you throw a bad Mona guy makes a great catch and you have to realize you through a bad ball and then sometimes you feel good ball and you know he doesn't catch you can't you know every place and exploit you have to\nYou know your mind is the most powerful thing in our body and if you don't see yourself making a play and then you don't make it so I thought he went out we I think the first pass we got also got a first down on the first play right through it to Jarvis and nice playing games from the orange and um and we went down in God's a certain three and actually had the snap that feel like we had a good play they're coming up so\nYou said it best on you have to make place that's what it's about and uh\nWe didn't make enough on our fencing and again I I'm really proud of our our defense play and they held him to sixteen points right because they gave him seven\nWhat would you know they got we got to get 'em off the food a little bit too and uh let's say you know it just wasn't a very good day for us on often it's clearly\n\nSaid wait a minute drive more than I think\nI don't know I don't know I mean we do we start we couldn't you said the first time was a snap the second drive we got a really good play that got called back because we got a false start\nOn the third drive we got a couple of first towns and went through the interception um so you know\nShouldn't have thrown at rice shouldn't call it if we run it and running up the mental and that's not good at is what it is but the first African we had three drives and we were down we were down six and we were down six six zero was was not much time left and they went on and made a play\nUm you know to get it to a third team I still had a chance that went out there and the second half and and uh we didn't get going and obviously we had to turn over in the end zone which is just\nCompletely unacceptable and a disappointing so\nUm it's too bad for our defense senior fellow at the station was we had just the emotion he just didn't time it up correctly hit the motion guy with the ball and put it on the ground so we had two more turnover was on office today both with the quarterback so we have seven turnovers on the year for all the quarterback position\nAs this fall if he's sort of\nTouched on it he said losing losing my faith is it'd be you know informal circumstances that would be\nYou know it's hard to have to have to stay together with what's going on in Maryland and [noise] you know the the Puerto Ricans next week coming out we were finding\nIs that makes it harder or the and how much more challenging does that make it as a host not knowing what what was going to happen or not knowing even when it's going to\nWrite I think you know there's a million answers to that question done and I appreciate the question but the answer is we're going to get up tomorrow we're going to worry about the football game that we just lost I'm going to do\nThe best job I can do much today makes you pointed out wasn't very good but I'll be better tomorrow and our kids are going to stick together tomorrow we're going to come back we'll play practice tomorrow when I turn the music on and we're going to condition a little bit Monday they're going to go to class we're going to come up with a better plan and we did for today\nAnd that's the answer and we can't control anything we don't know I mean so there's a million answered the dancers were going to focus on our job\nIs the best you can with what you got where you are right now we're sitting here are really really really wish could've played better that's really all I care about if this exact moment in time for foreign three\nCould be better could be worse so we're gonna wake up tomorrow move

I'm a simplistic per se\nThink I have more confidence in this defense but again maybe this is one of those expectation conversation Travis said my expectations what his defense was going to be I knew that front for was going to be good dot the line backers would be suspecting I worried about the secondary especially the corners corners have been fantastic line backers have exceeded my accent\nPatients front for is meant exactly what I thought they were going to be I think I've gotten more confidence in this defense right now than any Hawkeye team I can maybe in recent memory more than that more than the Fifteen team\nI mean this this defense shutting out in Maryland a team that it looks to me when we're assessing this game like this a team that could cause some problems for the hot guys a lot of movement in the backfield\nThey do some crazy things within that running game and then that opens up the one out of three times that they pass the ball sometimes that's available for them with none of that was there today\nI'm going to give you an example now this is going to make a lot of Iowa fans mad and don't\nThe only oh don't go don't call me a Homer\nBecause that's not what it is I was paid and I covered Nebraska football from Ninety four until two thousand ten Ross one of the best teams besides the Ninety five team was the Ninety\nNineteen and may have been maybe have been the second best\nTeam in the nineties but nobody remembers that you know why\nBecause they didn't win they didn't win a national title\nThey lost the taxes because they bubbled four times in the red zone that taxes only last year and actually made up for the last week beating taxing the big bowl championship game but didn't play for national title by far the best team in the country that year but they didn't win the national title\nAnd nobody remembers the Ninety nine teams being oh my God one of those great teams when actually talent wise it was but it floats off into oblivion because it didn't win a title\nCan we keep playing the game sure go into the Penn State next week and this season eleven and one day and you look back at that one loss and go man a mistake on ...\nAnd I think it then I think it's a valid argument or at\nLeast the conversation but I don't think you can have that conversation unless you've finished eleven ... you know something you have this conversation till the end of the ... and that's that's my whole point and this came up on our morning show uh the morning Russian fourteen sixty cakes known what your sister station I Am down done now saying ah such and such beat\nA ranked team I don't think you should say you should have been able to beat her right team\nUntil the final college football playoff all comes out and all the\nGames are over and whoever rank then you can say you beta ranked team because you've been ranked team in in in week one too and they end up going to three and Ninety yes yeah that's not that's not an accurate assessment let's use Iowa State for an example yeah you beat Oklahoma State your elbow states probably not going to be right at the end of the year", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Brian Gongol", "city": "Des Moines", "day": "20"}
