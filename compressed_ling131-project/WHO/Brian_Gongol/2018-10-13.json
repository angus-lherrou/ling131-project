H. O. it was one of those games that if you're a Hawkeye fan you loved it for obvious reasons but for one reason in particular\nOff ... off ... office the defense has been pretty solid all year long turnovers have been an issue in the last couple of games there was one big turnover today by Iowa but ... family more than made up for that bad throat\nYou're free to think that you're a fan obviously anybody going through Penn State in happy valley has to play a great game we've seen the hawks when it happy valley before but first of course it's Marilyn can't overlook\nMarilyn every game is different and as you saw around the Big Ten today there was some scares are at Ohio State didn't look all that good against Minnesota so maybe that makes\nIowa look better because they ran all over Minnesota but gave them a couple of touchdowns via our turnover so let's go to the more in right now sir you are on the U.S cellular post game show I didn't catch the name go ahead please\nUh Clint hey Clint what's up [noise]\nI just want to make a couple of comments first of all good game ... of all I just want to say thank you all the farmers out there trying to get their field wrapped up in

course I have relatives who are\nIn combines right now as we speak and we appreciate them listening as well the other positive that you are taking away from the Hawkeye team is the fact that and keep in mind there hasn't been a Hawkeye quarterbacks row for six touchdown passes in over Thirty years\nYou and I were a lot younger than Thirty years man that's pretty amazing by itself\nBut what's happening is we're starting to see Nate Stanley become the quarterback that we hoped he would become and and again when you talk to bees you're talking the hardest position maybe and all of a sport I'm sure there's arguments to be made for some other positions but you got to be good and quick\nGot to have a strong arm Nate has all of that but what is impressing me\nIs the fact that he is standing tall\nHe is in that pocket he's getting hit any shrug it off like his raindrops now he doesn't escape every sack but when you have that ability now his ability as not to talk and run that's not what he does but if you have a quarterback who can pinball\nButchers off his own body you're obviously headed in the right direction\nSpeaking of that I Want to take a break with us from color standing by we'll get to you if you're on the line please stay there love to hear from you appreciate all the calls on Jim Albrecht to this is\nThe U.S cellular post game show we will hear from Nate
