where the rub Brooks and Dr Brian ...\nScary thank you very much and we are on the Hawkeye sideline about the twenty five yard line with Dr Brian ... fan to talking about a stinger is this afternoon and any time you see\nA player come off of that arm is kind of dangling down toward his feet\nYou never know exactly what it is but certainly that is a a pretty good indication that that's what they call a stinger doctorate is you have a player come off like that or what\nKind of the process you go through to figure out if he can come back and play\nSooner rather than later well these are a kind of a stretch injury opt in there and that gets tilted to the side and and often they either lead with their shoulder had kind of a significant blow to the top of their shoulder to get a bit of a stretch and are there like\n... so our biggest concern is one that has to be comfortable because this is usually pretty painful immediately after it happened but most importantly for us as we they need to have their strength so uh\nWe're very quick to invest their strength and until they have their normal strength back we're probably going to restrict their play\nAs I've seen it over here on the sideline a lot of time we'll try to raise their arms off to the side that with some resistance\nRight so it you know it's a pretty ... these guys are very strong individuals so it's it's a pretty significant strength test and\nAnd uh if they do get their strength back will let them go back there are things that we can put around their color and their helmet to try to help the positioning of their head and neck to avoid having over currents that if they've had a couple of them were going to be very slow to let them go back and they are things that can occur and and kind of drag on through the season [noise]\nAll right a beautiful day for football let's go get them ...\nDr Bryan off right here on the University of Iowa sports medicine injury update dolphin chorus says most Hawkeye fans know linebacker nickname and is not going to play today he is a\nWeek to week with a leg injury and that means Barrington wait we'll start with that line backer position Kristen\nWelsh will back him up and also um some changes in the defense of backfield more specifically the two corners for the guys today a defensive back in corner I'm Matt had kittens who left Wisconsin game with an injury and the second half of them\nDid not return and that ballgame Julius branch replaced him and that is the indication that\nWill happen today and then also I'm Michael OJ moody up is a not a hundred percent but is available today but you look for a freshman Riley moss from ... centennial to get his first career start in his true freshman campaign and he of course it wasn't the for a hundred and ten meter\nHigh hurdles or this past year and then also is they drink relays chap as well so he's got a tremendous speed and as we've talked about throughout the pregame show about Minnesota missing a couple of there are a big time players are running back Rodney Smith is out for the season played in just two games this year\nWas averaging six point two yards for Kerry\nAnd then also had nine hundred and Seventy seven yards a season to go that's a big blow for the gophers and normally would go to a Shannon Brooks but he was injured back in February with a a knee injury and has not played the season will be in uniform today but will not play vote for him is to be able to play maybe in those last four games of the season\nAnd then also come back and play next year and then of course Antonio Winfield uh the safety special teams specialist out with a a a pretty severe foot injury that happened last week he played in four games is Seventeen tackles very dangerous on special teams\nAveraging over thirty six yards her ... return and also took one back so a couple of up big time performers are not playing today for Minnesota\nYeah good points to Robbie or we'll give you an Iowa injury updates further than beyond your report because I Know a ... year down there we're up here we just got some light information that\nAre definitely a a Julius branches starting in place of Matt Hankins who's out with injury now we're told that a Hankins is trashed\nAnd would be available but hasn't practice much this week Riley moss will start at the other corner and Josh Turner a red shirt freshman is available and that secondary as well the good news is ... hooker are healthy and good to go they'll solidify that back in ...\nYou mentioned Antonio Winfield the third or their best defensive player\nOr he had a strip fumble recoveries had a a an interception deepened that Fresno state game that\nPreserve that victory or this could just cannot stay healthy I mean last year we only play for games before a season ending injury and the red shirted used as Richard uh now he uh stretches a leg up to the point that it needs surgery and a foot or in the Marilyn game and has done for the year and\nI Hope you get a medical Richard so he could conceivably come back next year third year in the program as a red shirt freshman year and a and you know electric kids would just say you know what I I just what I just wasn't meant to play football or not this kid I mean something else in his dad Antonio Winfield was an all American\nIn the secondary at Ohio State like fourteen

on the first the first one on the road of any kind of let alone big jet\nWell and that's a that's a learning process for 'em all your young players when you had for at home now you've got a pack your stuff get on a plane come up here stay in a hotel which had a lot of business in it last night and a lot of distractions in the Hilton downtown so you always worry about\nA lot of these young players probably ever taken a road trip before so at any level of it and now you're going to do it and play a Big Ten game now one of the things we're going to see today is some freshmen action\nOn the part of the guys and on the part of Minnesota they they start freshman quarterback jak our next did a who's only averaging a hundred and eighty seven yards per game passing\nSo we're going to start today to freshmen corners Julius branch to six too and he's from Indianapolis and Riley mosses six foot one eighty five from ... so obviously during the bi weekly that a chance I Know there's there's been some injuries at the corner and there's been I think\nUh some disappointment and some of the play so it's a chance for these guys to ah start today and also another newcomer Barrington way we'll start on the outside linebacker per nickname men who had an injury and it's going to be a real challenge for Barrington he's a big guy\nI'm strong guy but he's going to after court cover that slot receiver\nAnd that means you have to a lot of running today so coaches Barry feels very good about it\nThe wide receivers that Minnesota are pretty darn good freshmen shout Bateman these numbers Thirteen and he's got all the time and he's a porn star and he's going to be a good one who still just press room but Tyler Johnson who's a junior\nA is really an accomplished wide receiver so are you own corners are going to be tested right away or they're only good bird Israel was a freshman quarterback throwing it to him that when you flip it over and the other side\nWhere are all fast versus ... says look at the last game Maryland Rand nibble thirty seven times three hundred and Fifteen yards they only through fourteen passes I'm\nThat game you know that's kind of that's the kind of game I think that Kurt first dreams of do under the obvious thing is to be fifty fifty were passing and receiving\nTheir line backers are passing and running in their line backers are probably the best part of their football team and we're gonna have to block them\nRun the ball but I think when you take advantage of their secondary they got to beat up young secondary so I expect to see a good mixture of a running past\nAnd the best way to help out those youngsters in the Iowa secondary as for the defense of lie to keep doing what it's been doing\nWell I don't want to be standing in the pocket and when you were just um you know interviewing a\nMinnesota coach talking about his quarterback them somewhat restricted to run out of the pocket who don't you think that the defense is Lynette ... looking at that on film no\nQuestion and a two weeks ago at Marilyn Marilyn ran the ball\nA big time cashing a\nA minister of defense up the middle which we haven't we haven't seen that

Kelly healthy should be able to get something going on the run game ... was fourteen of thirty two\nFor a hundred and sixty nine yards and two interceptions at Maryland and so the guy's gotta feel they can win the turnover\nBut yeah I did I\nAnd I think took this Hawkeye team really played well against Wisconsin a couple of turnovers mistakes costs just a football game and so this is a good
