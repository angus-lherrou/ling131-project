I think if you're going to look at those tightened number they talked about me into it and a fantastic game for name and he got a couple of mentioned throughout the day today and they did talk about how\nAh he had a a a pretty good game when you're looking at those tied in numbers though Travis it's got to be done through the lens of what Nate Stanley did again you only had eighty six passing yards an entire game today\nAnd a dominant when you see the ball for eighty six yards so when you hear Hawkins in three catches for thirty Yard's fenced three catches for only fourteen yard\nI think it may be as easy to go ooh titans didn't show up today and they just weren't needed the same way that we've needed in the last couple of weeks\nWell isn't the two hundred in twenty four total yards twenty four Russian rushing ... in that the most of the year so far\nI didn't see that in the game notes\nI mean I I didn't know I did if I heard all through that or not but uh yeah I mean you know the last two weeks later they had to do we we talked and we talked about a a great deal last week how almost the pass last week was there go to the past last week\nLast two weeks drives you out of the run us last week had they've lost faith in the running game and I tried to tell you I didn't think they had\nThe end it was it was a bad way to phrase\nYeah I mean you know we've had that conversation last couple of years about the identity of the ... and it's been pretty easy to pinpoint in the last Twenty years what the identity of this team is run the football\nControl the line of scrimmage run the football don't make mistakes and once they give you the past then utilize that that hasn't been seen the last couple of weeks and maybe even\nLast year and a half they they've become a much more balanced him I think that was what I think that was what you were saying and trying to trying\nTo figure out how to started I didn't take you articulated very well because and I guess what I mean how many years in the past if we said well if you shut down the Iowa Ron you're probably going to have a pretty good chance of\nBeating a absolutely and now that's just not the case yeah in a big way in eight family continued to get better is numbers running that great today no like I said but but look at the\nThings that we talked about with the running game last week when I said you know the past couple of weeks against Indiana and against Minnesota you've had one guy get twenty carries in my case Arjun has ended exactly on ten carries is the third game and aroma ... sergeant ends with exactly ten carries you get twenty four\nBribery Kelley Martin and then finally they get torn young into the game that second half\nHe ends up with nine carries too but I think that\nThis is their plan Travis like when they're going into the game I I don't think it's by chance McKay sergeant has ended with exactly ten carries the last three games I think that's what their what their goal is just the number four hit him ten carries get around\nThe job of rules for my ... yeah that's it for an old baseball reference era man what happened in ... or is he right now running a bar and Lincoln So anyway is he really a day [laughter] but then he said he had a hard time\nGetting a liquor licence 'cause we had a DWI that's a no no if you want to liquor license\nTwenty four carriers for ivory Kelley Martin in Ninety eight guards I think that that the game plan going into it trying to\nDo it for ten forty let's go back to the phones Ted and Des Moines welcome to the other is barbecue sound up a news radio ten forty W.

I think he was a he he was out of the shotgun he went left or right and then turn around and threw the ball I mean it was just I ...\nI remember Mr direction played yeah everybody to the left and then he turned around and kind of through like a\nMan that was that another one of the screen pass type deal because he threw it across the only thing that that one was to Hawkins was ... and yet\nToo so you yeah that was a play to utilize the titans there\nTo wait for ten forty will go back to the phones Tom and Tom welcome to the jets rose barbecue set up a news radio ten forty W.

I Believe as far as the dumb domination that was about as good as it gets\nOr not what team and just the way they were prepared this this today so\nAnd the key word right there Joel was prepared listen listen to occur grants that after the game about being prepared\nYou know I think we really one of those game during the week quite frankly are guys were\nA word in there are there are focused or wait a couple of hundred during the course of the week this to one on Monday won yesterday for both those guys are played through it and were able to pull it are they so now we had a couple of moving pieces are behind the scenes but to you know it's just it's an show up at all today I just\nThink that says a lot of our reporters opposing focus on what they're supposed to we\nWon this game during the week\nThat that's a pretty strong statement\nYes and it reminded me the way that often they have their Marilyn\nReminded me of the Orange Bowl of earth Georgia Tech in how norm Parker totally prepared to defend the dominate ... I was at the game when actually my daughter was still in my wife's belly at the time we were both at the games though it was\nA a ... just the way that game was played today was I thoroughly believe that was the best they played all year\nLong I'd agree I agree with that job most complete game but we've seen well even with the ... well what's one penalty or zero penalties in one interception the the eye and we said that you're really one play away from ... right I mean the interception\nKept you from perfection Joel things were going I don't know if you're listening on the on ten forty WMA Joel or the I her radio up but it's good to have you on no matter what Brandon in Des Moines walk into the job was barbecue shot up what's up\nHey I just I first of all I Want to give it\nA right or the guy just called in is it is from Texas and in your diet fan love it absolutely love it decides that I think our defense look great today um it's one of the games that we we actually put\nEverything out there with it and we we stopped everything\nThey do minus the when I think we were to done the same thing\nHere is a good question ... who is the defense of MVP\nA park or has he\nGets a good one yeah he had he had to pay most hapless rely linked to\nHe was just I mean it it's hard and here's the deal brand and you're right if it but we we should be saying that if you're a deep answers only on the field for Ninety minutes in five seconds of the game you better say you're a defense at a pretty darn good game\nI mean I Am right now and I and I completely agree with that I mean don't get me wrong they often but actually a good as they could ... the wind was a huge ... in this game but our ... won this game for us easily\nAll right Brian thanks Vogel appreciate a man\nDo it for ten forty let's go to Jackie in Des Moines Jackie welcome to the joke is barbecue sound\nHey thank you I\nI'm not calling and we did have a good I I Would I have wonderful oh no I wouldn't go back\nTo Iowa wedding out bad I mean I don't like I said I thought well if they went and eleven y ou predators out that I'm Sorry go ahead I mean I have been forever but unfortunately I don't think they're going to\nSay here here's the difference ... and and I'm going to put you on hold so you can hear this conversation ... ... but here's where it's different we have got to get out of the mindset\nOf the pie and the coaches because that does it matter we have not seen a whole yet from the college football committee a pi means nothing coach's poll means nothing\nYou can you can maybe use them as a barometer of of how the nation sees yeah he seems that's but that's it it does it it doesn't matter\nWe won't be able to make a determination on Iowa\nAnd where they could possibly end up until we see that first college football poll from the committee now we know that I was not going to be one two three four five right but we need to see where Iowa falls in that top twenty because remember who's in that room\nSupposedly pretty smart college football people right they may look at it I Would eventually go guys\nThis is a better team than what\nThe the media thinks they are because the media likes to think they're smarter than everybody else in the really not\nIn ... well they have the rest of IDs vote so that doesn't matter it's how those people that room look at the I Would be fair to the way this I Will office is performing alright get another hour complete we're here till seven o'clock everybody's saying hold your phone calls next [noise]\nAnyway Joe ... and I arch radio station and on your age the radio Katie RV ADD [noise]\nNews radio Sanborn jumbled you wait Joe [noise]\nThe Saudis story I'm ...
