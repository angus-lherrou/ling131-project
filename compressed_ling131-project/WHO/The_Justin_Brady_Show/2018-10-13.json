I'm going to talk about this a little bit later the significance of that passing game has a as kind of changed the worker this Iowa ... and we're not talking about it a lot so we'll get into that Randy [noise]\nIt's really it was really good dog so let's say tour and young he's it seemed like he was doing pretty good job and they're my my son can acquire does say something\nHey what's up [noise] ... when you get older you are you don't want people to call you Kenny [noise]\n[laughter] no [laughter] no I ... kidding reason [noise] that has a right real Hanukkah nights [noise] go ah\nIt was like no TV [noise]\nSouth Park reference Hi Paul up next calling from Des Moines any Mitch Miller was a ball I was just er\n[laughter] I I I I don't want to start drawing on the on the\nNumber one on the trap or I don't I I watch the guy I think I can get\nMore snap I better why I don't I don't ...\nI got the verdict plus catch down or fan I've seen it from ... oh oh I Would argue [laughter] pride in fact that I that I didn't\n... here's here's the problem is as Paul just hangs up he doesn't want to have a conversation about it but you know I can have a conversation but\n... yeah 'cause I Do I Do disagree with ... I think there's a reason for\nBeing here here's the problem with polls logic is that you're not doing an apples to apples comparison they are two different tight is now they can do similar things\nBut no other than I think has a lot more versatility as a receiver\nThan just stay he he's not your true tied in type of guy right when you when you think true tied in I'm thinking the Jay hawk and so he may be a better blocker still affected block do do keep yourself about it but I think no fan is more versatile tool in his game it's not you're not comparing apples without\nYeah I Would also say that and I'm I don't want to take anything away from the ... and he's a fantastic ... and we are very lucky to have to NFL caliber tied into this off and both will play in the lead to do that went over a hundred yards lining up with lineman today that this is\nWe're really lucky to have this but if you want to have the conversation about which one of these guys\nIs I I don't know better might not even be the wrong way ... TJ Hawkins is benefiting from having no offense on the field when there were no other fans out there there's a lot of attention that goes towards no offense\nYou're right that a T. J. is probably a better blocker but I Would say no one is put outside on the outline a lot more you we are lined up in that flank or slot position a lot more than than\nHe is going to stoke the fire here a little bit and I don't mean this to be rude to our callers are even Iowa fans but Iowa fans 'cause we're to talk about this later on too 'cause we will have time to kill we got three hours ten minutes ago three hours five minutes ago\nOr Iowa fans going to defend TJ Hawkins in more because he's from Sharon in Iowa and he's in he's in Iowa kid more than a kid from Omaha Nebraska and who has a family member go on Twitter in openly criticized the coaching staff\nThink tribe is that is more of the second side of that okay that when we're as college fans here in the state of Iowa we embrace these guys\nWe when they put on the colors of your team you embrace them yes and you you own them as you like I was never a guy I Can't tell you where Ninety nine percent of Iowa ... grew up there's a few of them that we know right you know uh the story behind Akron widely we know about Bob Sanders\nYou know where the stoops running your right and you know some of the Iowa guy like Dallas Clark and you know these these stories about the guys to come to I feel like once you put those colors ... state and probably applies to\nAny okay college fan I don't know how to bring I stayed in you forget well I'm just I'm thinking of us as fans in this state ... guy or are they all live within ... yeah I think that we look past wherever you're from prepare to time I done the hill\nThe brother weighing in last week and I will fans who are looking at this objectively loving both guys\nLook at this and go whoa wait a minute no is by far the number one option on this often they go to him in the red zone a lot he's becoming the greatest tied in in a in a program that's known for producing NFL tied in slow down here\nAnd if if he were to come back next year would be the greatest receiver in Iowa history\nHe's certainly ... are you now that ... on the all time touchdown I agree\nAny so versatile but you're right soon as a family member goes often and criticize then you're going to look for reasons to come to the defense of the other guys say listen it is just as good watch your mouth don't tweet\nYeah I I I Would step back a little bit yeah Paul said the ... the better tight end of the two I think no fan is um is a bigger weapon at all that being said Paul if you listen to Fox central on our a sister station kicks no Wednesday afternoons\nI set on that program during the by week TJ Hawkins since your first have MBP as is often\nTo wait for ten forty let's go to Tim and Marshall town welcome to the jets those barbecue set up a news radio ten forty WHM\nHey guys how you doing great well Tim ... a a\nGreat when the super ... for the hawks are looking forward to next weekend that would be a great a great environment for the ... uh uh my only concern\nA little bit today may see many middle to anybody else but at the end of the game will be throwing the ball\nYou know that fact Kirk parents this type of a a demeanor to rub it in or whatever that is kind of bothered me a little bit because I Love I Love Kirk Ferris but uh it just seems that a difference\nTo me it's funny that you say that ten because most of the reaction on Twitter people are upset but they want to know our thoughts about throwing the ball late in the game and don't forget they threw before half trying to which is usually not somebody that occurred parents coach team does usually that position with the lead you taking the you go to the locker room and he came back out and yet the football\nThey had like fifty eight to ... got the ball and like the forty two yard line team at the end of that first half and took four shots down field in those fifty two seconds or whatever was forty five seconds that they had the ball they took four shots down the field at the end of the first half\nIn the end of the game what you're specifically addressing I don't have a problem with them throwing the ball there\nYou did they did try to hit the ball off the torn young to get him over a hundred yards at and Gary who do it again it Polack who's got more football experienced in Travis night will acquire in our lifetimes ed said he thought maybe they were trying to get Nate Stanley that uh what\nSix touchdown pass or sat down at seven six today that\nSeven would've tied in with Chuck Hartley for the most of the single game edge thought maybe they were doing that just to try to get in there I don't have a problem with the play called him as much as the personnel that was on the field\nYou're you'll go into that you've got this game wrapped up um I Would have liked to have maybe even seen Spencer ... one of his four games to maintain his red shirt in this I don't know if the coaching staff is kind of decided they're just going to bank those four games for later in the year that way you don't put yourself in a bad situation\nYou know Nate Stanley does get hurt God Forbid you're going to want those four games still\nAnd they are on that Spencer because his shoulders [noise] but I Would have loved to have seen\nA [noise] a statement sell out there taking a couple of those snap slate maybe give him a shot at throwing that ball down field either way I think you hit on they had him you you qualified at the right way you have to pick up part too many things that they but if there's one concern that something you saw out of the ordinary three so\nStay at hold Steve in St Paul stay on hold you got a couple of lines open we can't wait to get your phone calls when suggest those barbecue sound starts at four o'clock [noise]\nDo any weight Joe ... and I arch radio station and on your age the radio Katie ... to\nMorning doubled you wait Joe [noise]\nEnjoying his freedom I'm Roger Easter and Fox News American pastor Andrew Brunson back in America after being freed from two years of captivity in Turkey took time out to thank President Trump and members of Congress are fighting for his freedom\nThey may not have trusted him completely out on routes and\nAnd and with Nate families quick or ... or the way he kind of fires football so I like that they used that jet sweep as a way to put the ball into the hands of a guy like a mirror Smith more set\nYou you lay it out pretty clearly do Cooper got bing bing up today north than when they tried to do that with the the tide in sweep he got hurt on that ended up in concussion protocol\nI'd like to see him maybe get away from that and that uh that bubble screener wide receiver swing whatever defensively when you talk about Juno stone Teresa go ahead go ahead jobs I was I was going to\nPlay this retreat go ahead Ramsey quickly has a large do ... they take it to him throw up to the theater ... separate aliens owned by judo stone that's just ...\n[laughter]\nI think what you just described would you know stone is one of the things that we all as Iowa football fans love about coach barons and the\nUm identity of this I Will football team under him is that is that fair Travis yeah we love it when that they are very good talented value waiters they're able to find guys that they think are going to be able to play within their system you get guys like Gino stone in almost every class it seems like\nOur treats I'm

D Warren County your disease right right [laughter]\nMe tell you I I travel through your arm I Everytime I go home to stay in my family home is Burlington\nMy well my all my home as well I grew up on a farm between Burlington and media apple is really you've got you guys have heard of Minneapolis\n... hours yeah yeah matter of fact I'm Still bitter Minneapolis be try center Neal I Believe in the late Nineteen eighty seven girls the basketball tournament still six on six\nYeah we were supposed to win the championship that year we do we draw Minneapolis in the first round that is what it was still all class that's when he was really cool a little bit back when it's cool 'cause six on six and you still didn't have classes yet so you had the big schools play the small schools you know\nWhat Minneapolis went to the states Herman every year I Know and you don't want it made headline news on that one right just drives me the apples got upset before the state tournament\nMinneapolis isn't we're fond addictions from no no no no she was from that area you know I thought she was\n... when she from New Fonda who funded ...\nKnow that she wants her from Minneapolis got called a big name like for ... for a girl's house called Iowa the Debbie call okay\nWe know our girls six on six basketball around here though what's your whole\nGuy yeah I mean what Minneapolis for cars is you know big name for a town of twelve hundred\nPeople yeah I'd agree with you what what's your football question though Steve well I don't mean to a rail\nRecord we got off topic because of your mouth but anyway I Hope you guys have a two games up right now at Georgia\nIs down sixteen than not than and pet is beating Notre Dame and the fourth quarter\nYeah we've been watching that pit Notre Dame game almost unfortunately here because our producer John Roberts thinks he's a Notre Dame\nAnd I mean his emotions ride the wave of Notre Dame I mean when they fell down seven nothing he was throwing stuff in the studio saying the season is over they can't go twelve no I'm not watching the Georgia I'm actually watching the Washington Oregon game\nOr two games on right now because you know ... in the in the hugest studio that I've that I've ever worked in a for some reason will have room for one TV [laughter]\nOh no you gotta have that George came on because Georgia's not much on the country and they're they're at LSU\nOkay I was little I've got my I got the YouTube TV going on my computer sauce which the Georgia game soon as as soon as we go to our next brick\n... okay I got two points I Want to definitely talked about real quick go ahead Steve okay the first\nPoint as why not it's an observation that this is the second year for Brian parents Brandon Smith\nIs Les ... fat and what I Am saying and I'm curious what you guys are saying but it just looks like everybody that I named Dr looking really comfortable and they often and Brian is getting the ball to his play makers\nAnd it looks like everybody knows what they're doing and everybody looks comfortable so that's that's my point on what I'm seeing on the off and then my second point is is what are we doing [noise] and I kind of forget\nBut I remember one plant particular but what are we doing on kick off a why are we not utilizing the fair catch when I make ...\nHolt been on Steve Iowa leaves the Big Ten in kickoff return I mean kickoffs has not been a disaster\nAnd they had a hundred plus yards and kick off to kick opportunity to really good one yeah so don't don't jump to conclusions on that\nNo but what hunter wasn't there I Know there was one of at least one player where they let it roll into the anthem I picked it up and then they started running\nOkay but if there was a penalty remember they Indiana went off sides on that and they got he got back and they get a better return ...\nGo watch it again Steve ... Sunday just misjudged that that was an ad was talking about on the air that in that ends on those guys were steering into the sun Sunday tried to catch that ball to one yard line it I mean like it hit off of him so he had to go into the end zone or to pick it up so that\nOkay yeah that's my that's my only the only time I cringe is on kick off on God don't\n... I I I really am convinced your\nSon is going to break one he's got that kind of like oh no I agree with that mentality back there he really wants to get out and try to make a play back there and I think it's going to happen sooner than later\nYeah so I agree with you I think we're I think God I think he's a good a good return or but I we don't utilize that they're catching and maybe you're right they maybe they lost in the sun or whatever but\nWhat happened died and I can't I'm concentrating on return either the kick off for the pond return um we'd botched or you know whichever\nIt got away from the ball on that one punt returned versus Wisconsin and I see it's not fair catching maybe when we should be uh so that's my only complaint is on on that\nKind of yeah see that's interesting I mean we all look at it differently I've actually been really happy with the fact that they haven't utilize that fair catch thing and take the ... the twenty five those that don't know you fair catch the ball inside the ... I didn't want it inside the twenty you get the bottom of twenty five\nAnd the hockey I have not done that we've seen it all over college football or almost every other team is has gone to that strategy I liked the fact that the hot guys want they're the guys that they're trusting to put in place maker situations they're letting to make that decision I like it Steve but I can see your concern as real quick about the wide receivers before we hit this uh this time out\nTwenty one passes were completed by Stanley today only eight to wide receivers I I like the fact is wide receivers are more involved in the game the last couple of weeks we've seen them really step up with all usually have the ten catch gain a lot of targets last week against Minnesota\nWe're still talking about a passing game that is dominated by the titans and utilizes the ... the the running backs on the back to weed through the two different full backs today I\n... I think he is ... parents were getting the ball a first play makers\nI completely agree with you on that thanks a lot I used to call to wait for ten forty to wait for ten forty John in New Jersey stay there with\nYou and we'll get to your ... and John writes moravian question mark yes ... is an Iowa town\nThat's the town ... from\nThe ... that's probably why we're getting to calm the than whole\nGym in Des Moines [noise] Fleetwood Mac said tomorrow night or Monday nights Sunday night and then we'll find out because you all your Fleetwood Mac information you did that last week the morning [laughter] the jets barbecues I don't know if I lose rodeo said forty WHM\nRange selection raining very\nWhat isn't expected is how hard we were after the sale to keep your\nWe're still trying to decide if it's your Mississippians yes [noise]\nSure [noise] she said it sounded good yeah [noise] feels good do\n... for thirty minutes John I'm going to be your first job it is the judge was barbecue sound of a news radio ten forty WHM [noise]\nFor ... for the American pastor Andrew Brunson met with President Trump at the White House today\nWe've been negotiating long and hard [laughter] so we do not pay ransom in this country at\n[noise] we all read some of those big problems and lots of things will happen\nBrunson was held in Turkey for two years on terrorism charges President Trump hosts a political rally in Richmond, Kentucky tonight\nThe president tweeting about its edited a rival here quote heading to the great state of Kentucky big rally recovers with Andy Barr fantastic guy need his vote for mega strong on crime tax cuts military vets and Second Amendment\nFox is Doug ... thousands of people marched through downtown Chicago to protest President Trump and encourage people to vote in the mid term especially Fox News [noise]\nWhich is coming to the mall and an October to presented by Bernal this election was\nTo Americans go to we need\nWhether you'll recall the regular ...\nBiggest coal guy results moving has closed the fit you and if you're listening to some dog we call you and I walk I spent ... salutes bands of all sizes as the Iowa\nAfter some of the story\nHere until you find your side and\nSo you can look forward to it to\nFarm and this is\nTomorrow is property for Dell neutral returns coming [noise]\nFamily has banked with American trust and they were talking with Kerry about the ... better banking my husband and I opened our personal checking out when we moved to Arizona in Nineteen eighty three growing\nNeeds of our family have changed from just a couple of checking account and now we have two sons in college so they have their privatized which again council we have our savings account our home mortgage and our personal chain you know we don't travel a lot\nFrom careers and so if I'm In Des Moines I can easily on my accounts um from my mobile device and taking care of and the click of a button\nOr in super high interest on your reward the county an ATM rebates Tim users and cards and Thailand value my mind\nThe American trust bank for detail and I like the home town feel an American I like that no matter where you are personally professionally\nAnd we felt comfortable thanking American ... are you comfortable with your bank trust American trying again it's on the mountain you member and the I think even housing lender\nYou with the biggest names in the news on the ... law for newsmakers by\nLetting in law for your first call for about one workman's comp or personal injury claims\n[noise] warning our fundamental right to free and fair elections is under attack sinister\nLaws are undermining our right to vote\nAnd threats of cyber attacks and warn interference being to destroy the integrity of our elections\nOne needs a secretary of state that will fight for our democracy our right to vote and our fundamental freedom\nDeidre this year is the fighter Iowa needs to take on the threats looming over our elections and stand up to the anti voting gender\nLeader does year will fight to secure our elections from foreign interference fight back against efforts to suppress and didn't to mid ...
