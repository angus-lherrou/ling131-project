that talk is up on the Internet it's not on our website\nUp but people should watch it\nBut the left and the Jews and it said the largest the synagogue west of the Mississippi Valley ... alone in\nLos

and you'll you'll get the talk\nAnd the the group was the Republican Jewish alliance is that correct is that the correct the exact same yeah or or do that way but it doesn't matter if you're a Jew or not the it's the talk will be illuminating\nAnd\n[laughter] if\nI said the reason that the talk came to mind as I said at the beginning of the talk as of this moment anything can happen of course but as of this molded this president is a great president\n\nHe is he's a great praise be not only beyond expectations she is the is done more for what I value and others who are not on the left value including liberals but they don't know it because they've been so intimidated their whole lives into believing the right as the enemy\nBut as Alan Dershowitz said that left as the enemy of liberalism I have said that over and over watched by video five minutes pick five minutes differences between left left or right sorry between liberal and left\nAfter ... plus the video this week okay health care what's wrong\nWith the government running what is wrong with government rowing healthcaregov as a timely\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWow is there a battle so it turns out I was right there was a civil war in the United states even the left now acknowledges it they're writing about it that's correct but as I said most of my life only one side was fighting\nNow it may may be maybe capital was the final straw ... maybe while I reported last hours the final straw\nA a a male winning the female bicyclist bicycle competition\nBut the male is a transgender woman she she identifies this person identifies

have been brainwashed there was no rational ... there's no possible rational reason is purely an emotional decision\nIs going to be the final straw to have people say that the left is it an elderly destructive force any one of these things the Capitol hearing the the ... the decimation of a good man\nBy the Democratic party by the way things happened so fast that is amazing fish it's so amazing how fast\nI predicted in my column that I wrote on the Capitol hearing now they'll go to elementary school and sure enough they did Stephen Miller the to the president's ah eight and and speech writer now there's a report last week 'cause you've probably heard on the show or might have heard or should have heard\nHis third grade teacher so says what it was a a cookie kitty was what an odd\nBall where you go\n... there were no parameters you get to their moral parameters don't exist for the left every every parameters destroyed\nThe concept that essential to Judaism and Christianity that it is that if a person has turned their life around even assuming that this happened in high school the ... my argument was that she should not have been this hearing to begin with but it's no disrespect to the woman and it simply\nI'm Sorry we are not going to have all the basis of one person in high school have a hearing about a man's life\nThis is not how we run the United States Senate they were willing to go to California to hear her do realize how even for the Republicans fear of the left is greater than fear of God do you realize that they were going to go to California to here or\n\nWhat if somebody I'm Serious one if somebody said you know I when he was in when he was in tenth grade he held up a store what would you say\nSeriously that's a very serious thing with a gun he went with a gun and I could tell you I I I don't remember at the store a nobody else remembers that happening are but I'm telling you I I Know what happened would there be a hearing\n\nWhy not is armed robbery or an inconsequential sin\n\nWe I watch on a daily basis the left destroyed the greatest country ever made and I don't know if the the these elections coming up\nWe'll be will be determinative on whether or not the left has gone too far because if they if they win the house or what you don't know chaos until you will know the next two years if they win the house they will immediately go for impeachment of the president they will try to impeach uh Kavanaugh\n\nThey will have hearings at every day on on on corruption in government for two more years we will be preoccupied with not
