I Try to push it [noise]\nI think you've done a a memorial service in writing this and I ... it was I think to be honest it was somewhat of a gamble on your part because so much has been written about the Holocaust and about the Nazis and so so I'll ask you then what prompted you to do this\nEvil I'm seeing a rise and evil in America I'm\nTalking about people walking into schools gunning down students [noise]\nThousand shot in Chicago by drug gangs clerics um abusing shouldering a this just small pure evil across the board and I'm thinking about those stories I came to the conclusion that Americans are numb\nTo the growing evil around us and the only way that evil is defeated is if people confront it\nNot turn away as they did in Germany I'm In the late Nineteen twenties in Nineteen thirties [noise]\nUm so I decided to write Kelly access because we had written killing Patton huge success and we had a lot of research material leftover we got the Israeli government to cooperate with us on ss\nOpened files that had never been seen before which is why we're able to put the reader on a step by step of the abduction of Eichmann in Argentina uh we had a lot of new stuff that's never been put in print before\nSo I decided to write it but the over arching is I Want the world not just Americans to know that evil exist and we have to confront it\nYes it did now I don't know whether they call themselves or deaths or not but the set up a was um that the they used the two letters S. S.\nBecause of a of Hitler and what they did was they have this apparatus and you ask the question was what surprised you shut up this apparatus and they have tons of gold and tons of looted cash a and they have assassins\nWorking for them and and the the organization had a rat line what Martin garden I called the rat line from Germany to Italy gentle way Italy where they got these ss guys down there and put them on boats and then they went where they went most of them to Argentina where the PR own government was bribed\nTo allow them in and to keep them they're protected so\nThe red cross out of Switzerland helped the ss so to the F a beginning CIA and sorted elements of the Catholic Church and I'm Catholic\nSo all of that surprised me and we documented pretty thoroughly in a book and then to track down um you would think that the Israeli government would really want to get these guys in the beginning they did not\nAnd they didn't want to reopen this and they wanted to concentrate on protecting the new state of Israel from the Arab threat\nAnd they had to be badgered into tracking down Eichmann in manga law and the others that surprised us and then there's you know surprise is all across the book individual stories that we tell [noise]\nSo let me ask you you I Love the fact that you have a preoccupation with evil which has been me much three since I was in high school so I I asked a Holocaust survivor men went through hours for the rabbi Leon ... passed away\nAnd I I was with him for many many years and I finally interviewed him and I asked him how does he how did he explain\nThe ss guards in the camps and their sadism and he used the phrase that I have kept in my mind ever since the ... the one thing I truly remember from my interview\nAnd he said they were

they do the most heinous evil things that anyone could imagine\nAnd then after the war they go back to the towns and they take up their farming again\n... unbelievable and that's why I wanted to tell

tweets well Kavanaugh maybe on the Supreme Court but at least we ruined his life\nTrick tremendously interesting interviews\nAnd in ... burst\nAmongst those interviews has been my reading to you\nFrom a column and then I Will go to a second column in the Washington Post they have a feminist column\nIn the Washington Post where women were feminist or or one I think in particular the feminist columnist writes and I was reading some of them on the plane last night\nAnd I I shared some of them with you know some of the quotes\nI think that these are so important to understand the damage that feminism an image each make believe world ... all is said emanates from the left or make believe socialism is make believe\nAnd feminism is make believe you ... is make believe it's all make believe\nFor whatever reason and it's all psychological what ... ... it's there's no other explanation there is a beep beep beep\nUh [noise]\nUnhappiness maladaptive ... to reality on the part of the people who embrace these things and certainly those who develop them to have contempt for the world as is conservatives understand that the chance of making the world worse\nOr is the chances of making the world worse or at least as good as far as making the world better when you have a revolutionary idea [noise]\nMaking the world incrementally better is spectacular that's what we should be doing in every generation but overthrowing the foundational ideas of a society because you have a dream of something better which is what character respects the characteristic of the left\nRemember from the will to fundamentally transform the United states of America that's revolution\nThat is where only bad things will happen in the bad things do happen she writes here that she's a middle aged single heterosexual feminist by the way one of the things that I did not mention in my first read of her\nOf her column in the Washington Post and I'm not seeing her main deliberately 'cause I have no desire to a metal leftist I have no desire to humiliate people\nAnd it's not important to she is she they're interchangeable they have the feminists are feminists are feminists are feminists are on the left\nAbove it is interesting that there is no mention in any of the columns by her or older women writing in this column in the Washington Post that may be part of the solution to their lowly mission she says I have never been so lonely to marry\nShe seems to be looking for a relationship but she has the word marriage there's not even enter she's a she is divorced if I'm not mistaken a but ... there's no mention of of marriage so she wants to wish racial loneliness\nWe've relationship or even an unappealing\nTemporary are fleeing would appear from what I'm reading\nThe divide between men and women is never felt so why am I have never been so lonely too what does she described that I knew what I described it to [noise]\nAnd then she writes about her on her being uncomfortable with this really nice man she went on a date with for three hours\nAnd he kept saying whatever you're comfortable with when she asked where he wanted to eat lunch he said whatever you're comfortable with and now I read to read from her over the course of three hours that while I became as ... ... she didn't like that\nAnd then what I even not only put in bold for myself to underline what it was time to part ways\nI was comfortable giving him a platonic hug it was not sexy being the one in the driver's seat for three hours [noise]\nSo if they're managing the driver CDs a patriarchal guy and a probably a somewhat of a massage or this and if she's in the driver's seat she doesn't find it sexy well and then she wonders why she's never been so lonely in her life\nBecause what the feminist like Old West is living to make believe world\nReality it is is awful and then they have an imaginary world where things will be better so she says if the ... the man is a dominant decision maker that's a glaring red flags that's what she writes after she's disgusted with the guy who says whatever you're comfortable with [noise]\nI don't need a man she says to ask permission for every move he makes fun of course that is exactly the way young men are taught today you have to ask permission for every move you make\nWe shouldn't let the battle cry of consent translate into boring sex see this they hate to say that they want their cake and eat it is like it's so trite they want to change the world into some imaginary things that can't exist\nIntentions are important at every one's intentions during

date stands on Brett Kavanaugh you showed so she said she doesn't like to talk politics on first date but now it's inevitable that she wants to know where they stand on Brett Kavanaugh\n[noise] so she writes a few years ago when I was getting back to dating after getting over a breakup\nI told the friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox okay listen to this has nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh Detroit the title but listen to this again\nI told a friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox I wanted to be open to love but I also wanted to protect myself from the emotional rooms that dating and relationships and memorably can bring\n\nDid you hear that this is a grown woman\nTheir children left his two children the party they do want to grow up\nI Want to be open to love but I Want to protect myself from the emotional boots that dating and relationships inevitably can bring\nWhy don't you say that about anything else I'm open to working but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that working for a living can bring\nI Want to live fully but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that life it never to bleed can bring\nI told you there children there was no exception leftists are at heart children they do not want to grow up growing up means facing reality being prepared for her that's the reason for safe rooms and all of that stuff\nThey are snowflakes some of them are even nice snowflakes but they're snowflakes they're not grown ups\nDoes it amazing thing she Mitch this like the other woman that made it in the Washington Post held only she is and how crappy relations between men and women\nYou can't tell I agree with you know ... percent\nRight but at no point to she challenged feminism\nMaybe her own personal statement and again if people are familiar with this particular person they eat their evolution as well I mean\nI'm a Democrat I so I have what he left progressive um positions but I think when it comes to this and my relationship and kind of by sense of oh no you know I I Am the nervous they're scared to do that again that's like human\nEither ... or whatever I don't feel that our eye patch to one side or another politically is that\nOkay All right I appreciate your call very much a Cathy in Torrance, California Hi Cathy\nHi Dana Hi\nI just called to allow him a ... a story that I heard from a a recounting some nice song about five years ago he is\nNow how old is your son thirty two so you Mary Kay\nWrites us probably four or five years ago\nI he was telling me about child attempting to date and he said he found young and then sell aggressive\nThat when you're trying to get to know them it's a little like a job interview they want to now on\nHow much money you have in my kind of car you drive and what your goals are at an easier way you know not just a friendly let's get to know each other about a very aggressive grilling\n... so ironically if that's the case I have to say the word if but if that's the case so the argument that men will see women as sex object to snoop is matched by women who see men as financial objects\nWhich by the way there is some truth to both not necessarily a terrible thing just the way people were built we have to live with that\nWe have to figure out how to live with real life\nWith them if you do your older conservative\nThan a Springer show by the
