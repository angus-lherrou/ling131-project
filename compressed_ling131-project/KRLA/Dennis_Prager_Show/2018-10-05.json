a point a nearby so firmly that no matter who\nWill be appointed that was a conservative would not be allowed you know much like it out of the Supreme Court I don't necessarily have to be a an accusation um from a woman or against the powerful\nSo I'd lost in a ... it's a good point uh meat neither of us knows because it's a hypothetical I Believe I Believe that right now there is sexual McCarthyism as Alan Dershowitz said\nAnd I don't and Tony I think that that's that's the one that is a given that they would stop for bless you my friend I Hope we meet at a Cleveland speech sounds like a good man fight like you to heal Arabs are sure which now he was on with Tucker Carlson last night on Fox News\nAnd I I really salute demand for his courage very very rare as you know courage as

anxiety what you do is you tell the person\nThe person who becomes anxious you have to work on this I've known someone who had such anxieties not with clapping but with large groups of people you

I've been waiting Eighteen years even listening to everybody that happy happy happy happy happy make the world better to have me make the world worse it is a moral obligation to act\nHappy whenever possible [noise] guess happiness\nIs a moral virtue not an emotional state that is something nobody thinks about unless they listen to the ... is our with me\nAnd I was not bragging nonsense like that I have zero interest in bragging I [laughter] I just am interested in telling you the sad truth that you're not going to hear that outside of this show or my book on happiness that happiness is a moral virtue\nYou know who knew what the founders knew what life liberty and the pursuit of happiness pursuit of happiness is a good thing pursuit of fun is not a good thing to\nGet it\nHow we are born here today's topic on a one to ten scale of importance is drum roll play is [noise]\nNine points for four or six new line for three to five that is how important it is my friends we are very precise on this program now you're some the to a gentleman that I work with the living martyr and a triple G\nAre thinking why does that bring come up with stuff like that\nIs that correct yes all very good yeah you know what that dates you you're very young how do you know that there were slide rules about your father had a slide rule hey a a living martyr how many uh guys under or girls under thirty nowhere to slide rule is\nClose to ... that's so interesting\nHow about what else well what was that thing we used where you had the pin on one side and the\nAnd the pencil on the other and made a circle\nWhat was it lightly pro tractor although I have not use that word\n... before Reagan I Know I pro tractor I Would if you just said you will not eat until you come up with that word I starve to death pro tractor [laughter]\nDo they use that you don't like I was with a bunch of kids the other day kids or college kids and I asked them how many of you can read and write cursive\n... remember though this was a Colorado Christian university so I think that I got a disproportionately high number who said yeah I can read curses them I said okay how do you ride a capital by\n[laughter] and\nI can get a very positive response today's subject is indeed extremely important this this could change your life I Love like I'm not kidding [noise]\nVery very very very few people have a good in every area of life\nI ... I mean every important area of life let me give you a list or write a list of and if I miss them eight I Would ask the two gentlemen with who I work to come up with something I missed All right now and by the way this is not an order of importance is solely in order of their\nAppearance in my brain actually in my in my mind show for example health\nChildren parents\nSpouse and north marriage work\nAll right how many people\nCan say that in all of those areas of life they have\nBeen the recipient of great happiness the answer is very few\nI was with somebody who has a spectacular life strict ... children in great health\nAnd a fair marriage affair marriage ... not a particularly good marriage\nAnd this person I couldn't even say male or female this person or did I say great career as well as I mentioned that I don't think so children career health\nTerrific marriage fair\nAnd the answer it with the person like a better marriage absolutely is the person basically happy you absolutely\nBecause you have to find happiness where you can\nThat's the lesson of today's happy this hour and very few people find it in all major arenas\n\nAll right that's that's you ... you don't like your job okay you have a good marriage All right so be happy\n\nTo be the ability to have happiness supplied as it were by every major avenue\nIs a rare warm for most people want any Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six is the number if you take this seriously you can have a happier life\nIt just it just doesn't work out for everybody\nEvery major area a happiness producer so your task if you want to be happy as opposed to unhappy and I I this is one of the revelations of my life is how many people really don't work on being happy\nAnd I to me that's more amazing that people are working on their health but maybe it's maybe it's analogous\n\nYou know if people do X Y or Z they would be healthier and they don't do it because I guess it's hard but maybe it's hard to be to work on being happy so\nIt is what it is but if you want to be happy or happy or you have to understand you have to accept the fact that very few people for very few people those life deliver in all arenas\nOf life that's that's a key\nBecause otherwise what you do is you fixate on that which isn't\nGood so this person was a a fair marriage that you know nothing to write home about and ... not worthy of divorce understands that there are other avenues oh excuse me I Can't believe it I Can't believe I missed one\nI should send myself the punishment room but I've never I've never done that I've the punishment room\nIs only earned for carelessness\nNot for content\nBut I don't know maybe I'm wrong maybe content should should apply anyway friends\nHow did I forget that one\nSo friends health marriage I sit parents I ah I Know of course children I Know but I I'm thinking I it's the one includes parents in the look if you have wonderful parents it's a big bonus in life is all put parents and\nSo parents children friend's health work marriage\nThere you go if you got 'em on all cylinders that I mean that's like having an all wheel drive and be and I was thinking of a brand name but I don't want to push any particular brand name here but you know what I mean I mean and all wheel drive super luxury s._u._v.\n\nAlright that's it's not most people can't afford it or just don't have a one eight Prager seven seven six\nI like you to call in ... she ever question or um you see if you defer you know if you don't have one of those well the truth is if you don't have health that's a toughie\nI Would say of all of them that may be might might be the toughest but it depends what health means\nIf you if the health is debilitating or not for example Charles crowd hammer the wonderful late commentator you know it was paralyzed almost fully from the neck down that's bad health but he he he was a fully functioning\nHighly functioning more functioning that most people want to power one\nIndividual love life [noise] and every body\nYou gotta find happiness where you can and few people have it in all the ... of life that I mentioned you are listening to the happiness our second hour every Friday on the dentist Prager\nFor you to be happy you can't say oh when I fix this I'll be happy you have to be happy wall fixing so I Want you to fix if you can\nIf one of those areas or two or three of those areas are or not sources of happiness I Would love you to pursue those areas but you can't the for being happy until those successfully\nAccomplished\nSo that makes sense that\nReally it's a very good answer I think yeah [laughter]\nOh You're welcome thank you that's the best\nQuestion answer good [noise]\nAh I like that\nWhat if you do this is from triple ... what if you do with the other person in your life fails to realize this can you be happy with someone who doesn't realize this he told me about a a a a love interest you're talking about a friend ...\nWell I Would answer it let's say even a spouse let's say you have a spouse that isn't on board and in these matters that's why I said then you still have the hopefully health friend's children parents or work and remember or not in order\nTo be sources of happiness [noise] this is so I wasn't I was kidding about nine point nine four seven six for three to four seven three six to but I'm not kidding about how important this is\nAnd you can't that's why Julie's question was so important you can't pay this is how people live\nI'm not happy but I Will be happy when I get a raise\nWhen I have a better job when I moved to ah to Baltimore oh well as a bad choice I'm kidding Baltimore I'm kidding I'm totally kidding don't be offended that\nWhen I get married when I have children when my children got to get married when I leave our eyes that's good when I lose this weight that's right yes there's always a wedding I'll be happy when you can't do I'll be happy when\n[laughter]\nThat that's the point that all this time until when happened just wasted\n\nAnd you don't know how much time you'll get anyway you know people die young\nJust for the record you don't you we don't have any guarantees you celebrate\nWhat you can now\nYes it's very important\nThe went issue ... people have that that I have talked about but not as the weather shoe I

advice [laughter] [noise] uh yes I Do so ah yeah here it\nGoes and I'm just putting you on hold there [noise]\nSo what the what does it mean to be a bar or ... ... is the Hebrew word for commandment it's translated often as good deed and many commandments are good deeds but it means command [noise]\nSo let's take that seriously the notion in Judaism is that at guerrilla twelve or a boy of Thirteen is now responsible\nFor their own sins until now you did bad it was on your parents' record now it's on your record wild one should be excited if their bar mitzvah one should be a little afraid to\nBecause now there is no protective shield between you and your moral record before God\nYou can't blame your parents as if tomorrow in fact parents say a prayer thanking God that they are now freed from\nFrom the moral record of their children I take that very seriously took it seriously when I was your age I took it seriously as the as the parent of two book two boys who have permits\nSo this is a spectacular notion I Am now responsible for my life it's the matter is the opposite of what is taught in America today to so many kids I'm not responsible for my life others are\nSo that's that's a big one that you now take control of your moral life\nAnd does that make sense\nFor\nSay thank you that's that's precious\nI'll give you another one the the on the work commandment do right I've said this often the biggest difference between my religious and I think Christians religious education and secular education in America today is this I was raised\n... I'll give you two differences I was raised obligation oriented kids today are raised rights oriented how you're going to make a better human being whose preoccupied with his or her rights or his or her obligations\nI didn't hear the word rights to like off to college I ... I knew the word obligations throughout throughout my life oh by the way to give you a real powerful example\nThe uh uh Judaism and Christianity believe that the husband and wife have sexual obligations to the to their spouse\nYou say that today you're accused of advocating marital rape Huffington Post just accused me of marital rape second time I've been accused at least I Know of I'm sure it doesn't know that this doesn't times but I mean the big places because I wrote an article ten years ago\nNow which I'm proud of and people should read it\nSaying that given the importance of sex to a marriage if you love your husband\nAnd he loves you and he's a good man don't let mood alone determine whether you will have sex with him sometimes just have it because you love it that's called marital rape today\nThat I Believe that there are obligations I have obligations to my wife ... in in a whole host of berries and she has obligations to me in a whole host of areas\nThe other difference between a religious education in a secular education I was taught that the greatest problem in Dennis ... life is Dennis prayer that is a religious school Christian school Jewish school\nThe biggest issue in your life is you\nSecular school biggest issue in life is American society sexism racism and xenophobia homophobia et cetera big difference say so those are my areas for

respected I think that the I think if my children have no fear of me it wouldn't have been good\nThat but today at their ages in their twenties and thirties I don't I don't want them to fear me I don't I don't think that's that would be a good thing I Want them to respect me and love me but uh when they're when they're eight I Would like them to fear me feel like this Andrew I asked I did an hour once\nIf you didn't do drugs when you were in high school or college or let's say high school why not\nThe biggest the most common answer was because my mother would kill me\n\nThat's good very
