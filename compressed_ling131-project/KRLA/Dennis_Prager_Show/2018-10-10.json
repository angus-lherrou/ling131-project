ATF get the results as they need to keep defending religious freedom\nAll across America invited you before a\nWhy is it really folk hero well I mean look ... ... Trump says stuff that no one ever says like when Reagan said Mr Gorbachev tear down this wall\nPeople lost their mind you can't say that I really believe as you do as a Christian that these are prophetic words they shake the demons tremble when you speak truth to power and when when this president says something like\nA cabinet you are an innocent man in front of the world in front of the whole world people lose their minds because you have just\nSpoken a powerful truth that everyone says you must not take sides you must not\nAnd so he is the ... I mean most people who like him understand that but I think a lot of people on the fence trying to figure them out [noise] and I really thought first of all with all this hour in this in our time the bitter sour left you know a ... banging on the Supreme Court door intriguing like devil's and and behaving like children this madness first of all\nWe need to\nHave some humor and to celebrate what is good warriors remember out of court happy worry that's right and so So Tim wrangler and I wrote a it's it's I don't know if it's a children's book or a parody of a children's book but I Do I look I I still\nRead asterisk until I Love our Saturday and I think that that has a lot of truth in those ... now that's exactly right so\nSo we created a fable it's called Donald drained the swamp in Savannah caveman name Donald okay hall the cave people are angry because they say\nThe king king who lives in the middle of a swamp and he never he's totally out of touch with us he\nDoesn't know about our concerns we can't even talk to him because the swamp people up protect him he will only talk to people who live in the swamp what do we do so they go to Donald Donald the kind of a famous caveman he's a builder of caves everybody wants to have built by Donald uh and so they go to Donald Donald can you help us\nOr they told us that the situation is as well tomorrow you know I've got some time I'll go down to the swamp and see what's going on so he takes a walk down to the swamp encounters a first swamp creature\nA lobbyist tourists and the lobbyists or a says you don't understand you can't talk to the king the king doesn't talk to people who live outside the swamp he only has to be living inside and so I'm so if you want to live in this one maybe work something out down says not interested I'll see you later so he goes back and tells\nThe cave people he says listen it's worse than we thought were gonna have to get drastic and he said they said what do you mean drastic he says we are going to have to drain the swamp and they kind of get scared like you can't say that don't that don't say that the\nMineral if the only way and if you will how you gonna do you're gonna get a swamp people angry and he goes well you're angry aren't you and they say yes and it's just well maybe it's their turn so\nThe next day he decides I'm going to dig a trench he's a builder he knows how to do this kind of oil is not a war with China and Mexico is not going to pay for it but he says we are going to build the biggest or the ... trench we've ever dug and so he goes by himself with a shovel down to the swamp now the swamp creatures come out one of them looks\nA little bit like Chuck Schumer one of them might look like Hillary Clinton I'm not being specific about that off as you yeah the artist that when you when you look at it you can figure out who these people are but but they get angry they said we live here you are sitting there and and he says well what do you live where we live\nYou either live or where we live and they say we don't want to live outside the swamp the people who live outside the swamp are uneducated\nThey're on cultured they're deplorable\nKenny understands that you know what all he needs to do is dig the trench and ignore these creatures so he starts to dig the trench and as he is taking the trench he sees that the swamp green color the swamp is actually the color of money why because the whole swamp is money that's why the swamp creatures will not leave\nThe swamp so he starts digging and then the biggest battle swamp creature ball shows up and he's angry\nThe biggest bad a swamp creature of all is called\nThe George Soros\nAnd the Georgia sources really angry he has bags under his other than the he looks Hungarian and he looks like a billionaire but but the Georgia store is is really angry but Donald turns around and\nAll of the cave people are showing up with shovels and they say well not as angry as we are and they help him dig the trench dig the trench during the swung dreamed of as one of the rest of the way they want to have to buy it for the incredible credible but but at the end of the book there's a true teaching moment about what is\nSelf government what does it mean for people to govern themselves with American style self government\nDonald rises to the occasion and he refuses to be the new king he says no no no a free people govern themselves and that is very exciting so they so he says if you're looking for a president not a King I'm your caveman\nWashington gentleman ladies listeners think about the facts of the greatest works of fiction or about reality about truth Shakespeare wasn't writing fantasy players to entertain you he was writing about power\nAnd read the novel is get Eric my
