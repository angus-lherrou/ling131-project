only on one look at it and complement to President Trump's presidency that found\nPeople are nice and it can I just think that's just how\nWell it's certainly a complement to America the truth is that it happened on ... under President Obama and the economy was was not good you are right that there was it that they know how good things all over the United states and how low the unemployment rate is\nSo that they could most likely get a job\nBut a ... it's remember ... look let's be honest compared to hunt Doris in Guatemala\nThe American economy is always robust\nSo if these people aren't sitting down with the wall Street Journal and checking out the stock prices that they they know where it's better here is the point though that the\nKey point and that is just should be made every single day why would these people want to replicate the failed societies from which they come\nBy the way I Know again for the left who in their superficial little intellectual bubble think to say something is a failed societies to engage in racism it has nothing to do with race should is one hundred percent values is zero percent race\n\nCan't people ask why is America prosper is is is that if you were in Guatemala\nYou every one of you listening if you weren't granted Guatemala and and see the door and Honduras or El Salvador and watching or in Brazil doesn't matter any Latin American country essentially and watching your society\nJust be mired in poverty and corruption why wouldn't you ask the single most obvious question why is America affluent\nThere was no other question anyone in Latin America thinking about the economic situation there are other situations but thinking about economics there is no other question to be asked\nWhy does America work why don't Americans ask that question why does America work but they don't\nInstead the left asks asks why is America so racist and Xena phobic and homophobic and Islamophobia could cetera\nWhat you what people who care about people as opposed to get just care about anger should be asking is why does it work\nThe question in this question intelligent people bought for people ask you not why Americans have slaves it's wide in America abolish slavery\nIt's not why use their poverty in America it's why use there so much affluence in America every question asked is the wrong question\nThat's that's the point that needs to be made something just it just came to my mind I was just reading about the likelihood of Americans of different Americans when I was speaking about Americans complaining on the left\nThere was just a survey done about who is most likely to demonstrate\nAnd ... the the results were fascinating and it turns out of course left his were far more likely to engage in demonstrations then

[noise]\nNot discussed enough the ultimate issues because we get so bogged down people were for example news junkies but of course nobody remembers what they saw on the news or read the day before was saying you shouldn't be up on the news I obviously I Am I have to be I Want to be [noise]\nBut ultimately to use the ... term ultimately the ultimate issues are what\nWe mean division of life today's program today's topic\nIs so important that I only wonder if I ever devoted an hour to it I mentioned that I mentioned it in passing regularly [noise]\nBut I don't know if I ever devoted to an hour to be you do see one\nChecking credit for going back very far it's an indication\nThat and that subject is a word that is not you it's the most important thing and it's not used\nWhich is a a real reason for the problems and troubles of our time in America and in the west in the world generally it's W. word that with the double your booze\nPeople without thinking thinking work\nWe're\nGoing to have many people even if I say the W. word no wisdom [noise] you know how bad it is how bad the situation is the word is boring to most people\nSay to a young person would you like to be wise I think you will get to the response what do you mean would you like wisdom what do you mean would you prefer wisdom\nWar a new iPhone [laughter]\nThe federal really that will really do it I Would I think that the somebody needs to be what poll a with a I I'm not even just ... you know under forty\n\nIf you could have every ... knew the newest model Android or the newest model iPhone every year for the rest of\nYour life or wisdom [laughter] I Wonder what people would vote for but I think most people would say what you mean that's the point it's not valued\nLet me tell you where where is is that my whole life it it has been a ... a love I Want to understand what is wisdom understand me life that is what wisdom is okay it's a it's it's the single word term for understanding of life\nYou can know a great deal and understand that nothing that is why the highly educated are usually the least wise\nMembers of our society [noise] hey because universities teach the opposite of wisdom they teach you to be a fool in my opinion [noise] some people to skate on harmed but many don't and secondly because they teach you implicitly from up explicitly\nThat knowledge is what matters rather than wisdom\n[noise]\nWalk to what aside from political correctness and the preoccupation and race and gender what does it show that Shakespeare's poster was taken down at the University of Pennsylvania English department\nIt shows a lack of wisdom because he wrote the wisest please written in the English language but it's not value\nAll that matters is not wisdom bought in this case race and gender so they they dismissed him because he was a white\nMale and they put up a female I don't know what color\n\nWisdom without wisdom you can't do good\nThis and good is what most concerns me good versus evil you can't be a good person if if you're a fool and the food is the opposite of the white person and those of you for biblical you oriented build the word food is used pretty often\nWhat was the fool fool as a person without wisdom doesn't mean a person without compassion so let me talk to you about compassion for a moment wisdom is infinitely more important than compassion in setting social policy\n\nWith me if it's if if you just hear that today it will be very important if if only that sinks in [noise] in making political social policy for a society wisdom is infinitely more important than compassion\nCompassion without wisdom is destructive\n[noise]\nAnd that's what we have that is what we have in the western world vast amount of compassion or pseudo compassion that doesn't matter even if it's genuine compassion but compassion without wisdom is overly destructive\nSo I feel bad for people I'm not going to get into policies are going to continue the discussion about wisdom but I give you an example here\nI feel bad for people who don't have as much as others and so we will give them more benefits\nBut the white person asks what are you doing to that person and to the society by giving them more and more people benefits\nIs it good for society is a different question that's a question of wisdom is it compassionate is not a question that has anything to do with wisdom\n[noise]\nCompassion without wisdom is destructive\n\nAnd we don't produce people with wisdom because wisdom is in talks wisdom isn't salt it isn't taught because it isn't soft\n\nI Believe ultimately in fact the radical secularization of western society is at the core of the lack of wisdom\n\nWhen I get calls this I have but I Know I mentioned before when I get calls here from let's say a twelve or Fifteen year old\nAnd the kid talks about important things of life I Am certain that they are in a religious hold them in every case that it's turned out to be true [noise]\nTwelve or Fifteen year old if they would even listen to discussions of great issues like I have a my show even if they even ... they would call in about let's save the planet\nThey wouldn't call in about an issue of wisdom\n[noise] they would be worried for people they would be again compassionate without wisdom\n[noise]\nThis is the great problem and I realized that in college so I had all these professors who were very very bright very very male legible\nLiterally unwise didn't understand life\nI fear for a society that does not value wisdom and that is happening in western society [noise] or they\nPrager seven seven six is the number eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nWisdom will create a much better society\nBut you can't make policy of compassion\nCounty with ... no I
