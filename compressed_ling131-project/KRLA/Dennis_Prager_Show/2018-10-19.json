of all it's a very important question am I I Will work on a more elaborate answer a butt off the top of my head\nFirst of all you must be clear ironically I'm using that term you have to be clear that what you are seeking is clarity even though you may want to win an argument you\nHave to sincerely seek clarity you can desire to win after that but your primary aim must be ... where do we differ\nThat's that's the ... the ... the most important whether it is with a spouse a friend or or political foe where is it that we differ let's try to establish that then we can argue on on who was right\nBut first the least let's figure this out when I have done that with the Cold War is about half the time the conversation and did something like this to the truth is we don't really defer that much at all do we know that interesting\nAnd then other times it just becomes clear if somebody says for example that uh uh I I just wanted to get a good example my wife\nThat column was that age Donald Trump or a massage in St Paul I saw was clarity I had no desire to defend him not defend him it was not the issue it was written after the election so nobody could charge me with trying to influence votes I just wanted clarity on the word ...\n... right and and I think that I provided venue before you answer the question or answered the charge that this man or any man is a massage missed let's try to define the terms\nAnd it turns out that sexually object to find women doesn't make you a ... it makes you a heterosexual\nJust as sexually object defying men if you are a man makes

fight them at the same time\nNow if you got a PHD in women's studies you cannot possibly know that but if if you will allow for clarity then you can so that so does that at all helpful\nOr very thank you so much and thanks for all you do\nOh God am I happy said yes\nI didn't have no idea what he would say say well it's interesting but not briefly\nI Know that it's so important what does it mean
