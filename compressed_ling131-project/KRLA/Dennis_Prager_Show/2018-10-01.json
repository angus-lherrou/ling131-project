interviewed by Scott Kelly of CBS News and the interview was about a Senator Flake basically essentially by a by his demand forcing the White House and the president to\nCall for what is now happening a seven day FBI investigation limited in scope to expand the background review a Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh\nThe FBI will reportedly take seven days to look into the accusations made by three different women of sexual misconduct all of the accusations are different they're not a ... their specific allegations the behaviors are different but they run the spectrum of\nOf ah exposing himself and and ... and ... doctor forge testimony on Thursday\nAnd watching things to doing things the allegations are all over the table really right they really are\nYeah yeah so the FBI is doing that Scott Kelly asked Senator Jeff flake if he thinks that a week from now we might still be sitting here just waiting longer\nFor some sort of resolution over judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court ordered the chances that we are going to be in exactly the same\nPlace a week from now\nWhen the chance and we knew that some of our colleagues said that that will be back here one week from now it'll be worse so we'd rather outrageous allegations have come forward the FBI we'll talk to people who want to talk anymore or we won't be any better off um\nThere is a chance that that will happen I I Do think that we can make progress\nSenator Flake of Arizona his Democratic colleagues Senator Chris Coons of don't say Connecticut a has a has a different perspective he says indeed will be in a different place after the seven day FBI investigation into the background of judge Kavanaugh\nI think will be in a different place because lots of survivors around the country will feel that I'm Dr Ford story was hurt and respected and further investigated we may well be in a different place a week from now because judge cabin on his family may well have had exculpatory evidence brought forward\nTo judge Kavanaugh shown to apply to the committee\nSome nations over\n... in the morning man Senator Jeff flake and senator Christopher Coons they both seemed low jams out for sure

the Democrats on the left we're in our in many view calling and stay there and try to get two and a little bit I just want to for some other ideas out to you\nI Want you first to consider the importance of a quote that my one of my brothers share with me from our second president John Adams here's the quote it is more important that innocence be protecting than it is that guilt be punished\nFor guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished but if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned perhaps to die than the critics will say whether I Do good or whether I Do evil is immaterial for innocence itself\nIs no protection and such an ideas that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end of security whatsoever that's partially what's taking place that's uncalled by the way the Democrats ... out there know what their unleashing\nDo they care they're destroying one of the basic tenants of our republic the presumption of innocence they are asking for trouble they're also asking for trouble if they want to go back to high school and check everybody's teenage years\nAmong us is so proud of those years and where's the bank account a thirty five years if he even committed what he's accused of as a teenager I thought we at least the left I thought they believed in redemption and they haven't kept the left\nThat wants people to be forgiven even those who commit capital offenses\nBut now the teenage years are in play and maybe soon part of that the junior high years\nAnd by the way I Believe you confess to some sexual assault ... senator Cory Booker during those years how come you were still in the Senate\nAnd I thought Joe Biden plagiarized while he was in college how come he was vice president and senator cotton tweeted\nSenator watch this I knew about this but here's the tweet senator Blumenthal lied for years about serving in Vietnam which is all you need to know about his courage and honesty maybe he should reconsider before questioning judge Kavanaugh's credibility [noise]\nEven the New York times reported that this is me now Blumenthal has said he served in Vietnam when in fact this is the times when in fact started at least five military deferments and eventually landed a spot in the marine reserve where he used was ... was officially guaranteed knocked to serve in the conflict itself\nSenator Blumenthal ask Kevin off he was familiar with I mispronounced the Latin false us in you know false us in on the bus which the legal principle that dictates jurors can rule a witness to be false and everything if he says one thing that is not true [noise]\nExcuse me center Blumenthal but that does that also apply to you\nOr do you have a six different now for lying\nI watch these hearings and I felt like I was living in an alternate universe tell me if you felt the same way if you're on the other side of I'll take your shoes and the other side of I Want to get calls from people who disagree why it all makes sense do you want to prayer seven seven six now another thing I Want you to consider this\nIn my home state of California I suggested on Facebook that Senator Feinstein deserves consequences for her to publicity and Republicans should vote for her opponent who may be further less than she is acknowledge that my brother another brother suggested this to me because what difference will make whether a leftist\nIs replaced by far left as\nI remember years ago comedian Mort Saul said that voters are often given a choice between Tweedle dum and Tweedle dum are\nNow it's much less innocent than that and what's the big difference between a choice between left and far less\nOne at least he's telling you where they stand and going for

biggest issue we face\nAnd he is the sworn enemy of President Trump so let them go for their left his utopia and let's get the pain over with what do you think of that idea let's get Republicans to

can feel the pain out there it he he saw this and let's go to a I like Josh in San Antonio is question or comment go ahead Josh\nHi Michael sure you\nKnow I just wanted to basically say that uh you know in my own reaction any way to the testimony early or testimony which is I think Republicans may have gone at it a little bit\nWrong angle I think maybe that they won't when you come up you can't really question anybody's memory without coming off a little bit vicious especially in a I'm a when a victim you're talking about starting to think that they should have basically said hey we understand that\nYou're that you're you've been going through a rough time company must have happened to you and your incredible were not questioning that at all I think that what they should have done it that\nIf the if there was a terrible situation to where somebody brought you evidence or brought you an unelected accusation but had no evidence what would you do and then giving our that option she would have no chance other than to say that what\nHappened is that it requires Robin it evident in order to destroy somebody's life if they could have gone around to that then it could've been like that we need your help to bring some evidence that there is any evidence and then from there you wouldn't have been accused of not remembering\nI'd like your style that's and that's that would have been a good way to do it unless you may have different or lawyers who knows and they would have had some objections saying she's not here to answer that kind of a question I don't know\nYou never know what but it by like your approach thanks a lot of Josh and I knew you had a good comment there let's go uh let's continue the inquisition in some ways even though you know how I feel

where this is all going and what it means for the upcoming elections as well as for the future of the Republican\nThere Sean steel Republican committee men from the former great state of California you can't say that but I can and artist Steinberg political consulting pollster and writer of whiplash from JFK to Donald Trump\nOr political odyssey [noise]\nReal gentleman I don't even know where to begin the colors are still there but to the parents have been accused of surprise you even in the first place [noise] ... [noise]\nYou know if I if there were the vast right wing conspiracy which I was the head when she came forward to that she would have been just dismissed but of course it would have been pre supposing that the Democrats were also liberals like Alan Dershowitz simply would have said to\nDo if I were Dianne Feinstein and she weren't interested the blood sport of gutting this nominee a while we her mid eighties is her final swan song there when this letter came to me or the staff would have looked interviewed proceed look if you want to be anonymous and there isn't any cooperation there is a long time ago this doesn't come across\nThe threshold for me to pursue and I wouldn't be the end of it\nAnd aren't speaking of Dianne Feinstein center Feinstein did you I don't know if you heard me suggests that Republicans and you're the national committee men for public after Republican Party in California that maybe we should vote for her opponent so there's some consequences for what she's doing what she did the top two primary system\nIs another unique the listeners should know that some other disasters showing nature of\nCalifornia that you're allowed to vote for two people doesn't matter only two people ah who get the highest number of votes regardless of party affiliation with no primaries any more minor parties have disappeared in California so not consequently we get one crazy Democrat too far left wing cook Democrat\nAs our only choices for US Senate we can't even write in a terrible idea Democrat activists say the Republican activists have that certain ... folks love it and it and so what we have is a dying Feinstein or as as a left wing opponent and Sean steals aren't gonna vote for either one I Can't even right in what about what\nAbout mark suggestion that these people are so upset I tell you this idea of felt like going to measure fights on campaign Bill Carrick who I've known for many years and say you know\nWhat you're going to have those is the average Republican voter the average Republican vote that's what we should just get it doesn't know the Kevin de Leon her opponent is more left wing than she is France or they're gonna viscerally react against Feinstein by voting for the other Democrat\nBut you do for your people naturally listening to the show they say ... what is your way or the future be where with this is is that when there was a so called primary the top two vote getters go into the general election you let her what so if the Democrats are strategizing and take over your state when November comes you have a choice between bad to worse\nNow that's what it is that's why I say it's ... it's not only my idea of other people have suggested it I think we should vote for her opponent and maybe she will win\nRight if you want to be tactical do you say okay if she gets re elected she did her eighties she's getting less and less energy I just watched the way she walks to the podium to talk to Senator Grassley their\nGroups Elvis dot super high energy there and if you get Kevin de le and he's a younger person he's gonna be around for years so he won't have seniority that she'll have but he'll be a threat to us in a while I posted this on Facebook people are upset with me and they did say what\nWas ... that are dying find since she was like more or less the kind of a semi acceptable Democrat because she wasn't as crazy as as as her colleagues\nBut now she joined that that that group and now we're back to the Salem witch trials Salem witch trials relationship disabled broad right I was gonna say yeah exactly but this is an Salem, Massachusetts a sixteen id to they can\nYou know there were ... there's a hysterical people that were making crazy accusations against a number of women there were hung\nA and they were accused of being witches and it was it even against what they did but it was it was their ghost that did terrible\nMark full disclosure is I knew Shaun steel and he was in high school\nSo I'm not no no not you know let let that go I don't wanna hear any more about that I Will do want to ask you though what she credible some listener picked on me saying all your talk shows are saying she had some measure credibility\n... she was extremely well prepared she's a psychologist she's done the whole life she's been practicing this role for for many years to come she had a group of very smart media savvy lawyers\nAnd no she wasn't I thought she gave a good story and that was effective but it was a great presentation but when you dig into and you see that nothing about her story her life story makes any sense but\nYou say that and I agree with you but Republicans they didn't say she wasn't credible one of your callers I think the key points we always start out by giving her credibility there\nYeah well you know because we want to be courteous ... carrying not to be angry against women and and the ... and possibly somebody who was actually had this experience pitch you got the wrong guy and she probably knows in our mind and heart of hearts that she got the wrong guy but she's she's she's a tool often\nBut you know it's like our our behind they leak the fact we're going to have a women or a woman\nThat question her because we don't want these Republican mail is such a self defeat your consult right so is that a smart move terrible first of all it was a good move that to have these senators not grandstanding ... you know ed Royce when he chaired the foreign affairs committee they hit it and ...\nAnd ... and I looked at it was awful but it wasn't at he's competing but every house member wanted to have their day in the Sunday or their Fifteen minutes of things but there was no choreography no strategy no coordination\nSo they were wary of that I get that but why should I have to read the New York times Washington Post is going to be a Republican tactic secondly they never should have done the traditional thing alternating Democrat Republican and giving a ... I Know that I thought every time a swimming that she was confident I mean I've been crossed with them if you have 'em and you want to keep going so he do we have lawyers\nOn our site as their US Senators\nWho are so an app that they agreed to this format rather say look all you Democrat's gonna go go through August up there when you're done we're going to have our personal question or\nThey should have had you that well they I again the Republicans were in a bind they're looking at all the stats and appalled and women are angry and they've been walking away a as a sizable number maybe ten twenty percent of women are walking away voting against Republicans because they think Republicans are bought\nIn ... in this hearing I I'm going to say something a little bit uniquely ... I like what Chuck Grassley is generally done he's kept telling me you know and I have kept the tough schedule and look he's got a real problem at you and I don't have to face in daily life he has to get eleven boast about Twenty one person committee tests and fake flavors flaking out so\nThe whole hearing loss for one person in the universe was for Jeff Flake ... got his hearing any voted out and I told you like what was the earning what was your flakes name before he changed it I you know what I think it was born that way that's sad to say\nNow Jeff weasel yeah and then he changed the thought that it was but unless you're a lucky we got to vote I got to tell you something I'm grateful for that now\nFlakes got another week going on with us I think it's actually good and I'm going to tell you my cold calculating political reasons yes making my team very angry fired up their team's been angry and fired up for two years now it's about time our team wakes up understand smell the roses we have a nasty enemy here\nThey're about they're trying to take over the house representatives\nAnd if you say gets bad today wait till you see Maxine Waters in charge of a major committee that's really going to end up ... put us over the\nOf it it's very scary she were to look if the Democrats take control at who would share the the major companies in the house\nIt's it's a rogues gallery of I mean you when you see people who are going to be an arm sources they couldn't get a security clearance ... there are people going to be having oversight or the CIA\nFor software so the message clearly it's as I said you got to you know be enthused enough to go out there and vote and get everybody you know and look at the at the at the national strategy 'cause we have a national leadership there\nThe Democrats are counting on for example getting a few seats there in California like let's say Dana Rohrabacher and you talk to a conservative washing their not yet energized\nThey don't realize that this was a battle out here they just look at Republican registration so if you live in orange county right that you got to come out for dinner ... ... s national implications how few how she can do it make the different ... ... ...\nYeah I think average voters don't understand what it means when one party controls that chamber the Senate or the house there it means that they control the committees that it it is Maxine Waters there it would be fulltime impeachment twenty four out of it\nNot only that Orange County as the pathway for Nancy Pelosi we've got four seats at risk we got great candidates oddly enough of the four seats we got three women running the Democrats have three guys running\nSo so so in other words we're we're we got the right demographics you've got the right approach or getting out spent two to one six to one and some of these races we need a muscle up and get serious and show up like the Tea Party get in two thousand and ten so that's the conclusion we we got to get out there to all our listeners out there that are are women candidates were born women [noise]\nOkay was judge Kevin are critical that was a blessing\nI you know ... you heard that yeah you heard the speech is a little you know girlie boys at that that we heard in the morning and you know this terrible victim and she looked good she had to make up was she didn't have any makeup on\nA she had a nice smile or by the way our entire statement was pretty written and and circulate it did you know that it wasn't on the spontaneous Damon she she was all written out by her lawyers and she had she had rehearsed for several weeks probably for for many years of her life because\nFor some reason she got this weird obsession against Kavanaugh cabinet came through not ... with without notes

eight descriptions the psychological impact of the event raised questions\nNine the activities of congressional Democrats and Dr Ford's attorney is likely affect the doctor for its account and I think these are all great point because what why did she do it at a\nDay or the the first of all we all could front is that\nIs that we're ... these are wonderful points but\nOur whole discussion is all this is on the the the the opponents turf there this is what we're discussing it sort of cattle that we have to do it there but secondly you know the reality is that if this were done properly the Republicans when they were going to have her there they would have a different form and secondly she would have had somebody\nPlay the role of this is a preparations there to go through all the possible response is there a good cross cross examining adaptations where no matter what the answer they know the model of quick your they oh what's what's your follow up question goes a long one line or the other there and wait a minute erupt interruption you go to there\nAnd look you know I've talked to two to too many of the women have been uh\nIt had sexual assaults that lives out there but the the point that they all hinged on is that this was a girl who was not driving age who said that her her parents drove or places there\nBut she has no recollection of how she got to this party\nAnd she has she went downstairs out the bathroom and somehow got home without telling you seeing anybody on anybody else at the party like I'm leaving for somebody attacked me or I don't feel well or just ran out the door did she hitchhiked whatever wind up the prosecutor asked certainly up that I have to tell you with somebody who's been involved as a consultant many lawyers in in in cross examination than in some several criminal cases\nThat sounded so inherently implausible objectively so we're both of my political ... are you there because first of all you would have expressed grad to the person who took you always Oh thank you very much or eat if you didn't watch all the details\nAre ... that would have been on your mind you wouldn't remember that hurdle if you don't remember how you got
