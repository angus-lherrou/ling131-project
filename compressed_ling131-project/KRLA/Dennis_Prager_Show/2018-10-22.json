weekend all over Southern California a staggering Seventy seven point five million dollar debut universal\nTops the weekend with Halloween the second largest October opening weekend of all time I like when they do this because I'm a huge fan of Halloween I Am I Am a I I'm a self\nAnointed expert on the original from Nineteen Seventy eight thank you very much a John Carpenter by the way conducted this scored costs you at what caught your attention\nAbout this movie in Nineteen said well why is this your favorite movie\nOh that's a interesting but I don't know if it is an interesting question I Hope my answer is interesting I was six years old when it came out my parents did not take me the movie theater but in Nineteen eighty are so right before Halloween to the sequel came out\nMy great friend on Staten Island Joey potential\nIsraeli pretend a joy pretends that called me and he said you got to get over here he lived a we lived in one Fifteen was our address he lived to Fifteen by one name straight but he was at the we're ... you were a hundred breed apart\nBut he called me he said you and your brother need to get over here because\nMy dad brought home a beta max [laughter] he said and we sit right next to the eight track he said he's got this movie says it's really scary it's called Halloween I said okay I was in the movie did my mom and dad wouldn't let me see because\nCome over and we sat and had to be a stop and anti he's having a Joey my brother berry me can Murphy Brian Powell and a bunch of us sat around in the TV room in the tens of house on Staten Island and watched on beta max the original Halloween\nAnd we'd probably in our childhood watched it you know dozens and dozens of times and then we make a like some kids will do we make our own short\n... scary movies and uh when I grew up I Can't do it in a way it inspired you it really didn't really frightened me as a young kid\nAnd the music is very the music to this day frightens me as even as an adult but the the original ... camping this very campy the original Halloween but ah as an adult you know I come to LA and I know the shooting locations and I visited them I've I've even done tours I've hosted\nTours of the shooting locations I'm I'm a I speak out on one thing some people get out on a game of Thrones and video games I geek out on the original Nineteen Seventy eight\nJohn Carpenter classic Halloween so on Tuesday I'm going to go and throw a few more dollars on top of the Seventy seven point five million brought in by Jamie Lee Curtis in a very talented cast and the great John Carpenter as they uh redo Halloween for the fortieth anniversary so you have questions for me is you\nKnow I I I Do because ah this this is the impact of financial results of this movie you've got me a little intrigued I probably I I might want to see it uh but I always wait until movies are available for me to view them in my whole\nThing I've seen the now this is a a new movie and I've seen the original Halloween in festivals where it's like Rocky Horror picture show\nIt was just going to say does this have the same sort of does it\nDoes because the people who go like in off years or thirty dress up no there isn't well lucky you are my buddy Peter Jenna basically addresses up as Michael Meyers he actually worked with him you know Joey\nNo he doesn't know what they would get along our number is eight five five seven eight five eight to five five if you have a trivia question not about the movie that you saw this weekend not about any of the sequels I mean I can do a little bit I don't even want to go on there on the sequels\nThe original Nineteen Seventy eight John Carpenter film Halloween if we even had a guy called us who played a Michael Meyers in one of the sequels you know it yeah called uh Jennifer and me one morning eight five five Seventy five\nEight to five five if I get one wrong well you'll get the pride of humiliating me\nHow 'bout that let me just start off with this because you've intrigued me about the movie and I you know I might be interested in going and getting the original but if I wanted to catch up on the whole franchise do you know how many Halloween there have been in total I Know that's not what we're focusing on we're going to get back to the specific\nI Believe I Believe that this movie that came out this weekend is the twelve\nTwelve so I'd have to when I write for I don't I don't know I was just like go ahead and asked me the truth\nSo usually in movies there's a tremendous amount of time that goes into actually writing the script you know these scripts can hang around for years before they're made to get ... get\nModified how long did it take to actually write the script for the original movie\nThreat descriptor shoot the film write the script\nOr I Know that between ... hill and John Carpenter the script was written fairly quickly I don't know exactly how long I Do know they shot for twenty eight days\nThat that would be true the script was written in ten days and\nJohn Carpenter a wrote the scares\nThem that's like the uh you know the ah the scares a you know a Tommy running into Michael Meyers while he's leaving school those are the scares ... hill his girlfriend at the time will the chatter among the teenage girls go into high school the baby sitters the original title for the film was supposed to be the babysitter\nMurderers and maybe should have asked me another uh Halloween one for the show with\nThe ten days script to another as you know obviously got now make the movie and making the movie can be a long\nDrawn out process with you know hey they're they're entertainers I got to have things the way they want them it can be you know a long time to how long did it take to shoot twenty original ... twenty eight days [noise]\nToday from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [noise]\nAnd those of you in the Pittsburgh area should know that we have a bigger event tonight and been looking forward to it I like the city [noise]\nYou got to get a sense of people\nThe least I Do I'm going to travel for so many years so many places and you you could have a certain sense just a certain niceness here is a non ...\nType of personality here that I have I have appreciated ... people are this is the America that I that I Wish I really like\nSuch a wise guy America the hyper sophisticated fools that um habits so many of our urban areas have go to graduate school too long to become stupid\nSo that's my that's my initial take a high everybody not just stupid cows jaded mean but other than that I think a producing terrific people\nYeah been be so what is it now seven thousand have you seen\nPictures of the caravan coming in from largely from Honduras\n\nLike to talk to somebody about how ... how did they get through the Mexican border with Mexico is just don't care or keep remain conflicting reports of it's not clear to me they only let six hundred forty and then there are seven thousand so is it six hundred and forty years at seven thousand [noise]\nAnd it's it looks like seven thousand to me it's a mile long and again the question is how did they just become such a large group get through Mexico about that I think Mexico cares\nA was a substantial part of their population lives in the United states in ... Mexico mission back billions of dollars and\nWe take the unemployed off Mexico's hands I mean we're essentially that we're a ... government to Mexico me and my state and the left thinks that that was a terrific thing even though all of those is in ... the Mexicans to avoid confronting their own issues\nIf every country could send all those who are not employed or all those who are I'm happy to another country why should you deal with any of your problems but hey that's you know\nThat that pales that question pales in significance compared to the possibility of more Democrats\n'cause if you can't make enough Democrats in your own population you need to import Democrats so that you can win more elections so that's what they do the imports Democrats met an amazing thing is I've done anywhere else in the world and the democracy\nWe import millions of people in order to have you will look good\nYes I'm quite aware of it I have a way of a lot of I I ...\nThrough the radio answer ...

mean recently in the last couple of years\nA is a and it was stated by some ... some of the quote unquote leaving thinkers in the world I think even I think so I I if I'm wrong I totally apologized to think pope even said we need to build bridges not walls\nIf it's an astonishing demo demagogic statement matter who makes us\nOr comparing an an American wall to the Berlin Wall\nAt the ease with which people lie is is role of the phenomena that makes me understand the human nature is not basically good everybody who compares the Berlin\nWall to an American wall at the southern border of the United states is either so ignorant of history that they should not say anything about anything or they're not ignorant and they know that there are allowing one goal was to keep your population in the oval almost to keep people out\nEverybody has a wall it's called the door with luck that's your wall\nWe needed door with a lot for our country why is that wrong or bad told me I I feel like it would I Would pay\nHas a stuffed thousands salad literally thousands of Israelis were killed by Palestinian terrorists\nIt's really amazing though I think about the pro Palestinian westerners Israel as the villain\n[laughter]\nAt what point do decent people not to see the left is despicable I don't understand that these one of the it is one of the [noise] the great conundrums of life\nTo be a conservative you have to have a moral compass the functions the wrong on everything there means they're wrong see the video about with regard to Mitch McConnell\nThese people come screaming into a restaurant where you're gonna have to fight back folks if people come screaming into the restaurant including my site if my side when\nScreaming into a restaurant where a leading Democrat we're having a was having lunch or dinner I Would I Would get rid of them as readily I Would consider them as disgusting as our ... as their side but our site doesn't do that because we believe we have\nRules there are some people are shouting Nancy Pelosi which I'm not for by the way that was at a political event that's a different story but I'm not for that either let them have their political events let us have our political events\nBut uh where they are on private time this is this is the new rules but there are no rules that the whole point they the the only rules of the war for the left of the ones the less water pass\n[noise]\n[noise] like you you must allow a male who considers himself to be a female to run in a race and the women's race this narcissistic did this last week\nAnd it's amazing it goes on commented on in the United states men or women female races it is the end of female competition if this continues\nAnd we're supposed to consider it's so amazing to me the sickness that the left his bread into the American bloodstream that we are supposed to have pity for this this person not for the women who are racing\nIt is beyond belief that all the compassion goes to the to the man who's feels he's a woman and I have a passion for men think their women but I Do I also have compassion for all the women who want to run against women's bodies women body verses women body that's the way it should work\nBut they got less liberal\nAllows the mean spirited left this to win every time that's the way it works liberals no there's something morally wrong with allowing a man body to race in a female rich they know it but they have no guts to confront the left\nSo what the liberals are cowards and leftist are mean and that's it that's a bad combination cause cowardice allows meanness too when\n\nI read to you that article last week it it wasn't even covered in the national media I'm ...

promoter of marital rape or has really been a dramatic\nAnd they lie with the ease with which you breed they are taught by their professors to lie they do not ask is there a source for for that can you actually show where he is advocated marital rape\nNo of course now I wrote an article which is a well known to you my theory on this from the male female our wrote a column about ten years ago to ... column\nArguing and suggesting that if a woman loves her husband and he is a good man that she not allow mood alone to determine whether or not she will have relations with have\nSexual relations for those of you who are not aware for relations meant in that context that was it that was\nI made the context that in general but it's a bad idea to allow mood to determine whether we do good things and it's a good thing for your husband even if you're not necessarily in the mood but I'll be ... it's so obvious the whole point was you've got to be a good guy and you have to us to say yes\nIt's the [laughter] ...\nI I just asked you see the ... what bothers them is that\nThey have grown up thanks to the left which is in the moment the deep north system with no concept of obligation to others\nAll it's all water my rights so the I hear that a husband and wife have mutual obligations is foreign to so many students who've been touched by a left wing narcissism\nWhere you're only question life is what is my right\nSo if I even argue you might be even consider that you have obligations these are foreign concept\n... so much prefer the Jewish or Christian education for kids because you learn that life is obligations oriented\nTowards other human beings not rights oriented\n[noise]\n\nThere's an NFL a skirmish year apparently daily wire reports here yesterday and it was a game between the Carolina Panthers in the Philadelphia Eagles\nEagles\nThere agreed and Panthers Malcolm Jenkins got into a heated exchange spurred by the national anthem protests that ultimately require teammates and referees to separate the two [noise]\nProtests founder and now ex NFL or Colin Kaepernick the guy who was the big poster boy for Nike\nNike another major corporation the loads this country and they'll sell that's disgusting we love America if you love America you don't make a poster boy out of the person wouldn't even stand for the national anthem and the flag okay you're full of crap\nDon't live my friends don't lie to yourself still alive yourselves\nSays this is ...\nEvery ... every uh American black white Hispanic Asian who died for this country and for that ...\nWhat it is All right\nSo just just understand that you you fools Nike\n\nRead was on the forty niners when Kaepernick started the protests and still refuses to stand for the anthem\nAs long held a grudge against Jenkins for his role and redirecting some of the protest energy into more direct action via a deal with the players coalition which Jenkins cofounded\nJenkins who endorses the cause behind the protests agreed to stop the on field protests if the league would invest about a hundred million dollars into quote unquote social justice causes\nFor that read has labeled Jenkins a sellout\nAs the two teams went out on the field before the game Sunday reading Jenkins began to draw a moment caught on camera things got tense enough that reached teammates have to restrain him\nKaepernick quickly chimed in to express his support\nFor Eric read them after the game ... made clear to reporters why he has so much animosity for fellow NFL player who actually agrees with the larger cause\nJenkins he said as a sellout and an Neal colonialist because he co opted the movement by working with the league to raise money for social justice rather than continuing to protest on the field by the way this proves that guys are like read\nA low with this country he would rather crap on the flag publicly in front of millions then have a hundred billion dollars go to causes that he cares for so why does it prove that it proves that his mission\nIs to is to have contempt to show contempt for America that is what it is when you do that\nOkay let's be honest\nYou you will go down to the ground rather than stay standing for the flag and the national anthem\nIs a is only to say I have contempt for that flag and the national anthem that is more important for me than a hundred million dollars to causes that I Would agree with\nThat makes perfect sense that's their cause it stopped pro black their cause is anti America\nThat is true for all of the left the left\nAs I pointed out a thousand times the left around the world loathe America right there is no exception to that liberals are different group the left loads America always did she ... ... ... if you're an American leftist you would have to argue I agree with the world's left on every single issue except America\nEvery issue an American left to set a French Left this at a Belgian left this to you were going left disagree on\nExcept America oh all of a sudden the left this is no longer a leftist oh I Love America but I agree with everything else on the left her gender please please don't still don't lie to yourself\nPart of being on the left in the world today is to hate the United states of America secondly they do hate\nAnyone who wants to fundamentally transform something doesn't love it okay again just be a little honest with yourselves it's bad enough to lie to the rest of us but to lie to yourself is beyond belief literally and figuratively\n\nFive days away from fundamentally transforming America used that boy did he tell the truth than Brock Obama\nWe are transforming plants [noise]\nMore contempt for the people who cheered him and for Obama\nPeople are going to go back to their beautiful homes back to their phenomenal healthcare back to their incredible amounts of freedom and cheer a man who wants to fundamentally transform their country\nThis is the sickest truly the sickest\nExpression of self content that I Believe ... has been recorded history the people who have it's so good in the United states who sheer it's fundamental transformation\nBoggles the mind [noise]\nA lot more to talk to you about your where I'm assuming to them as Prager show coming to you from Pittsburgh where everybody goes to\nHistory has made when a leader steps up\nYeah Florida I mean think of it Florida in the south\n[noise] well\nWell it's a it's quite a quite something my friends knew in Florida listening you got to vote you got to get everybody to vote\nThis if you can't get to the left of deal I mean that doesn't that doesn't exist in mainstream politics\nPeople are hungry for something different I Love that why are you a hug why are people hungry for something

actually have written my Tuesday column comes out tomorrow or on on the subject\nWas among the things that most got to me was the lack of knowledge about cars that they're selling ... among these all all of them young mostly males\nA sales sales people at the at the car dealerships it was it was remarkable I asked some truly basic I mean really basic questions and the answer in each case was\nAnd now that you can call in I can pursue it I had this experience with my wife was shopping for an SUV first time I've always just driven a car\nAnd anyway\nShopping for an SUV and I am very rarely shop for cars because for much of my the last decades I been driving cars of advertisers which\nEventually they they sold their businesses and anyway it whatever it is it now as we're having a new experience to having had in a while ago in the car dealers and I don't want to give car dealers the business I Want to do with the Internet I Want to know what to do with the you know with car dealers [noise]\nLet me give them the business but it was it was really fascinating everybody was nice I mean all the sales people were nice it's not an issue there almost all young men with whom I took the test drugs I think in every instance of five I think for four or five five young men but\nThe thing that got my wife and me was any question I mean any question that I asked was clear they didn't have an answer and they said with no embarrassment I'll look it up so let me let me this look that up\nSo I as I said at the end I think that if this is all representative and it may not be like fully acknowledge that but if it is it all representative\nThere were two things that immediately strike me and one is that the idea that you should know as much as possible even about a product you're selling has has not registered\nBecause hey I could look it up\nWhy why do I have to know if that SUV can come in all wheel drive why would I have to know the length of the of that SUV versus the other one it's like all I could always look it up and the other is in general knowledge may not be valued\nWhy do you need to know anything if you could just pull out a little smartphones from your pocket and find out all you need to know this\nIs now if you feel that my general generalization is not valid or you do a very curious\nTo hear from you because it made a real impact on us I Am trusting is that the lines are working one ape Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\n[noise] that was a ... that was one aspect of the experience that hit me there was another one too which is even deeper than that is that the\nThere was there seemed to be an absence\nOf passion I again I remember from years ago when I when I last really went looking for cars with dealers the the the sales folks were passionate about cars that's why they were in that profession\nI didn't have that sense from any of these ah salespeople but again all the young I didn't have any sense of that that they were passionate about cars\nThat was it was they might as well have been working in a shoe store this is not a negative these were very nice people ... ... is not a character challenge it's just a statement\nOf a change that you know if you haven't seen anybody you know in a war you ever seen a young person a long time wow boy did you grow up you really grown because you haven't seen them see you see if you haven't seen something in a long time you can see a change\nSo this was a change that we saw a gentleman who you are just so many folks ask a technical
