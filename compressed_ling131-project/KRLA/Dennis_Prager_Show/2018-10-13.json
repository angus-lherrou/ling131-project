difficulty in getting this carrot and the need and that's because it's got to go through the liver and you guys are reading too much for those refined oils\nAnd that's the thing we want to really get

so you don't have to deal with them so just give a ... eight hundred three Seventy two thirty four\nForty seven eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven [laughter] All right let's go right back to the phones let's go to\nRobert in Brentwood, Tennessee and he's wondering how magnesium might relate to about regularity and his trouble sleeping\nOkay or are you there Robert\nAnd how old a man or you know how much do you weigh\nSixty six one eighty seven okay\nAnd when you when you have difficulty going off to sleep or staying asleep or what what's the trouble was sleeping\nSo I'm\nA lot of weight loss very rapidly and that's what I see and then I'm Sorry I lost weight and the doctor tells me that a certain amount of calories and so I Try to eat meat so proteins and things of that but I have the vegetables because shift in those\nAbsolutely need the boat but I Can't eat enough vegetables\nI Can't I Can't eat that much okay so you're not sleeping all at night so\nWas that the let's get back to sleeping do you have difficulty going off the sleepers\nOK offhand stay okay good I got it All right well see the off to sleep is usually linked to the gall bladder\nSo we'd want to support gall bladder and your body size maybe three teaspoons of gall bladder PG usually the first night you observe you can go off to sleep easier okay and this you would use for months\nAnd uh after you have used it three weeks he would begin to coffee and them as per week nothing will give you more beautiful here and skin\nThat will just do wonders for you and that lasts for Thirteen weeks that's going to take care of going off to sleep now staying asleep is typically if you're waking up like for no reason not where are you waking up to urinate or you waking up for no reason\nLast year and I\n... well then we should support that so let's go with the pollen ... floor\nAnd see if we can't get you and your body size about oh\nThree per meal and I do that for three weeks and at the end of the time you'd probably find you're not getting up at all\nAnd then you can cut to two at breakfast only okay then the other thing we've got to do to make sure that it's not rotting food that's waking you up\nHis to get you on digestive support ... show maybe to quantum died just at the start of your main meal\nAnd then the end of the meal about four\nTo five detain hydro chloride\nNow you're digesting more like you did as a twenty year old\nSo now I think this should be a tremendous help the lack of sleep\nWill cause you to excrete magnesium which can tend to make the intestines and the ... much harder show you could jump on some of our magnesium four hundred and take a couple of teaspoons a morning and night for\nProbably\nFive days and now you should start having very easy to pass by movements and then I Would cut two um\nTwo teaspoons am only okay and I think that should doing as job for you a lot of people tell me at your age so that they prefer a teaspoon morning and night\nRather than taking it all at once in the day because you're still screening till we rebuild those adrenal 's okay [noise] I Hope that's a big help for you and your and take care of by now\nTo promote the best adrenal function\nAnd so there you know there's a laundry list of things the adrenal is neat\nBut in particular the number one they want a about half your weight you know says of water so if you're a hundred and fifty eight let's call it a hundred sixty you'd need about eighty ounces of water per day how you doing on getting that Robert\nExcellent\nGood okay then the next issue is a little bit of salt\nAnd here we would like air dried sea salt or even better yet or pink salt which is yeah\nI think for the last two years\nOkay that that wouldn't be my favorite SALT I would ever do you go to an air dried sea salt\nAnd what you want to do is break a sweat from time to time so you can taste the perspiration at the upper outer part of your arm it should be slightly salty if so salt is perfect\nOkay next issue is ... and of course since childhood I don't think there's any problem with iron because you are normally this problem develops over the years as a result of eating white flour in white sugar\nAnd so if you've had this problem since you're a little kid then I'm not thinking that we've got to worry about iron so let's move on and then we go to be vitamins now\nYou could be in trouble here if you were a bit of the sugar hall lake as a child did you eat a lot of sweets as a kitten\nLatch okay do you know if you were breast fed to term that I was so at least twelve months yes or\nNo good okay so you should be able to make ... or it it's good show a then the next guy is five hours is straight sleep and how do you do with that you're sleeping good\nShops\nAre very good well then it you know all these things sound really good to me when you wake up in the morning in bed or the feet and hands still cold\nYes they are okay All right then let's go to circulation so circulation the number one thing you would try at first just to see if it's an issue\nIs you can go on something called Cirque du gold this promotes micro circulation throughout the body\nAnd that your body weight I Would just go to for for a meal and just see if in two or three days you have a difference for your hands and feet if you do then I'm going to recommend that you go on the battlefield diet\nAnd use strictly follow it so there's no oil nothing that says occasional or rarely you don't eat any of those things for at least thirty days\nAnd see if it now promotes a better circulation to their hands and feet if it does then it's the food that's doing this to you and it sounds like that's the case 'cause it sounds like you've got all the\nAll the things the adrenal is need you could try ... be and see if it does any good for you maybe one or two teaspoons per day and just see\nIf that benefits you at all\nAnd when you wake up from sleep you feel rested\nAnd go\nOkay well if that's true and all the adrenal things except maybe the B vitamins\nShould be good in ... that would rule out the adrenal was in my mind so [noise] um get a copy of the biofuel diet what I Would do is just be very strict for thirty days and see if it changes the game if it does\nThen wild since childhood then I Would agree that the something or some issue with circulation and I'd get to work on it as quick as you can\nOkay\nYou're welcome bye now All right this is Dr Bob Marshall pitch gee this is helpline live and\nDon't miss that is really great specials it's your chance to if you're struggling with any issues with your hair skin or nails and you want what's really the issue and that is the uh boosting of the soluble lives carrot than\nWe've got the

thickness\nThat it was before and of course the people with the best skin on earth would be Asians and of course African Americans\nThan the rest of it as a the skin is just not that thick and dance and as we get older a little help like this might be just what you need and unfortunately most of the other products out there or college and\nFrom chicken necks or something like this and we already have so much protein affect you guys need to cut down protein that it's unlikely that that's going to be a big help but the carrot and\nThis is really leans to the issue of our gall bladder and the health of the governor and what we see is after each forty just about everybody needs support for the gall bladder\nSo you want to jump on today is really great special our hair skin and nails\nYou just need one cap so if you're you know under two hundred bound to be over two hundred pounds I Would use to capsules if the issues are really big deal start out with two gap shows even if you're a

retire eight eight eight Ninety nine retire that eight eight eight Ninety nine R. E. T. I. R. E.\nUm if you want to email me you can go to the website WWW dot L. A. stem cells dot com and there is a place on every page for the website to email me but I'd rather get your phone calls in right now it's more fun to talk to and then just write an email\nAnd the number here so you can go live with us is eight six six eight seven zero five seven five to a repeated\nEight six six eight seven zero five seven five to that is right now and you can talk to me for those of you that want to call the office to see if we take your insurance\nAnd we have a lot of insurance we do take the phone number is eight hundred three hundred and Ninety three hundred I'll repeat it for you guys grab a pencil have hundred three hundred and Ninety three hundred\nAnd you can find out if we take a year insurance we do take Medicare cigna ethnic Blue Cross Blue Shield United Health care and for people without insurance\nWe take something called care credits like a credit card that we can help you get\nFor a medical issues and I think you don't pay as you don't pay any interest on it for a year [noise]\nUm no the techniques that I use are called regenerative medicine that means that I injected body with your own cells that I take from your body\nAnd that stimulates the tissue to grow back so instead of doing surgery [noise] like this person that question me about uh they're having problems going up and down the stairs without pain and they're planning on a hip replacement I Would tell them to never get a hip replacement\nUnless that hip is fused and um that's where that happens but I Do occasionally get a patient that comes in and I tell him I cannot help them this is not a magical cure\nSo we do take your bone marrow for severe cases and the bone marrow has many wonderful growth factors in it also has platelets in it and it also has stem cells and stem cells are sort of the talk of the town today we read about it every day in the newspaper\nAnd we read about I'm pro athletes that are getting it done to save their careers but\nIt's something that's so easy to do once I knew him up to the area and we take the bone marrow from the area on the pelvis and above the bucks once I met up with some light it can it generally takes me on an average patient about Fifteen seconds\nTo pull it out put a needle into the bone and has spread out the bone marrow\nAnd then um we inject so it's pretty simple and um I've been doing this work in regenerative medicine for about a Twenty years and I use it on my body every time I injure myself\nAnd you'd think I'd get smarter but I don't that I still overused my body when I Know I'm going to have an injury but then I just inject myself that I'm pretty good shape\nSo um I Can't answer this question about um\nWhether this will work for this person until I examine them if they've got some ranged emotional leg and if they're going upstairs we probably have pretty decent range of motion we can probably help\nThere was never a promise in this work there's um you know you have to make somewhat of a leap of faith because we are trained since we're a little kids to think surgery is the answer for healing\nAnd now the studies show that it is not the best thing for you and it is a good thing to regenerate the tissue by using your own cells in your own body\nSo what do you think NATO\nWell I think it's important for people to understand that distinction between regenerative treatment that is less invasive as opposed to just rolling into surgery because it's been sort of the party line for many decades\nAnd uh this is a climate in which we should all the more active and our health care and research and go to different types of practitioners and find out what's going on\nYou know and um the way I woke up was in my fourth year medical school I injured my shoulder to bench presses and I was doing orthopedic surgery at the time and I\nCould worst literally course my boss to operate on me right away because that's where we do 'em all day long and I was like this so cool you know we're fixing people [noise]\nAnd um I woke up from the surgery and my arm was swollen like a balloon full of fluids and I had a high temperature and ah it took a couple of years\nThey're quieted down to its pre pre surgery state of being miserable and never never got better it got worse\nThan that I learned about regenerative medicine and I mean it's kind of a weird story I got a syringe full of um [noise] well we used in the old days which was the proof therapy solution [noise] and I hopped into bed with my wife who's watching TV and I injected my shoulder and she was\nNot happy about that are using some expletives about what the heck was I doing to myself [laughter] and I\nLiterally woke up the next morning completely pain free I never needed that surgery and um it healed my shoulder to shoulder was good for twelve years after that and when I re injured and the next time it took me a couple of injections and eye healed it again\nAnd then some years later I did re injured and had to inject it several times to give it back in shape but my shoulders perfect\nAnd um [noise] you know all my buddies and also wanted to have me do another surgery and I said I Am done with surgeries I'm going to live my life\nAnd guide my patients to stay away from surgery and uh it's been a great career I've had I still have it\nAnd I wake up every day so excited to be in my office with my patients and save them from surgery\nSo please consider if you're considering surgery please consider doing something so easy and simple which is to just get an injection with your own blood cells platelets for if you have something that's a little bit more intense [noise]\nSome kind of arthritis you may want to go to just using your bone marrow a very simple procedure\n[noise] do you know that\nThis is our tenth anniversary of working together here on living pain free if you're just joining the shadow that says letting paint famous actor mark arrow and we are taking your calls at one eight six six eight seven zero five Seventy five to we are here at ten am on Saturdays and one PM on Saturdays\nAnd we'd love to hear from you and we know that\nMillions of people across the country are in ... people have arthritis ... hip pain neck pain you were just sharing a bag question with helped hip replacement so to give us a call that number again is one eight six six eight seven zero five seven five to\nOne about a neat oh and me and you know\nWe do get literally more knees than anything else uh because people have two of them [laughter]\n[laughter] that's funny uh\nAnyway this person's says I have chronic problems in my right knee which recently worse and MRI was performed and replacement suggested does this is a big fallacy that I Love talking about on the show\nYou don't operate because an MRI tells you something\nThe studies are replete with evidence that says you cannot believe an MRI meaning memorized show you anatomy but they can be wrong number one and number two they don't tell you where the pain is being generated from [noise]\nSo yeah I don't know what the samurai so that it might have said the person has arthritis and might as well here let me read the rest of it quite a few other arthritic problems with this is the primary issue we're just now please advise thank you [noise] um\nYeah so the ... not going to tell you where you're paying as coming from I Am so sorry to inform you folks if you had an MRI and the doctor said you needed surgery and you have the surgery and it didn't work\nFits because the MRI should not be the guide\nIt's okay to use an MRI and getting them around I like to see them because sometimes there are hidden issues like a cancer\nAnd we want to find out about that [noise] but em arise are overly sensitive many times we get people who have an ACL rupture that's the anterior ... ligament and to me the MRI showed it\nThe surge and goes in and he goes whoa the seal is intact\nSued the hammer eyes are overly sensitive they're not gonna tell you what is truthful and they're not going to tell you where pain is coming from so be careful don't get a surgery because of an MRI [noise]\nUm but any rate uh this person with a chronic knee pain\nIf that news moving there is a great chance that we can help he lit up using platelets from your blood or using your bone marrow which has played let's stem cells ex assumes growth factors all kinds\nAnd for people without insurance we take care credit which was like a credit card we can help us but even so insurance is weird that they don't they don't cover everybody that they do you think they're covering\nThere's a lot of variations in the\nBest thing to do is call her office at eight hundred three hundred Ninety three hundred and get insurance verification will

been going on for about Seventeen years\nThat's amazing well let's see I don't I don't know I don't know how I ah [laughter] I've done is pretty amazing I Know times I go to or she would go to Robert who has the hip pain in Santa Clarita yes\nHey Robert ... how are you today\nI'm good how are you doing\nI'm living it up man I'm always love\nYou sound like you're down into well are you driving around and Bluetooth\nOld over got on my own directly affects them I just wrote a quick question on experience\nAnd I wanted to find out between now and they're not all go together and\nUm how long has the the hip pain bothered you for\nOh probably four or five were worth it\nYeah I Gotcha how are you able to walk around she's your leg move yeah\nThey're going to sit down for any amount of time comes back\nOkay so there's still good card legs left in your joints so that's good news as long as you're moving the joint and this is something that you should hear about it because you do go to a doctor [noise] we get new patients every day who say they have bone on bone\nMeaning that there's no cartilage left and I move them around and examine them\nAnd they've got plenty of cartilage left\nIt just the doctor is I'm thinking that I have a replacement needs to be done because that's what they do for a living and it's like I always laugh and tell patients what do you get if you go to a to a a barber haircut [laughter] so you know if you if you go to a surgeon you're not going to get ...\nFrom your body re injected to grow to issue you're going to have to shoot cut out that's just with the with the rise of surgery was\nAnd it was hard weight is is that is there something that goes with each other about who\nYou're talking about waiting or are you talking about extra fat on\nYour way yeah\nYeah that's got to go man for a lot of resumes out so you know it's not healthy and the problem with weight is not only that it affects the joints negatively and causes pain that causes arthritis in in the joints a ...\nHelmet laws and then er junction\nI'll tell you I'll tell you what I what happens in my office that almost every person I suggest to lose weight says okay I'll lose the weight and then I'll come back so\nThat's never happened in Twenty years because the impetus to lose the weight to lose the weight is to start the treatment now and everybody loses weight them\nAnd loses fast we have a diet called ideal protein the average weight loss there's about Fifteen pounds a month people said well that's too much weight to lose in a month ago why what's what's the big deal about losing Fifteen pounds in a month I did that died as an experiment for one week\nI'm pretty skinny to start with that I lost seven pounds in one week ... people go well that's not healthy but what's not healthy about getting rid of fat\nThat keeps your insulin Hi what's actually being so high that causes the fat positions and the high insulin causes all kinds of diseases including cancer and heart disease and other things\nSo we want to keep our insulin low we want to cut the carbs out of our life and ah it's easy to do it on the protein vegetables\nAnd water that's basically it and believe it or not you can eat fat and lose weight because eating fat keeps your insulin low and insulin is the storage hormone if you're raising your insulin you're going to store fat\nIf you're eating fat your insulin is low and you're going to get your own fast and loose and lose his yeah so no you don't have to lose weight for me to treat you but it helps heal quicker\nAnd I wanted I rather than the weight right now it's just that I'm just trying to see if you're in that process I could also do some self I'll give you a call apps\nAnd not only could you but this is the time I Would suggest that you start doing it because you'll lose the weight a lot faster when you're getting treatment you have a real impetus to get the job done\nAnd then one other quick question if someone is already out of surgery and the search yeah you know if you have to have another one step you know a person without going through surgery or is that something\nAbsolutely we have a pill and make up a number I don't know probably half of our patients have had a field surgery thin we heal them up using platelets from their blood or bone marrow and\nLearn learn rather than the rest of the law and I'll give you\nThings are Robert I'm looking forward to that you're a great guy appreciate your call God Bless you\nThank you very much here as well go by by\nOkay our number is one eight six

one that's always a good sign I got a lot of hard to answer your question so what's up\nYet I have a cat that we ... it was a I don't you without approachable but we caught her and got her she has now become silicon left again and she she loves she loves she loves being in the house you love the outdoors\nAnd I've come to a situation where I I may be bringing in a letter I get the ballot that approachable I'm and I'm Wondering how to do that would get a law\nYou say you're bringing in another cat that maybe feral is the cat that you may be bringing in is that cat approachable at this point no okay so in other words before you bring a cat in how are you going to get the cat to come at this point\n[noise] yeah I have to get it I had to catch it I'll take it to like that they're going to check it all out and\nI'm sure they're going to space span outta would ever had to be the\nNext but she seemed like\nIt is the is the ear clipped yet\nOkay so she's always been fixed and probably with vaccination so here's what I Would recommend you do when you when you trap the cat in the have a heart track\nAnd you bring the cat to your veterinarian lifted that check her over the next year is there's no disease that's go communicable okay when I Want you to do is pick up a stuffed animal before you do this take that stuffed animal to the vet with you Rebecca stuffed animal all over the cat\nThat you have at the vet bring that home let that cat or your cat live with the second that new cat coming into the home\nFor a fair amount of time until the other cat comes in and also when the other cat comes into your home give the the center of the cat is already living near to the other cat give them some time to adjust to each other out you know obviously can hold one but you can kind of put a barrier and let them see each other and smell each other\nFeed each cat out of two dishes now the outside cat may never used have never use the litter box that may be something you're gonna have to tackle as well\nWell that's what I currently have she like I said I Love the outdoors also so that's where she goes hearty\nListen listen we're going to teach your cats go potty I Love the term my cat doesn't go potty attacking go potty and as I could listen to be careful like a lot of outdoor cats\nLike to go because your assimilated to go on dirt and soil so when you put a litter box down to them it's like what is this thing it's got to start from now what do I do with it what I'd like you to do\nIs take two litter boxes take them outside filled the litter boxes with some ... where the cats generally hang out bring those litter boxes into the house with the dirt in grass in it\nThat every day at a little bit of literate remove a little bit of the dirt and grass till the transition is made and now you're going to be on the list I Want to send you some some great way to get you started to\nUh catch incredible it's an amazing litter that they don't come to you but anyway you start out with the dirt in the grass and then you slowly introduce the cat incredible cat litter and you make that transition you know I've literally rescued should I don't know how many hundreds of feral cats in my lifetime\nAnd almost every single one they're not always Maurice but every single one can be made adaptable and even if they don't become some buddies with the other cats do at least accept each other so that was my recommendation to you at this point\nOut one guy do bring it home do I keep it in the cage for in a\nWhile I Want to keep it in the cage I Would try to put up a gate or something or screen door or something so they can save the cages just going to make the other cat the new cat feel inhibited which may create more aggression on that part\nSo ... it would be free to wants to get away\nNo no no I Would put up something high enough where it can't jump over screened or something so we can so they can see each other during the day I think that's going to be real important\nOkay say listen don't come with you I'm going to put you on hold I'm going to send you a somewhat Lucy pests cats incredible cat litter to get you started off what I'd like you to
