A. L. D. already licensed zero one nine seven six zero one zero\nBam a chimney\nOn hand matches doing our students\nAnd you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what they become\nPresident Trump's political rally cry after the confirmation of a second Supreme Court justice now just one month before the midterms and we're back with a paddle\nWe ask you for questions for the panel and we got this on Twitter from grade who tweets will the controversy provoke Republican voters\nTo turn out in greater numbers than anticipated Chris how do you answer Greg how's the Kavanaugh fight energized Republicans that is this something that you think can has staying power will last for four weeks\nSo we should we should put on you you share the numbers with a chairwoman McDaniel which is a Republican intensity has come to meet Democrats but not because Democrats went down everybody's up all the numbers are up the intensity is huge but I Would put it this way the the gift of this Republicans there's a division and the Republican Party\nBetween conservatives who are maybe not Trump voters from skeptic at least\nIn Trump's pocket populist base who don't voted for him in spite of him being a Republican not because he was one of the coalition was sprayed they agree on this one because the conservatives care of the most about the Supreme Court than any other issue set that they had we saw it in twenty six pain\nBut on the other side quite to get like this was became a social issue because of the ground over which was fought because it was me to stuff and his reactionary culturally warriors supporters come into the space seriously\nI mean in Trump world thirty days or the turn of the day I mean we have four hundred new cycles does this last\nWell look some of it last no matter what but the question is we've got all of the unknown unknowns that are going to come between here and there and it relates to Russia in a majority and other things that could come to mirror on this so I Will I Will refrain from speculation\nOne given the fact that Democrats were clearly as we saw in that poll already mobilized a lot of them in their opposition to President Trump does this if it does energize the Republican voters and conservative voters is this a net plus for the Republicans all thought well\nIn the short run again your point is well taken we don't know if this dissipates between now and election day but I Would say that in specific given the white male dominance in the GOP based there has been this outpouring all the language that we've seen a pen to it about making judgment a proven guilty before\nA anybody has introduced convincing evidence and that kind of thing even though this was not a legal proceedings and we were talking about putting a man on the high court\nBut I think looking at the numbers that you put up you can see that it alienated a lot of also white women Republicans independents and that's why you see the gap that was displayed in those numbers so if you're looking at the races\nYou talk about race in suburban districts outside of major metropolitan areas many of them that went for Hillary Clinton but have a Republican House member\nI think you put those in greater danger separate situation with regard to the state races because so many races but at the moment and there's twenty Eighteen cycle are red state\nWhere the Democrats are trying to defend and I think you're going to have more problems there although it's telling that Joe Donnelly of Indiana Heidi Heitkamp a and others decided they were going to vote against Kevin\nLet me turn to you Josh\n... what about this analysis and and the one just referred to it that this was going to may play differently in statewide Senate races than a dozen much more localized\nHouse races and that it will benefit particularly given the mouth of the fact that the Republicans have so few states up and Democrats have so many in so many of them are in Republican red states that Donald Trump ram that it could help a lot in the Senate races but could hurt for instance in those key swing suburban districts that now have a Republican congressman\nSo I mean I think there's a danger of over analyzing based on data that we don't know what we do know is that Republicans have been absolutely set on fire by this we also know the Democrats had basically the best political environment and the generation before they decided to hand the microphones Spartacus for they're closing argument here\nNow we found this out ourselves past Kavanaugh is in these red states like Indiana North Dakota Missouri West Virginia in particular are a huge danger now Joe Manchin may have done himself a favor by voting for Kavanaugh\nFor the rest of these er and significant danger what we don't know is whether those Republican voters who supported Republicans in ... twelve fourteen and sixteen will be there in suburban America which Republicans have had a problem with but we also don't know\nThat women are a monolithic voting bloc here I think that some of the data is shown to suburban women see this very very differently than Democrats would like them to\nDo agree with that very well I think it's a little too early to tell but what I Do know is the suburban women for the last year and a half\nHas been really moving away from the Republican Party because President Trump and his actions and his comments and the next thirty days there are a lot of things we don't know but I can guarantee that President Trump will likely say things that offend\nMany people are particularly on the left that reminds many independent and Republican women why they're uncomfortable with hand and a lot of this ... and the Republican Party may dissipate because President Trump can't get out of his own way\nI Do think that the Republican Party should recognize this is bigger than having a Democrat depend on fire for two years this is this and Democrats line is the latest in a pattern of not taking women seriously and that's the argument they're going to make its not to me that the Supreme Court ought to be about the overall message I think\nI think the X factor that we have an attendant here is increase in democratic voter registration that's right and it's very high and continue to remember\nRepublicans are unable to run on repeal of Obamacare unable to run on building a border wall or reducing the deficit I think you look at a lot of these districts going back to Pennsylvania Eighteen Conor Lamb or the Alabama Senate race and you see\nThat the dynamic is this is a referendum on Trump and Republicans had little before cabin off\nTo fire up the base we've seen them fired up now says it lasts but\nOne of the things crust that do you get a sense Republicans are going to say is\nThat the Democrats have so overplay their hand and cabinet and they'll continue to overplay it they can talk and you heard the president say that they want to talk about impeaching him that when I talked about impeaching Brett Kavanaugh Jerry novel or the potential\nHouse Judiciary chairman is talking about launching an investigation they can run against you put these guys in charge of that's really what the president was saying that it's a mob and you don't give a match to the ...\nAnd that's why I've been saying for months and months and months but probably the best thing for Donald Trump twenty twenty reelection is for Republicans to lose ... small majority to Democrats because this is where Trump is at his performance in best when he is fighting viciously brutally with the other side but\nWinning argument for him to prevent Democrats from taking over and others will at work and this is this election\nIt will help him in the Senate the reality here is just on its face some judges right it's too soon to say but on a trace it looks like this it's helpful for Republicans in the Senate because of the map and is one pointed out at a historically Amos map for Democrats but in the house is probably helpful for Democrats because of where the districts this has been contested\nWhat about the argument Murray that you hear some ... Republicans make the Democrats overplayed their hand in this case and that it has created a backlash and that that's going to hurt the Democrats\nI think Democrats need to be careful about that what I argued when Kavanaugh was nominated we should get this over with quickly because we didn't have the votes to prevent him from getting on the court and it's not a winning argument when it comes to the ballot box Democrats just don't vote on judicial she's the same way Republicans do\nI think that a lot of Democrats are I think for twenty twenty and they need to stay focused on twenty teens and getting the majority back and I do think that we Democrats my party needs to be careful not to overplay not to play the cameras to focus on winning elections in the house actually there's been more of that\nThat it had been more I don't know\nCrazy when people start as painting for the camera and not at all and I find when I when I wrote I Know that at green agents at I [laughter] I wasn't\nOne quick question that we're we're about to run out of time does the presidential race for twenty twenty start the day after this election it's already started court already started our rights battles and Sunday and we'll be right back with a final but [noise]\nAre you hearing are already retirement are you concerned about the low rate of return for your heart or an investment dollars hello I'm David crammed with\nChoice to say do other choices we're on the U.S and\nThe main thing is they need to know that this is what this is about to say go one way with their votes\nAre saying yes to\nFunding of illegals with health care\nBussing variety of the century steak\nFor whatever I I think the illegal immigration issue is one of a primary issues that will decide votes here because it's it is basically attacking our quality of life and actually attacking our safety as people\nBut there are some other major issues that are at hand the sober living home phenomenon for example a it's a I don't know how my bona feels on that but a lot of people and his party feel oh no you can't do anything to\nA rain that program in because it's the same to helping people well yeah we want to help you ... you know people who are drug addicts and people are alcoholics we want to help them what were they shouldn't be putting these homes in the middle of residential neighborhoods and\nThey want to they could have a solution in areas like the commercial areas are or areas industrial areas of a study a lot now and then somebody's neighborhood and I have a piece of legislation that says\nThe states and the local government should have the right to regulate sober living rooms because what's happened because of the Democratic party and so one of the left\nThis in Washington so we have the ...\nLocal government has been neutered they can't even his own them out some legislation that I've been proposing to actually give the power back to the local community to zone out and the license and give license and only those with licenses are would be able to set up some\nLiving homes and only the only their neighborhoods that are shown to force overwhelming homes\nWe heard today at an event in Newport Beach where they were saying are under six people and there's regulations at all these things that's right\nWhat's happened is again with the best of motives were deliberately left in this country has the best uh motives I think they want to help people and they feel other people who believe in the rule of law and\nWant local government to be responsible for things rather than having the federal government or once they well\nThey don't see that that way and so we end up in ... and all sorts of powers to the federal government should be done in the local level\nTalk about what's at stake in this midterm election then why it's so important to get out the\nPaint the picture of what's going on dams wants to take back control of the house there's a certain number of candidates they feel\nThat they can pick them off so to speak with their people and\nThen they can do after Trump that's kind of what's up\nRight well what's happening right now really is a something that's been going on since\nThe Hillary last the last election\nObviously from the investigation into this Russian collusion what we're finding is there were a group of high level Democrats in our law enforcement intelligence agencies they were the ones who were committed not to permit Trump to become president\nAnd once he did a they are committed to not allowing them to assume the foreign aid and said they will now obstruct his ability to become an exercise the president said\nThis is what we are up against a may have indeed we lose this election if it would go over the Republicans lose control like for example if I lost my seat and and my opponent was in a Nancy Pelosi than would be responsible perhaps getting control of the house\nAnd they would waste being tired next two years\nTrying to destroy Trump rather than trying to get some things done for our country so this was not just the joys of philosophy but let's let's recognize that Trump won the selection of two thousand sixteen I must make sure that we operate and\nAnd do the Democratic process that what he has to get things approved by Congress or we shouldn't have an obstructionist Congress just as regular do nothing but get him and that's what would happen\nIf I lose Democrats get control the house\nAnd and so that's why it's so important in this election as they say it could be the most important also things like\nExtending the tax cuts and some of the things that are being done to try to help the economy down to like to take that back while\nThere's a lot of things that the president has done\nIf indeed the Congress decides from just a target the president rather than targeted being positive things\nTarget the president to attack him and get him to fail so whether it's a tax policies are regulatory policies on some great things for example you know I think what he's doing a where they're trying to trade policy is a good thing for challenging the Chinese\nTo treat us fairly\nAnd they say well you're going to create a trade war with China the Chinese have already been at a trade war with us when we just haven't been doing fighting to protect our own people\nAnd so uh there's a lot of great things as president was done with an executive order that and that's one of the reasons why our economy is doing so well right now he really is taking\nAccess bureaucracy and and government controls off the backs of those people who want to create jobs and who want to get things that make us more competitive so uh uh we need to make sure that uh that isn't one done\nBy giving either house to the Democratic party which is only targeting the idea of making sure Trump fails\nCongressman dinner robot cruise with is running for re election in the mid term election and there's a lot out there in the so called mainstream media that has jumped on the Democratic side you watch CNN MSNBC is ABC CBS [noise]\nAnything that needs to be cleared up that you see out there I mean they have no problems are just picking on Republicans as you know being tied to Russia or being tied to this for such a good\nExample because here we've had a special prosecutor in place specifically because you've had fake news creating destroyed some collusion with the help and the Russians that's what's holding election\nThey met him or he wasn't a good candidate and the American people don't want to go as far left as the Democratic party is trying to take us you know Trump won but now they had to blame it on collusion with a lady had\nOver a year and a half now with the special prosecutor enormous powers and they have not been able to prove that yet they wasted our time and my opponent for example still wastes his time in our time attacking me for that same thing all supposedly I'm too close with the Russians that I met with\nThere's a citizen of the scriptures that I've met with this Russian and that Russian or what they leave off\nThis is the fact that I Am the chairman of the committee in the United States House of representatives I'm the chairman of that committee that has jurisdiction to oversee our relations with Russia\nI mean God you're doing your job they use that against your right to leave leave that out of the equation then it may sound sinister that I've met with a number of Russia Russia\nBut I I actually met with more anti Russian Ukrainians for example but my job is to meet with a with people of every point of view from the countries that I oversee and Russia is the area where I'm the chairman of the committee the house the jurisdiction to oversee our relations so\nAnyone who sees those sleep will go out in the mail and they say we try to tie you know this is why you want to tell them oh wait a second I'm doing my job\nYeah and they they they need to understand that you're up against a political party now that is trying to base campaigns on allies\nDestroying people to try that and we've seen that done that as far as for judge Kavanaugh and what are they feeling just this insane\nAttacks on on on him and now we know that no mail that as a conservative or Republican kind of expect that they're they're not going to try to use this tactic\nWell somebody who says they were with you when you were drunk than a teenager [noise] uh I mean this is just incredible\nThe warnings on that is that good people\nWill say what's running it's not worth going after public office if that's what they're going to destroy yeah\nYes and this in this case we had a wonderful guy with a great track track record of public service\nNow he's being dragged through the ... with no there's no collaboration of anything that's been charge against him\nAnd said the fake news as again just spread it all out as if it's true\nAnd they love it they they did boost their ratings they you know we had a story to cover that that's the dirty little secret for the media right well\nWe're just a double standard\nWith the media and with these people who've been attacking judge Kavanaugh\nWas just overwhelming I mean these are saying people who you had women begging for help or about milk come\nAnd many of them not just she wanted it and we had Kennedy again was infamous in Washington for\nThe type of things he was doing in restaurants et cetera and but then he went out and then I went out and then actually drowned some girl\nAnd left us Spain and yet he said people are touching count on getting drunk and maybe doing something which we don't know they attack him really as if he's a rapist and yet they have Teddy Kennedy and and you know did they give them awards all hang out with\nSo some of those people will be reminded them to ice under the the new policy in other words can you get more of those who've chosen to live stealing out of the community or are you having to stay above the nine hundred dollar level I'm I'm slightly confused\nYeah if I was looking for him\nIn other words if ISIS looking for that individual and they are taking things they could be removed but if I was not looking for him and it's up to nine hundred and fifty dollars we're not going to push them out\nThat the potential\nYes [noise] seems like you're going out of your way to be more than ... here you're not trying to do very well never\nTry it and then you know I'm Larry when we had our our calculating back I'm In the spring we had a hundred and fourteen or a hundred and Seventeen public speakers\nAnd only six of the public speakers actually addressed the specifics of the agenda and the other the other hundred eleven\nOr you know we were ... Huntington Beach was anti immigration or the other sites that were pro immigration and it wasn't about immigration has about constitutional protections for every citizen\nEvery resident that lives within ... to keep everybody safe for tourists language and we were tourists to come here to feel\nSafe and secure and come back and over and over again and tell their friends and we want people to move here live here and businesses to establish here and we can only do that with public safety ... let that's our primary primary job is ensure public safety\nUnder serious crime you talk about it it's not perpetrated only against citizens I mean anyone can be the victim of of crime and so\nYeah it I mean property crime is bill if that is what I mean if you get your you know bicycle stole agar garage or could they stole the bike who's the victim of the crime you order a bike um it's not just there's not just assault and battery on the person with its property crimes of property crimes and crimes against personal\nYou know and if there if it gets to visit there against the business of businesses operated by a group of people are you sensing a spike in crime in your community\nWho were

you on\nThe Laurie nice to talk\nTo your voters are going to be Brian is with a a bunch of different ballot measures and you know sorting it all out tell us which one number ten years\nWell proposition can would repeal the existing law to repeal wreck control exchange for that it would do several things that would\nMost importantly for the first time have rent control on single family homes people would also established about five hundred and thirty nine different boards on elected 'em to tell us what we can and can't charge for apartments Oregon are single family homes\nAnd you are no on this let's walk through the arguments on this issue obviously\nThe other side says it's getting very expensive to live in California it seems like you don't landlord might raises rents here there and we got to do something I've seen the ad on TV that they're talking about this stuff you know I mean it is expensive here but it sounds like you're saying this isn't the answer\nWell you know there are some there is there a dispute about the fact that we have a housing crisis but proposition ten will make the housing crisis\nFirst and the reason why we say that uh several first off\nIt would fit some set of eyes any kind of building going forward for affordable housing which we all know here in Los Angeles and across California we're in desperate need for this was a disincentive proposition tendons a disincentive to do any any further building\nYou know and and that will make it difficult for for ... the other thing it'll do is is is it will it creates a perverse incentive for folks who currently\nHave apartments it you know we're talking about small apartment owners you know that our own you know a couple of duplex says or maybe two or three small apartment complexes\nWhere it's essentially say you know what I don't want to do this anymore I Want to get out of the market you your turn those into condos or two we're being be or other kind of vacation rentals but in the end when it does is it takes away stop from the from the rental market\nNow it seems pretty simple supply and demand kind of sets the price but if these folks come in and they set up these boards and somehow they tell a landlord you can't charge enough to make back the expenses you put into it and a little bit of extra\nWhy would you be in the renting business right\n[noise] well that's correct in fact you know really that's one of the reasons why some folks\nMake just simply say I don't want to do this anymore and convert gr apartments in the condos and cell and that doesn't do any good for anyone\nWho is looking to try to find an apartment all that does reduce the overall stock of available apartments which by the way are you know kind of hard to find a ... well he suggests to something else ... now one product and work with a legislature and local jurisdictions to create incentives\nYou know either through reforming sequel or providing affordable housing bonds or the like you know could build a part time it'll it'll just simply do the reverse it'll make the housing crisis worse now\nIn California is not doing much to make it more affordable would legislation I recently read in the future the past about requiring solar systems on houses that's going to\nRaise the price of houses as you mentioned sequels people don't know what that is but there's a set of laws out there that are supposed to protect the environment but they're actually been used by groups organizations to challenge any sort of building and extract things for themselves in the process right\nWell that's correct I mean the California environmental quality act was really put in place to help protect the environment rules also put in place to\nUm to allow communities to to speak up against you know projects is just frankly didn't fit into the communities um but but what it's turned into over the years is really a blunt instrument where\nThen the real issue becomes it's not just the one employee that complaining about it or or disgruntled about it it ends up being a class action representative claims so they represent a all of the employees and and that's what makes it so difficult for him so expensive\nSo in in a lot of times they go after technical things that really aren't affecting somebody's paycheck I Know like a paycheck you've got to have ten things on the check that are correct\nFor it to be legit to be legal in since it's not a violation so if you don't have the beginning date and the end date on the check or the companies in proper corporation name it's paying you is not there but they have a logo instead that matters to check clears and everything's fine eat steal a violation and so\nThese attorneys who wants to learn to game the system stacked up all these violations and say not only is last week's pay check wrong but that logo he's been on the air without the proper desk for the last year so we're going to go back in ... for each one of those right\nAbsolutely that's absolutely what's going on and and you know there's a company in Sacramento right now that's going to shell out over a million dollars because they have the wrong employee id number down\nFor the number on the check didn't match the number on their identification badge nobody was hurt no harm no foul about two hundred employees one million dollars\nThan any of boys got paid on time the amount they got they got everything on\nThe plane that went into their checking account or whatever like it was supposed to that's not the problem but somebody has found him miniscule little mistake on the check\nHim so this is what happens and they have to pay out this money and and that is what driving business out of California or at least unable to pay raises or increase wages or expand when you've got that kind of thing hanging over a business right\nOh yeah and I mean you know last year they had you know close to eight thousand of these lawsuits\nThey're gaining momentum they're gaining speed a lot of these attorneys you know there fulltime business is nothing but a suing businesses and it's not just businesses nonprofits such churches it's it's it's religious institutions it's\nUm any company any non profit you could think of\nYou know they're named and one of these private attorney general lack lawsuits because it can be something as simple as\nHey I'd like to um take my lunch for a little bit earlier today or later today so I can leave early to go see my kids function and once you miss it break or you take a late lunch then all of a sudden you know it opens up Pandora's box and you have a gigantic lawsuit on your\nHands right right so we're to the unions fear you know that's why why can't there'd be a consensus that we make a level playing field for everyone did that and it's a mistake it's discovered we write the wrong if money is owed to a um you know employed they're paid I get it through times when mistakes are made\nBut why is there the union on one side and you on the other explain this\nWell that's the frustrating part I mean I'm you know fairly new to ah getting involved in trying to to change labor laws that make sense that are common sense\nAnd it seems like the unions have an extraordinary amount of influence on all the labor laws\nUh they're behind a lot of a labor laws that are written and it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me because if you look at the population of unionized workers in California it's about Fifteen Percent and half of that is state and federal workers working for the government agencies\nGot literally about seven percent of the workforce dictating the other Ninety three percent of the workforce\nSt that our government agencies subject to bother to or is there an exemption for\nYou know they have they been named and some of these talk a lawsuit so yes it it is and that's kind of you know there's some funny things and and some\nComplications and you know what happens is they are the unions have a lot of collective bargaining agreements and things like that so a big for instances of 'em I've spoken to a prison guard at Pelican Bay and that prison guard comes in he works twelve hour shift he gets no brakes no launches\nA if we were to do that we would end up paying a million and a half dollars you know and lawsuits maybe two million dollars so a normal business can't conduct themselves this way but somebody that is a prison guard can\nBecause the unions have put in these collective bargaining agreements\nAnd and these types of exemptions and rarely ab sixteen fifty four you know\nUnions are isolated from pocket to begin with but that's pretty much removes fog for anybody that as a union construction type worker so it's not the worker so if I'm an employer and I own a construction company and I employee union people with a collective bargaining agreement\nOr we could be ignores them they would have to seek arbitration opposed to filing a class action wage and hour lawsuit so you're just really really unfair totally unfair everybody else\nShould be if they're going to do this reform and they're picking up this idea that ... band and we got to protect to certain segments protect everybody not agree unions I mean it's it's kind of like yeah there on the right track here but everybody ought to be ...\nEverybody everybody all that do that and you you know you're talking to the construction workers so that may be what two percent of the workforce so the the unions are going to spend money you've got a a lot of uh assembly people that are supporting this bill and they're saying hey this is something that needs to pass\nWhen we know the laws that but we're going to protect ourselves and the other Ninety eight percent of the population oh well that's not how legislation that's not how laws are supposed to work\nBut that's how Sacramento seems to be working there he's somebody\nNeeds to stand up and say hey enough is enough it's time to do some changes and reforms that really makes sense because eventually you know we're going to become so over regulated companies are going to be sued so much is going to start to have a serious negative effect on on the state\nWhere you walk around Sacramento if you ever go into the capital you see people with their union T shirts on there there are a lot of people up there who are working the system they realized that's where the decisions are made and and they're in the lawmakers office and unions give money to the lawmakers and their campaigns\nHow do you fight the system how do you find it Tom\nWell wait we need to continue our question is going to be uh fortunately we have an opportunity to be on your radio show fortunately the Fox announced published an article you know we need to really get there's not that to the street because I think a lot of people aren't aware of it you have a lot of businesses owners\nWere focusing on growing and developing the business that's what they do they don't have time to read the paper well Sacramento just passed this law and this was going on and that's going on\nSo it's it's pretty much as the owners are trying to build and develop business nurtured grow it create more jobs or you know behind the scenes there's a lot going on and somebody needs to raise their hand say enough is enough and that's what our group was doing\nYou know we've got John before and share the late lunch story ... workers started at different times of the day and that they all wanted to eat together and it it sounded like a way to build morale right\nIt was a it was a great way to build morale I mean when you have a company that's manufacturing a lot of people aren't flexible you know and and we had people that would come in you know anywhere between five and eight thirty in the morning or you know and play a couple of hundred people out of the two hundred um we have\nFifty one immediate family members twenty six extended family members people have been working this company Fifteen twenty five thirty years I guess what they eat lunch together their their their whole lives here and they want to eat lunch together no matter what time they start\nBut yes other law says Munch shall be by the Fifth Amendment right\nBy the fifth hour so we have people that were actually late by five minutes ten minutes\nHalf an hour the most about Fifteen minutes\nAnd then it costs us a million dollars and and what they ended up finding out as as we get a safety incentive and we didn't calculate that correctly either we're about twenty two cents off though so we're twenty two cents off on an incentive we're giving that we didn't have to give or allowing people to have a flexible schedule and the company gets penalize the million\nDollar and you're the bad guy or the bad guy so do your employees would they still like to have lunch together if they could all\n... you know the problem is is we totally eliminated flexible work schedules it's gone\nTimes now you can't take a chance now is it some disgruntled ex employee the Ken ruins all this or is it just to every single\nEvery single time Larry I got a call from somebody will last week at the security company a private security company in Oakland, California they had an employee come work for them for five days five days they were there\nTwo months later they're named than us private attorney general act lawsuit because there he was claiming he took his lunch half the fifth hour\nWow that that's how that it's getting to know how can a five five day employee come in and cause that kind of commotion well if the attorneys they're allowing it it's the legislators the law makers that are allowing it could\nQuickly amount of time where can people go to learn more obviously the socks and hounds dot com website to your article ab sixty fifty for a union exemption you can read that what's the website or contact for use somebody's in business and wants to learn more about ...\nJoin our cause copy of the a B. I. A. dot org you know and my number's eight one eight eight two three seven six one one getting the call let's get together let's try to change things and fight for business and give all the business owners of real voice\nOne other accuser totally rich recanted her story turns out to the third accuser backtracked so significantly that it became nothing\nBut the good news of course at the end of the day is captain on this very good ban this extraordinary man of principles has been confirmed oh and you want more good news Cheyenne you do All right I'll give it to you know\nHundreds of thousands of moderate Democrats if not millions\nHave seen the ugliness and the pettiness of their own party the anything goes mentality of their party and have ... ... they've converted to conservatism\nYou will see how many new conservatives have been born you know what they'll do shy end the call themselves Kavanaugh Republicans\nAll right just like we had nine eleven Republicans and a ... and all sorts of other different kinds of Republicans who change based upon certain events are Obamacare ... Republicans for example Obama about a generally Republicans and they saw what was what\nCan they be became Republicans and now Kavanaugh Republicans\nTo all which we say thank you Chuck Schumer for helping the conservatives better than we ever could ourselves and thank you for making the upcoming red wave even bigger and stronger\n[laughter] yes raised you always want to show gratitude my friends very important on the bravo show\nOr one of the things that um we also talked about before and and now it's coming out remember I told you that there was there was leaking of information that showed that there was some operative in the Democratic base on the hill\nThat was doc sing a GOP senators what does that mean duck singing means that they they're revealing document information about senators addresses and telephone numbers and such and this democratic operative on the hill an eight to one of the congressmen I Believe\nDecided to release this information why you ask\nBecause he wanted to allow protesters to protest in camp in front of these centers Holmes who might vote to confirm Kavanaugh you know\nAnd they ought to be taught a lesson he wanted to facilitate his Democrat friends\nTo do so it's disgusting but\nThey did it you see there's nothing that they won't do to get there a way it's it's a party my friends of no principles but they have tactics\nRight that's what they should they should have a new emblem for the Democratic party right no principle this maximum ... or something like that okay but one thing you can rest assured there are no principles anything goes\nAnd they have plenty of tactics to use at their disposal and they have their army within the media they have their army within ... they have the army and in the Hollywood mindset and of course academic year\nThey have it everywhere and tactics oh they've got that uh plenty\nThe at the end of the day my friends what what happened here they they created this Web\nAnd they they want it to end trap and snare Kavanaugh for that matter the Republicans at large about this within the sweat and they got caught in their own Web right but my daughter Sasha said it's the the tangled webs we weave\nAnd then they get in there right in it she's so right\nEight six six eight Seventy five Seventy five to with your disagreeing calls appreciate that anyway so what are they very interesting things here is that there's all these predictions of a blue wave versus a red wave right and I've told you before I I I foresee a red wave\nNow [noise] liberals out there the left in particular they anticipate a great blue wave resulting from this Kavanaugh's confirmation okay so from this alone you can see how disingenuous they are gets one thing for them to say look\n[noise] uh I I think that people are sick and tired of Trump and they don't like what they're seeing and they want to go back to the bomber way's fine I I get that but for you to say\nThat the Kavanaugh hearings will somehow embolden the left and get them energized to go vote [laughter]\nI mean honestly my friends you you do not see yourselves in the mirror\nBecause I'm I'm guaranteeing you my left you friends\nAt what happened there was no way you could say this was a net positive for Democrats\nYou are going to instead had a wave of Republicans going to the to the polls and dare I say it's very dangerous for you because as you know this is an off year election where people who are not voting for president they they tend to sit home and they're called liberals\nAll right uh let's take chief from Los Angeles who appears to be disagreeing with me I always appreciate that case you're on the air\nOh hey look I I don't know if you I think you meant that I mean I'm not disagreeing with you know\nI I'm In agreement with ah the whole uh Kavanaugh situation I thank God that he won and that was a civic collect them for the country but I was gonna ask you to maybe ... found a little on the fact that due process he did not receive due process\nFor this whole situation even though they kept saying oh the job interview and not a you know that\nRight no I ... yeah yeah I appreciate that he he did receive due process of course a first of all this is not a criminal matter that's a fair statement it's not as if a his freedom was threatened or for that matter that he might be found liable for him money judgment right\nSo it's a very different this is a as they say job interview but even if it's not a job interview and something more\nThe reality is there's no real penalty other than him not being confirmed as a Supreme Court justice so it's not the same thing you don't have a right to be a Supreme Court justice that's a fair statement right\nGood but I doubt if you go ahead\nAnd find was he didn't have a right you're absolutely right but I don't think we disagree on the\n... the sixth amendment or calls for witnesses and um that sort of are actually based on you know the uh going around me Nineteen about a three two or three witnesses that takes two or three witnesses to uh you know convicted person of a crime\nWell that's true that's true but but but again it's still about crime and it's about what the penalty might be so for example I mean you could accuse anybody of a lot of different things that you think were inappropriate for example I I just said on the air\nThat there is this guy who apparently was duck sing a senator's addresses and phone numbers\nAre and you know there's going to be an investigation of this guy a right and and I'm saying on the air and I think he he did exactly that\nAnd so it's it's easy for me to say it and I he but he doesn't get my due process right it's not as if I have to prove this you know the the allegations are certain there I Believe the better that had happened because I wouldn't pass anything past or anything from the Democrats\nAnd nevertheless if and when he ever is charged then\nThe prosecuting attorney has to establish beyond a reasonable doubt if it's a criminal matter that he engaged in this in the various behavior if it's a civil issue then it's more a preponderance of the evidence that's a different standard listen to ... I got to get going and I appreciate very much thanks so much less\nUh eight six six eight Seventy five seven five to four you're disagreeing calls again um but like the cabinet matter it's worth exploring more because you know it's it's one of those what happens in this thing what can we learn from this sort of moment right\nSo in the cabinet fight it toward the last week when there was the ... FBI investigation everything started falling apart right\nSo the liberals the left the least started moving the goalposts dramatically as Mitch McConnell called it and he was so right\nBy the first day you know once they realized that the whole rape allegations and the sexual assault allegations were all\nI can very questionable the very least they started changing to his credibility because you know he said that he never drink to excess but some of his friends during high school suggested that he did drink drink to excess as if that's that's something important right now\nA ... at All right and then they they [laughter]\nWhen that doesn't pan out then they start saying well he he was really angry at the confirmation hearings and I I don't like that right if he can't handle that kind of pressure at a confirmation hearing well what's he going to do what he becomes the Supreme Court justice himself\nTo which I say well what are you talking about the Supreme Court justice position is not a high pressure job by any stretch\nIt is a purely intellectual enterprise it's very exciting it's very stimulating but high pressure no way it's not as if you've ever heard of Supreme Court justice say boy you know what if the pressure was just getting to me too much I I had to retire\nAnd here's another thing that's very funny about that she's basically admitting that she doesn't see things objectively she's admitting that she's a partisan\nHow dare she complained about they're not being a swing vote was she she's on the very panel as it were where she could be the swing vote\nSo it's the obligation of the Republicans do have a swing vote not you liberals no no no\nIt's like they don't even hear their own words I uh I got to tell you it's really fascinating\nI'm sure she looks at herself in the mirror every day like we all do to make sure that you look appropriate you know for the guys that your ties on it correctly right and you you know that your caller doesn't stick out of your jackets and and your hairs in place if a woman perhaps is making sure that the ... is the right makeup or whatever\nBut does she reflect upon herself in any way when it comes to what she says\nNo\nMe you know what I I think that there is a theme in that shy and I think we might even use that as a theme one day All right [noise]\nAh there was a great article from John Porter it's a commentary magazine and he talked a lot and I just wanted to call it a little bit of permit I'm at twelve thirty in the afternoon September twenty seven\nI don't think there were many serious political thinkers activists on the right who thought that Brett Kavanaugh will survive the mornings testimony by his accuser Christine Blasey Ford\nEight days later Kavanaugh all but secured his appointment the question is how did it happen faster is Kavanaugh happened\nAnd it's on the president's speech unprecedented speech following forts testimony capital not only blasted the process but they may know pretense when it came to those who had manipulated it liberal groups\nPeople angry with Donald Trump people want to take revenge for the Clintons\nBut you know what the speech electrified the right there is no other word for it and boy this is such a good point it's a point that I've been making for for weeks now\nThey don't realize it but that their tactics and and and I say there's a phrase the principal free tactics me they have no principles\nIs exactly what his galvanizing the right exactly\nAnd I I find that fascinating because they they just never internally look so after all the accusation of drunk and groping roping accusations of gang grapes of throwing ice in a bar of being so drunk that he can't remember anything\nProtest after protest against Kavanaugh\nHere we are right\nFault for not for the liberals and all they've done is burned themselves down and we'll talk a little bit more about that when we get back but I'm also talking about the fantastic speech by President Trump and Kansas yesterday [noise]\nAlso talking about the great new numbers coming out for the economy for Trump's popularity and everything else and then of course our thing about how we humans always need some form of transcendence is out in our lives and we ought to be exploring why that is so\nMany times it six six eight Seventy five Seventy five to four you're

of the Kavanaugh confirmation and it turns out like protesters were there\nAll throughout the process weren't they they were there way before the sexual assault charges they were there because they didn't like the way he voted to or rather that the what how we ruled in his various previous opinions and that he might be anti abortion\nAnd so forth but it's always abortion at the end of the day for the left that's you know they they want the right to kill as many babies as possible that's that's their that's their monitor it seems to be\nAnyway protesters apparently happened clawing at the Supreme Court doors wild Kavanaugh was sworn in\nCase this this is your party my left the friend's kid this is the way you ... employed tactics to get your way\nAre you okay with that you see what you're doing again is just creating more conservatives people don't like chaos at the end of the day people vote yes with their pocketbooks for sure but they also vote\nFor stability they vote for leadership they vote for a sense of justice and fairness you think that they like this\nAnyway it's up to you but I tell you I see a red wave coming because of antics ... like this but nevertheless the Democrats are battling a day of reckoning\nRight and and a writer for the cold there show Steven called bear or in the case well we're just glad that we ruined his life but guess what you didn't\nIt didn't ruin a Clarence Thomas's life he became a Supreme Court justice ... testicle wanted that\nHe's very well respected and guess what the same will happen with Brett Kavanaugh everyone will look back and they'll say what a pile of garbage this was what a charade it was you didn't ruined his life\nBut you know what it's not a surprise that that is somehow a tactic that you think it's healthy that this is a good way to proceed about getting your way to ruin people's lives whether it's true or not the facts upon which you ruined them\nVery strange everything about it strange but not at all surprised\nAfter all those accusations that I mentioned just before the break a drunk and groping right the acquisition of gang grapes of throwing ice at a bar of being so drunk that he can't remember anything of protest after protests after cap Cavanaugh a confirmations and all those arrests\nAnd I just love these these speeches that he makes it they're just they're rallies or campaign style rallies and it's fun and he goes through the litany of contenders are that may or run against him and twenty twenty\n[laughter] destroys them one by one he starts off with Elizabeth Warren whom he calls and I think ... folk uh Hondas instead of Pocahontas I mean really just brilliant Appalachian about her and I don't I don't know how she's going to get around us and it turns out that she has all sorts of shady deals in our past financially and otherwise\nBut a lot of Pocahontas charge is going to stick because he or she claims to be a of of Native American heritage on what basis you asked on the grounds that her grandmother I think said that she had really high cheekbones right that's good enough [laughter]\nSo I don't know I don't know what to do at this lady and it's it's very very funny so good luck to you Elizabeth we'll see about that I kind of want you to run because they're so far on the left and you are so similar to Hillary Clinton they already rejected her and I got a good feeling that they will reject you\nKnow then there's Cory Booker and he talks about that and he says and he says really and this is the things I by the way who admitted to a sexual assault allegations against him and he was forced that and then of course his whole Spartacus moment that he had right good luck on that Spartacus by the way [noise]\nAh and then then it's got the the the um ... Blumenthal who might ah you claim that he might run against Trump's so\nTo which he called denying Dick run mean that ... the the village in Vietnam where he had not even been right have claimed to have fought in Vietnam and not only funding it but also bravely defended all of his men in a hail of bullets right not I mean it happened\nNot only was it was not in Vietnam he didn't it certainly didn't fight in Vietnam I think it was in the reserves that best nowhere close to Vietnam\nThat reminds me of Hillary's claim from a long time ago when she was running a ethic either two thousand eight or twenty twelve\n... sorry twenty sixteen when she said um that she was shot at when she visited Bosnia in Nineteen Ninety six you remember that [laughter] it all fell apart on or a man you know it's like it's like that but from Dr seuss right I think it was called oh the places you'll go\n[laughter] and it's it seems like a book that actually describing the Democrats right 'cause they go everywhere\nIf they they just imagine themselves in Vietnam fighting you know for about a hill and saving their man they imagine themselves in Bosnia ducking Under Cover right they go all over the place all over the world using the power\nOf their imagination I never mind that they tried to present it as true but that's their problem but they're very good imagination department All right uh we we spoke a little bit about the midterm election\nOf course coming up but there are some um propositions out there I Want you to really focus on and make sure you vote no on ... I can talk about all the different populations but I Want to focus on to\nWrite one of them is proposition ten\nProposition ten basically would blow up\nThe restrictions that there are unrecognizable did the net effect of it would mean that it would it would make rent control very aggressive it would allow towns and and different parts of the city of Los Angeles and otherwise to uh have a lot more aggressive rent control\n... control of course as you know is designed to its design but doesn't work but it's designed to provide much more affordable housing for the poor and middle class as such like that that's what they claim\nOf course in the party of irony it always actually increases the rent and makes it less affordable and of course restricts the availability of housing for such people but who wants to quibble about such things\nThe bottom line is proposition ... passed which is to uh allow ... control to be much more aggressive in every part of the city\nIt would devastate real estate prices it would devastate the availability of affordable housing exactly the opposite of what they seek and of course it would hurt landlords and they were hurt everyone who owns property but other than that it's a great idea [laughter]\n... you know and what would happen is I mean think of it if you if you cannot raise your rent in a reasonable amount you know from time to time\nIn fact you should be able to raise the rent whenever you're damn well please ... and if if the market will bear well then no one's going to take the rent big deal\nBut you should be able to do that and there's plenty of affordable housing there is no right for you to live in the fanciest part of Santa Monica ... there's no right for you to to ah to be to to live in Beverley hills no such thing and yet there's this this feeling somehow that you have this automatic right\nAnd I never understood why do you have this right in housing when you don't have this same right in food for example or to have a computer or to have a car or whatever you think must be provided right\nI mean it's it's so strange they did they demand that that everyone alter their lives\nAnd the landlords who bought their these homes with certain expectations are and and they bought it in the long run because ultimately one day they might start making a profit and suddenly this ... this this record troll comes out\nAnd devastate their ability to to to have the benefit of the bargain that just can't can't imagine that\nSo here we are proposition ten vote no on proposition tend likewise vote no on proposition eight which show would completely altered the whole ... insurance market and everything else is just no okay I'll make it very easy no on proposition ten no on proposition eight as well\nAll right let me move on to our theme which is the theme\nOf transcendence look one of the things that I ... I'm always fascinated about are the differences between humans on the one hand and animals on the other right and we're not we're not merely more sophisticated than the animals we don't merely have more brain capacity\nWe have a lot more differences than you could imagine right we have a sense of free will we have a love of music we have a sense of the past and the future\nOr we have a sense of purpose we have a sense of improving our lives I mean it goes on and on right and one of these differences is that we seek transcendence\nFrom our daily lives but you know you know a a deer or a lion doesn't seek to transcend\nFrom his ... or from his line you know nature he's aligned it's going to he's going to do what lines do All right but we ... we have a sense about ourselves that we are more than just eating drinking\nA sex thing it up having fun and working right in and making a living they we we censor something more within us in fact if if that's all we do in our lives is that we eat breathed a you know have sex and and drink and work and then die we feel like we've missed out on something right\nEach of us cents ... cents as we have some sort of purpose we want to transcend just a basic humanity wouldn't want to go rise above that so we humans do that though we we we we ... we manifested in ways\nAre that are not necessarily religious so for example ... people take drugs but it's a way of basic of transcending outside of themselves likewise with alcohol likewise with sexuality\nLikewise with intense music even with food for that matter that they seek out these these hives these connections sometimes they go to concerts for the purpose of transcending with the music I get to\nThe end they often take drugs in the process to which is horrible\nBut we rarely ask why we see each seek out these transcendent moments\nRight we just it's understood you know this person has a drug addiction right this person has an alcohol problem this person you know you know wasting his time too much you know buying music and listen to music and or protecting our food and he's gotten us in such animals don't have that problem right\nThey don't they don't seek out drugs or alcohol or or too much sex or whatever it might be but we humans we we do that and what we're talking about is the quest for transcendence\nA transcendence from reality\nIt's a quest to connect to something far greater than ourselves\nWe do that that's a distinctly human thing to do\nAnd what is that transcendence in reality that we see my friends well why do we mistake but drug transcendence and the alcohol why do we do that because we have this creeping this call to to transcend\nTo find God to connect with God that's all it is the transcendence that we that is innate within us\nBut when we reject God then we seek out that transcendence in some other form don't we\nWrite in terms of sex and drugs and alcohol and all of the things we just mentioned but they are they are deviations from the real transcendence they were mistaken sign posts they lead you the wrong way [noise]\nSo was my point here it's to keep things simple I don't want you to get into this whole craziness of um ... credits spreads worth the diversification of the the whole international currencies with commodities\nYou go gosh you know I I guess it must have missed that day at school\n[laughter] must've I must have been sick that\nDay and econ\nBecause here's what I Want you to focus on simple enough\nTo make money every year and once it cost me and if I don't make money every year\nDo I lose money when the market goes down I don't know if you should put all of your money\nIn safety just like I think you should have some money for emergencies at home\nFor ... no no decent financial professional will tell you don't have any cash at home rely completely on the banks and the electronic system in a debit card\nNo of course they're going to have somebody in your pocket have\nSomebody at home they should also be mentioning oh by the way I think you should have money safety in safe and guaranteed places\nBecause here's what happened you're going to it's not a question unless you don't live very long you're going to have a financial emergency in retirement so you have to plan for that\nThe financial emergency sometimes your doing\nSometimes something happens to you and in either of those cases\nI think you want to look at\nHow you can manage and build your financial life with out without a problem where each and every day you're worried about what the market's going to do in each and every day you're worried about uh the ... you know what's happening in Asia or in China\nSpecifically right the south China Sea I don't know what does that mean to me and\nI'm guessing it somewhere in the south China\nSo I'm going to go over some things how to deal with a financial emergency in retirement\nBecause life events happen natural disasters health crisis\nUh sometimes people divorce is called the great the graying divorce I don't know if you know about this maybe you've seen it but you probably have friends\nOr family that have divorced after thirty forty fifty years of marriage\nWe have for clients right now that are thirty plus years of marriage that are actively going through a divorce that's a lot\nThat that's a lot of time and in all but three of those cases it was a surprise to one of the spouses does now that an all but three they said oh ah\nJust one day he came home and he said this isn't working and she said she could tell you it was almost like you knew where you were when John Kennedy was killed or where the where the world trade centers came down and you were notified it it's kind of that memory in her mind and she said she was standing there in the kitchen and she's thinking what's not working\nAnd they had had problems with the air conditioner but they fixed it so she she's thinking of the air conditioner this isn't just this isn't working\nWe can get it fixed again I I don't know what's wrong she says no no no this this and he's pointing to each of them this this isn't working ... and then the dogs are but she's making that can't be true it can't be what he's talking about has to be something else so she's still trying to figure it out\nAnd it takes a few minutes I mean imagine being the only one in the room that doesn't get the joke\nRight that's that's kind of how she felt cycle wet\nAnd after a time you start thinking well it must be but I'm the only one that didn't understand it must be that I'm the only one\nThat didn't see it coming well her family and friends nobody outside coming he just had another life he had other ideas other plans of what retirement happiness was about well that's all well and good until we look at statistics\nMost of the time\nThe poor the indigent in retirement are women most of the time the ones that still work certainly because\nThey're still alive for women live longer\nBut today those statistics are starting to change we're starting to see men live a little longer certainly not as long as women\nBut they are living longer than they were just ten years ago\nAs that starting to change in retirement\nWomen will no longer receive their husbands Social Security which is usually the ... the larger of the two because she was often working part time or stay at home mom or just had careers that had flexibility and and wasn't as as much in this promotion world\n[noise]\nSo what you see across the board is women are now reaching age and instead of being Seventy Seventy five years old and a widow many of them are divorced\nAnd ladies I notice is never going to happen to you but just do it for somebody else pay attention because somebody else you might know it was going to need advice\nAnd part of that advice is to plan and prepare because an emergency and retirement isn't just an outside force hitting you\nIt is sometimes the inside hitting us back\nMake smart careful moves to uncover what those expenses could be how to plan and prepare\nAnd will do that will work through that here's we continue but most of these come past eight fifty five sixty sixty five\nBecause when you're working you have a plan right the family leave medical locked\nF. L. M. S. A. B. C. whatever to another government program that says the employer has to figure out how to come up with time and money\nTo have two people do one job while you're gone\nThat means listen if that's the way the rules that's what people have decided to realize there's less money for the other workers because they have to take the amount the employer has to take the amount that as allocated for labor\nAnd divide it amongst employees that are going to be gone sometimes so that means there's less for you because do you think the employer's going to make less money\nDo you think the employer do you think she's going to say listen I busted my honey for this business and worked my whole life\nSo that I can barely make a living or so that my employees always have a guaranteed paycheck but there's been months that I haven't taken a pay check it out there's been weeks that I haven't uh that I haven't paid myself so that my employees could have a paycheck and now with all these new rules and laws what I'm going to do instead\nIs I'm going to get even more money for their health insurance even more my no\nThey're not going to do that\nTo the dollars that are allocated towards labor in a business is now going to be divided up amongst an extra half of an employee or a third of an employee whatever their numbers work out to be\nBut if you're working and you're an employee place a listen I I've been there I took time off from my first son was born I liked it\nEverybody likes it right when you Rob Peter to pay Paul you're always going to have Paul support Paul thinks that's a good ... he's like you know the schedule is passed that law\nThat rent control I think that's got a I'm a writer I like it\nSo I don't I don't think that because somebody's passionate about something that it must be right even there more and more passionate they're they're even extremely passionate so it must be right I get it all of these laws and rules it's a balance so what will employers do if they can leave they do they do\nYou can argue you can say what you want we've lost ten over ten thousand businesses so if you're an employee and you're still working you have a backup plan your backup plan is the government giving you these little programs unemployment a worker's comp\nNone of them are bad I'm not saying they're bad but you need to understand when you are retired there is no workers' comp for retirement there is no hey you know what I got hurt gardening last week and somebody pay me more money\nThey just don't do that what they do instead\nIs it just keep paying you a lower wage called Social Security\nSo if there isn't a natural disaster if there is something that happens you have deductibles if you even have an earthquake insurance that's amazing now you ... you have to come up with the first ten twenty fifty a hundred thousand dollars before they'll cover it called a ...\nSo we have to plan for emergencies in retirement [noise]\nFirst of all you always have to be in touch with your CPA your tax preparer and this is important\nBecause you should not be just meeting with them once a year for Fifteen minutes when they have\nPiles of files all around their desk on the top and behind them and they barely look at you in their eyes and the shirts all wrinkled right [laughter]\nAnd they're just stressed out I feel so bad for these folks\nBecause they're it's like they're running a marathon from January first 'til April fifteenth why they disappear for the month of April and may that's why they're gone go to\nGo on vacation for two weeks can't blame them why do I want you to stay in touch with them because if you have an emergency and you need to pull money from your retirement accounts stay below the next tax bracket\nAsk them how much more can I take out from my four one K. is or my IRAs\nAnd not have my Social Security tax it the next highest market\nSocial Security has tax bracket that has it has levels\nWill get into this and another show but do you need to really understand this because if you take out we had this happen to uh last year when he comes in she said I Need it five hundred dollars so she took it instead of from her savings because she wanted to have some magical number in her savings all the time instead of doing that what she said instead was I Am going to\nWell thank you it's now metastasized and she has she probably won't make it through the end of the year early fifties\nSo these are emergencies that can happen where the other spouse has yet to plan\nSo what a safety do for this safety builds a couple of things number one safety in retirement says I Need to have some of my money protected because those things we\nControl but what we can control\nHow much of our money is at risk in the market\nHaving some are part of your money safe you pick the number if you think the average downturn in the market is five years it's a little more than that depending on a you know if you go to the last ten years it's five or six seven years whatever before you make all the money from the high to the next high\nRight before we get back to where we were yesterday if it starts to drop tomorrow\nWhat does that number it's about six seven years but let's just take five years\nIf you take five years and you say what am I going to need to live on if many bad things happen at once the market drops like everybody saying it's going to write\nOr we have an issue with the economy or or\nYou don't hear war right isn't that interesting President Trump's you just don't hear war\n... and the left is using everything they can they're caught on their back foot they're always trying to plan\nThey can't talk about the economy that's not an issue the economy's find jobs are fine so instead of saying you know things are going pretty well then immediately start walking down the road of trying to find your personal accusations\nWhat we need to do is say how much money do we have to\nSafe so when not as a financial emergency happens in retirement and it it can be all sorts of things\nWhat are some of the things we can do\nIt well look we've talked about relocating you've heard me say this time and again you can save at least Fifteen Percent when we do the math it's probably closer to twenty here's what that means if you're making a thousand dollars a month and Social Security or one of your ... imagine getting another two hundred dollars on top of that\nThat's not bad if you're making ten thousand dollars in retirement imagine getting another two thousand dollars on top of that\nThat's what relocating out of California can do if your budget is close enough if you want to quality of life a lot of people do that\nWe have set about one out of two of our clients not retire outside of California this year in the last few years it's been about one out of three\nRelocating that's an option a lot of people do to lower expensive place we're gonna come back and just a minute I Want to get over a couple of things with you\nHow much money should you have set aside for retirement and this is important when I say five years what does that equal how do we take those sixteen months\nAnd set aside money to make sure we are not going to go backwards\nBecause retirement can happen at any time but so can emergencies we'll be back and just a minute you listen to me ... it's the talk of financial our give us a call if you have a question\nTriple eight Ninety nine retire eight eight eight nine nine seven three four seven AAA Ninety nine retire [noise] total financial our
