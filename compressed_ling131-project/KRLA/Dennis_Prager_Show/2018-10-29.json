World Series victory [noise]\nThat was the Eighteen and again but when I was I I think I should I fell asleep or in the sixteenth or stop detriment I think it was about twelve thirty when it ended okay so then game for which President Trump even treated about yeah which will review and about which is classic\n[noise]\nThat's Joe Buck with a call now the amazing thing is that uh that game for victory President Trump was watching that now Jennifer what was that the dispute but you you had a similar news breaker you agreed with President Trump even on the Dodger\nMarkets are packed with you again filling in for Dennis pray you're my second decade\nOf doing this it has been a real privilege to keep in touch with me and see where I Am on the air next on my Web page at the Marcus for show dot com where you can email me following me on Facebook or Twitter\nOr leave me a message was a question or comment that we can perhaps respond to on the air as always you can keep in touch with me I mentioned this specifically the all the mail mark ... dot com M. A. R. K. I. S. L. E. R. at AOL dot com which many of you've done over the years and I really appreciate the fact\nThat if you check those sites you'll find out where else I appear besides filling in for Dennis prayer or Larry Elder as I did last friday for what a privilege to be able to fill in for both the gentleman although I must admit I intentionally used Facebook and Twitter much less now I don't think I ever barely touched Twitter anymore you know how far left\nAnd biased they are that Facebook has its own thing with you know you get in touch with people you have known for years or seeing for years of her from but I don't know it's so clear what side of the spectrum there on and that makes a difference [noise] but in the news you at where I've heard about the ... murders at a Pittsburgh synagogue [noise]\nIt's hard to imagine that you go pray and be with your God and your fellow worshippers and you were murdered purely because of your face\nThat it's just incredible not unlike when you go to your church and you were murdered purely because of your skin color or your threaten or attempted murder is committed because of your political persuasion\nThey all have one thing in common\nThey make no sense except when you understand there's evil in the world committed by evil and deranged people [noise]\nThat people are not born good and this is seems to be a battle with those who are I don't know religious from those of us who are secular\nAnd if people are left to their own devices can commit terrible crimes\nAs with genocide or slavery so from the very beginning you write we teach our children that you know not every toys they're taught I always love it when you go to a party and it's your kids ah someone else's birth to part of the kid goes than he your kids watch every toy\nThat the birthday kid has because they haven't been taught right they grow up selfish everything is about them when they're babies everybody's a doting on them and falling all over them so that's a key difference certainly between\nI think not only the religious and secular but the left and the right to people are not basically good 'cause you hear all the time with the left at all you know you got\nAnd we've now found out through the corruption at the highest levels of the state department and the FBI\nSo she really was never held accountable for her actions and the cries to lock her up represent the Irish people feel that she was given a pass and appears to be above the law\nNot unlike her husband who didn't go to jail for lying under oath of course the press doesn't do that they made it into you know he had this affair with an intern so because of sex that's why people want them to go you know he lied under oath you don't have a system in in court if you can get away with lying under oath\nAnd the idea that this one set of rules for the Clintons and another set for the rest of us so ... is not by any means and incitement to violence\nThe other charge that President Trump calls the media the fake media and they get especially annoyed with the charge that they are the enemy the people there be on the media is beyond outrage they really get on their high horse for that one and they were beyond offended\nBut it's also legitimate\nThe press not infrequently comes out with stores that are not true the latest example that you hear this one NBC was hiding spot Qatari evidence in reference to the charges by Julie sweat Nick and her sleazy porn lawyer\nThat's Tucker Carlson is named for him and it's why it's a good one [noise] it seems NBC knew that you didn't even support her lawyers characterization of his claims that you saw Kavanaugh spike drinks or engage in gang rape you didn't hear that John I think I got something on John even hear that bit of news yeah\nAnd this so called serious offense is not outraged if you examine it from President Trump's respect for many of his supporters\nTo media is huge power to influence the course of events and the public's perception of events so they're no longer object the reporters and apart a sense of the left which they come\nThey will influence the people in a way that profoundly affect public policy does to the detriment of insurance so for example I don't talk about and the next our legal immigration debate with the media showing heart wrenching stories of children being ripped away from their mother never mention the fact that none of this would happen if the mothers didn't bring them here in the first place you never hear that\nOr the more salient fact perhaps that whenever someone who's guilty of a crime catch this that children are also so called ripped away from them when their parents go to jail\nFor children as far as I Know never go to jail along with their mother or father [noise]\nHow come that hardly ever reported by the mainstream media so it can be put in perspective by the viewer or listener so the media shape the debate even in their use of the term undocumented well she was on Fox News even though he more picked on them\nAs all at all it's all they lacked the proper documents to come to this country or your house or take your bank account so I just don't have the right documents\nSo of course many people never hear the other side of issues if the press barely reports and so in that sense they're an enemy of the people because they're denying all the facts to the people and not allowing them to make their own decisions\nLet me know what you think I think this is a big part of the issue he's right let me know what you're saying one a prank or seven seven seconds mark guys love a dentist [noise]\nLeave it right here on AM eight Seventy the answer\nFor other\nThings a little jammed up by now and ... somebody in a car trouble and

I've got to cite examples his dentist would say talk radio on the left is just about never made it in one of the reasons I Believe is because they don't have a sense of humor because this thing is not just about information it's also about to either way that intrigues people ends entertains them some way not only not staying the facts I'm not trying to put them together\nBut everything with you oh he encouraged him you know I I I could cite examples of other presidents that have said things that certainly weren't the most peaceful thing in the world what about even Hillary lately saying we can't be civil get any more into we get rid of the Republican administration that is not encouraging people to do something\nI think you see it on one side let's go to\nMould mould in Torrance, California Iran with mark\nMark how you doing well I I'm not a ... it's not really a bone to pick or anything but just a clarification I Believe that the president used the term uh said when he was very you know people who said that they use\nThe enemy of the people and the irony here is that the media took umbrage to that and I bought like\n... ... on their part that they are they\nI appreciate if I don't know if that's correct I assume you're saying if the way it is but it wouldn't matter either way because even if he said they're an enemy the people I I kind of agree with them if they're not going to be with him not going to be objective in a report the news\nIn an objective way and then you're influencing people and you're not alone with people in this republic to make a decision about who who's supporting who do elect\nSide don't I don't think it's outrageous but you notice how they get so offended\nOn the left is outrageous to pick them up for what we actually\nWon a prank or seven seven six smart\nDay and age Seventy\nVia after my friends the bruising battle over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was just the tip of the iceberg of what's ahead of me sold on our freedoms especially religious freedom all over America\nFrom Atlanta fire chief who lost his job for writing the men's Bible study on his personal time to the Colorado Baker who want to seven to ... to victory in the Supreme Court this summer one organization is in the forefront of defending my rights and your rights who's the alliance defending freedom\nI support them and I'm asking for you to step up\nAs we'll just call eight hundred for six nine nine six five six eight hundred for\nSix nine nine six five six we'll go to Dennis perjure dot com and click on me I support religious freedom better thanks to a generous donor every dollar you will be doubled so you're one hundred dollar contribution becomes two hundred dollars for five hundred dollars becomes a thousand dollars in the\nFight for religious freedom so please join me today by supporting the war could be alliance defending freedom\nPolicy that you buy American General life insurance companies can technically not available in all the details sitting direct dot com\nIf you're young and healthy you don't need life insurance right yeah that's what I used to think too until my brother died at thirty eight\nJoe left his wife with two kids a mortgage a stack of bills she couldn't pay\nMary had to sell the house and move everybody into this tiny two bedroom apartment just to make ends meet\nI never want to do that to my wife so I got life insurance I called A.

A. R. K. I. S. L. E. R. and let me know or what you think and I try to respond to all of those emails\nAnd if you check those sites you'll find out where else I pure besides filling in for Dennis or or Larry on the Salem Radio network\nIn the last star where he certainly talking about ... shootings at the temple\nAnd and then and it's kind of evolved into a\nPeople blaming certainly the media and of course the Democrats in the left it's all the same thing these days blaming President Trump for the pipe bomb or bomber blaming President Trump for the shootings at the temple it never ceases to amaze me that everything that goes on that's bad it's his fault\nAnd um even in the most serious charges against and the one I think that most if ended up being the press is that the people\nNow that depression is the enemy that people which I think they are because they don't report the news objectively and that was basic to our founding that they'd be a free press a new reporting the facts and not loads of giving into government figures that they agreed with and make it easier\nLike they get our President Obama and by the way speaking of President Obama he said some awful things to that could incite people like me normally calm not heard people like me we have that clip let's play that shouldn't be democratic\nHow\n\n[noise]\nNo no no\nSo why isn't that inciting people to violence did you see how he says so passionately and ... is the anger and his voice as ... people on my side let alone President Trump that were against people based on how they look or how they pray daily\nWhen did that first happened I didn't I must have missed that or where he is looking for the compassionate Republicans right he really needs to Republicans that don't stand up for themselves but I Love the last one because I was going to talk about illegal immigration in this hour\nRipping immigrant children not no it's not illegal immigrants but we're acting immigrant children\nAnd talking about from the cold cells running them out of the arms the mothers or fathers and and you know however you put a I'm paraphrasing and they wind up in a in a coal sell houses that incitement on his side for some people yeah you do that or to children away from their parents we better do something about how come when he does it\nIt's okay how come when he he actually is lying about our position\nWhere as President Trump blind I Want you to point that out in terms of\nLeaving them in a cold sell cars that makes me pretty angry how come it's not on their side\nThat that that's OK when they do\nBut it's only President Trump you seen the visceral hatred for this president\nAnd as I mentioned Larry show friday you know the reason for it is because we finally have a Republican who standing up to the other side who doesn't let them get away with anything look like you I I'm not thrilled with everything he says there's Denis says you get the total package with everybody but the fact\nIs they hate him to hate him with a passion because finally someone standing up to them that's what I think\nSomeone is really not letting them get away with it I remember John McCain didn't do anything about personal bombing he didn't want people to even mention the fact\nThat he may have been you know the way he talked about the America should I Apologize and I've you know the issue about where he was born I get that one but you can't say anything about President Obama that was sacrilegious so to speak\nBut it's okay you can do and if you want to say about President Trump is okay and the press is complicit with this\nSo yeah on my side you can't say anything but on the other side you could do what you want\nAnd it was very hard I got to tell you it was very hard for me is the last caller last hour said even some Jewish leaders I shouldn't say even what a surprise most of them are on the left to say all the climate from the top down that's what you're doing that's what's creating madman well let me tell you\nIf I was a little over the edge what President Obama did could maybe if I was a crazy evil person may be pushed me over the edge\nHow can you compare that mark how could you say that a person\nAnd I was just a straight guy right like he never lied he never set of straw dummies like you said immigrant children not immigrant children and how come it's not mentioned that when people go to jail their kids have taken away from them because people don't want you to know that\nThat you don't want to have that kind of ... let me know what you think when a predator seven seven six I'm hearing is live in a pain free relief factor dot com studios and let me get to your calls and rabbi day and I'm not sure if it's a different take her not rabbi Dan you're on with mark\nAnd mark how are you real good\nI'm actually trying to make a comment in response to the previous caller and I'm often looked like she said people get up and the Jewish community and say that the ... their ... to the ... her all the men but there is represent the Jewish community that unfortunately\nPeople and we'll get an entire community women don't represent the within the more traditional juice that I'm a Carter who we are good appreciation ... done\nFor the country and for the state of Israel and all the moving the embassy um everything with the UN um it's it's just been ugly people were grateful where you find the more traditional around so much like\nPeople are more conservative and people have more conservative values that we expect it and we all know that we have to cook her community will Iran we never charities system bucking is perfect\nBut you can't get in and they got the answer by without going you got there we go to ... have a ... you had in ... by the office\nAnd unfortunate reality of life in America could really do\nThink rabbi down I appreciate very much and I forgot that right we should mention that he's got orthodox or grandchildren but certainly\nThe idea that he's

R. at AOL dot com [noise]\nAnd if you check those sites you'll find out where else I appear besides filling in for Dennis prayer for say ... last friday\nIn this hour you can continue to talk about some of the things we've been talking about the last few hours but I said I Want them to talk about illegal immigration\nEspecially with the caravan approaching I've talked about illegal immigration for over Twenty years now and I've never wavered in my position the issue is really not that difficult if you acknowledge the simple fact\nThat people across the border illegally have come here legally as one caller pointed out\nWhich one of those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone the illegal aliens so you have to term undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss place them somewhere or lost them\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here legally the argument might be quickly over if they are legal then they're not allowed to be here and a story\nIf you own a home and someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in\nThey wouldn't be able to say they belonged in your home but they just lack of proper documents similarly if someone walked into your bank and wants to take the money out of your account they would be asked to prove that it is their account if they said it was their account but they just didn't have the documents approving the banks would not permit them access\nWhich is why it's so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase on document as if they are entitled to your house and bank account if only they could find a misplaced documents\nFor years now I've said that the left as one of the argument over language whether it's undocumented versus illegal livable wage versus minimum wage global warming or climate change whatever it is the moment\nBut the left is much better to finding the terms and using the language to their benefit of course that helps to have a media on your side perpetuating these false it's so so those on our side or off and on the defensive even though they're explaining the ...\nAnd the most recent case being parents with children\nTrying to get asylum if that's really the case if they're not just coming in for the benefits of work and President Trump and Republicans accuse you heard President Obama and last hour we had the clip them him of ripping children from the mother's arms and putting these children in cold cages [noise]\nNever mind that this was started under the Obama administration [noise]\nHe has more I mean but would be the right word than anybody I Know President Trump and the Republicans are on the defensive never mind that if the parents of these children didn't come to the border and the first place he would be no issue no one force them to come here they made a voluntary choice\nAnd we have a right to our sovereignty and to protect our borders and to decide who is welcome to enter just like we do with our homes but the left and the Democrats and the media off in the same thing I Do not believe in sovereignty but rather they believed in open borders but they don't like to admit it because they know they would lose the argument\nWhich is why they would rather talk about tearing children out of their mother's arms [noise] never mind that when anyone does something illegal and they're hauled off to jail they'll their children do not go with them to jail they're also then so to speak torn away from them\nAnd the ... in the latest reincarnation of this conflict hundreds of Hondurans another legals are heading for the U.S border in a mass migration to seek asylum\nThat was no doubt my my name is Thirteen and other people who would do us harm or among them so can President Trump the Republicans will be on the defensive just because they want to defend our borders and the media no doubt about it will again show you crying children and distraught mothers\nBut no one is forcing them to come here and we have a right as I said to decide who gets the entire country or a house and under what circumstances\nAmong other things we have a right to protect the American people from harm weather from terrorism or as one caller mentioned less our disease or even for that matter to make sure that people have come here is a radical concept share our values\nAnd just about every country does this including our neighbor immediately to the south Mexico [noise]\nSome of us think this is so obvious but there have been huge forces arrayed against this common sense I mention it last hour the Democrats won more votes and the country club Republicans want cheap labor of course the Republicans are also the stupid party that's my party I Know\nSo you have people like George W. Bush remember this and Karl Rove saying things like Bush got up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote when he ran in Texas\nWonderful I'm not a math major but that seems like a formula for defeat\nA loss in politics a sixty to forty percent is huge and that's based on optimistic assumption most of the ... illegal immigrants come here for jobs as we've long established but they also take advantage of government handouts that the rest of us are paying for and the Republican Party can never out to the Democrats in offering benefits give it up\nSo here's a phrase I've used over the years if ever given a choice between Democrats and Democrats they always choose the real thing [noise]\nWho are these people going to vote for it's not that hard to figure out\nAnd if left unchecked Republicans will never win a national election again\nSo even even on a purely selfish basis for those in the conservative side it is clear that we need to control the border but how about fairness for everybody [noise]\nWhat do you say to people around the world who've been waiting many years to get here but I have to undergo long waits and in ... and she bought a national paperwork even have a chance of getting here\nSo they have to follow the rules but those are dash across the border do not\nWhich is why a border wall makes sense among other tools one color on a different radio network when I was on a week or so ago suggested that border walls don't work in the long run\nBut even if that were true I told them I bet they work in the short run to stop masses of people coming here don't you wish we had a border now as we will are going to be confronted with these people in short time not to mention these really live safe for murder by their fans\nWe need we need to clean this mess up and have an orderly procedure coming into our country\nAnd I don't mean with a comprehensive immigration plan that has been signed on to better public as like Bush George W. Bush for Paul Ryan no amnesty and no pathway to citizenship should be accepted that rewards illegal behavior but there to those who say the border wall won't work\nThey use the same or ... I mentioned this that the defenders of illegals murdering innocent Americans use and I had to be in the last summer when they say the un documents commit oh he said the caller challenge me have they committed mass murder no it's not unlike the argument or have they commit fewer crimes percentage wise the Native Americans\nWho cares even if that is true\nIf an American is killed or harmed by an illegal immigrant that person would not have been hurt if that illegal had been denied entry in the first place no matter what the percentage and that well preventing one Hamas murder in Israel for mentoring would have said that Israelis life\nThe logic of these arguments is baffling unless you realize they have no real argument unless you change the words and the terms for example how can you ever justify sanctuary cities where criminal illegals or given safe harbor\nYou come up with phony arguments like illegals will not cooperate with the authorities you've heard this if they know they can be apprehended are sent home [noise]\nBut how about not allowing them to come in the first place and then we wouldn't care if they cooperated with authorities [noise] how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit ...\nI'm a native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate to the evil police officers in ice who had the audacity to arrest people who commit crimes soft rest of us have to live with long waits at hospitals deteriorating schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities\nSo what's my solution I said I Would give it to you take away the benefits like free healthcare and preschools you for strict penalties against businesses which one of you mentioned that hire illegals even sending some see CEOs to jail\nAnd you would be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home Romney had it right but he used the wrong language there we go again when he said self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would then say that those who remain I'd be willing to have a conversation with because they would stay for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake please\nEnough of the government sending out the wrong message with bilingual education classes or bilingual government documents our country is United bites language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our values\nAs I said our ancestors kiss the ground when they landed at Ellis Island has ... said one of the colors last hour they didn't come here for free benefits they didn't come here for free hospital care free schools\nThey didn't come here for any of that it was so happy to be in the land of freedom so let's build that wall and do everything to end illegal immigration and take our country back tell me what you're thinking one a prayer seven seven sex line Marcus of filling in for Dennis\nOf the illegal aliens that are here\nTo work uh have been violating these laws\nBut nobody ever mentions it it or not otherwise law abiding it's simple you know\nMy daughter was actually a victim of a\nFight eats up by illegal aliens using her Social Security number which were stole which was a child\nMhm so uh I don't know why the conservatives Republicans don't push back on this whole illegal thing by by describing what's happening here is entirely when people come into work [noise]\nYou have just a one one of the many problems with this whole thing it just seems obvious to me there's got to be an orderly procedure that house someone gets into a country we call the legal immigration you have a plan that makes sense you give the opportunity to them\nSo you want to give the opportunity to seem so obvious to me that's why you have to have the when the language war because otherwise they put it in terms of ripping babies away from immigrant children and having immigrants always been\nA terrific a boost to the United states from er yeah legal immigrants but you changed the language let's go to Rick in the Bronx Rick you're on was mark\nThanks for taking my call mark at this point I Want to change the big lost all of this caravan of course they want they want they either\nPathway contented only ... the out you know also a dog I bought 'em all of the decent people what for this conference that Scott first thought to be just gangs and dogs and a search team or what you want to tell\nYou all know the real point is I thought you were getting too they aren't all good people that they are they're going to be terrorists among them they're going to be people that don't value the ideals that we do in the United states of America to give me even people with disease right they haven't been fed him as one caller pointed out so you have\nTo have some means of doing some orderly process that's the whole point this argument seems such such an easy one to win if you frame it in the right terms use the right language you know be compassionate people okay you want to come to this country I think we let a million people in a year\nThere's a way to do here the rules here the procedures you have to follow that President Trump the Republicans are going to lose this one either way right your call out the national guard or whatever you do you stop them from coming in what you got to do your evil bad guys as Obama said ripping children away from their mothers and everybody joins in with that right\nAnd if you uh don't stop them you have an invasion you have people coming in these people aren't coming in for
