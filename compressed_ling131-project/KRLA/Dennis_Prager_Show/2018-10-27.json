that is just an outrage when the philosophy come through there specifically finding the churches of course the burning the churches down raising the churches out desecration churches\nAnd they take over the ... they take over the land and they'll rebuild the from the foundations of the church that will tend to rebuild a mosque\nThat's why we can't let this happen they have to stand up for our brothers and sisters so John pastor John also from the Anglican Church\nWas one of these passers who was threatened he did a CNN interview some months ago and when the ... found out that he was speaking out against the persecution they targeted specifically he told his family his wife and kids when you go to the marketplace don't use your last name\nBecause when they find out that we are in the area they're gonna they're gonna find where we are going to kill us [noise] so he was living under that type of fear\nAnd they came they destroyed his church and you know pastor John he's got a

forgive but we're also going to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ regardless of what happens and worth keeping that\nKendall of that whole nests there are we not\nExactly like in the book of acts believers in prey take away the prosecution is a lot in the midst of the threats let your serve and speak to your word with great boldness and that's what's happening on to a church the believers there that there are those that are standing up and say we will not give up we will not give it we will stand and speak up kingdom establish\nYour sharing with me too and I know we we told the stories um pass broadcast to in the campaign we had the the the philosophy some Muslims Islamic members are seeing the boldness and they're converting\nThere have been yeah there have been stories there's but I met people that were boldly witnessing to philosophy\nOf Muslims and imagine the youth if you're if you're growing up in the ... the Muslim community and you see your four or five you see this type of these acts of violence taking place but then on the up on the other side you see acts of love forgiveness\nUm people that are completely vulnerable that are only are responding with acts of kindness back to the ... what would you choose as a young person [laughter] you the way of love or the way of hatred and that's why this Dave in this campaign that we're we have right now is a way of showing\nThat Christian love is so much more powerful than the hatred of Islamists and this is not just happening during this is this is a ideological global warfare that we're participating in on one level or another\nThat we are standing up what their brothers and sisters and say love will defeat this form of evil\nPhone number is triple eight to five thirty thirty five to two we're inviting you to invest in this restored hope\nI'm Christian solidarity international and the plight of the persecuted Christian Nigerian families\nThe safe refuge and what that means is a roof over their head after these fellow brothers sisters of ours have had their village their churches there they're there\nTo burn down completely destroyed their land taken so that refuge means not only do they have a roof over their head but dignity to be able to have a a a toilet to use I mean that\nGuys this is what we're talking about ladies and gentleman that safe refuge is that the food of course water yes medical treatment so much of a Joel if you're talking about the the children that were in the hospital and continue to be in the hospital recovering from their midst Shadi injuries\nBeing shot so that medical treatment the counseling and their crime why are they shot why are there and ... why are there ... or their moms and dads are being decapitated by machines because they love Jesus and they are

one of our fellow brothers or sisters who have had the whole world up ended ... loved ones killed what would the Nigerian Christian family what have they said\nWhat would they say what would you say to our am a seminary the answer family\nA day but when I was there I was so impressed by the attitude of these uh brothers sisters of ours they weren't coming they weren't begging and they weren't a dream you know going to America and starting to live there they love their lives they love their families and the communities that the established they just want their they want their lives back again\nThey want the dignity reestablished and I think they would say thank you for praying for us thank you for standing with us thank you for giving so that we can and that that we can get back up on our feet\nDuring this difficult time third dignified people hardworking people are beautiful people\nAnd um I I Hope some of you have the privilege of meeting some of them are on the side of eternity as well because they're they're precious I enjoy the time with them so much we were other parts of Nigeria where we met at church leaders and enjoy the fellowship\nAnd the type of um [noise] church services they have with her music and the death scene in\nBut so and we have a lot to learn from them because they are um their faith is strong in the midst of these type of trials even so when you talk about pastor John\nYeah church burned down ... family being threatened and he says I'm not giving up on the name of Jesus and he's writing his church in a\nTent and helping bring aid to others I mean it's phenomenal that type of faith that's being you know I'm demonstrated during during this difficult time the phone number\nIs Tripoli to five three three five two to eight eight eight to five three three five to to the need has been painted the urgency I trust you hear time is of the essence we have\nSolid brothers sisters or bars who are\nIn need of medical treatment even now as we were showing a joy showing me pictures of\nTo reward you and your family for tuning in and\nToday we're going to focus on the hill who the kidneys and nutritional support for the brain memory and of course the inseparable lymphatic kidney connections so we'll be talking about the loop system as well\nAnd so um what is the kidney do well it's a major player in keeping the blood pure and clean a filters the ... of blood every single day and then\nIt doesn't have what it needs to do a really good job\nWhat exactly does get the kidney and drug uh well first of all not drinking water\nHardly anyone in America gets a half pounds per pound body weight\nOf water per day and that's kind of the minimum so let's say you were a hundred and fifty pounds\nYou'd need Seventy five ounces of water a day it's a little bit less than ... records\nAnd unfortunately by not getting the water it's very very hard and the kidney the other problems for the kidney is a really it shares this with the brain is getting way too much\nRefined oil which is almost always will make is six\nAnd then there by having the inadequacy the mode of omega three fatty acids and in particular the end chain form of omega three that's so needed by the brain and by the\nYeah the kidneys that's called D. A. J. do cause ... it and of course that also plays a role in promoting healthy inflammatory response now kid needs can also be in trouble\nBecause you've had a scar a trauma you women when you have childbearing if the ...\nYou may not notice any problem with it for a long time even twenty Thirty years and then you start noticing that you have some water retention in the legs\nA demon and it looks like it's a mystery well it's really not a ... the issue is is very old or scarred drama the ... and now there are many other types of\nDramas that can occur that may affect the low back and in effect kidney has well\nSo what do we do to really give ourselves great help the kidney because it's so important\nTo our energy and our power through the day\nSo number one you can jump on one of our are really great devices and this is really important for the skin to visit device called a high drama that are very inexpensive and its handheld and it's a sensor that can tell us\nWe're doing moisture wise within the various layers of the skin so you can make sure that you're drinking enough water every day for your body needs and this becomes a much more of a problem in very hot climates than it would be in colder climates\nYou can of course supplement the ha and\nLooking at American food\nUh and having done this for many many years and having tested thousands of people I Would say that everyone should supplement the shape of the do ... and that gives you two options won\nA vegetarian option we call it the ha two hundred which is a two hundred milligrams of omega three fatty as it\nUh from micro allergies so it's the clean is\nThe least likely to deliver in the kind of attacks and here you could take maybe three or if you've been to fish in a long time maybe you'll take five for a few months and then cut back to three and our latest edition\nI'm ... da da da ... ... or any weird things remaining we've been able to clean this oil\nAnd so if you are not a vegan you might consider this is a good option a teaspoon of the day is what we would recommend and this guy is not only critical for\nGreat kidney help and just about every one we do\nEnergetic testing on shows a shortfall to deejay and so we know this is something everyone should be using and of course it's critical to the nervous system and the brain as well\nSo can we do more for getting the absolutely we've got a kidney support formula and this is of course live the stores\nAnd it'll target nutrition right to the kitten is show today will have the ha two hundred and or eat da da da boom on special\nAnd kidney support on special\nYou would buy two and get twenty five percent off each so give above the two are over the line and there'll be happy to help you eight hundred three Seventy\nThirty four forty seven that's eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven or eight let's go right to the phones\nLet's go to Irene in South Carolina you their Irene yeah same here okay and how old the woman to you and how much the way\nAnd I weigh like ...\nOkay well the first thing you want to know when you're pregnant is that you want to avoid any kind of chemical exposure\nAnd that's quite a trick when you look at our food because we've had an ever escalating amount of persistent organic pollutants entering our food supply so\nWhat do we do about that well step number one when you eat your main meal it'd take a couple of capsules of something called dragon cleanse LAX\nAnd this is a calcium aluminum silly kick clay it never leaves your intestine\nAnd it'll trap up to Ninety eight percent of all the weird pops that may be in your food\nAnd may have been cleared some of them from your body as well over time that's step one step too if you really want the best healthiest kitten town you've got to supplement with an in my opinion a vegetarian form of the ...\nAnd maybe taking five of these have your main meal which hopefully could become lunch because it will be so much easier on you how far along are you in your pregnancy can we\nCut right so these are minimum things now you're going to probably need iron and I'm very opposed to eating white flour during the period of the pregnancy because it's got rock forms of\nOf iron and you don't want an iron supplement the ferrets humor right that's junk if you do need the air and we have a very gentle form of iron that's very low potency but usually can do the job of correcting um low iron levels from the food that's what I Would\nRather quiet I guess this is my first child I had not yeah and um now I have not yet I'm going to really want to take a vitamin but when I take in Lakewood farm accent actually gag even more\nSo that's not what you need when you have the ... your spleen is on your husband's wrong it gets in half\nThe the nausea is induced by the spleen being able to make enough red cells for the demand of the fetus so what you need to go on to something called adrenal support\nAnd to at your ... at your body weight you need between six or eight capsules at breakfast that should within a day or to stop the nausea okay and you would you it\nIt can have a history of like you know that I had a vitamin\nThat could be another issue because it's beat six that keeps the um cholesterol and suspension\nIn the ... so that's why if you go on gall bladder PG it contains that but that's a liquid with little alcohol I wouldn't recommend that the ... I Would recommend that you take perhaps fifty milligrams of straight B six\nThat you can take as a capsule and that should help that be nice to put you on God let us support but I\nI don't like the alcohol during the pregnancy\nDiet wise this becomes a very big deal\nI think that the research now really support shifting away from animal products shifting away from meat fish poultry eggs and dairy products and in particular shifting away from foods made with refined oils\nYou can get a free copy of the battlefield diet go to the last page it's got a resource list watched some of the videos with your husband and I think you'll see the motivation to to shift and shift\nTo the diet that's recommended where you can occasionally eat this or that I think you'll still need that occasional kick possibly if you used to red meat of eating a little red meat so these are basic things there's much more that you can do I think once you get on the adrenal support\nSo one of the things that I Would encourage you to do is begin some moderate exercise\nOr that may mean just a twenty minute brisk walk daily with no glasses out in sunlight that would be a wonderful start and then from that begins some moderate stretching exercises\nAs far as the bruises go the first thing I Would do is get on some kid needs support\nAnd at your age can wait about three for me all the other thing I Would do is make sure you're not eating any cooked food without taking digestive support like quantum digest you would need about two of those at the start of the main meal\nFor the end of the meal about two or even three detained ...\nAnd if you're really smart one hydro clerk acid activated we called HDL activated and now you that just a more like in your twenties\nAnd you may at this point need to get on some probiotic like our ... support and maybe to two of those and swallow to\nTo get a reset for the good bacteria for your gut and elsewhere because the killer for most people at your age is you can't adjust your food anymore\nAnd so the running food inundated delivered when it over loads deliver the waste products dumping the bloodstream and then of course they overload the kidney\nAnd that's almost for sure that linked to your weird bruises OK Joanna\nYeah OK secure and\nGive a bus driver would align there'll be happy to help you find them [noise]\nAll right we're almost out of time that we're just going to take a little break actually and I'll be back in one minute so just hang in there feel free to call in with your question [noise]\nDo the medical community can't find out what's wrong with you\nDr might dealing account um health and lobbying doctor who believe in finding in front of a pain in the nation\nMagazine one at the top twenty seven of us especially liking and count on line ...\n... a practitioner combined multiple credit card after hearing of life and I think he's including ... national supply can be\nPretty late and I can't be content chiropractic her life fabricating combination for life can able to help me no other chronic as she got tickling now seven four five six Ninety wind ...\n...

old woman are you and how much do you weigh about a hundred and Ninety\nWell the first thing that you want to know\nThat cause you're approaching the age where\nYou can't just hardly anything in the way of cooked food so obviously your first step to reducing the irritation in the intestine is to make sure you can digest your food\nShow you would get on one of them died just to maybe take a couple of those at the start of the meal\nThe end of the meal about for between ... and now you're digesting more like you did in your twenties and this shouldn't be any rotting food\nHitting the got them but the next step we have to look at is certain foods are more irritating than others corn is one of those super irritated his show you'd want to get rid of corn and you'll want to add\nVitamin D three or we call it the three gold and maybe about six drops of this\nIn about one ounce of water\nAnd you would mix in that about four drops of lime and then now that's an essential oil of orange\nAnd it will most if I the D threes so you mix it really good in the water and you see the big droplets of the three become tiny tiny now you know no matter what the state of your gall bladder you're going to absorb this this has been shown to promote\nThe best response to all of the\nKnown immune fractions two hundred plus immune fractions of body makes and it has been shown to be very helpful for all new coach to\nAnd this is wonderful for promoting healthy immune response which you don't have right now and the other guy is ... from\nHere you can get some capsules take maybe about\nFour per meal and this is a stand in immune system so the first thing it does is it provides human activity ...\nTo handle the first line of defense on the intestine so it's bears your immune system to deal with these other issues okay so this is a great simple thing you can do and you should have these around anyway in case you need them so it's\nReally really a great thing to do\nOkay go

Glenn\nAnd given enough time twenty thirty forty years those independents fields could destroy the or going to land to which they reflects so\nThey can mud back that area fix the problem\nAnd a symbol full of nutrition can outperform a wheelbarrow full before so give a bus to the ... there'll be happy to help you\nWith the names of some practitioners in your area the older one eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven All right this is Dr Bob Marshall pitch to this is helpful in line\nAt school right back to the phones\nLet's go to Julie in Irvine, California and she has got\nSome problems with the thumb and ribs there in really doesn't want to have ... soon shots surgery are you there Julie how about your welcome how old woman or you know how much do you weigh\nAnd one twelve very very young to have this sort of problem it was it spawned by an injury a blow a fall or what\nI Know it's too much to say I got the information going on trying to change it and I don't want to take all the fed 'em\nWell the first thing you need to know is that it's almost sure that you've got an interference field a scar trauma or blow maybe you fell hard on the wrist as a small child or\nAdolescent and that's what's blocking in building this problem in other words the other side is just fine but you're not using it the same [noise]\nUh I don't believe that moving your mouse will ever do it I'm you know twice your age and I moved ... miles for a million times but I Will tell you that I grew up in New York where a pastime was fighting and my wrists were a mess I must have done\nSo many many mud packs on both of my wrist to get them to show their pain free and that they work the way that is supposed to but you could do the same thing instead of hitting something or someone\nBy falling down and I'd be looking hard at that and especially when it's only one hand and the other hand seems to be pretty good and I think you're right though that a surgery and cortisone shots\nThese are going to treat your symptom you need to get to the cause show a couple of things that you can take\nThat promote healthy inflammatory response one of them is bone and joint\nAnd at your body size maybe three per meal will be plenty and then a vegetarian da da da da da du hundred\nAnd taking maybe ten of those at your main meal you can choose them spit out the capsule it tastes good but you'd be taking it with you know food that had protein like beans and rice or whatever else you're eating okay\nAnd that or to make a big difference reducing foods that are pro inflammatory like\nEliminating eggs eliminating poultry and restricting red meat to may be a red meat or fish to know more than once per day and also dairy you have to restrict dairy because all of those are pro inflammatory\nNow if they think\nWill and you just um it's time for you to love that body a little bit better and make some changes and I think that by making those changes the worst guy in town is going to be ... the next runner up his poultry and the next runner up is dairy\nShow those guys give them a Ninety day holiday I think you may have a new lease on\nLife okay thank you could take care

skilled will pay it doesn't work for everybody nothing does but it works very well when the patient has chosen chosen adequately\nAnd um you know the right patients for the right treatment is really what we're talking about the right treatment for the right patient\nSo be careful who you choose to do this work there are very few of us that have been doing it for a long time um a lot of guys go to a workshop and ah they learn how to do it in a day or a couple of days and that's not how all this stuff works it's a pretty complex [noise]\nUh fortunately I'm I've been doing this since my residency at UCLA and physical medicine rehab and that was my gosh I think I graduated a did more than Twenty years ago so I've been doing this work for Twenty years\nI Do it because it worked on me someone did my risk to yield fifty percent overnight started I'm trying it on my patience with great success and then I did my shoulder that healed up literally twelve hours later I woke up in the morning completely pain free\nAnd since then I have done my elbows what else have I done I've done both my knees or the other people do my neck and back 'cause I Can't reach back there and I don't like injecting myself with mirrors um I had broken ribs and the back I did those with\nThis fall with very very good success so needed anything else to say before a take some questions that I have here\n[noise] yeah I just want to remind people that you can call all our long at one eight six six eight seven zero five seven five two\nAnd please call now because the hour goes quickly and we catch up with calls at the end of the program and I don't want to run out of time I want you to have ample time to speak to a doctor Darryl that your particular pain so please do call now early in the hour we really would appreciate that\n[noise] um also my phone number at my office in case you do want to call there and find out if\nMy insurance that covers you because we do take Medicare signal at no Blue Cross Blue Shield and United healthcare and for those people without insurance we can take care credits a credit card we can help you get for medical procedures\nUm these insurances don't even though we take it and then maybe yours you may have some kind of a some policy that doesn't cover you for your first visit\nA but most too and uh we have to be careful also to let you know the most regenerative medicine procedures that's using ... themselves are not covered by health insurance but your initial office says it could be\nAnd that's a shame it's changing but uh the orthopedic surgeons still are controlling the playing field and they don't really believe in this kind of medicine that's too bad because why have surgery when you can just get a quick injection and walk out\nSo I've been on the white horse of saving people from surgery for many many many years and ah this work then we need to work than you did your neck many years ago you've been good since then\nYeah twice actually answered myself for years later\nYou know that can happen I'm also I'd like to just mention that um my wife Michelle Darrow does the fast\nHigher facelift which is injecting cells from the body into the face to re grow the college and in the face and make you look younger and one last item before I get to questions is that we have a diet in the office that's called ideal protein\nAnd please don't get angry with me if I ask you to lose weight because if you have lower extremity paying them let's say arthritis in your near your hip for your feet or something like that it's often the all the extra weight that causes that that's been studied\nAnd um it's not my fault that that's the way it works and if you don't want to lose weight that's okay but it sure can help get rid of your pain and stop the process of the deterioration in the joints than those tendons and ligaments [noise]\nUm so if you want to get to my office I'm going to give you the phone number or a couple of times get your pencil and write it down\nIt's eight hundred three hundred Ninety three hundred eight hundred three hundred Ninety three hundred thirty people by the phones right now you can call anytime you like\nIf the if the people are busy just leave your name and phone and they'll call you right back [noise] and you can get it they'll do an insurance verification for you on the spot so my first question that I have waiting for me let's see okay it says growing this is an email\nOr by the way anytime you want to email me go to the website\nWhich is W. W. W. dot L. A. stems cells dot com L. A. stem cells dot com\nAnd on every page there is a slot where you can email me questions and the website does have videos of me doing the procedures he can watch and see if it's something you think you might want to do [noise]\nAll right so this person says\nI have been dealing with the growing injury in my left leg for nearly nine weeks because of this injury [noise]\nThe ... the demon in this leg has gotten much worse these two problems have caused me a great deal of discomfort is there any way stem cell therapy could help me [noise] will most growing the injuries are really attend tonight as soon as we speak\nThe had ducked or muscle which is the one in the middle of your thigh comes up and inserts on the ... bone and that's a spot that we can inject and get rid of these growing injuries and some people call them the sports hernia it's not really a hernia\nBut it is something that could be very painful [noise] the information about the Olympic team I I don't know with this person has going on [noise]\nI emailed them back and I haven't got no response you know sometimes lymph ... diem a is just a swelling in in the arms and legs\nAnd it can come from many different issues which I'm not going to get into on the show\nBut the way if you're listening um when you get my way to go you already got it but uh please respond and I'll get to with more information about from emphysema if I can help you with that because there are things you can do\nTo assist that also so yes the answer is we could use stem cell therapy or just pure Pete to heal the groin injury\nAnd I'm very simple to do that just like most things in the body and people say does this work all over the body and the answer is yes we can regenerate tissue pretty much anywhere in the body\nNow I don't do I. V. stem cells or clinics around that do that but the FDA does not approve of it\nAnd I don't want to lose my license I Love my license I have three more girls to put through college [laughter]\nAnd uh so I Try to stay on the safe side and use this these procedures only for orthopedics [noise] I don't use stem cells from fat I don't use them out of a bottle of whether or not really a you know you can call in stem cells but they're dead [noise]\nSo I Do with uh the way the FTA says it's okay to do it and they have a couple of criteria for that [noise]\nWhich is what they call them minimal manipulation and the other one is a molecule issue so we stay within those guidelines [noise] people say why isn't this approved by the FDA well it doesn't have to be approved because it's not a drug\nBut once you start messing with the cells that has a lot of clinics do than there is a problem\nYou can do it out of the country I guess but in the United states you have to be careful to stay within the FDA standard for\nThey many different ways number one when we use a bone marrow that has platelets in it and it has stem cells and platelets are cells that stimulate a healing response\nSo they're the first attack when you injure yourself that come to the area they form a clot\nAnd they start the healing cascade\nSo that's how that works the other part of it is the stem cells that are in the bone marrow that I use actually go to the area and they wake up the nascent or sleeping stems cells that you already have in your cartilage in your knee\nAnd they put them to work and the stem cells also attached to the areas where there's a deficit and they start dividing and they become the cartilage itself\nTo answer your question or do you need more science and that\nSorry to say I would think it is something that the ... has already proven that's something that can be done like and then uh I I'm familiar with that as far as ... for some kind of the other but I played it\nBut the the removal of the stem cells from the um the body and injection and\nIt has not been approved by the FTA that doesn't need to be because it's not a drug it's not under the FDA or federal Drug Administration guidelines\nUnless you're outside of minimum manipulation I talked about this earlier in the show and ... those are the guidelines\nThey don't like people taking it from fat\nBut the bone marrow seems to be fine with them so there's many medical procedures that are not FDA approved and don't need to be and this is one of them but you cannot who certain things with the stem cells because then the FDA says it as a drug\nSo we're not allowed in this country to do um stem cells ivy although there are doctors the do it I'm not putting them down for it they're experimenting in a sense with us please Pedro we can talk about this more after the break\nOkay stay with us Pedro thank you so much you are listening to living pain free ... and we're taking your calls at one eight six
