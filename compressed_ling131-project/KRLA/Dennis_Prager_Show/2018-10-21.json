just running for Congress reelection and the twenty fifth congressional district got to tell you the Democrats are focusing on California they want to retake the house of representatives they've targeted you and others in Southern California how does that feel what what since you have of what's going on out there\nA you know I Love my district ... people are seeing through enough a lot of the\nThe kind of garbage that's just a all it took\nA break the record listen the complements that we've done for district so you know we're very confident and uh but it's not comfortable it's targeted stricter no doubt about it and go and minority leader Pelosi has made it very clear that she wants war California seats\nAnd so we are more of a target there's no doubt about that but we fight before so never had an election or they just sing the night here it is so you know what do we know\nQuite rude and how to win\nYou know fact one of the articles I read about you said that some of the other times you've run people thought oh somebody else is going to beaches and you've kind of beat the odds they're one of the advantages that you talk about having\nIs that you are one of these Congress persons who comes back to the district Seventy times or so that you you are on the streets you in the community here in the local stores you don't make Washington DC you're home do you\nKnow we did a I did that mean trip across the country last year so that's that's thirty five weeks or so um that we did the tricks and and I said I Would do that I spent you know my house is in Southern California in my district or my wife said look you know strike here in in the community\nAnd more kids are here so I Will come back for a couple of Southern California um but that that was a commitment and I've done that around then people see you know I was I had Fifteen minutes in between appointment yesterday I stopped by bonds to grab a couple of times\nAnd the guy saw me and learning center there it's great I always see where they were in a in a park that uh that we like about you so you know that that's part of a deal to hear what you got to be able to look at people in your eyes and will do\nAnd say here I Am or your gun\nShy as we mentioned Democrats have targeted your district in others to try to retake the house how important the easiest that\nVoters get out to the polls and keep you in office what is at stake in this election\nOh there's a lot at stake um yeah we talked to a friend was and and people out there that say you know we don't want to be in office I said well you got to get your your folks to your friends your\nYour um Facebook friends at all that out to vote because uh you're looking at a corner me like you know ...\nAnd you know her climbing forty seven year that we actually have more young people to take the jobs we have a three point seven percent unemployment it's the lowest unemployment for black and Latino that it's ever been recorded\nSo these are things that we should keep going and the other thing is you know a year ago you would start a conversation or the or we're going to go to war with North Korea that's not conversation right now\nBecause of foreign policy that you actually work with its foreign policy but actually walking so there's an awful lot to look at and say\nBoy it so it's good out there but if you want to keep it going this is the way we're going to do it\nSteve night is with us twenty fifth congressional district\nGoing for reelection their soda article in I guess it was one of the Senate rule or the Southern California newsgroup papers that said Republicans in California have a tough go at it because\nThey want to support Donald Trump but they don't want to lose voters by being too supportive what what are you going to do you support the president are you standing with them or do you have to distance himself to win\nWell I you know I Do the same thing with a person that's in ... they're doing something good and what we're saying hey this is a great a great is becoming a minute's curtain or something that we have a a tomboy that we are vocal barracks to 'em\nAnd out and we get that where where the terrorists so newspapers are good though chairs of solar or I did that on to a discharge petition that building in Congress so\nWe're supportive and and if there's something that we're not only will make a go but\nBut we're always very respectful on just like we were in a bottle on the administration but in this administration has been very open to working with the issues of the terrible newspapers was was turned back very quickly and I think that's part of walking ...\nSo it's not a it's not a good thing or anything like that it's just to say hey I'm represent my district and uh and these are the issues that are coming up so can we talk about them and then very very open to all of us so that's been good\nCongressman night define your candidacy and defined your opponent what are the differences people have to I mean they get inundated with these\nYou know car just come in the mail and they got to sit down with their ballot and figured this things out in your most direct way help us understand the two paths clear path between your candidacy and your opponent\nWell you know I I don't talk about my policy what about your example of how it's going I I don't see my opponent out in the community and the community tells me that we will never see her she uh obviously good primary or so we think that she's doing that but being an outlet you Mary is a big part\nOf the record I sat on a city council and the assembly in the Senate and Maryland congressman I understand how a lot of the workings of government works\nAnd how to get something going on and then the connection to the community and getting something done through their one of the biggest items instead of Korea is the same exploit and it's been going on for twenty four years\nIn this last debate my opponent said you know I didn't even know what that was until just recently and you make a big deal out of it is a big deal it's the biggest deal for the community and they told us that over the last four years\nSo I think that that I'm not just the inexperience because that that shows by somebody who's never been elected into office\nBut just the I nobody can tell me what she wants to do what we've been very clear and what we ought to do was stand up for the military in aerospace veteran care small business loans are our priorities\nAnd uh and we're very good at it but we've yet to hear something from her that says hey it's just this is what I wanted to do what I did in Congress\nExcept for that particular to where I work with people or want to get things done well thank you so we've been we've been direct and we've been successful\nOur message to talk about rallying the campaign getting people out to the obviously the way it works in this is you got to get more people to vote for you than for her what is your strategy how are you how are you connecting how can you do this takes place\n[noise] so what we'll do a lot of things that are so many other campaign that we can talk about this because we're successful at it\nBut it it uh at the totality of the whole issue I mean social media has a shared all male male and radio and TV I have a huge role but it's also getting out and talking to many people as you can I just came from a group of about ... veterans\nThat I told these horrible safe you want to keep the stone you've got to get ten people and sold them coke or commits to get out and vote\nAnd they're not you know it's it's a little cooler than the last elections because suddenly up in such an impact but it still we're still talking heard many people as you can\nAnd it pressing on them ...\nSays what's it called retail politics where you you you meet and greet you you know she can kiss babies whatever it takes to meet people you're doing is you're getting out there\nAnd you're in the community and that probably has a greater value than a flyer ... lands in your mailbox junk mail\nSo uh we we absolutely who though because fires or you know learning to protest about politics\nAnd people get upset at politics after after a while but they trust the person on the person is right in front of you and they're shaking her and and they're saying you know this is this is what we've done a lot of trust and the politics of of all the nasty campaign\nOut work to some extent but they also work in the opposite and we're very hopeful that you know being out there in the community and talk with people and they just always being in front of people to build that trust that people will continue to vote and then we'll stable home or sex\nThis means when you when was this would be very powerful thing for some of the conservative issues or what\nThat is right it well ... what it really means as we've been this district 'cause I Lived in the desert we've had one senator that went to jail ones that are that resigned we really this is chicken what kind of been thrown around like a stepchild\nAnd it's really really really a shame on the other thing and so people always say why you do for like politics because if you and I do sit like this\nIs talk across the table we're getting nothing there and if you get up and walk away we get nothing that so it's very important um but on top of that we just I don't know why people think that this district is like this step child [laughter]\nSo what do you do it so I'm really excited one of the things that we haven't been able to do in this district is I I pulled in forty percent of the vote and the registration is only twenty that's\nOut doing if you have these plus numbers ... people all the people who do the odds and figure out how it's all supposed to work but you over perform live\nOver perform that's right and hardly any money out and we ... started the campaign when I send the beginning all all of us or whatever he had almost I can say four hundred and Seventy thousand dollars\nHe was the only one that had money or even NASA Delgado and her race that she wants than a million and a half dollars\nUm I eat a independent expenditures\nThe charter schools back to a lot and I have maybe two thousand and ... mainly some most of the self funded because I I you know I I Will be joining running time to get out the vote for money and I feel for how\nThese people and I could not afford to pay the volunteers that I have to do work that they've done and that kind of ours have given\nUp to what you need to have happen ... voters describe your districts and tell them what you need to do\nWhat I Need to have happened is first of all all of our side to get out and vote\nAnd those are the people that believe in principles and values that are similar to ours but mainly I Need to have the Democrats and the independence of their own because this race has really really him or do we keep we he's\nPeople that don't get it man you know it's\nReally has offices where people don't want to leave in office they don't they don't want to meet these longer\nYou know they don't they don't want to they don't not only that it's very negative connotation I Want you to be proud of me I Want you to hold up your head and say this is not representative I always say this is the building\nCome down and we have an earthquake I Am not going to ask what party here and I'm going to give me and that's how we should be politically my hat is or whether you're a Democrat Republican independent or

a decision on which way to go as far as selecting our next year\nWhere you know very when I decided to run for office a over a year and a half ago I told myself I was in a run on my character in my integrity in my experience qualifications but I think that what people are looking for somebody who's been there done that\nWe have the ability to look at issues and resolve those issues as fast as possible I think this race really took me down to\nExperience is that the candidates involved have the experience to run the fifth largest sheriff's department in the nation and the person I'm running against is a is a line level officer\nIn the Los Angeles county district attorney's office in fact he never did a police officer\nIn orange county he's never served as a law enforcement capacity with accounting versus you know somebody who's grown up with organization overseeing every aspect organization\nVote for for profit six will lead to the repeal of last year the gas tax now let's put this in context the other side's out there saying that it will be the end of western civilization if he repeal last year the gas tax but the reality is\nIf prop ... passes California will still have the fifth highest gas tax in the nation and will be in the top five in car taxes so you know the question that people always ask\nAnd it's a good question Larry is\nWhat are they dealing with the money we give them now\nThat's always a fair question and the answer is they've been wasting it\nAnd they've been diverting it so we should not reward bad behavior vote yes on prop six and a and understand that the bell label is very deceptive just just remember ... is the repeal of the gas tax\nHow's he doing because the other side admittedly has more money they've got lots of friends who are lining up to the trough to uh you know make money off the labor unions the workers so they're happy to donate money to run these ads that say our freeway bridges are going to crumble it's all about the children whatever they say\nWhat's the truth or they slightly had what what are you going\nWell it depends it depends on how the question is asked if the question is would you like\nThe rollback of last year's tax increases uh there's overwhelming support but when people just read the ballot label or we don't fare as well now my hope is that despite the fact that they will spend this probably ten to one\nOf bill probably spend about forty million dollars a lot of money or misinformation and you're right the money's coming from major construction firms who stand to benefit very very much of this by the trade unions who again they will make a lot of money\nAnd anybody associate with the construction they're the ones who are funding it\nYou would think that if you have just the maintenance of our roads were issue\nThere'd be more grass roots support for their side but there isn't the grassroots support is on our side middle class families who are suffering from a high gas prices and high ... car taxes so we think that if people and by the way the ballot arguments\nAbout labels unfair but they can't control the ballot arguments we have for example someone who was on our side who is a former director of Caltrans said the money's being wasted so I think if people actually read the ballot arguments that helps a lot and of course if they understand\nThat ... the repeal of the gas tax uh it it will pass it's going to be very tight it all depends on voter turnout you know one of the things you know you sometimes you don't think what this for example the justice Cavanaugh a hearing you have to do with the gas tax well it's all about voter turnout and I think\nConservatives are kind of motivated afterwards ... been going on in Washington DC so we're keeping our fingers crossed on that one in it and I am cautiously optimistic\nAnd so yes on six repeals the gas tax puts six hundred something seven hundred bucks back in our pockets most families if you vote no on it that tax continues I understand the way they built a ... index for inflation they're going to take more from us right\nYeah it's gonna it's gonna go up and definitely you know uh so so ah I just posted something on Twitter\nBut the price differential between an average gallon of gas in California versus the average in all other states as eighty nine cents or we're paying almost a buck more average than the rest of the nation gasoline taxes and that's just you know that's that's ridiculous\nI so yes on six I use another initiative proposition on the ballot you want to talk about what has to do with why\nWell one of them is a is run control proposition ten\nWould repeal it current restriction local governments from being able to impose rent control we are\nAre we are opposed to proposition ten because it would dramatically expand rent control and California and we understand that there was a housing crisis in California\nThere are all kinds of legitimate responses to that including building more homes or removing some of the red tape but rent control is just the\nOpposite thing to do it we will result in a\nLesser of housing stock and you know there's an old joke that's been going around among economists for decades and that is\nThere are two ways to destroy a city one is carpet bombing and the other is winning control and uh we we've seen the ah we've seen the ill effects of rent control in many jurisdictions in California like Santa Monica San Francisco\nWhere these very politically powerful regulatory board it's called a rent stabilization boards you'd be increasing\nThe number of these big bureaucracies dramatically and also many of them would regulate\nWhat you could rent your own home for so this is ... if you're an owner of a single family residential home building that prompt ten will impact you it will because it's again government intrusion into the price of real estate and the price of\nBread just doesn't work address the ad they run this one and with this man with a blue shirt on just kind of looking at the camera he's got a little bit older and he's kind of concerned about having a place to live what do you think back to those I mean there was aimed at trying to convince is that somehow limiting the rent is going to bring more units on line it's not\nPeople are not going to rent their place out they're going to sell it if they can't get enough to recoup their investment\nYeah we we we would say that he's he's correctly identified the disease but there's proposed his proposed medicine is exactly opposite you don't take poison the to ah to cure on the hill and this will just exacerbate the housing crisis again\nUm there are other answers ... removing red tape allowing more construction of units and we begin to see a little bit of that happening already 'cause I think even progressives have come around to the notion that\nCalifornia's housing policy is policies have been counterproductive and by the way many of the progressive social justice organizations\nAre actually opposed to ... ten because they've they've studied it and they understand it the day that it would hurt their interests of keeping real estate values are are within the reach of the poor and middle\nClass John Paul well this hour Jarvis taxpayers association he's the president of our job is exposition proposition Thirteen and Gavin Newsom you wanted to talk about something that was recently said\nYeah very scary in a in a debate with the Republican or a candidate John Cox uh the moderators ask Gavin Newsom directly she said a is a prop Thirteen on the table\nAnd he said very ...\nVery this made me very nervous is a direct quote was everything's on the table well we now have someone running for statewide office who openly admit that prop Thirteen is on the table and this is consistent with what he has said before about prop Thirteen so\nIf if anyone is concerned about the preservation of Thirteen um you've got to look at this particular comment\nAnd take that into consideration when choosing who you vote for for the governor of California that to a very very troubling\nVery troubling or a comment and I'm a we hope that if he's elected he'll change his mind or whether he's elected or not people can understand that the Germans taxpayers association or will defend who the death proposition Thirteen as we have for forty years\nYou know it's it's hard to think forty years have gone by because I remember the commercials that the other side ran that said if you voted for proposition Thirteen essential services will be cut by two thirds you remember that yes\nI Do it and my my favorite one is they hired a uh they got some economists think it was from\nUCLA sold the guy who was staring at the camera and he in tone with a very serious vote if proposition Thirteen passes California will be plunged into the deepest recession never seen will prop Thirteen passed\nIn the economy and California exploded in the uh in the early eighties so everything everything that the progressives claim would be bad as a result of prop Thirteen has turned out to be just the opposite end and you know carry that forward today everything they\nTalk about in terms of housing policy prop Thirteen transportation you know they promise to solve this stuff how good great high speed rail would be you know we've got to take\nThese promises and these representations by progressives who the huge grain of salt\nWell we've got about thirty seconds left if people want to find out more about how are Germans taxpayers association what can they go\nThey go to H J T. A. dot org and we are a membership organization two hundred thousand members strong\nOur strength is in our number so we hope people join an organization and learn what's going on in California but going to all the resources on our website which is an age J. T. A. dot org\nHi Lesley recap what you just said as far as the initiatives and props to vote for and against tickets through them\nYes on six no one ten and be very careful about the gubernatorial race because of and we even doors John Cox by the way because of our nervousness with Gavin Newsom\nAh and it's very appropriate that that that is exactly what the case it so we are dealing with a massive influx of immigration which if it's unchecked\nWill lead to the Dell Lucian of what America is right I mean if you just open up the borders to anybody well then what what country do we have\nI mean I I Know that sounds shocking to a lot of people who think you ... you should just open up everything to everybody who they never make it through like what will this do to your job for example if everyone comes in [noise] then uh there won't be enough for everybody else\nIsn't that simple Jeff I mean I mean it's a little bit like [noise] I Know candy store okay or any sort of food store and but you think of it like a grocery store grocery store has lots of goodies and stuff that that are important they're right supplies for fruit vegetables meet whatever\nAnd you open up to the door and you say All right come on it and everybody come in right I mean how soon will your store be empty\nSounds nice but did you think it through my friends who support\nThis notion of open borders right except of course Jeff\nOr the the open borders Montrose does not apply to their own mansions especially the limousine liberals right in that case they need security all kinds and walls of all kinds so it applies and the macro to them but not to the micro just so that you understand Jeff\nGot it I have to explain these things to Jeff is a nice guy but I don't know he's a little uh yeah that's a little clump they're All right by the way\nYou know we have a nanny or for our kids and she's wonderful ah she takes care of her house and such and she's originally from El Salvador\nAnd she came here legally she are engaged in a lot of effort to get a green card she got the green card and after many years I'm very proud to say that she will become a United States citizen on Tuesday and I'm so proud of hurts a shout out to her of course\nBut but she did it legally that's the point she did everything legal\nShe wanted to do the right thing\nAnd here she is and and Jeff you and I we accept her as a full citizen right she did the right way we would never say oh you need to go back to your home country no she came here we want immigrants but we want them to come here legally\nYou know it's funny throughout our time working together I think six plus years I Would refer to her affectionately as\nMara like download data Salvador right ahead max is terrible I Know but you know it means is down in ... the woman from El Salvador right and I told her that when she returns from being sworn in on Tuesday I Will I Will refer to her in English as Mara the lady from the United states\nRight now she was so happy about that but these are caravan folks and all the other illegals who want to come here on demand to to be a letter to the country no no no they ah they don't have to go through the legal process that are ... no no no they're they're far more important than her for some reason\nAll of these people are saying we don't want to avail ourselves of your generous legal process for immigration no no no we get to cut in line we are more important for some reason that everyone else who would like to be a citizen of the United states\nOkay got\nVery weird the whole the whole debate I understand that somebody wants to cross over the ... you know the country illegally I get it especially if they're very poor but don't tell me for for whatever reason that they have some sort of right to do so\nHigh that that's the discussion and we're happy for some reason and it's absurd it's absurd\nIn that same context of you know that men can be women and women can be men but but you can't be black unless you are genetically black and we can't be that if American unless you ... what is this [laughter]\nI mean you can lie about your age I suppose and then just tell every one this is your age right I mean what what what's going on here yeah so uh anyway next door is the murder of show you this is the a journalist who was murdered in\nThe U.S Saudi embassy in Turkey as it turns out\nAnd look eventually the Saudis have owned up to this final right and the people I don't know the New York times and otherwise it's such an interesting animal there's two aspects of it\nFirst why do we expect that this Saudi\nArabian government for that matter any dictatorship\nWould want to be transparent\nRight I mean that's their business dictatorships don't have open a media they don't have free speech and so forth and it means that they lie when they can lie they tell you that their treatment of gays and women and minorities as all wonderful\nEven though it's not they they call themselves the Democratic Republic of North Korea when they're ... neither Democrat a democracy nor a republic but who's who's counting\nRight they'll say anything this is what the theater ship to do so why are we so surprised [noise] we can prompt them for sure but the the ... the bottom line is it's like saying you know hey lie and why are you eating that gazelle because that's what lines do\nAnyway we keep acting surprised that liars lie that's the point I guess and they only fess up maybe if you actually if you have the actual facts to ah to back it back up your accusations or photos\nYes unlike a certain party is presently are the minority party in the Senate and otherwise right I get it anyway it's like the husband or wife of constantly cheat sheets\nAnd uh we keep acting surprised an angry\n[laughter] but that's not that's their nature my friends that's what they do\n[noise] the second aspect that wants to talk about is this ... guy\nYou know he's not a any what does it wilting violets or whatever I don't know you get the idea [noise] he's not a good guy he was not a good guy doesn't doesn't mean he deserves to be murdered of course not\nBut this guy was a pretty brazen only a hostile to Israel wanted the destruction of Israel and so forth I'm not saying that he deserved what he got he's entitled to his crazy opinions I get it [noise] but this guy was was not a good guy\nNot a third thing I suppose I Want to bring up is somehow the New York times is all a Twitter about their fellow journalists being a killed right and then suddenly very interested in all this\nBut never mind of course that there are journalists being killed everywhere in the world including Mexico where I I I don't I forget the numbers but it's some some obscene number of journalists had been killed elsewhere throughout the world but when it happens\nIn that part of the world somehow they ah they get very upset about it agenda to be discovered later [laughter] so just wait for that Jeff\n[noise] All right uh uh cause you Ocasio Cortez alright vis a vis congresswoman or would be congresswoman or what's the latest thing that she says a global warming is that new not citizens [laughter] [noise] oh okay I'm you know [laughter]\n... this woman is the gift that keeps on giving really I mean seriously she's she's something else now looking contacts down in fairness what she's saying is that we need to fight\nGlobal warming and the same way we sought to defeat Nazi Germany in the Nineteen forties literally right so she she says so we talk about actually central threats the last time we had a really major existential threat to this country was around World War two\n... said and so we've been here before and we have a blueprint of doing this before All right and none of these things are new ideas what we had had a wasn't an existential threat in the context of a war All right so it's kind of cute that she makes this comparison\nBut I'll tell you if she were a liberal back then if she were around back then she wouldn't be talking about the Nazis the way she now talks about in hindsight she would say we need to give peace a chance\nYou know many of the English and and western shirts and was like a soul voice in focusing on war against the Nazis\nMany of English said we need to sue for peace and so did many progressive in America they they thought that a Hitler and misleading well maybe they had they had a good thing going and do we really want to go to war\nAfter all they had a terrible war in World War one it was not all that it was cut out to be as it turns out so they had very little appetite for yet another similar war\nSo by waiting for ah the war of course ironically that war world war two was far more damaging far more devastating to World War one ever was recalled that irony\nBut you know no never uh never are under the possibility that irony will be dripping from the Democratic party one way or the other\nThat's what they do they deliver irony right down to deliver the sliver speak to\nThe Democrats deliver irony constantly every single program anyway the point is that I Need to to to talk now so strongly so affirmatively about war but she does of course talk about the threat by Islamic fascism which is a huge threat\nAnd by the way you don't if you don't have to tell me right now you can do all your research you can call me back a week from now a month now a year from now the offer will still be good\nAnd don't tell me about Social Security and don't tell me that Medicare is example that they ain't my friends these are wildly deep defunded and corrupt policy programs that while they still exist that doesn't mean they work you understand that right\nThat's like that's like saying uh you know giving somebody some heroin\nOr in order to avoid their um withdrawal symptoms somehow is a working program no it's a bad program\nThat you don't you don't deal with that sort of thing uh by giving more drugs All right that's just so simple [noise] same thing was Social Security same thing with Medicare people throw that out of me as if somehow that's a good thing anyway [noise]\n[noise] but now when my favorite stories Elizabeth Warren yes you knew I was going to get there\n[laughter] the people have demanded it and here I come\nSo Elizabeth Warren she she claims Indian ancestry but hoops [laughter]\nIt turns out she yeah she does that this is a DNA test which reveals that at best she has one sixty fourth Cherokee or not and I'm not sure it comes to one sixty fourth a Native American ancestry or they don't know what kind of what tribe or anything else like that but\nUh to uh one one hundred and twenty fourth\nA Native American ancestry again\nIt's a major stretch to even believe that that's possible\nBecause they focus not on any sort of DNA with uh any Native American tribes no no no they just decided to reach out as much as possible to a Peruvian area a Latin American areas but nothing to do with Native American or as we think of it a try so it's a very funny\nBut so it's a real stretch okay and it turns out that the average white person in America has doubled the amount of Native American DNA does Elizabeth Warren and yes and yet she so proudly says that the results are in and it proves that I was right [laughter]\nThat is uh what's the what's the Native American word that I'm looking forward to describe that oh yeah oh I Know it's yet I don't worry [noise] but uh I think the Cherokee Nation\nWhich still is around by the way\nThey would call it quits by as well I think they've adopted that into their language because they're furious with her but DNA has nothing to do with tribal affiliations they say\nYou can't even tell whether you're from the north or South America it's fascinating we'll talk more about this because it is truly interesting actually emblematic of what's going on the Democratic\nAll right when we get back we'll talk also about Harvard me

I think NBC or something and she claimed that her mother and father\nHad had to elope to get married y you ask\nBecause her father his parents were racist and did not want you know him marrying know Cherokee or Delaware or Native American woman no thank you and so they had to run away to a to consummate their love\nIn secret was not romantic right [laughter] fire fighting all the issues of racism at the same time pursuing love I mean that's a double whammy when it comes to the Democratic party right never mind that neither of them actually are affects the way to but that's another story\nAnyway so that was a damning of ally when she said that didn't wasn't it I mean it's it's plain and simple it's right there and video I'm not inventing this stuff it's not an interpretation ... that she said is it on tape\nTo say that's not the case Jeff you say that they're being relatively silent on it you say instead that that Maxine Waters and others in her camp or actually encouraging the sort of behavior and may have very well created this environment of hostility by encouraging it no you go too far Jeff\nThat's conspiratorial that's that would never happen Maxine Waters she she has a decent person and she wouldn't know what she All right I guess she did she did encourage people to get in their face same thing with Nancy Pelosi by the way\nThey're the ones pushing for Democrats to chase Republicans out and hound them wherever they may be they're the ones doc seeing Republican senators who may dear to vote for the combination of Kavanaugh and so forth\nThis is your party my democratic friends\nIt was never very good [laughter] but I'll tell you it's gotten worse and worse over the years and then to say nothing that they've gone socialist I mean what's there to like about the Democratic party honestly what is it other than they make you feel good\nSo strange not one single policy has ever worked not one and yet they're still Democrats\nThat's why they don't want you to learn history by the way because if you learn history I mean just imagine somebody blocking the way no no no you you don't want to walk through the store this this history door please sir a trust us it's all good [laughter] our history it's just fine\n[laughter] move along sir no because if you open that door to their history you would say west that's pretty uh pretty bad stuff that's a it's a freak show it's a horror horror show\nInvolving racism slavery and eugenics and the embrace of Mussolini and Hitler\nBut other than that they were great party [noise]\nStormy Daniels has filed a saw her defamation lawsuit against Trump has it gone bust\nAs it were that got dismissed by a judge and she now has to pay Trump's attorney fees\nOops the great backfire of twenty eight [laughter] it didn't turn out too well for summer Daniels All right now like she's\nA she's just this this person that is of not of no real consequences but she found herself in the limelight all of a sudden and decided to ride this wave as much as possible\nAnd suddenly the Democratic party and suddenly the feminists are all supportive of her never mind that she's you know a stripper and all those things that they talk about that they supposedly rail against suddenly she's a great woman a brave woman no less right and that's speaking of ...\n... Carter Page formerly from the Trump Administration\nSues the DNC the Democratic National Committee and its law firm ... ... ... over the fake steel dusty\nAnd this is a I Believe also from the get we punish former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page is suing the dmc for defamation\nA page claims in a lawsuit filed in Oklahoma on Monday of that from June twenty sixteen through at least September twenty sixteen the DNC and his law firm ... ... ... and two of the ... partners intentionally spread the contents of the ... to media organizations and two entities and the government\nYou understand my friends\nThat this crack is going to bring you down right Democrats\nBecause in a lawsuit such as this even if you are a public figure which raises the bar for defamation claims a grant you that\nThe core issue is whether the DNC intentionally spreading lies maliciously about him\nAnd you know what when you don't have a basis and you know you're you're inventing something that is automatically considered intentional and malicious fabricating stuff leads to the inescapable conclusion that there was some tension\nAnd it was beautiful about this Jeff is that during the discovery phase of this defamation lawsuit because they're gonna find out more and more about this ... there'll be into all sorts of documents discovery is is a wide open swath ... when it's a court system you can you can get anything to prove your case or your defense if the case may be\nAnd they're going to have to reveal everything\nAbout their game plan to fight the Trump Administration off is going to be a rich I'm so looking forward to this but I mean it's as if they're going to reveal something that we don't already know I mean we know that that it was staked\nBut you wouldn't know that from the New York times right\nWho talked about fake news to my friends think news ... and indeed\nA has been speaking about the New York times so Joaquin Castro claims on CNN without any evidence that Jared Kushner right the the ... Trump's son in law was involved in the killing of the journal is ... [laughter]\nOh man [laughter] I Wonder why he said that I mean he he knows that there is nothing to it\nRight I mean it just throws it out there\nAnd they're the ones for claiming fake news from the right you understand right we're\nAll right we have limited time so I Want to go straight to our theme and that is that it was always fake news the only difference\nIs that we see it more plainly now than we have before because we have we've got posts people posting things on line but more importantly\nPeople are being challenged just for example the ... thing that story had it been posted a long time ago there will be very few opposing voices to it they wouldn't be able to get to the broadcast news for example there wouldn't be the equivalent of what we have today and the Internet to to challenge her\nAnd so that's the reason why it appears to be more fake news than ever but in fact there was big news all the time\nDo you remember two thousand for what happened with Dan Rather than the stakes letter suggesting that up to George George Bush junior had skipped town and for the wrong reasons why do whatever it was that they said they were easily able to disprove it by way of the Internet\nThe power of the people and so forth and Gen rather not only was humiliated in the process but he had to step down from CBS News\n\nThat's that's the problem I friends it's it now that we're exposing them then they claim they dare to ... to complain about fake news\nWe were also easily fooled back then but not anymore the point is when you have a contentious society you're going to have people say false things yes on on both sides that's true\nBut nevertheless that's the part that's the process of American democracy you you fact check you go back and forth and if you don't do it because of the New York times internally well guess what outside forces will do it for you\nAnd that's what's been happening Dan Rather right Hillary Clinton with bin ... and Susan Rice and so forth as so many other fake news items like the ... there's too many to reveal but I think it's so funny Jeff 'cause you know back in the old days ABC NBC and CBS ... all\nHalf an hour show in the afternoon all telling the same news right and do you remember that you ... you would flip channels and you would see it's the same stores and I knew at that and you literally think that there was no coordination among them did you really think that my friends\nEvery night by total coincidence the stories were virtually identical to each other on three now two three stations\nAnd you thought there was no fake news really that's breathtaking\nBut it goes far beyond that it's the burning of the information about the Holocaust by the Democratic party right FDR bearing of the Soviet starvation genocide in Ukraine Vietnam and Walter Cronkite and how he claimed that the Tet Offensive was somehow a success and that our war was lost when it was no such thing\nThat anti Semitism or racism was on the rise because of Trump's election\nThat whole Freddie Gray than the ... the Trayvon Martin thing none of which turned out to be true that was all false stories proclaiming racism among police as if somehow pervasive fake news my friends\nThe email scandal from Hillary and then of course historically that Christianity has costs for more ... far more deaths than anything else but that you think that's not fake news\n... permission to very least or that Judaism and Christianity are are anti science somehow the church was trying to squash Khalil lay on his findings right that's what they think it's false that's what I think\nAnd the crusades was an unprovoked attack upon poor unsuspecting Muslims who just wanted to keep their Jerusalem ...\nEvolution you think that's not fake news there's ... there's no evidence that supports random evolution none\nAnd yet they pursue it may tell about you in the schools and otherwise same thing with the static view of the universe can now that that changed ultimately but the scientists or kicking and screaming all the time even though his son didn't like it\nThe latest one is of course global warming where you're not even allowed to question the the the mechanics or the tactics of how the global warming up through his yes came to the conclusion that global warming was real right\nYou think that's not fake news how 'bout that Israel is aggressor and six land grabs or that the last one I heard was that Jesus was a Palestinian don't you know\nCompletely different than the career before in fact if it weren't for direct deposit he wouldn't even remember the cash the paycheck so that small\nCompared to what he's done so it's okay to be working your whole life\nTo shift gears stop working in a place that used to matter to you in in a way that you know listen pay was very important because you had to pay your bills your kids were young had to pay for your mortgage your house payment today maybe your house payments paid off maybe you don't need it anymore so what do you do\nWhen it comes time to start living on your income so I Want you to think of two things number one it might make sense to take Social Security early at least for one of you\nRight here's what I Would normally say is the right thing to do\nWhen you're looking at the ... I I'm just talking about math number one husband and wife working let's just think of it this way\nOne of the spouse that has the smaller Social Security\nTurn it on turn it on as soon as sixty two happens all the air but what about look I'm telling you the reason that I Would do that is to pay off debt\nTo build up your savings maybe that your vacation money maybe it becomes your emergency account\nSo that when you do retire the money's coming in each and every month that's important that's nice\nAnd preserve the larger of the two Social Security's for as long as possible\nFull retirement age which is maybe sixty five sixty six if you're younger than fifty years old is probably closer to sixty seven years of age so you get to that full retirement age or beyond as much as age Seventy now that's where Social Security stops\nSeven zero at Seventy years of age were done in other words it's not going to grow anymore unless of course you're working and you're making a significant wages then it'll go up a little bit based on that number but overall don't expect any more increase in Social Security after age Seventy\nBut here's the big reason why I Would take one early is because when what have you pass away the smaller the to Social Security's\nIt's gone you don't receive anything is going directly\nIt's nice you still have to pay taxes on the money that doesn't change if you you know if it's more than a certain amount it with your CPA there is a formula but as far as the Social Security check comes the government says okay where's my check a gun you get the higher of the two and he received the higher the two\nAfter one person passes away regardless if it's yours or your spouse so the reason I Would take it sooner rather than later is because if one of your passes away\nIt's gone anyway you might as well collect as much as you can for as long as you can if you're just going to collect at an added to your two million dollar sitting in your bank well you're creating attack scenario that may not be necessary\nBut if you're going to use it to pay off some bills if you're going to use it to to finalize or double up on the house payment for the last few years to get that either way\nPath for car bad debt\nThat student loans you co signed for that you've heard of Arab said never tell\nRight never coastline per student loan [laughter] it's like when people say hey listen I'm terrified I have three rental properties and I let my son living one I said what do you mean why\nThey said well because you know he he needs and then he's paying rent I said never rent to your kid especially as an adult and he's not in school is not he or she is not doing anything specific why would you read to your child\nEspecially if you need the money to live on oh yeah he's paying it though I'd say look here's what you do\nLet them go rent somewhere else\nAnd if you want to pay that rent and go ahead right you rent out your existing home collect the rent give it to your son ran out your existing home collect the rent give it to your son I'm okay with that the reason is because you're never going to kick him out on a on Christmas Eve\nBut you're never going to kick your grandchildren out so if they're living in your home if they're destroying it if the rents go up\nYou're not going to be able to do it in fact your child doesn't respect the house and the maintenance and the care and the effort you put in to create a rental property at all you know that if you're in a scenario you know that\nMy recommendation is if you're going to do something like that you have a plan B\nWhich is I better have some sort of income coming in to pay off that rental property or coming in to pay off the debt or the bills and I like creating the smaller Social Security\nBut having that come in and creating that as an income stream that's a good idea but here's what matters more than all of that lottery your income now what is the lottery mean simple I Love it when\nFinancial a Kaiser gals get on TV and they talk about the structuring of the uh attitude of the way we build the structure of the financial with percentages and allocations with the diversification and [noise]\nThink they honestly know that you don't understand that and and then it's not your thing\nBut you see that's no different than watching some of these are professionals come on TV pundits\nAnd they use words to make themselves feel important so that you know that they are educated\nThe reason these people will use big words and not even big words as much as big concepts right you know the reason is because we're a lotta ring the scenario so that you think wow that's a pretty darn smart guy I have no idea what he just said but he said it with confidence\nAnd he looked pretty sharp and he's lucky knew what you're doing so well what form\nRight that was really the big problem with Mitt Romney I think it was a big problem with some of the other folks that were running for president you know John Kerry a lot of them were so using such large words and and talking down to you what did they meant to or not it's just what happens\nAnd then you have George Bush would get goes and looks goofy ... a little bit right\n... and ... and for someone like Donald Trump that comes along and says things that can well wait a second you know that's kind of what we were talking about the barbecue last week after my third beer writer he say the same thing to me and my buddies are talk out\nI think that's what happens is a lot of people will look at those financial professionals and certainly we want them to know more than us that's why we're hiring them or you don't go to a doctor because\nHe or she is looking up on Web MD the same things that you can look up\nDr this hurts hold on let me see uh this hurts\nTerminal cancer or a sprained ankle I don't know depends on which click on what what I click on TALK thanks Dr\n... probably go to the regular physician\nSo one of the things that I Want you to look at when you're ladder and your income is common sense\nThe reason you're going to be successful in retirement and through retirement\nIs because you understand how to turn on income from different streams\nDon't ever expect your financial professional to to make a miracle happened it's not their job\nRight they're not going to come out of the woodwork and say that ah we made a miracle happened\nWe took a hundred thousand dollars and turned it into two million in income over the next Fifteen Years of your life just not going to happen\nAt least nobody that I Would work with\nThat's how a lot of scams and fought to take place\nBecause a lot of people are desperate\nThey're asking for something that seems so mathematically impossible\nThat said before when we say less than a financial professional you're so sharp you must know how to take a hundred thousand dollars and turned it into two million in income\nAnd so people give it to him or her\nI'm surprised we ended up in trouble\nBut you heard us talk before with Brandon reef of the ... group R. E. I. F.\nReef law group and what brand name was talking about was the F. I. P. folks do you know how many of you called us and called Brandon he called me mid week instead of the week that we do the show and he said\nI I've had for phone calls of people that are righteously legitimately\nVictims of these scams\nI had one gentleman who called me\nAnd he I think we were already slated for another phone call in and he called out of the ... out of the context of me helping him with his retirement income and they said hey by the way or if I heard your show\nAnd I'm a retired Vietnam veteran and this and these guys took me for hundreds of thousands of dollars\nYou know look you want to find these people and punch him in the nose right\nThat that's probably the least that a lot of us want to do something when you heard some of our friends and family that served\n[noise]\nBut I think you need to realize that that's illegal\nBut the other day somebody the other day somebody said hey ah\nYou know there's a new elite isn't it illegal to carry an automatic weapon you know or or that kind of a gun out you know I think the we should know about it is it legal I said guys it's illegal to murder people what the heck do you think that matters you can have all the gun laws in the world you know all the scam fraud protection laws in the world\nSecurity when we come back in a minute or I Want to get in touch with you with Social Security or when should you take it you heard me talk about having a the the lower of the two taken out sooner but what if you're still working\nRight what happens to the money you're still working they take a portion of it back to you know that\nIf you're making more than a about Seventeen Eighteen thousand dollars a year or Seventeen thousand forty I guess\nFor fourteen hundred and twenty a month\nThat means that social\nSecurity starts to reduce your benefits what happens to it where does it go\nThey just took\nOne dollar for every two dollars that you made about fourteen hundred and twenty a month yeah they did and where does it go\nWell it doesn't go to a black hole when we come back I'll give that information to tell you hey this is where it goes and this is why\nIt's going to ah to where it's going look remember the Social Security is job is not to protect you forever it's not to give you money is not to give you income it's simply designed to do one thing\nIt's designed to make your life less than poor it is that old thing that the socialist we're talking about which is\nHey by the way folks it is not a it is the what is called the lifetime income or the guaranteed minimum income for your urine me tell you before what happened when they give you subsidies guess what happens to the price of things it goes up\nSo you create a problem then you have to solve the problem by solving the problem you create another problem\nIt's the same thing with the tariffs you've heard me talk about the terrorists before right do you realize that if you owned a liquor store and they were stealing liquor store liquor you know at the back door every week they were taken the employees were stealing a thousand dollars a month or a thousand dollars a week\n... hours a week at the back door new management comes in and says All right guys you've been stealing a thousand dollars\nWe're no longer going to allow you to steal a thousand you can only still six hundred you would say wait a second how does that her math work will come back we'll get to the bath\nI'll tell you well how does that make sense\nWhere does the six hundred dollars come from\nAnd why is it that way I Will come back
