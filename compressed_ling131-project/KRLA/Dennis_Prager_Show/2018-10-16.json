thousand twenty fourth but even at it's at its best to one sixty fourth you're not you're not that at one sixty fourth there were sixty three other things you are more than that\n\nWe're looking at me you don't think that's how the math works if you're one sixty fourth Belgium and you're sixty three sixty fourth English you're you are English\nIs that fair\nCorrect there is no guarantee the other

mister nice contest it's a values contest\nGod what am I like to speak to this man is Seventy one year old Vietnam War veteran she looks for heart\n\nJust this is does that does this gentleman and I salute him for his service obviously does this gentleman have convictions\n\nNo and this is not at all of the attack on I'm sure he's a wonderful man I'm Upset I even mention his name 'cause I don't know him and the two relevant to exist to citizen but he's in the times article so forget his name but does he have convictions is not an attack\nWhy don't you vote based on your convictions do you think ... ... does he think that the military budget should be smaller or larger right center is that a conviction does he think the ... the United nations is a force for good\nOr not\nDoes he think that Israel is the villain in the middle east or the Palestinians and the surrounding Arab states are more villainous I mean these are pretty significant questions\nNot who has a horse who has a heart you got to be joking where's the paragraph\nSo obviously ... okay who's traveled there is\nNo no I don't it's too bad she said he never considered running for office just\nThe ... said he had never considered running for office until we visited the United states memorial Holocaust museum in ...\n\n\nSecond highlights service I\nWas\nAnd good luck\nTo you guys ...\nHour of my show is called the ultimate [noise]\nAs many of you know [noise]\nI have a great analogy for why this is significant\nWill give you a perfectly accurate statement of where you are but if you don't know where you want to go a map is useless\nI think a lot of people have maps but no destinations so this hour is in effect the destination our bought one of the big issues the big issues have always preoccupied me\nIn high school I remember writing an essay on the moral necessity of the afterlife not what most of my\nFriends were thinking about on the other hand I Do want you to know folks I went to hockey games every week just I did I did leave a normal life semi normal\nAnyway the ultimate issues our I'm Dennis Prager and I have a truly a terrific guests man I have tremendous respect for Steven Meyer director of Center for science and culture at the discovery Institute in Seattle\nI Would you tell people I think it's important given that we're going to talk about science and face so tell people don't be humble about some of your credentials in the in that arena\nSure uh I as you mentioned direct is a network of scientists to run out of the discovery Institute in Seattle uh my ... and the philosophy of science from the University of Cambridge in England prior to that I worked as a geophysicist and uh\nDid a double math physics geology or science degree and as an undergraduate and I'm\nA written a couple a couple of books one signature on the cell and the question of the origin of the first life in the second one called Darwin's doubt\nA which is a question of about the origin of the first animals which uh prepare very abruptly in the fossil record in Contra addiction to Darwin's own expectations of a very gradual origin\nFor for animal life so your life has been immersed in science by the way just I've never ask you this and all our time both privately and hung or radio in public what does the philosophy of science mean\n... it's the discipline that address is scientific questions that are right at the margin of science and philosophy things about\nThe nature and a basis of human knowledge the what's called in philosophy pissed about how we know what we know but also questions about a new consciousness the origin of the university origin of life\nUm [noise] and these are the ... the topics that have always really fascinated me how did we get here how did life get here\nUm there's a huge scientific dimension to these questions but they also have encouraged to believe philosophical implications and so\nI've always been attracted right at that boundary between the two and you have to learn a lot of science to be any good in it and you have to be thinking philosophically to make any sense of it\nQuick combination did you enjoy your time ... really if you have to do if you have to do something is grueling as a PHD it's nice to do it in some place like Cambridge or Oxford with a lot of cultural compensations and wonderful people and the weather helps the weather's awful but I bought in Seattle so\nI was already not LA that you're right I never thought about\nHis latest book which he edited is a collection of essays\nAnd don't let the title of it in any way him into the is the evolution a scientific from a Suffolk Olivia logical critique Miller worth the stick revolution is\nThe attempt of many and in very good will people to reconcile God and evolution and this is a series of essays critic critique critical of that position that position so let me get to that the book is up the dentist Prager dot com\nAnd obviously I mean if you're interested in theology or science will find this immensely interesting [noise] so I mentioned see right before we went on the air that I until really I met you to be honest\nUh my my view was\nI didn't really care about evolution if it didn't bother me if it was true and it didn't bother me if it wasn't true I Believe in God as the creator of heavens in the earth the God of genesis one and if if God used evolution water why care it's all a miracle anyway\nSo that in ... in a nutshell then I I read you and talk to you\nAnd my wife frankly whose loans or a fair amount of his you know about evolution and and uh it has become less and less tenable\nNot for religious reasons but for scientific reasons\nTo\nTo endorse the evolution as it is generally talk show before we get to garden evolution\nI Know this is ridiculous in the time that I'm getting me give you a couple of minutes can summarize\nEvolution and why it's not we may be skeptical about well not not only we yeah you know they are but but scientists right this is what you were in my mind to scientists are having trouble with ... right\nRight okay go ahead so quick three definitions of the term evolution for orientation first is simply change over time nobody nobody challenges that there has been change over time or the kind of small scale variation we see in\nGalapagos finch beaks are peppered Mavs or a bacteria that acquire anti antibiotic resistance is sometimes called micro evolution\nUm second definition of evolution is the idea of universal common descent and the idea that all organisms are connected by common ancestry back to one or very few simple forms such that the best picture of the history of life is like a giant branching tree as part of Darwin's argument the origin\nAnd the third in most controversial meaning of evolution is the idea that there's an ... guided directed mechanism namely natural selection acting on random mutations that can produce all the new forms of life that have emerged in the history of life that produces all the change over time\nAnd that that mechanism hum is also responsible for the appearance of design that that ... biological systems manifested even leading evolutionary biologist acknowledge\nSo those are three key definitions the first is innocuous nobody doubts that the second is somewhat controversial the third is where do you stay with my second on the tree I'm I'm skeptical about the the universal common descent there's a lot of this continuity in the fossil record and then the genomic a patterns that we're now observing\nA but the key issue and the one that leading evolutionary biologist themselves are now questioning is the idea of the mutations election mechanism as genuine creative power the ability to generate fundamentally new forms of life\nUh so what you hear a lot of evolutionary biologist quoting now an aphorism is that\nA mutation selection explains the survival but not the arrival of the fittest explains the small scale variations but not the major innovations in virtue of that uh two years ago this time um I was at a conference that of the royal society in Britain the oldest\nIn arguably most August scientific body in the world they called a conference to a assess modern near Darwinism and specifically to call for\nA an a new theory of evolution many of the evolutionary biologist there were deeply unhappy with the idea that mutation and selection as creative power the opening talk at the conference by ... leading Austrian evolutionary biologist\nEnumerated several key what he called explanatory deficits of the modern version of Darwin's theory neo Darwinism that a number of the the the deficit that he enumerated were things that I had written on at length in my own book Darwin's doubt\nThis stunning the the Royal Society what is the ...\nThe royal society of London it said was started by Robert Boyle Newton was one of its first president was yeah yeah just reading about them yesterday okay\nSo they that's incredible that you had a conference on the weaknesses of the traditional Darwinian explanation where where\nMost if not all of the talks were were exploring some new mechanisms that could supplement compliment replace\nThe standard mutations election mechanism the odd thing about the conference however was that uh there were a group of of what they called themselves third way people they don't want to associate with those of us who are um supportive of intelligent design and that is a growing number of scientists by the way\nA ... but they reject standard near Darwinism so they're looking for another approach they have a there was a one group of those scientists is known as the uh Alton Burke sixteen and one of the scientists who was involved in that will call the conference declared at the end of this world society conference\nThat it was interesting but it was characterized by a lack of momentous nests\nIn other words they did a good job of critiquing the neo Darwinian mechanism but nothing really was offered to solve this problem because they rejected rejected out out of hand intelligent any sign and guidance any any any like mind or purpose in in in the process by All right for\nRises so where those flaws might be and then the issue of\nReconciling if possible God I mean this\nEvolution my guests Dr Steven Myers director of the center for science and culture the discovery Institute in Seattle\nAll right so when I hear you say this I'm thinking of all the ... pre eminent scientists of the last hundred years\nWho have believed what you now say is not tenable what does that say if you are right what does that say about scientists\nThat science like uh every other form of human endeavor can be subject to groupthink\nOr to ... uh or it can be influenced by prior ideological commitments\nIn particular in the debate about biological origins there is a prior commitment to a materialistic approach to the question it's codified in a principled on his methodological natural awesome\nAnd it says it if you're going to be a true scientists you have to limit yourself to strictly materialistic explanations for everything not just how nature ordinarily operates\nWhich would be quite sensible but where in nature itself came from\nAnd that principle then precludes the possibility of a ... a precludes consideration of designing intelligence and yet what did we discovered that the foundation of life we've discovered digital code\nA Bill Gates the our local hero in ah in in the Seattle area says the DNA is like a software program will be much more complex than we've ever device but where does software come from it comes from a mind we have all sorts of indications of intelligence um\nActivity at the foundation of life we've got digital code we have a a complex information processing system we have nano technology miniature machines that um\nAre a mind blowing in their integrated complexity we've got circuitry controlling the expression of genetic information\nAnd know persuasive Darwinian explanation has been offered for any of this type of complexity the integrated or organizational complexity at\nThe most likely all some aberration was born and it prosper because it was better than the previous ...\nA ... a a a plausible theory and the nineteenth century was formulated by Darwin before we knew about the complexity of life at the microscopic and molecular level\nOr in the wake of that theory of a a principle of reasoning was codified among scientists namely that we must limit ourselves to materialistic ... explanations of the kind that Darwin a promulgated and then there's the evidence from the Nineteen fifties sixties and write to the president has begun to stack up\nEvidence that would in any other realm of experience point to a designing intelligence that the principal of methodological nationalism has prevented many scientists from considering the obvious right Haitian\nOkay
