{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "President from God and former President Obama making their closing arguments developers out on the campaign trail and we're back now with the panel will live with nine\nDays killed them in terms of how do you see the rice as both for the house on the side\nThat he'd get when we really got that right now what's going to happen and early that have been really interesting to watch and hide and across the board that affected already surpassed ... nearly ... million people that voted early and and it's possible that some states will surpass\nThere twenty four total total voting numbers ... early voting and according to the next I set out to find that a lot of interest to question it turns out or they're going to turn out and we really don't know if they're still going to be silent ... like we thought and Twain sixteen or this or that Democrats meaning of life young people minority their coalition we\nWe need to point this out though because the ... mid term as often time as opposed to a presidential election turnout is low this almost seems that it could rival the presidential election and turnout\nAbsolutely and and ... again addicts like Michael McDonald has it turned out extra early voting turnout expert in saying that it's possible that we will see the highest ... kind of like ...\nAnd and I just want to say right now I was not around and I tell you for taking the show but I was a heck of a turnout congressman shape is\nA lot less talk these days about a blue wave a sweeping democratic victory particularly in the Senate wherever I think they kind of conventional wisdom for what it's worth is that Republicans are going to hold on to the Senate majority\nBut aren't there in the house a lot more ways when you look at the map for Democrats to get to it to Eighteen majority than Republican\nYeah I Would agree with that but I was in the house in two thousand ten when there was\nA red wave across lots I think some sixty three seats and there's no evidence anything like that it's going to happen keeping that Senate me meaning gaining in the Senate I think is what you're going to see in the house it's going to be ... going to be close\nA lot of local issues like water in California will play a key role in what's happening in those races there but I think the week after the selection of the speaker will be fascinating because neither the presumptive leaders actually have enough votes to aid to lower\nThe only talk about that we have to wait and talk about what I Do not burn our political areas not let me\nTalk about the issues because there seem to be several big ones out their\nHealth care obviously is economy is the image immigration and concerns about the the economy about about how the caravan and President Trump let me start with you know I'm going to go to Jason in a moment which of those issues do think has the most traction with voters\nOr I look I think um [noise] we're kind of living in a populist era and\nPeople are feeling that institutions are are are ignoring them [noise] um and which is why I think it's really interesting that Democrat if you look at democratic ads across the country they're focusing on health care they're focusing on on losing a the protections for preexisting conditions that might be one of the most populous issues Democrats have had\nIn a very long time and I think it is fueling a lot of these numbers Trump is being talked about a everywhere else Democrats are kind of trying to find an alternative to Trump by talking about health care and I think it's helping them\nGuys [noise] well I think are the issues that play to the president's strengths when they won the economy we just had a a reports third quarter three point five percent growth uh after eight years of being told to ... percent was the new normal by all the experts we could be on track to four percent growth for the year it's within reach\nSo that will certainly play because the Republicans and the latest Wall Street journal um ah NBC News will have a ... point advantage when it comes to people who take which party a says a better job on the economy I also think immigration plays to the president's strength and I don't know why\nThis caravan issue or why the Democrats think that this works for them it's simply play than I think to the lawlessness a that a\nPresident Trump has labeled them with a place until they abolish ice sanctuary cities this is more of the same and I think that that's something that works better for the present and then it does for Democrats so that to another\nAnd let me let me just interrupt for a minute we have a Democrat here what about immigration and the Taliban is that an effective issue for Republicans\nLook I think there are two ... of emotions that Dr voters in any election\nHope and optimism or fear and anger this is clearly a fear and anger a dynamic and a ... a ... election not a whole lot I I I think what has been motivating both sides in this election from day one is anger Democrats have been angry since the morning after December or since November twenty sixteen that has worked very well for them throughout twenty Seventeen and\nHas gotten to where they are now\nThe Republicans I think there was a bit of a complacency and then between cabinet and caravan we starting to see the intensity and some anger on the right and begin to bubble up the president has been very effective ensuring that pot and trying to keep them as angry as possible which is going to which is going to win that will\nFind well I I I think that the to the congressman's point a local issues obviously play a big role in terms of what I Wonder if that was kind of national issues\nYes they are the Kavanaugh hearings and the caravan have helped Republicans close\nThat enthusiasm gap but I think what what the caravan issue well this is a massive humanity headed towards the border this was not spontaneous organic and these are these are people that have been rounded up by activists I'm an immigrant advocates told what to say the reporters and and people at the border and\nAnd the Trump is not only right to to do something about this I guess a duty to do something about the very pro immigrant what I Do believe in a sovereign us border and and doing things the right way this is not the right way to seek asylum to America\nLook I I think Democrats have been using immigration to their advantage for much the past year when the president and his family separation policy was center stage um you saw a huge outcry and I think Democrats\nI'm wearing all to harness some of that energy and have been saying during this caravan a crisis or prior to me a discussion that\nUh that we need to address this issue at the source and and the president's better to do that has helped to add to this\nBy when when push comes to shove and you look at these districts the suburban swing districts across the country that are sort of the most competitive and the most nip and talk and people are talking about a caravan versus losing preexisting conditions which is going to be more of the motivator which is going to be more of the driver for talking about the politics of this moment\nI I think preexisting conditions is going Jane ...\nJason ... uh I I\nI what surprises me is ... the economy is going so well that you would think that this would be a no brainer that Republicans would run on that and the president yes he mentions that it doesn't really spends most of those time talking about\nHis at that and you've got about thirty seconds here that he thinks and and Republicans think people are more likely to vote and anger than in gratitude\nWell I think the idea that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer would have the gamble that Maxine Waters and be the chairman of financial services is something we talk about all the time there's a criticism the mainstream media doesn't talk about the good news of the Tropicana me and I think that's very real but people fail in their in their pocket books and it helps the Republicans going into the election\nWell we've got a little bit more time to talk about it and then after that's over the election then we can talk about the election of the speaker as always business is good these days ... say next Sunday up next as we hit the homeless scratch midterm campaign things are getting even more heated on the trail\nIf you plan on selling a home listen to the supporting message from rex there was no longer any reason to be

don't talk about too much but they'll get these interviews with the policy and others who really want to focus on going after President Trump and it's not about getting things soldier improving the country it's about challenging him they really have a problem with the president\nThey do and if you want insurance and investigations then vote for Democrats and your kids and the power to subpoena anyone in the executive branch and really shut the government down shape what you will about President Trump and whether you like the man personally or know what\nThe truth is we need eight functional executive branch\nWe need a functional judiciary and we need to social Congress Congress is doing nothing that investigating they aren't out solving the problems that they that a lot to solve and that's why it's so important is just the first time\nI've seen the control of Congress to show depending on what happens in California and in particular what happens in orange county and if that doesn't motivate the base to come out Republicans to come out\nAnd protect what we have and keep us a functioning government what will\nIs a matter of Irvine there John Waggoner okay walk us through the races that you're looking at him again is one of those times when you don't have a total sense on how it's going to go some could hang on some could slip up to Democrats we know have targeted specific congressional races walks into this\nWell as I understand it and and read the finance reports and\nShe on the ground to the Democrats are targeted all four of the ... says that touch on Orange County that thirty ninth district where you've got young Kim who has spent years in a congressional office working for ed Royce who served with me in the state legislature going\nUp against the guy who won the lottery and has a whole lot of money because he won the lottery show I think that's an easy call in terms of experience an actual ability to get the job of governance done\nPeople get busy in their lives you know when we saw politics like you or I Do but yet they get these may lose and if you got lots of money for winning the lottery you can push up more may lose then the Republican candidate\nYou absolutely can't and that's the problem they ended up doing that and that the voters elect harsh\nAt various levels of government to do the job of governing and they get back to their lives and when we do it right folks can get back to their lives and pay more attention to their families as they should more attention to their businesses as they should ... that\nYou do find money can can come in and can twist at election and do your homework as a voter they say it's a civic responsibility to vote it absolutely is I encourage it\nBut it's a civic responsibility I Would say\nTwo for storing the issues and then however you decide\nBut make sure that your vote is an educated one and I take some work\nYeah it does take some work in a shared this story on the air I was sitting in a little ... side of the popular supermarket in orange county\nAnd a couple of sables over were these two people deciding how to vote and they took all the junk mail that came in with all the flyers for lead them out there and they they didn't really know anybody and they look at one of them they go oh I don't like his here I'm not going to vote for him I hate to say that but that was out there\nWell I I think there is some of that out there I Hope that that's not the majority because I'll give you a completely different story that was somewhat nice to hear and goes back several years my oldest daughter is in her thirties now but when I was driving her and a friend to a soccer practice or something\nYears and years ago and it was right before they were old enough to vote and the French said gosh next year I'm going to be old enough to know what I'm going to start paying attention to this stuff\nAnd I thought well okay that's the right attitude to have and they'll look at the gender don't look at hair don't look at the makeup don't look at the tie or the candidate look at the positions and see if they make sense [noise]\nAnd the other thing I Will say and I sometimes get criticized for this but I'm going to stand on the sand on the air ... says like mine for mayor or city council or non partisan\nAnd I think that's a mistake because what that does is it takes away the one piece of information that everybody kind of shorthand knows there is a way that ... a Republican will address issues there is a way typically Democrats will address issues [noise]\nThey also fairly clearly will vote for party leadership when it comes to deciding whether it's fancy below sea or Kevin McCarthy who will be the next speaker of the house and that actually is a shorthand a piece of information that does matter doesn't make all the different\nBut I Would urge a voters to say you know I Am a Republican because so I Am a Democrat because I have the following values and at respect that and look for in their candidates those values not their hair not their color about whether that's a nice suit or not\nYou think it's going to be simple you get the information it's going to be accurate but I Want to share a story that shows it's not you know there has to be where a candidate to Lake Forest city council says her opponent is running a dirty campaign her name is Nikki ... she says the mailers have been going out painting or as a criminal\n[laughter] very shocking I never like I said never in my life commit a crime you know to to see that was way below the mountain\nSo she's never been convicted of any crime proponent sunny ... says that he didn't do it I Am offended to lie to share you I haven't had nothing to do with it so you got to take the stuff that comes in the mail with a grain of salt right\nAbsolutely do and what you need to do is look and see who is producing the mail I Do know about that case I Know Nikki I worked with her a little bit she is absolutely solid for that city council that mailer comes from some third party\nAnd they are not accountable we think we know who put it out\nBut you know I don't know I'm not going to say on the air but it is not anything authorized by the candidate show you know it makes her look bad but I also think that Mr Mubarak is dotted with Jimmy Heath ... with a wand assumed to be behind it and he's not and that's not fair to him so yeah these mailers or a dual edged sword\nYeah but if you're ... the damage is done the damage that who can't news report or Sunday Morning program where we're correcting it\nWas very very few people and a lot of votes have already gone in you know they see it they vote before the corrections can out\nLet's go to the candidates quickly walkers kinds of races what's important you started out with Kim ...\nOK right the two races in central Orange County the coastal one with Dana Rohrabacher versus a Democrat upon and there was a tight fight in the in the primary Dana is facing a challenge in my district congressional district forty five\nA mini Walters is going up against a ... law professor climb down out of the ivory tower and has decided that she got it on\nA on a progressive platform that means you spend it offers for quite some time now in and around Orange County I shirt whether she just a fantastic work\nAnd her opponent I only has a whole lot of experience to talk of the show that one is the other race and then the the fourth congressional races down south\nWhich is the seat Daryl I held he is retiring and show a Diane Harkey who also served with me in the legislature as many many years of experience is up against a a Democrat down there a guy named Mike lab and um and I\nConfess I don't know much about his background that's not my district but I Do know he's never held office before\n[noise] I just don't think he's raunchy level positions either I mean I've been privileged to serve in various spots for for several years now and uh there's there's something to be said for learning how to be representative of the people and train the keys over to somebody who's ever driven before is a risky proposition\nAlmost out of time real quick you because there are a couple of races like there was the one with Feinstein Jillian for US Senate where you have to Democrats what\nDo Republicans do well\nI I Know daily on on your program today and I know him as served with him and I'm very very disappointed in senator Feinstein's handling of the Kavanaugh nomination that sad Mr daily own is\nTo the left as Senator Feinstein and a hard is that is to believe and she is running to the laugh because of that challenge senator daily own state senator daily owners to the left\nOf Dianne Feinstein and show a conservative voter are Republican voter without too many good choices perhaps should take that into consideration and realize Senator Feinstein is towards the end of her career\nAnd your daily out if he gets in will be at started his that's going to inform eye to\nEye out of time I'm ...

and thank you for having me on well let's talk about the campaign you've been crisscrossing the state why did you get into this race\nThat's kind of scary you know it's attacking a symptom\nThe symptom is the high rents and so you're attacking it by putting on rent control but as you know from treating diseases you know you just can't keep attacking symptoms you got to get to the cause of the problem\nThe cause of our housing crisis is government mandates delays lawsuits impact fees\nApproval process the regulations this is the cause that drives up the cost of housing that's what's driving up rents and if you just do rent control you get less investment\nYou've have places if they tell you you can't recoup if this board sets the capital point where you can't crunched the numbers to pay for the place you you can't run it\nYou don't sell it and not only that if you have rent control and you've got somebody is protected in your unit or you as a landlord going to spend a whole lot of money renovating and bringing that up to have the money to do it or not only that it makes no sense because you're not going to be able to get an additional read for\nI renovated probably sixty percent of my portfolio in Indiana and the last five years\nSpent millions of dollars yeah I'm charging a little bit more each time I do it but it's it's marginally more people are getting a much better place to live and they're happy to do it\nWhere can people find you obviously they're going to see your name on the ballot you know where you want them to do a lot of people do this a ballot at

much Greg ...\nIs running for state treasurer he's here with us so how's it going\nWell it's a it's a real battle but I think we're fighting back\nAnd talk about the key issues that you're facing is run for treasure\nI mean this is an important position in our state isn't it\nYes we've got a state of a\nHere what let me say that I Believe that every nation in the world including ours has a right or a legal right to protect our own sovereignty\nUm we have um an individual or fleeing a certain Central American countries that are being driven by a couple of a a real factor is one is the ship climate change and displacement with regards to the ferocity of hurricanes you already have deepest trench poverty to begin with so that compound situation\nThe the human crisis even more so another major factor is the drug cartel violence or because of our large consumer appetite in the United states the United states is the largest consumer of illicit drugs in the world so they are torn between\nThe manufacturers of uh illicit drugs to the south of them and the richest appetite here and there and this vortex of this deep violence so regardless of what the numbers of individuals fleeing their countries coming to the north specifically to our borders [noise]\nYou know we have the rights to prevent them from entering the country now you may have individuals who are seeking political asylum\nEmperor the laws of the United states of America they need to be processed and the cases need to be vetted and assess you may have individual who do qualify for political asylum and then you may have an individual who do not qualify for political asylum and obviously a will not be allowed to enter the country\nUm so I understand those dynamics and you know we don't have open borders I don't support open border so obviously we just don't allow folks just to come in and to the country\nUm but uh we need to really engage in a better foreign policy especially when it comes to our own western hemisphere a Latin America specifically to invest in these countries so they have stronger democratic institutions so that sense of wanting to migrate to the north is removed altogether because there's no incentive to to leave your native country\nWhat do we do though now as they get to the border and the president talks about potentially putting the national guard there this is not a good story either way and how did we get here\n[noise] well we got your number one because I think we had a very a failed foreign policy at Washington DC that never really helped\nThese nations in Central America developed strong democratic institutions and this goes ... not just Trump does oh no no this is this is the way this is less as FDR that says you know the ... the ... brothers you know\nIn CIA operations overthrowing governments and you know having very weak democratic says to ... to judicial the legislative and the Democratic a lot of the systemic corruption of folks are just trying to make ends meet and survive I'm\nSending the military to the border I don't think it's wise number one that we spend\nYou know so much money of our taxpayer dollars to train the most efficient um lethal a military or in world history\nAnd to send them to the border with ah weapons of um of a military destruction to belong on the battlefield is a recipe that is a ripe for a potential disaster so what do we do that because there is that we have reports or do we ... we have a border patrol agents there and catch and\nRelease where you you you get into the country and then you can ... you sign up and you come back in two years and you don't show and he did that well they don't have\nAnd the longer that by now that was under the Obama administration right now and they're the Donald Trump administrator and he is removed that requirement that the requirement I should say but that procedure of catch ... way to say you can't you can't even come in yeah my my understanding is that they will be detained a process and then they will be a ... or send back to their native country I'm\nBack on a plane actually to their country of origin and not released in Mexico because they're not Mexican citizens or rather other ... to be more specific so Republicans\nAnd the Trump Administration says we need to build a wall we need to have a wall because big door let people in legitimately but a wall and they use this as an example of if you had a big ball any it could just protect the doors and you'd be fine\nWell let me say this is that we have a I think Republicans and Democrats can agree with this we have a broken dysfunctional immigration system because when you hear folks who have said it took me ten Fifteen Twenty years to legalize my status I said oh my God I'd be so angry if I were you\nBecause that means the immigration service is worse than the DMV in California that pretty hard to be right yeah I mean you have to wait that long to process that means you don't you have a large dysfunctional bureaucracy\nIs should never take that long we need a much more efficient professor who run agency to process the applications that Congress Republicans and Democrats alike need to move forward with a sensible immigration reform that normalize the status of folks have been many times have you met someone who says I've been here twenty five years\nBut there's no law for me to to apply so I could become a a legal resident of United States I've heard this story numerous occasions that's separate from what's happening on the\nBorder because I'm sure I'm going to jump around ... ah the Kavanaugh hearings and your opponent Senator Feinstein having information about an allegation sitting on it not asking him about it during any of the time she had and then dropping in the last second I understand you didn't you didn't really like what she did\nI think it was a failure of leadership um I think that's sitting on the letter for two months and a spring surprise uh at the last minute or was not the right way to do it I think when you have explosive information\nOr you need to have a collaborative um cooperative I should say that they should have submitted to the FBI or immediately so they could assess uh the uh\nThe value of the letter itself um when we're dealing with the issue of sexual assault a it's a serious issue it's it's a real issue that affects everybody\nA serious but there were a group on the Democratic side who just I'm with her believed her without\nThe specifics that you need in an allegation to make it we have some weight and it it didn't have the the location the date how she got home we all watched that and yet they were people who were with her I agree with her she's right he's guilty\nAnd looked at that and just how did that happen\nWell I like I said it should have been handled in a much more professional way uh I Believe that um the letter should have been submitted to the FBI first and foremost you do want to protect the anonymity\nOf a doctor ... for ... and her lawyers or should have told her that they could have had a private meeting gee seem not to be aware of that the anonymity at the confidentiality the privacy the safety of Dr ... Ford is first and foremost\nA most important you know we know that a lot of women conservatives liberals I'm agnostic to politics altogether\nHad been the victims of of sexual assault or rape or as well as harassment and\nNo woman should ever be assaulted are harassed especially when the only thing they're trying to do is is do their job and uh if given the opportunity to be a voice for California what I'd like to do is just take my values to Washington DC type\nTalked about what you face or you've been in politics she's been in politics she's been in that position for a long time or some of the polls seem to have or ahead your take on where things are\nAll of sudden I've ... I've been traveling up and down the state of California because I respect all voters are to me doesn't make a difference for you voted for it and Twain sixteen if you voted for Donald Trump or another Republican candidate during the primary if you voted for Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders I wanted to give you the respect\nThat you deserve as a voter as a constituent as a Californian as an American\nAnd that's why I'm asking for the good people who are listening to the uh for their consideration to be their new voice for new vision for new approach\nTo me whether you conservative or whether you're on the right or the left our children are breathing the same air into their lungs every single day I Want to create high wage paying jobs for Californians and put them on a pathway to one hundred percent clean energy so those are my values and that's what I Want to do if given an opportunity by the good people of California\nSenator Kimberly on the lightning round the quick question quick answer is yes no ... and maybe a little bit longer on this one a century state laws you were right they're offering this or from the conservative argument they say well that protects\nBad people who are in jail and should be taken out by ice if they want to back to the home country and this makes it tougher they use\nThat as your blurry and I'm Glad that you give me an opportunity because I don't want our local tax dollars\nTo utilize to force federal immigration law when we're talking about nannies when we're talking about cook's we're talking about our friends and neighbors now that being said the bad guy if you're a violent criminal felon he wanted a ... I Want them out I don't care if you're from Canada from Ireland Scotland or wealth I Want you out so\nWhere do they get the argument wrong on the other side they think that you're making it tougher yeah you have to publish a list on the Internet you have ice kind of show up they can't work together\nYou know they can work together that can collaborate together when you are a violent criminal fell and there's a huge list of the crimes\nThat you have been convicted for war allows for ... collaboration cooperation\nOftentimes as you know well in politics things could twisted and or you can define the actual reality because the reality is defined by the media and it's been called the train to know or by critics yes or no I Believe in order to support a bullet train but I tell you this right now I'm deeply concerned about the financial uncertainties or the train\nAnd I may be pulling back if it doesn't or if they don't show a a real clear plan to find a finance this in a very responsible manner\nSenator Kevin de Leon where can people find you if they're studying their pamphlets and trying to decide who to vote for\nUp Kevin ... dot com bust you know when you open up your ballot or there's only two names there there it's Kevin billionaire Dianne Feinstein that'd be honored to give you a new voice for California Thanks for coming up thank you so much it's an honor a mates entity they enter\nAnd who he was and what his background was\nAnd so they waited and waited and they hoped with bated breath\nThat this man would be some sort of Trump supporter\nThat he would be some sort of conservative wacko and then they would get to say what they said about that fake pipe bomb guy right that somehow this is a reflection on conservatism and all Republicans right\nThat's what they get to say\nBut it didn't turn out that way it turns out this monster this killer\nThis sucker deserves the death penalty in every respect God willing Pennsylvania actually enforces the death penalty it turns out that he's a ...\nThey made very clear that he never voted for Trump would never vote for Trump and mocked Trump in every way possible case so\nHe's your boy my democratic friends are you willing to live with that because what's good for the goose is good for the gander as they say\nNow I happen to think and I think I'm right now this is the work of one master it doesn't work it doesn't matter what his politics are\nAnd I would not paint a broad brush stroke on all Democrats merely because of this idiot but this crazy person\nBut you guys would you Democrats would and you have\nWhenever when it was the the ... a pipe bomb guy who by the white didn't kill anybody right was just having a fun lark or whatever just wanted to cause commotion but putting that aside\nWhen it's him well then it's all reflection on the entire Republican Party\nWhen it's this guy who does this thing in the synagogue well then it's the work of one Mad Men\nIt's but it's always this way they can't wait\nTo say that a Republican has done this that conservative has done this so that they they ... they could pay that broad swath of brush overall conservatism\nThey don't get to this time but if God Forbid something like this happens in the in the near future\nThey'll do they'll jump on it right away or you see this is the result of all that crazy Trump rhetoric they'll say\n\nNot that they know what the word rhetoric means\nI mean I'm I'm surprised that they use these words rhetoric right today is word of the day is rhetoric rhetoric is the word of the day right but anyway they will that they use these words rented like I don't think their base even those who rhetoric means\nPutting that aside\nWill say that Trump has caused this atmosphere of violence right you you've heard this so many times Jeff never mind that of course they're the ones doing it\nI mean not once can you say that there's something about Trump where he's encouraging people to be violent not once\nI'm ... I'm angry now yes [laughter] I'm feeling very angry about this subject because I hate when evil proclaims to be good\nAnd that some that somehow good is evil but this is something that the Democrats do master flee well they blurred the distinction between good and evil and make one the other\nThat's the end up civilization when you do that but that's all the Democrats ever do liberals but more importantly the left which has taken over the Democratic party\nThey blurred the distinction is this is a major part of my book atheism kills which came out I guess in November last year almost a year ago it's about the blurring of distinctions when you do that you and civilization\nAnd they do not just with good an evil they do it with men and women they do with justice and social justice\nThey do with the notion of right and wrong they do with the notion of between ... teacher student old and young every single distinction that you think is out there they want to blur and eviscerate completely\nDon't work at this rate will be next week's word of the day\n[laughter] that district [noise] All right but that's the point they just want to learn they want to destroy everything's upside down with a left\nBut here they are including Maxine Waters who who who tells her base go out there and get in their face in restaurants and gas stations in post offices for that matter and give them no quarter\nAnd she's OK with that that somehow is a normal thing for her to to champion\nBut not to be outdone Hillary Clinton says the same thing there will be no civility until the Democrats take over again\nShe says and then you of Eric Holder who says well when Michelle Obama said when they go low we go high I say no when they go low let's kick them right\nSo who is the one breathing the sense of violence and hostility where's the one example just one where Trump is saying let's let's create violence let's go get them where\nI don't mind agreeing with you if you're right if you have a point but you don't have a single point you don't have a single example\n\nSo what do they say they say well his rhetoric that's a nice fancy word rhetoric alright tell me where in the rhetoric which means words at the end of the day where in his words or his rhetoric does he ever say let's go get them\nLet's go hurt them let's make mayhem where because all they're focusing on his well it's the feeling we get what are you talking about what\nFeeling the fact that he wants to to ah to to secure the borders that's the rhetoric the fact that he loves America that's the rhetoric\nAll of their dog whistles Mr learn don't be fooled you know what that's garbage everything's a dog whistle to you if you can't do you don't have examples that it's a dog whistle the flag is a dog whistle somehow\nAmerica itself has a dog with these people are weird very very weird anyway you live by the sword you die by the sword my democratic friends my left the friends I should say you do\nAnd if you start playing this game where you say well you know this guy was a Republican who who uh mail these pipe bombs or at least address them to the various elite of the Democratic party well then you have to accept the reverse when it happens to you\nBut we'll accept to Jeff Jeff as ... is shaking his head she does not think so no no [laughter] he's a very deliberate men that Jeff my producer [noise]\nEight six six eight Seventy five seven five to eight six six eight Seventy five Seventy five to if you disagree with me I'd really like to hear from you\nKnow what people are afraid to call and I get a lot of emails from people are disagreeing with me and then they kinda rant and rave and then they don't but I think they don't call Jeff because they're afraid that I might respond to them it's weird it's a it's an interesting dynamic that's going on [noise]\nAll right ah but but then of course the big bomb the whole pipe bomb thing now [laughter] so I'm this is the situation where this guy addresses\nAre\nAll sorts of violence or stuff like a fake pipe bomb\nTo people like by going and Obama and Hillary Clinton and otherwise right\nWith the idea of somehow intimidating them as if they would be intimidated right they certainly are not so there's nothing to do this because first of all they were in order to things they were just that you might as well just a drawing pictures but putting that aside even if it were real shouldn't be a distinction I kept that migrate with that\nBut this was something that they so badly wanted and so that this was one of the rhetoric ... came in right\nBut they want it to mean when they want this to mean something political\nBut in fact this was a mere attempt to distract from the whole caravan\nBecause of exactly what we're seeing here the enthusiasm is so extraordinary and it may be even more enthusiastic now than it was twenty six team\nFor Trump I'd say that's good news\nAnd then of course there's the fact that there are far more people coming out in early voting in the battle ... battleground states there is a Republican surge there\nYou can't ignore that\nThat's causing the Democrats to flip out\nBecause the early voting should mean something\nAnd you could parse it out and say well there's a it's a different kind of person who does early voting versus the people who show up at the polls during a voting day I that's there may be something to that but I don't think that there's that much of a distinction there is a huge disparity between the Republicans\nGetting in there and voting and the Democrats getting in a A N and voting in the early voting it's yet another reflection of the enthusiasm gap\nMan I'm subset of Jeff\nYeah we're talking jumping I off line before the show about how I Am so enthusiastic he is so enthusiastic you know it's not just that our boy is in the White House and that's great were were happy that are pretty sad but we like this boy\nDonald Trump is awesome\nYou know if if it were Romney for were Bush you know we'd be happier than having that person instead of Hillary Clinton for sure but we'd be constantly wondering okay is this guy going to do the right thing come on get on a stick dude that's what would it be saying right Jeff\nWith Trump it's she's just getting it done and and it's less than two years he's done all the things that he's done and I I cannot possibly meat within\nThis the rest of the show or the rest of the next show all the things that he's accomplished\nWith Bush you know did a couple of good things sure you know he held the line with the Democrats but you know it was not that much of a distinction between Bush on the one hand and and the Clintons and the other no wonder if they have a love fest going between them now right weird\nThe whole thing is very weird we're going to talk more about what's happening in the country from a gross domestic product to point of view [noise]\nAh well they're talking about the caravan still\nAnd we're gonna talk about uh how bizarre new things that are happening in Europe how it's these illegal not to say anything negative about Islam\nAnd then of course our theme [noise]\nThat the Democratic party never seem to bother to look at themselves in the mirror\nAs a consequence bad things are going to start happening with them\nAnd they always it's already showing\nAnyway God Bless

I mean once again this is way past the be what two percent annual rate that Obama said would be the new normal that we would have to live with\nYou know he never said you know until twenty sixteen after which it will continue to grow because of my great policies right no\nHe said it will always be that way but now of course he's taking credit for the great economy as if you had planned this all along don't you know\nYou know it's funny that economists have pulled us our head I'm expected the economy to expand by three point four percent so we actually beat that right and then of course it just to help the economy and everything else\nAnd then the department said that the obesity rate show a key measure of inflation increased by one point six percent last quarter much less than a to point two percent increase which is great it means inflation has been kept in check\nThat consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of us economic activity grew by four percent in the third quarter which is the strongest since the fourth quarter twenty fourteen\nThis is all great news if you just can't fight this news to say nothing of the unemployment rate which is now I think and flows in fifty years and the black unemployment rate which is the lowest in history\nIt just doesn't right now\nThe third thing I Want to say about this is the Democrats are simply importing their votes here right this is they they can't get enough votes in America itself among American citizenry because the Americans have said you know what your full of crap\nYeah that's right they they recognize that the Democratic party platform does not work they see it\nSo the Democrats desperate as ever\nFirst they glom down to the to the gay vote because you know you got to get whatever votes you can but that's only three percent of the vote you know if that and of course not all games are concerned are liberal you know newsflash [laughter] I Know quite a few days are that are that are conservative\nAll right we all do\nSo that [laughter] and then you know they well that's not enough of course so then they go for the transgender\nYou know group which is you know all of what went on for thirty five thousand people in America so they've got Seventy five hundred more people there assuming again let all transgender as are going to vote liberal good right [laughter]\nSo they keep on dredging up whatever they can in order to gain more votes they just can't do it\nSo they have to important so they get these fourteen thousand ... an end to the extent let's say they brought in any amount of them will then by golly as we like to say here I'm In Brooklyn Russia by golly they've got that many more votes\nRight he's just you just do one caravan at a time right the Democratic party growing power one caravan a day [laughter]\nAt a time I this this is just the way they think\nHow do we know this because if we were certain that are Latinos\nPeople who cross the border illegally let's say we're going to be voting conservative where the majority were to be voting conservative I Wonder what the Democratic Party would do I think they will be suddenly be be all about border control how about that for a lucky guess\nYeah that's right that's what I think and I'm right sue obvious this is why they don't want voter id of course just to say that somehow it's it's hard for black people to find an ID I mean putting aside the insulting and and and how racist that is\nThey don't they don't have any evidence to back that up but that's far more\nAnd this hypothetical a thing that that somehow it's it's intimidating for black people to get IDs right said no black person ever [laughter] by putting that aside\nThen then how how is it possible that that you have all these black people voting right conservative or liberal for that matter I mean I I just I never understood that\nBut putting aside again you know do we want to balance the whole reason why we have voter id and the first place is to in to ensure that the person voting claiming to be who he is is the person who he is who who ... who with whom he claims to be right\nThis is a basic we do it for everything else but you don't go to the airport and say hey on Brecht Larry I forgot my ticket I forgot my id but to me you know let me on the plane [laughter] oh okay I'm not allowed to ask you for your ID missile or so please hop on it right\n[laughter] so I mean it's just not going to happen but this is the way the Democrats think\nNow I talked I talked about being an American ness to write I Am an American ... that's right and you should be to\nWhat does that mean to be an American is it means that I Love America and I think specifically that America is better yeah that's right I Want their Jeff\nI think America superior\nHow so how can I say such an outrageous thing yeah because the this American system of government is the most effective system the most freedom loving and the the the country that has led the world\nTo greater liberty and innovation thank goodness that without America\nThe world would be a far darker and dangerous place\nHow 'bout that that's my working theory if you will\nAnd not only do I believe that but I tell you a shocker Jeff\nEveryone else believes it to everyone is an American ... yeah that's right how do I know this because everyone wants to come here that's why they don't want to come to France other than to take it over right and they don't want to that everyone's\nFucking to America this is obvious right do you ever scratch your head and say I wonder why everyone would prefer to come to America\nI just wonder\nThe reason why is that they love our system of government they love the opportunities that our system of government provides for America is better yeah that's right\nIt's better because of a system of government has nothing to do with race has nothing to do with gender has nothing to do with even political ideology of of of any individual it has everything to do with checks and balances and so forth and the resulting offered to opportunities\nThat's why\nAnd everyone else appears to believe it so here's the answer instead of allowing these people to come in whether the caravan or otherwise illegally and somehow we have a duty to let them in how about this how about if we project our government system\nYeah with all its freedom and such upon other countries yeah instead of importing their votes how about we export export our values and our government system\nTo other countries well you say that's that's what culture centered right or chauvinist even you're wrong\nBecause they believe that too that's why they're coming here if they had the same system of government in Honduras and El Salvador and so on\nAs we have here they wouldn't have a need to come here file this under hashtags you don't say yeah but we live in a time where we have to say obvious things All right God I Can't believe\nThe story I mean how how we have to deal with this All right ah one less thing about the news and then our theme or apparently it's now illegal to say anything negative about Islam and Europe\nYeah this is from PJ Media by the way one of the most reliable news sources out there is PJ Media or as Obama once said the future must not belong to those who slender the prophet of Islam do you remember that Jeff\nWeird thing to say very weird odd the timing of it was weird of the time it just came out during one of his speeches in response to some guy that says something negative about Mohammed and such\nBut as PJ Media said they didn't like it at the time because it was a capitulation to Islamic terrorists\nAnd then less than a month after his own ambassador was murdered the president United States told the world pay free speech is great and everything but if you heard the feelings of these guys meaning Islamists you deserve whatever you get\nThat is what he was saying and this grows out of a story of a woman who said something negative actually accused Mohammed of having been a pedophile\nAnd what she did a report on him in two thousand nine and the government and she was silenced she was arrested and fond of course as you said uh what about my free speech rights correctly\nAnd the government said no not when it comes to Islam not when you offend a religion like that were not drinking with that and so you don't have free speech rights there\nThat and that's your that's the beginning of the end of your civilization if you cannot even question cannot even criticize a religion\nRight God Knows we criticize Christianity all the time God Knows we ... we criticize Judaism too but Islam gets a pass\nNever mind what the crime actually says right\n[laughter] I mean the ... says the Mohammed married his uh his child bride she was six at the time they cost ... when she was nine you don't call that pedophilia then I don't know what pedophilia as ...\nYou don't have to like it you may say somehow that it's that it was an exception to some glorious ruled there's I don't know\nBut to me that's pedophilia alright how much time do we have Jeff\nAll right so look I Can't really go too much into our team but I Will talk briefly about uh the Megan Kelly story this is the story that you heard about how she made a comment about the old days of Halloween the white person could put on black or paint on on him and be considered black and vice versa\nLook I'm a no big fan of making Kelly but I'm not clear what she did or ... or ... said that was wrong but all I Know is that she's been fired\nWe get paid when you when you make more money when you make more money\nWell that's nice that means you charge me a greater feat when you make me money so\nLet's talk about the other side everybody's happy on the honeymoon everybody's happy when they when they get a pay raise when they got a bonus everybody's happy when they\nWhen things are going well\nBut when things aren't going well\nWhen the when the world stage is confusing you you heard done it's just a minute ago it was very kind of him to\nTo say that to do that commercial force ah because I Want you to understand we have been telling you about this it's not a secret when you're at all time high just look at the charts as not a secret\nThat this was all available to everybody we don't live or die by any of these charts but but you're brokers usually do they they try to point out some real secret you know formulas that they have\nTo be very careful guys 'cause this is your life savings [noise] what do they do hoops I'm Sorry and then they go on and still take their vacation or drive their fancy car\nOr living their fancy expensive home but what about you\nYou're the one that's worked for this money\nBack when they couldn't even spell financial you're working for this money when they were chasing kids around the the junior high school playground now called middle school I guess\nYou were working for this money and sacrificing and for some reason when you the brokers lose your money they think they deserve to still be paid\nThat must have you with fire somebody who did a crummy job that they're\nAt their work or you would be fired if you were an employee and did a crummy job\nFor the difference is not about or at least I don't think it's not about how bad somebody is or how good somebody as I think it should be about are they doing their job and if they're doing their job great if they are not and then maybe it's time to find a new\nFinancial professional and I think we're good this is what we do we keep your money saved my job\nIs to find help you find an account that works better for you that include safety\nWhere we protect the principal and the interest we're going to get reasonable rates of return somewhere between zero and twelve that's about it we're not going to hit home runs you're not going to see twenties and thirties if you were in the market in the market that that maybe you would get that but not with us\nAnd it's one of the trade offs\nAnd our goal is to keep things simple and easy to understand\nThe client came in recently and said I said you know I had a meeting with my broker and went through a big old pile of\nPaperwork and\nEnvelopes and financial stuff and then she said and he put together this report for me I said oh great\nSwitch here you want to look at it I said sure I'll take a look at it I don't let's see what it is\nI look at the report and it has pie charts and\nBig words like diversification okay well we kind of know what that means that\nBig explanations about ah the volatility index than it used to use the word VIX vi acts\nThey talked about correlation\nNegative and positive and\nAll those things are wonderful\nBut if you're somebody who goes to work or who's retired\nAnd this isn't your industry\nWhat good does it do you to have a report from an industry\nThat is very focused on making you feel not that smart\n... what's the purpose of it\nI think the purposes\nThat report is to make you think\nThat you need them\nMaybe ... maybe that's maybe you do need them\nWhen I ask for her and her husband and I said oh did you guys understand this what does it mean what does it say it's because we have no idea\nAnd he kind of chuckled he he's a bit more quiet at least at the beginning of the meeting she was a little bit more vocal\nAnd she said we have no idea and he kind of chuckled\nSo what was the conclusion when you looked at this report he said after the end he chimed and he said after a looking at the first half of the first page I realize I had no clue what what the rest of this thing was gonna say so I just kept my mouth quiet a shot and and not it\nYou know a lot of this is about\nYour future\nThat shouldn't be about\nThe company or the brokers future who cares if it's the largest company in the world if you lost my money there is no consolation\nOh well this company and Seventy five officers and Fifteen states wonderful and you're still lost my money\nOr the the market is doing and you know extraordinary ... yeah and he's still lost my money and I paid a fee for that\nSo I Want you to to take us down to a simpler level\nIf you want risk you want a I'm taking a chance right if you want that\nSpeculation great nothing wrong with that\nYou can go to any casino\nAnd play the ... the tables are the cards in fact I've met some professional gamblers over the years and they say you have to have a lot of money to start so when you're learning and you're making mistakes you can go down to lose some of that but you have to have enough money to stay in the game long enough to eventually make your money back and do very well if you're if you have to go\nBut this is your retirement you cannot go backwards and make the time back\nI think there's some issues right now and probably in the next two years of not longer\nThere's uncertainty with the elections\nAre the market does not like the Democrats taking control of the house\nI guess you can say oh my gosh that's so part isn't it isn't me speaking\nLook at the polls the more the Democrats look like they're doing better like they may take over the ... I don't think they're going to take over the Senate I don't think anybody even believe that\nUh my prediction right here right now\nOf course I listen to a lot of people like you on both sides\nI think the Republicans will have fifty four seats in the Senate\nThey might do more it's a little bit of a stretch some say fifty two fifty three is the is the right number I think it's going to be fifty four maybe fifty five it depends on\nA you know a few things I think North Dakota's in the bag I think I Will see on the turnout how many illegal boats or illegals and illegal boats happened in in Texas whether or not beta do takes over\nWho who that is not really as it gets Robert but he goes by a you know Hispanic name I think that's funny no different than are\nAre wonderful former mayor in Los Angeles the ... right that's not his real name you know he had some financial issues in some some criminal issues or or are accusations and some other problems financial and just changed his name does wife's name made some version\nFriday just merged his his name with his wife's\nSo he's kind of a different person\nBut if you don't realize the sneaking is in some of these folks there but it isn't different\nThan the rest of the community it's just that these people\nI think that are running our our our government they don't have any clue in the financial world are they just say things\nTo say things to get elected they don't know they don't believe it necessarily I don't think\nSo how was it that you're going to take care of I think the Democrats taking control of the house is a fear that the markets don't know how to deal with\nMaybe it will do better I don't know\nBut they they don't know how to deal with it I think also the near certainty of another rate hike by the Federal Reserve\nThis year\nHousing sales are are slow look take a look around we have two people to this week come into my office\nFrom the real estate world one was an appraiser one was a a lender they were laid off in this last week that's unheard of\nThat when there are six million jobs available\nWhy are we seeing two people get laid off I'm just a little microcosm of the company right I'm not the entire United States\nBut I can tell you some thing is happening with the real estate market\nI think the near certainty of another rate hike this year\nIs going to keep the markets\nNot so happy\nTrade dispute\nYou've heard me talk about a trade dispute before as a as a way in which I like let's explain it but most people can't even spell tariff\nDon't even know what it means\nThe president of the United states\nWas President Obama he owned a store or let's call it a big box store Obama Mart\nRight Obama Mart is a big store and he allow people into that worked for the company in the back to steal about a thousand dollars a month off the back door but we were such a big company didn't really matter\nObama march sold lots of products lots of goods and services all across the world [noise] yeah you know we know those people are stealing a thousand dollars but you know they are poor and they're they're hungry and they're small and we're big and we can afford that\nAnd those employees stealing out the back door where people like China\nAnd the European Union in Mexico and Canada\nBut now that those people stealing out the back door living amazing homes by the way they're beautiful or big\nVision not wealthy\nThey may not be as wealthy as Obama Mart\nBut the United states is much wealthier than Canada so there's a guilt right when you have guilt\nSo these are important things when the big depression or or you know the Nineteen oh seven bank\n... most people didn't have money in the back most people weren't in the stock market it was the very few the wealthy\nSo when when you received word that hey the banks were collapsing and you're like God doesn't matter we got a ... you know ... forty\nWe have to plow the field we got a plant that whatever we don't care who got stuff going on\nThere was little impact in the rest of society that's why in Nineteen twenty nine\nWhen the clocks came\nThere was a much bigger impact because more Americans now thought they were smart investors and just put money in the market\nAnd the crux on the other side created companies that didn't\nFor many people bought companies bought stock in companies that didn't even exist there was no way to check it out\nThat's why there's a lot of regulation now and if a company\nWants to go public\nWants to be accountable\nWhile then it has to follow these rules\nThe reason I'm sharing this with you is because I don't think volatility has gone anytime soon I think there's a huge crisis\nAnd I believe that the Democrats have decided I think they decided a long time ago but I Believe they decided that they would prefer to sink a ship\nAnd rebuild it with the pieces that are left\nThen to go out and allow the president to have wins the same thing that he's talking about\nEconomically socially more things that Hillary Clinton spoke about in two thousand and Seventy thousand a same thing that President Obama spoke about in two thousand nine two thousand time there isn't any difference except it's coming out of his mouth\nHate the discuss they have for the president has blinded the left media it has blinded\nEven some financial people\nTried to economics one plus one as to whether you're a Democrat or Republican it doesn't matter there's good people on all sides\nBut there's enough people out there that are allowing their hate and vitriol\nTo go in and turn change one plus one\nOkay well it all depends\nCase in point a male as a male why because of physiological resumes and a female is a female because of physiological reason that when the president says we are going to use that as a definition come along hate and and disrespect for the algae B. T. Q. XYZ community and you know and that it\nYou know if I was one of those letters I Would be insulted that you're just being used and abused and common sense is missing its point\nThat just seems like

five or so a one out of six depends on the you know whatever the week I'll say hey look I think you're fine where you are there's nothing that we can do to change or this isn't something that that works for you\nBecause part of safety is defined as protecting some part or all of your retirement from market declines how do you know how much to put well there's a couple of ways to do it\nFirst of all you've got to look and say uh if the markets or you know historically let's say it takes a whole I don't know\nFive years for the market to return to what it once was that's about right if you go back to last a Eighteen Fifteen Eighteen years you'll see that the markets go down\nVery quickly within a year or two they're down ... very low and it takes about five six seven years to get back\nAbove where it was just before collapse so in other words you're looking at a period of time five or six or seven years of income that you want to protect so you might say All right I Need fifty thousand a year from my accounts time six years four hundred three hundred four hundred thousand you just decide\nAnd that three hundred thousand is what you're going to protect that is what you're going to so that if all hell breaks loose you still have money available to live\nThat's very important so that you say I I'm not going to let the economy the market\nI'm not going to let that dictate when or how I retire\nWhat are the biggest mistakes people make them we're dealing with this literally right now\nIs people that retired in the last six to twelve months\nBecause they committed to things like buying an RV or a vacation home\nThey committed to things that were very expensive a high payments but it didn't matter because the market's up and they're using the banks' money and it's it's all gravy and nobody's losing in life is good and\nWhen things are good\nI don't want you to be looking at this and saying well because the the commitments you made\nWhere when times were good what do you do when times are not going to be good\nAnd we don't know how long this downturn is going to last and frankly doesn't matter\nBecause our clients money is protected from market declines
