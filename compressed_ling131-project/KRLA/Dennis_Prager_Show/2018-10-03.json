judge Brett Kavanaugh confirmation process the drama continues President Trump is just the last night at a rally in Mississippi making some comments that got him in a bit of trouble if you missed that those comments sounded like this\nThirty years ago\nI had one right I Want to be\nWell do you think it was I was wondering how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where was the place I don't remember how\nTo do and I don't know [noise]\nWas it and I don't know where\nWhere was I don't know but I Want to\nKnow those comments done have cars or an onslaught of response from Republicans and Democrats alike you have a Senator Lindsey Graham\nWho was asked if he approved of the president's comments he said no but he thinks that Brett Kavanaugh should still be confirmed Susan Collins from Maine it said that she didn't like the president's comments either but she has a reason to doubt some of the elements of the story provided by Dr Christine forward\nSo all eyes are on Senator Jeff flake from Arizona who is needed to help with the confirmation process of a judge Kavanaugh and he was a bit troubled by Trump's performance at the rally in Mississippi he had this to stay on the today show ... there's\nNo time and no place for ... for something to do a political rally [noise]\nRight right I have a daughter [noise]\nOut of a\nDozen fortunately the left has done a tremendous amount to do their own narrative of women are to be believed\nAbove all else well as women or ... whatever happened to the women that were a assaulted by Bill Clinton how come Hillary Clinton now says women are to be believed makes it and and when she interviewed\nThe person sitting across the ... the the way from her that supposed to be a journalist doesn't even hold her accountable shows women are to be believed fine how come now we're hearing from the ex boyfriend to Dr Ford who says\nGuess what for six years she had no fear of flying for she even coached a friend for ... ...\n... a polygraph using her knowledge of psychology training you know ... ... ...\nYeah Donald Trump may have made these remarks a little bit ... the timing may not have been right\nBut the the credibility of Dr ... Ford is unraveling as we speak I Would say yeah I I think there are certainly should pointing the finger at Kavanaugh what we're ... we're seeing through that right now she's not even sure a hundred percent although she testifies to it\nShe says I Am a hundred percent sure it was Brett Kavanaugh when she was also a hundred percent sure she had a fear of flying that didn't turn out to be true she was also a hundred percent sure of other things that are turning out not to be true what do you do with that\nYeah there are a lot of holes that are coming out in a judge in a doctor Christine Ford story a wonderful boyfriends from six years ago that was a boyfriend or first for six years from the Ninety Ninety to Ninety eight came out and gave a sworn statement saying that he had witnessed are prepping someone\nFor a polygraph test that matters because obviously if the piece of evidence that she used to corroborate\nHer story that she was the victim of his old I Would say down though that it's not\nAnd I'm so sad that all of this is it's happened because real victims are going to be ignored by like of all of these allegations that have come out\nI think women should be believed but I also think that they should be treated like adult and that they should be able to provide evidence to their claims now thirty five years is a long time but there are pieces of evidence that she's missing like who drove her ... who drove her home could we contact that person maybe after\n... named her best friend is the time ... says no if if women are to be believed why didn't Dianne Feinstein when she got this letter handle it differently handle it as if she believed that her\nAllegations were worthy of being digital why did she should on it until all of a sudden it look like Brett Kavanaugh was going to be good\nFor the ... the direction of the hearings was in favor of a of a Kavanaugh's confirmation and then all of a sudden someone probably from her office leaks widely incorporated into the whole process from the very beginning behind closed doors where she could have enjoyed\nThe privacy of this and it would have had the same of impact\nI I obviously agree with you I think the handling of this from the beginning has been a disaster it's been a disaster for Democrats it's been a disaster for Ford and Kevin ... who we should be looking at\nIn all of this and it's become a ... it's blown up and to even a greater story senator Joni Ernst is a senator who will have the opportunity this week according to Mitch McConnell to vote for cabinet yes or no and as one of

wrote that the press has become an adjunct to the Democratic party and that\nIt it is the noise him that the president's calling them fake news is true so I think he's half annoyed that they're fake news and a half annoyed that they're justifying the president like sit there fake news I mean it I think that both annoy him equally\nA buddy to compound that the entire top half of the New York times

the fathers of tax returns so that's the ... it's a very of really by if you notice did you notice my beer listeners how little was talked about Russian collusion recently\n\nI why might that be that was that was the dominant story from the election because there is no story\n\nSo they're they're now they moved over at the same thing with a with Kavanaugh the story is now his demeanor\nThat that's the story now temperament does he ever judicial temperament\n\nSo remember the temperament is based on the assumption that he didn't do what it said in high school\nSo he he died as a citizen and have a right to be angry on his behalf whatever happened in high school because of my original position that I stand by\nMake an accusation and it becomes the here but the the land and a front page headlines and there are are guilty by just public accusation and not having a fair hearing and not having\nAny sort of private process to go through and and the Democrats will do anything they can to\nUh have an issue come up and attacked Republicans and the the regular person out there Dennis I'm telling you it absolutely appalled that something like this comes up and and can be their son or

extreme liberal socialist party of Minneapolis and St Paul and that is not who\nMinnesota Democrats are so they are leaving the party in the eighth district up on the iron range which has historically always voted Democrat we're going to have a Republican congressman up there down in southern Minnesota always voted Democrat that's going to be Republican\nSo Minnesota is not a Democrat as it used to be and we we are seeing a real red wave here uh because they've gone so far to the left and they left the people not not who we are here in Minnesota\nI I just wanted to tell you what I see that every Republican candidate for Senate for house governor\nYou're not only running I mean this is on solicited advice I humbly acknowledge that fact what do you every Republican is not only running against their opponent they're running against destructive left wing party\nAs you just\nNoted and I I I salute you for doing that I think people have to understand as nice as an and I don't know your opponent but it's nice just any Democrat individually might be they represent a destructive force in America the Democratic party\nAnd they really do and it and it is a a responsibility a on us as Republicans to make sure that the people know what\nThat we really are the party of education and health care and freedom and they are the party of obstruction and that's exactly what my opponent Tina

I Believe that everyone if every one of the three males affiliated with the direct presentation of the show triple gee the living martyr and I have feminine sucks I Do I Believe that\nI'm sure enough tripled jeeze feminine side came out where he said he would like to get a gift not a gift card after I laughed at him for about five minutes we resume the conversation\n[laughter]\n[noise] did they have gift cards when I was growing up not only that they had cars that yes running water showers bats yes no no no no it's amazing even even automatic transmission\nThat that's amazing I Know I Know [noise] I Can't believe that question did they have gift cards while he was that held his that hilarious that gift cards no no they was invented when you were born oh my God this this\nGeneration we keep him around as like a sort of a a you know to stay in touch with what the with what the the new folk thick anyway one aide Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nAnd that is that that's the theory that I'm I'm working on women love to and by the way there's no better or worse here this is the ... at all there there is no such thing in this regard I'm simply offering you buy may be wrong by the way I I maybe I I think I'm right\nWell obviously or I wouldn't have said but you know what what is your take she and I I Know in this case by the way you may be curious I think I should add the ...\nAnd as your Dennis prayers feminine side\nAnd I sent it to these guys and the the the living martyr didn't fully believe me I don't know why\nI have no agenda here I I Know why he doesn't really believe I have a feminine side this has been a ... [laughter] no no no no no he doesn't believe I have a feminine side yes\nAnd he's wrong and I give you an example I prefer in movies I prefer romantic comedies\nTo slash him shoot them uh dramas where you know action to action dramas men law yes Ben love high speed car chases\nThe guy shot him and this and and as it does do not exploit ... explosions [laughter] explosions\n[laughter] that was great I I I I I turned to the popcorn vendor when the when there's an explosion hits it it does nothing for me but a romantic comedy I Am\nTotally enthralled I Love it I I Believe it I moved into the whole situation I mean I Love sleepless in Seattle I I was riveted\nYes I Know that guys have yes I you don't even have to turn it off that's right triple ... so the living martyr is in the middle you like both correct that was your statement you like a romantic comedies and and the explosions okay fine\nBy the way I did like I Love James Bond movies that I admit\nBut that was when I was when he smoked cigars and and the love women I have to weigh in the ... the early days and and that's right and gift cards that is correct and you see Dr ... do you see that there is a gift card slip to them that is exactly right\nYeah yeah and exploded the gift card did explode [laughter]\nSo everybody was happy that the guys were happy and you know what it is [laughter]\nSo I Am this this is a male female efficient is devoted to Dennis this theory on gift card versus gift I didn't ask my wife I ... I I I I you know as well as I Know her\nBut I could say what do you think you know my wife very well why do you think sue would would would answer\nIt's a tough one what would your wife answer I suspect the gift yeah okay I I Do [noise] I Know there is a good argument in both I think if she like the gift I think she'd be very touched\nBut I Would be touched too if I like the gift but the chances of your getting me something that would that I Would enjoy as much as me getting me that\nThere are a very small ... who knows better what I Want then I that's why that's why rational male brain talking\nSo let's say if if there's a hundred dollar gift right so so generous gift a hundred dollar gift\nThat somebody's spends they have fought to it and and I know they gave thought to it but it's not what I Would choose for me of course I'd rather have a hundred dollar gift certificate but people think this is another thing\nPeople think that you're getting them a gift certificate chose you didn't think he took the easy way out\nBut I I I don't relate to that at all\n[noise] listen don't couples set up part of a cold when they set up an account at a at a department store or a
