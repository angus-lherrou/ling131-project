having a map is useless unless you know where you're going\nYou know exactly where you are but if you don't know where you're going it's useless\nSo why does it all about what are the big issue that's why it's the ultimate issues hour after all so sometimes something in the news provokes a subject on the male female our or for that matter the happiness our or for that matter the ultimate issues hour and that is the case today\nSo I guess it's ... it's a multifaceted question but it revolves around one issue and that is if you are middle aged adults\n\nIs it important in assessing you how you active in high school it's obviously based on the Brett Kavanaugh nomination\nAnd that's the question you're how old is he exactly fifty four fifty three fifty four or whatever you're so you're in you're almost mid fifties\nIf you let let me put it to you this way if you had an important position in Europe business where your school\nAnd you had your ...\nAgreement that a man had led a remarkably good life as an adult in other words from the age of Twenty one\nSo for thirty five thirty four years as whatever has been a remarkable human being contributor to his community a family man us a churchgoer\nWhich to me means something to many it doesn't [noise] would you then what do you pursue allegations of misconduct in high school\nThat's the question I wouldn't if I were hiring for ... for you and I and\nI'm not talking about hiring a twenty two year old the where the proximity to high school is a few years I'm Talking about remember I'm Talking about the age of Brett Kavanaugh somebody apply for a job at ... university\nIs unanimous wanna find human being family man community man this person has been and then uh some charges are brought up about what he did in high school or even the exact same chargers\nOkay I Would ignore them\nAnd it's clear what type of adult you would have been I Am I'm not going to look at what you were are alleged to do in high school\nSo that's the question that's the ... ... how important in assessing a human being is their conduct in high school and high school alone\n\nNot not not a thirty about twenty five but in high school\n\nOne aide Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nNow I don't have I don't have a vested interest in this argument okay I I actually was a good guy in high school and I led an anti cheating on tests campaign I was elected the graduating class president I I was a bird was a good guy basically\nBut I'm I'm sure that you know things could be brought up I mean that I don't even know about\nOr that didn't happen which is I think is a possibility or in the case of Brett Kavanaugh but happen or not happen with\nThe uh they were kids in in high school who were uh near do wells and who ended up fantastic adults\nSo ... who cares who cares and in effect now I care about how my kids act in high school I acted in high school of course you care about how your kid acts at the age of five that's a separate issue you you because you you want to form a good person\nAs early as possible I I agree with that but in ... in in the perspective of a life and in retrospect\nWhat how you acted in high school should have no bearing in undermining once assessment of this person in middle age that's my position do you think do you think it matters that's the question\nWhat eight Prager seven seven six\nEight seven seven to for three triple seven six\n\nBig stuff big stuff that people left to answer it's hard for me to believe that anybody listening even Democrats\nHiring a person for a an important position in their business who knew what a terrific person misses and then charges arose from high school within say no I'm Sorry\nIt's clear what type of adult you've been put in high school are you uh you you robbed a a candy store or a pretty serious not not not simply\nNot simply shop lifted some candy bars but you threaten the owner and and you rub\nBut it is obvious you turn your life around or otherwise what is what one is saying is people cannot turn their lives around we will let no point to acknowledge\nThat you're turning your life around that is why religious Jews and Christians find this notion particularly offensive because they're both Judaism and Christianity so rooted in the importance\nOf benefits\nOf forgiveness\nOf tissue vi in in in the Hebrew of of return or that's repentance\nThen there's this famous Hebrew statement that I'm a I'm literally translated from the Hebrew where a penitentiary stands the most righteous person cannot stand\nYour a higher level if you turn your life around the person who never turn their life around and it's been good the whole time\nThat's how that's how ... and of course obviously in both religions forgive right forgive us as we forgive those who trespass against us the whole the whole notion of Christ dying for people sins and forgiveness\nAnd uh the uh Judaism holiest days the day of of uh of panic tense day of atonement you'll keep poor [laughter] so religious Jews and Christians understand of course people can turn their lives around\n\nUh I emphatically endorse the notion that when you are already in middle age and the lead a good life that's all that matters I have no interest in ...\nWe're like in high school\n\nAnd primary where where's your cutting cutting off line is is elementary school right well you know elementary school well yeah that's what people said until recently about high school\n[noise]\nAll right one a Prager seven seven six\n\nAnd let's go to will in San Antonio hello will Dennis Prager\nI guess I\nGuess I could just tell you a little story um I was a high school or college did you live in California there the whole the whole party scene drugs and you know part of coke in every day\nAnd a was later arrested for a dealing and went to jail and uh it was kind of funny 'cause when I before I got you know for a guy that said already side to get away from that it was easy\nAnd um and I pulled away and pulled out a kind of caught the last second tired of it you know and a ...\nThat you know about five six years about life after that we're just impossible and very difficult and\nWorked hard and the alter my life around and I've been married for twenty five years I've raised three great kids are born graduated from college worked for major tech company one is a five year law or the other one is just a sophomore in college\n[laughter] [laughter]\nSo when you make up your own wisdom you're not wise that's the way it works but they don't believe that so you get ideas like Joes relatives\nOkay\nSharon in Dallas either Sharon\nHi how are you real well thank you\nGood okay so I'm On the same page that never stopped creating\nAnd um I have five boys seven of them were really good in high school some of 'em like Craig making close to God and all of them would be great catch it you know I I think it's\nYou know that that they live in the media\nHas a shattering thing isn't it if it doesn't matter how you've led a whole adult life\nThat's what's being out at in the United states of America\nWork at a school and I would hope that my people ... and young adults like these kids are going to be good quick yeah thing could be a good parent and do the best they can and we also got in there and you got it right\nI think it usually does thank you I contend that for many years that my mother couldn't believe I didn't end up in prison\nYou you have no idea how often when I was in elementary school she ... she thought I was going to end up the J. D. that was the term in those days as Sean you ever hear the term JV no right if they if they die it's a very interesting juvenile delinquent\nNot a doctor or jurisprudence\nSay be that's what she thought I ended up at J. D. why does she think I'd end up at jail because they didn't do any homework\nAnd it doesn't work in high school either\nToo busy uh learning about life including teaching myself how to conduct [noise] which turned out well\nBut you don't you don't know you just gotta you gotta you gotta strive you've got to work on your kids and then you don't know what's gonna happen but in retrospect you've letter or a magnificent life\nYour your high school days and not relevant to they're just not relevant why why why is that an issue but only about ...\n[noise] read my column this week he'll away some issue or right [noise]\nOh okay well so it was just going to take a call and like a thirty second warning they by the way I just want you to know that the people who are protecting\nReligious freedom in this country is the alliance defending freedom they won the case for the Baker\nThere they do it for free but they can't do it without your support as an ATF batter at them as ...\nDennis Prager show live from the relief factor pain free studio [noise]\n\nThis is Pam eight Seventy the answer to traffic\nAnd things I mean jammed in North Hollywood when we have an ongoing thing that the Novak unfortunately\nAnd this is on the one felony heading compound testify Sherman way\nHe can only get find hard last plane that's the only one of the Mexican I'm shut down because they clashed China it's kept up some ... by hand in hand the fucking Ninety One there's three class in the far right lane and you can some sounds strange ...
