second hour of my show was devoted to what I Believe it's the most I was talking about men and women in the media at this time [noise]\nAnd as I often point out if it is not the most honest then I salute those who are more of a a totally prepared to be in second place on this\nBut I I don't know where that might be found at this time and the reason is I don't have a male gender agenda or female agenda another man fan than I Am a good people than\nAnd there are just as many good men has good women and just as many awful met a ... that's just the way it is it's the almost perfectly apportioned\nFor every foolish man there is a foolish woman and vice versa for every good man there was a good woman by and large by and large in some societies you will find more of one type than the other I think\nBut any in any event good people don't grow on trees whether male or female my topic today\nIs the column that I Britain this week and it is largely about young men and the question of ambition\nOne of the things that renders men mass killing in the eyes of women or at least that was the case for all of history and I am perfectly prepared to acknowledge that perhaps for young women today it is not the case I Would love to get your input on that particular issue incidentally but\nBy and large one of the most appealing traits if I may say ... ... a man sexy it was one of the things to a woman is ambition knocked crazed ambitious miss nor she says no\nAmbition I Want to get ahead I Want to be successful and ambition for all of western recorded history\nWas largely I Wish to succeed at work and I wish to provide for a wife and children I Wish to provide for a family\nThis is what male ambition this is when I was certainly when I was a kid this was what was assumed it was so so much of a given it wasn't even articulate it because it was just assumed\nWill you grow up and be able to take care of a family that was male ambition\nAnd ah my sense is that that has been killed for many young men because it has been killed\nIn the society the notion of raising men boys to be men first of all is it believe it or not is almost\nConsidered archaic today a be a man that is so sexist be a man or a data show patriarchal or some others unbelievably destructive adjective used for\nThings for a boy to aspire to be a man was a man a man takes care of the family\nThat is the primary suck the only thing that constitutes a man obviously but it is for most males that has been the defining element can't will I take care in all senses of the word we'll like take care of a family\nSo my assumption today is that this ambition has been shot first of all a lot of men for my generation to today even more so today\nWe're taught that hey you don't have to take care of a family in fact you don't even have to have a family there's no real compelling reason for you to get married and if you do the\nFemale will pull her weight as they say she will row her or just as much as you will roll your or you were all a boat with two or has been\nAnd so the notion that that I as a male will but me to take care of a family is is considered again patriarchal and archaic\nYou agree that's my question do you think that the the man of ambition\nI I Wish to get ahead I Wish to succeed uh I Wish to take care of a family that this is endangered species I obviously acknowledge that they exist they exist even in significant numbers but I'm the question is proportion\nSo if you especially if you are a woman or if you have a daughter who is dating\nOr do you have a sense that this is taking place\nThat what I have described is in fact what is taking place or a this is an alarm that is not worthy of being sounded because it's not a big deal one eighth Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nThese are the numbers to talk to me if you are dating if you have a son you might have a son for example who is not particularly ambitious who was a more than happy to stay at home and uh you know make a living but not not not really aspire to more I had the sense as I told you\nKnow as I mentioned I didn't tell you I admit any enemy lanes but it's my column this week is about\nMy wife and my experience is test driving vehicles last week at five different dealers in the Los Angeles area\nAnd my sense and they were all wonderful people are there was this there's no knocked on them but my sense was that\nThese were not guys who were particularly ambitious particularly passionate about their work and you could say well maybe they're not passionate about selling cars yeah but it doesn't matter you still left to be passionate about your work even if you don't care about the particulars\nBecause the the more that you were passionate about your work the more successful you'll be and the more you will rise in life\nThat my father wanted to be a doctor\nHe couldn't afford medical school so it became an accountant he became extremely passionate about accounting which is about as far from being a doctor is you can get but he just decided to his great credit I'm going to become passionate about my work of all it's all too well at it\n\nSo the question on the table is ... young males and ambition now overly ambitious is not good overly anything if it's good to exercise it's not good to be addicted to marathons I mean is there there's no end in life to the to the\nFact that any good things can be over done\nSo I understand you can have too much ambition because then it's not ambition to take care of a family in an ambition to do good it's ambition to be to be super rich or to be super famous or to be super powerful and that's not a that is not admirable that's not what I'm Talking about\nBut the absence of ambition in men is in a mask you leading\nCharacteristic\nThey major part of masculinity is indeed ambition I Want to succeed I Want to take care of I Want to take care of and I want to take care of\nThat is a good thing and it and and in the past it has rendered men desirable to a woman but\nI I Believe that society has played a terrible tricked\nOn both young men and young women it has told them that they are at the same is told young women that they are sexually the same as men\nThey could enjoy any number of hookups just as much as men can with no emotional price paid\nAnd now what do you think why do you think that the idiocy of or rape culture charge at colleges exists why do you think it exists it exist because so many young women have had sex with the leader regretted so rather than saying you know why did I get into it they prefer to use the term break culture\nThat's that's the genesis of the a phony charges of rape culture image I by the way this proves that it's phony the proof is the parents and their daughters to college\nNo no parent in the world what's in the door to door rape culture I mean what are we always joking ... what what are we living in the New York times\n\nAnd they told them and the same thing you know you know you know women women will carry half their weight and in any in any deal and not by the way guys you don't have to get married you know what's what's in it for you divorce is a fortune anyway there's nothing in it for you you know women are available\nAnd so that doesn't breed the type of man that a fair number of women would want for a mate [noise]\nThat's my theory if I'm wrong I'm happy I'm wrong\nThat is that is an exceptional teacher and part of the reason I Am convinced is it South Carolina and it is not LA New York Chicago et cetera [noise]\nThat's a powerful story I wrote it down and I think you and Michelle San Diego California tennis Prager Hi\n\nWell thanks so\nAir my answer last year and I\nTake like when you go I think that today I really hope not I don't mean that college that men and women are very excited and then I got married but I can tell that that's not true\nAnd I think that oh yeah because they have it they don't stay on the cat that they make like why do you make or isn't really motivated to which it harder to make money than it used to be\nThat everything is now we have no income tax rates by a boy and girl after school programs and I think everybody is\nWell I think that that to a large extent except when you know obviously quite wealthy homes could afford a on a few ... or at least one and

way they're eighty percent of the time my wife is with me which I'm very blessed to have that ability but not right now and\nNot when I go city the city the city the city but when I go for a few days to a city she was almost always with me which is a real bonus but I Am asked do you know you do you like it and it's such an interesting question totally understandable question\nOn the one hand nobody likes flying every single day for much of a ... [noise]\nUh and packing a suitcase or again and re packing and entering the hotel room on the other hand I Walk around thinking how lucky I Am and I remember I I mean it's\nOnly sincerely just as I did when I started this in my twenties I never lose sight of the fact people want to hear what I have to say how could I dislike travel is the reason that I'm traveling is that people want to hear what I have to say\nThat's why there was no happiness possible if you don't look at the big picture all their aspect they is there any job on earth aspects of which people don't enjoy to do that there is no ... there's no such job but doesn't exist\nYou liked playing baseball and you're paid well to play baseball there were no aspects of of being on a I'm a baseball team but you don't enjoy of course there are talking about travel these guys do it for half the year it constantly\nAnd the work out that they have it's not it's not all farm but any baseball player who whose mind is still intact knows how lucky he is to be paid to do what he loves [noise]\nThat's the only way to go through life is to have a perspective on on what you're you're doing so too do you enjoy every single aspect of it there's no such thing it doesn't it doesn't exist\n[noise] by the way I just like to note for no other reason than I Would like to know what it is today is October twenty four twenty Eighteen and my late mother was born on October twenty fourth Nineteen Eighteen\nNo Nineteen Nineteen I'm wrong but I my dad was Nineteen Eighteen\nI made a ... my dad was a hundred would have been a hundred in July my mom would\nBe Ninety nine today yeah she was when you're younger eerie stuff\nYou know when you think about like the roaring twenties you think of the Nineteen twenties but we're going to be entering very soon we're entering the twenties again\nSo what are they going to how are they going to distinguish between the twenties and the twenties I don't know maybe they won't be roaring ... the roaring twenties were the Nineteen twenties and the non roaring twenties or the twenty twenties who knows\n[laughter] anyway mom wherever you are and I believe you are somewhere happy birthday [laughter]\nFrom the from your baby [noise]\nAll right everybody how to make America America again elect Democrats and win back the house or the ... the emotional basis of left wing for is\nSomething I've been pointing out my whole life Thomas Friedman is a perfect example of it like to read the ... and he is considered not want to be thoughtful liberals he's not even\nHe doesn't call himself a leftist but he hates the president and this is this they hate the president to president represents everything they load the people who vote for them or low some were deplorable we are the opposite\nOf the Tom Friedman so we are I mean it's just the fact we lived differently or we uh many of us are religious many of us a A R like guns remember that cling to religion and guns\nOr many of us are to actually get the chills bet the star Spangled Banner many of us think of this only contemptible to ah purposely meal in front of hundreds of thousands of people rather than stand for the national anthem\nAnd many of us think that the United states is the greatest force for good many of us think that it's the least racist country in the history of the world many of us think we are blessed to be American so where we were different than if you guys are and to Tom Friedman ths world\nBut I like to I'd like to read to you because he is one of the more eloquent of their spokesman he knows how to use language so I I don't I don't want to use a [noise]\nA bad example but the best example that the left has so Thomas Friedman in today's New York times okay it's titled how to make America America again elect Democrats [noise]\nNow the very notion that you're going to make America America and abide electing a left wing party is is in itself and absurdity\nTo the left wing all over the world which is to undo the American revolution and to preserve the French Revolution every to get philosophical for a moment\nSo America will be made America Again by having by having Democrats in power to have a more of a a far more socialized economy as an example really All right so let's take some of the things he says some of the things he doesn't talk about\nThe begins one is still left to say about the terrible murder of moderates Saudi journalist ... and its aftermath by the way I don't know if he was moderate or not and I don't know if it's relevant\nIf if the guy was moderate or not moderate\nOr what was done to him is disgusting we all agree on that one of the few things left and right can agree with only one thing and I said it before but I feel it even more strongly now in the mid term elections vote for a Democrat campus for a Democrat raise money for a Democrat drive someone else to voting station to vote for a Democrat\n[laughter] why does this have to do a well we'll we'll find out what this has to do with your mom could show ... then he writes I don't say that because I'm particularly\nLiberal oh really you're not particularly liberal that's fascinating said why would you you're not even particularly liberal you\nNot let alone left is you're not even particularly liberal Tom Friedman but you want people to vote for Democrats campus for a Democrat raise money for a Democrat truck someone else to voting station to vote for Democrats should you want the left wing party to win but you're not particularly liberal\nOkay I just want you all to follow the logic here and wants to shift the whole country the liberal agenda I say that because I'm particularly American and I want to put the best of American values back at the center of our diplomacy in politics\nReally the best of American values and and uh was was that it was that for example on display or when the when the rock Obama pulled out of Iraq\nWas that the best of American values and international policy was the shipping of billions of dollars to the Iranian regime\nWhich is worse W. O. R. S. E. then the Saudi regime in terms of doing evil on the face of the earth evil means hurting people in case it meets a definition\nBut she's not a religious terms specifically if it's not a complex term evil is the greater amount of hurt that is done to innocent people\nIs greater amount of hurt them to win some people by Iran or Saudi Arabia\nThe enemy of Saudi of the enemy of Iran is Mr Friedman\nShow if you really care about humanity why wouldn't you while we all recognize how primitive the Saudi regime is\nAnd and it's institutions nevertheless I don't have a choice between a wonderful place and he ... I have a choice between Saudi Arabia and Iran just as\nIn World War two we had a choice between Stalin and Hitler and weak correctly Joe Stalin who even kill more people okay that's that's why I don't know what you mean by put the best of American values back at the center of our diplomacy in politics\nBut we'll explain his way I Will continue with his worth analyzing\nBecause we need to understand how the best of our opponents think and respond you're listening to the dentist\n\nJust to bully trumping Republicans the same way he has them oh you poor bully people but I'll take that chance because there was a basic respect for truth science in decency and the Democratic caucus you gotta be\nKidding\nTo people who deny that there was male and female in the human being they have a respect for science\nYou're You're Joking correct truth truth university\nThey're committed to truth left ones the university's Tom Friedman is there a commitment the truth their\nDecency who who who decency as to what the democratic caucus did to Brett capital decency\nYou have you had the temerity Tom Friedman to speak about the Democratic party and\nDecency the left and decency\nAfter after the the ... Republican after Republican who has gotten punched while campaigning got shot while campaigning ... and the others were shot at a well playing baseball sorry not campaigning\nAnd what about on all of the all the Republicans who have dinner and people scream obscenities in their face and you talk to me about who's more decent\nGod I live in a very very wonderful a power away from reality\nWhat else is he said I Know the two more years of the GOP holding every lever power blindly following Trump's basic disrespect for true science of decency there we go again she is so fascinating they they they throw out these gigantic charges ... it's all generalized and I generalize to give\nYou specific I just gave you a specific for every example who's who was been more indecent Republicans or Democrats in the last two years [noise]\nTruth without power today is just background or background moves Zach moved back to the march of the Trump Administration you see I can write that it's vitally important for global stability in the protection of journalists everywhere that those who executed and ordered the murder of cars show you'd be punished really it's vitally important for global stability\nI\nThink they have to be punished I couldn't agree more on moral grounds for a global stability when was the what did he write about the need to punish the Iranian regime for what it does to journalists\nIf I was just reading a report about the rape centers in in in Iran\nFor women caught up were anti regime\nI missed that article I guess in the ah [noise]\nIn the a celebration of the Iran agreement that rock Obama may backing them over to the dentist tiger show\nFactor pain free studio [noise]\nGet breaking news on AMA Seventy the answer\nAdopt ... stuck in traffic\nWe orange county's roadways check in without any problems although we do have some count transit you make the drive through the bill apart city of orange area they're working on the fifty by north bound between Chapman and can tell us\nIt's the right hand lane taken away for another half hour or so no delays either direction other fifty five from the beach up to the Ninety One ... big enough to Ninety One looked like he has some sluggish traffic had he needs from seven hand down to Lakewood boulevard my ... is the answer [noise]\nAh forties continue to investigate a suspicious package sent to CNN headquarters in New York City Scott single has the latest\nSaw the NYPD says this appear to be pipe bombs and also where the white powder forcing authorities to evacuate CNN headquarters here mayor de Blasio calls this an act of terror\nPeople in New York City will not be intimidated that we're going to go about our lives\nHow Governor Cuomo says this is nothing new and we bought allowed to scare us\nTerrorism be attempt to spread fear is the world that we live and\nCuomo as a device a center his office we wouldn't be surprised if additional devices harsh than the president\nJust moments ago at the White House\nTo begin today's remarks by providing an update on the suspicious packages\nAnd devices meld to current and former high ranking government officials to safety of the American people is my highest absolute priority [laughter]\nI've just concluded a briefing with the FBI profit of Justice Department of homeland security and the U.S Secret Service\nSouth on whether sunny today seventies and eighties LA downtown sixty nine in Farmington it's sixty five ...
