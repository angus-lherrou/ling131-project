he makes the point that it is you know it is a very big day Tony Soprano on the Sopranos used to use to rail against the effort to dishonor quite literally and that's a centrally what happened Christopher Columbus was dishonor when here in Los Angeles or we stopped calling it Columbus Day and\nNow it's national indigenous people's day uh there are a lot of people are of course you recognize history the Christopher Columbus you know there were more than a couple of people slaughtered a on his watch 'em but it was when I was a kid he was like his picture was on the classroom walls\nOr Columbus ohio this is the first year ever were Columbus ohio is not celebrating Columbus Day they're celebrating and digital indigenous people dance well they live in Columbus correct\nSo maybe if

guess there are ... those two are liberal women on the Supreme Court it's genetically it [laughter] so typical [laughter]\nOh he can't be a good justice because he attacked the Democrats in the ... in his hearing because there there was no reason to attack the Democrats as we know they they they were running a fine shift their\nLindsey Graham who is is you know who is is bridge building a Republican is exists\nI should play it again I should play that periodically for the next year to remind people\nThat's how good he was\nAnyway people forget you know Ruth Bader Ginsburg gave a speech which she attack Donald Trump ... the city and justice\nAnd indeed means nothing it means nothing like it didn't happen so if he's invalidated for attacking the Democrats in the Senate why isn't she invalidated for attacking the president of the United states while she's sitting justice because\nThe same rules don't hold for both sides that's why the oh we should a senator Hirono of Hawaii who is

laugh at the cats\nAnd that's all done for for generations and tanker from out of the country that's another thing to run senator out of restaurants do to their home is that going too far I think that a rule\nThat there are a lot of people who are very very much um motivated about what's going on because they say okay\nThat if that does not disqualify this woman from serious moral consideration nothing does\nDo do you do you think that Republican senators seeing right wing mobs go into restaurants and starts screaming and cursing at at at democratic officials you think they would say well it just shows people are motivated\n\nYou understand the moral rot at the heart of the left this is this to say I every day I bring you an example I'd like to know how any of you on the left that liberals liberals just\nAre naive but leftists are truly damaging but so I I just want to know what why do you how old are you assimilate into your conscience\nWhat ... the scent this democratic senator has said\nHow do you feel about these people who go into restaurants and start screaming\nA at a Republican senator for example like they did with Ted Cruz a fellow senator\nSee I'm torn right now\nCan I what I advocate on the air that people do to senator Hirono while we're still to Senator Cruz see I Can't do that because I have standards\nBut I Am curious\nHow she what she would say if it happened to her after\nAll I Know this is amazing to Democrats we feel as passionately as you do I know you you can't believe that because we're so much more civil than you so you don't really
