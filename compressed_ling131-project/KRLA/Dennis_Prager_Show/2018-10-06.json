eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven\nLet's go right back to the phones let's go to John in Cleveland, Ohio and he's got questions about\nA dental bone augmentation All right are you there John\nLewis I Am and how old a man of you and how much do you weigh\nSix to nine to ten is is a two hundred and ten pounds so what do they want to do they want to\nBuild up an area like right I Want to build up a an area that is ... ... in the ... one of the scientists or as yeah it's actually lower lower ...\nOh well that's different usually it occurs in the upper area and that would be normal and you wouldn't mean bone loss but when you're losing when they want bono imitation in the lower jaw now you're into what's called the L. veal or bone\nAnd that bone is very sensitive to boneless show\nIf you need to build that area I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole\nUntil you first figure out why you're losing bone\nSo the normally you would get a roller ph paper in check the first morning you're in ph\nNow [noise] this is like a dog chasing his tail though\nBecause if there is remaining infection in them out\nNo matter what we do you're not going to get that ... to the Green Zone six four to seven or it'll maybe come in and go out\nUm show first you need to be sure there's no raging infection left in the mouth like a dead to or\nA pocket of infection from an old extraction something like this so we need to hunt that down and make sure we got rid of that then we've got to work on\nGetting the first morning you're in ph into screens don't\nKnow if you were five years old this would be usually a very easy task done but when I have five so neither your eyes so that task could be\nEasy could be hard so first we get the ph paper and we find out where we are no if you're already in the blue zones you're in deep trouble\nThat means you're making a Monet above your urine\nAnd you're really low and minerals\nThen when you start with the something like the coral and the vitamin D D three gold and you start maybe with a half a tease when the coral\nAnd every three days you check yourself and if it if it was blue it should drop down to the five or if you're a yellow and then then it should build his way back up and so every three days you jacket as long as it's going up you don't have to increase the girl\nWho doesn't want to go up you could double the coral and see if it'll start moving let's say it won't pay than we may have to support\nTerrorists that road and the kidney okay so many times we can support the kidney was simply taking five ... your body size like our deejay two hundred\nBeen for the parents that I read you can use the ... is one of the things that works well\nMaybe two capsules just once a day with lunch and now she will that move the ph now does the ph come up okay now if it comes up when the stage and they're great but sick comes up but it won't stay in there or you can't quite get it in there\nOkay there's still some ... some infection somewhere in the body\nAnd now you're going to need to visit with the cure a person and all this should be done before you do any kind of bone grafting okay because if you try any of this it's not gonna work good and you're not going to heal well when they do the other dental work so it's a whole ... thing is going to be bad\nSo you get a ... a practitioner and they can test the teeth and the gums and especially the area behind the teeth called the retro mole area because so many of us have infection that sits there\nFrom the extraction of a impacted wisdom tooth and the ... a residual infection never being dealt with\nShow what we can do they're usually can\nLocate through the cure it practitioners are one of the Dennis and has a laser like in in the ... laser and they can crank up the power to maybe three watch yourself and disinfect that whole area and you'll be able to see the ph becomes mobile then\nAnd um it might take one or two times to do it but let me tell you your future is riding on is if you don't get driven with devil is going good and you're sixty nine by the time you're eighty nine you won't even be able to walk\nOkay area it's not a pleasant prospect that's offered for us as we age and part of it is our crummy mineral status food\nPart of it is our overeating oil and part of it is of course\nDesperately needing to be able to digest our food well that's the other thing you gotta do you got to make sure you're on some kind of ... like one of them died just and then to your body weight at least two of those at the start of a meal the end of the meal\nMay be five or even six between ... and now you know your digesting that we did in your twenties and if you have plaque this will get the plaque right off the teeth so it's\nYour warning and at your age or shouldn't eat cooked food without taking digestive enzymes if you do you're asking for trouble\nAnd so this little

diffuse as to what is happening I Would have to touch the area with my hands and move your ... certain positions and see where the pain is being generated from\nI'm not one to get stuck on images such as X rays are MRI's to decide and it just burns people up when they come in the office because they've been to several doctors usually by the time they get to me\nWho have said well you're ... shows this or that or even ... shoes this or that and I started laughing and I say it might show up and I can see it but European stuff coming from the area\nAnd in other words when studies are done on people that have zero pain to haul 'cause we do that as doctors we check people out and we do studies we find that people that have um terrible things in their body terrible pain let's say\nDon't necessarily show anything in an MRI and vice versa they can have an MRI that shows all kinds of pathology and not have any pain at all\nCertainly you wouldn't do surgery on a new like yours unless there was a need to do it then unfortunately or fortunately depending on which way you look at it [noise]\nThere's been many studies done by doctors were surgery is done versus using a sham surgery a sham surgery means of fake surgery were just the skin was cut and sewed up\nAnd nothing was done inside the knee and the outcome whether you it's a real surgery or a fake surgery has the same so what does that tell you [noise]\nI don't really want to do a surgery some kind of hoping that maybe I can make an appointment touch it maybe we can go there\nYeah I think that'd be a smart idea and another thing you can do is\nIf you want to call now recalled during regular office hours the number is eight hundred three hundred Ninety three hundred repeated for everybody else listening who's grabbing a pin\nWhile they're driving it's eight hundred three hundred and Ninety three hundred you can call and\nAnd um [noise] if no one picks up just leave a message and you can find out if your insurance will pay for your examination history [noise] okay\nYeah that's what I'm worried about you but I think that\nYeah and we take insurance we take Medicare and cigna has no Blue Cross Blue Shield United healthcare and for people without any insurance\nWe can help them get what's called care credit which is like a credit card for medical procedures and that covers all of this stuff unfortunately most of this work that I Do\nWhich we call generically recall it fried chicken or active medicine because we're ... growing tissue in the body can do that anywhere in the body\nBy just taking your own cells your own DNA than injecting it in this thought that as the ... generator [noise]\nUm but often the office visits is taken care of if you've got a nice full of fluid which a lot of people come into the ... or ... or something well often find a lot of fluids\nAnd it can be blood if is actually a tear [noise] and the insurance will pay for that and pay for some other things but it doesn't generally pie for um\nThe procedures if it's a car accident the insurance will pay for it if it's workers' comp they'll pay for it but not general health insurance [noise]\nOkay and from what I think telling me you're doing pretty good and um we should be able to help you knew how they'll get\nIt for like a year it's like I said let's take another step [noise] thank you for taking like\nWell you look you need you need to get to a dock you need to get to a dark\nWho examines things with their hands and unfortunately you know this is something I think is terrible but most of the people that come to me with the field surgery and that means they went and had a surgery and it didn't work because they got better when I asked them if the surgeon touch their body\nPart they say no they looked at an image\nAnd decided that they needed surgery and that to me is not the right way to treat people [noise]\nYou gotta find the pain generator images don't tell you with the pain generator is [noise]\nThey might they might not\nMoving with person around and touching them I'm doing a proper examination often can tell us a lot more\nThan ... so do I like him or her eyes I Do [noise]\nYou don't need to come to the office and say well you don't like him or her eyes I'm not going to get one because it is ancillary information and make confirmed the examination that in itself and only itself it's not a reason to\nDecide what to do with the person\nThat at least and muscular skeletal muscle [noise]\nUnless there's a fracture something like that that you find you know what I'm saying\n\n... thank you thank you talked to a game is leisure how 'bout you appreciate your call okay\nYou're listening to living pain free with Dr Marc arrow and our number one eight six six eight

also if it's lower down\nIt could be what's called the tests and surrounding us which means the sort of the rooster and French and that's three different um tendons looped attach there and there's a few other structures there's a teller tendon\nBut we take the bone marrow from the back of the pill this now from the spine no this is not a dangerous procedure it's very soon you've done thousands of them\nAnd uh we take the bone marrow and we ... we can spin it down if we like er lately we've we've been doing a trial a study in the office where we don't spin a town\nExcept for ... we have to because the red cells that are that come out\nCan be very inflammatory and inside of a media can cause an infusion which is just a lot of fluid buildup which can be painful so we definitely spin it at this point with knees but yes I've been doing Achilles tendons for Twenty years\nWas very good success semi procedures have changed over the years how I Do it\nPersonally I don't inject into the tendon because that tendon ... pretty easily even without a needle going into it\nUm I Know a lot of people that a lot of doctors who do inject into that and then I don't do it\nBy injecting I'm deeper to the tendon and for some reason people heal up that uh the flu or the cells that I put their migrate up into where the terrorists or and he lived that way so let's see for procedure\nAnd yes

practice is to regroup to shoo instead of cuts tissue out I did a lot of training in orthopedic surgery when I was in medical school an internship\nAnd a little bit also in my residency\nAnd I jumped ship you might say I switched over to physical medicine and rehabilitation because in my personal opinion the surgeries that were being done shouldn't be done and there were too many failures\nAnd then on my own body I had regenerative medicine on my wrist and my shoulder which I did myself and found that uh I was able to heal even after I had a surgery that botched up my shoulder\nSo I have nothing against my surgeon who was a very good friend and my professor and medical school but I Do have something against the surgeries that are done and they're overused and unfortunately it's taken me Twenty years to get that out to the public\nI'm doing a pretty good job but there's still quite a few people doing these surgeries that I don't think should be done I'm just one guy it's just my opinion I'm entitled to it you guys go do whatever you want if you want a surgery go ahead but I'm going to tell you this I get a lot of people who come in\nWho have already had a surgery that field and are now coming in for regenerative medicine what is regenerative medicine very conservative very simple\nThe side effects are basically getting stiff afterwards you get a little bit sore
