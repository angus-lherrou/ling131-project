actually I spoke to penguins in the Antarctic um the two subjects happiness and ethical monotheism\nAnd they ah they were equally interested\nIn both there was one paying when the hundred or so looking at me the other is most of the others had their nose under the butt of their partner\nWas just strange fess wise that make me strange 'cause the beat\nThey don't have noses okay they beaks ... penguins have beaks than I guess you're a member there birds they're ... I guess why every body and this is the happiness our today's subject\nI admit at the outset so here is a trigger warning we need you know what we need a musical or\nSome sound effect\n[noise]\nIt's not a dog whistle it's a trigger no there's not a dog whistle this is a trigger for the sensitive so that they will know that they may be challenged or even a God Forbid really God Forbid offended\nBy that works\nSo here it is every body and\nThe what made me think of this topic was actually the last hour the previous hour talking about nationalism so I have a theory and you've probably heard me say\nThat oh one thousand or so times 'cause I have a lot of\nTheories about life by ... theory that identities are important to happiness\n\nWith me and I'm thinking of three and there may be more and if you have more or if you defer certainly if you defer one aide Prager seven seven six but first hear what the identities are and they are in no a indoor report just three identities\nThat I think are\nThey are necessary or they are major additives to one's happiness but they are not sufficient if this is this a loan doesn't make you happy but they are great\nAdditives supplements contribute towards that is the word they're great contribute towards towards happiness or sexual identity male or female a national identity and the religious identity\nI think in my lifetime I have seen that these things are real contributors now the reason I warn you at the outset the trigger is that there are those and I won't even identify them cause it to happiness our want everybody to listen and everybody to be as comfortable as possible\nBut there are those who are working to\nNotify those identities and say that they they really are not real and they are not even good [noise]\nBut that and therefore I truly truly believe they are contributing to unhappiness in the population\nBy knocking these identities won a Prager seven seven six so that I Believe that the more comfortable you are with being a woman for being a man being a boy or being a girl\nAnd that is that is a serious part of your identity sir I Will be totally although by a graphic here I have always been I'm very lucky I admit it always been comfortable with being mail\nI've never wanted to be a female I've never thought of myself as female I Am truly comfortable and I celebrate to ... to ... to whatever extent that celebrate a boy I Am I my male identity and I want females to do the exact same thing with being female\nI think I mean I I don't know how you can debate that that is a contributor to happiness nobody would argue even the most I Would think\nOf the most ardent defender of the transgendered and I'm not even attacking the trench either on the contrary he was not an attack at all but I I Would say that nobody would argue that having gender this for you thinking that you are the other sex\nOr then your biological given sex is not an it's not a source of happiness it may be something that you you you have to deal with and of course it's something you have to deal with it\nAnd you should try still to maximize your opportunities for happiness in life but it's you gotta really did my reality to argue that that is\nA a not an obstacle at the very least to one's happiness\nWe're one is not comfortable being a male or being a female so that's one identity identity is in fact almost been given a bad name oh here's an identity ooh that's not that's not good next is a national identity\nI think it contributes to one's happiness to feel part of something larger\nAt it and I think I think it's terrific I feel very American it has been a major contribution contributor to my happiness\nAnd I uh I celebrate it\nDoesn't mean I think America can do no wrong with some sort of serenity it's like saying I don't think men can do any wrong celebrating the fact that I'm a man or or comfortable with the fact that I'm a man but having an identity more\nThe more I identify as this is Mike pieces of this happiness our the more you identify with\nThe the greater your chance for happiness in third as a religious identity that is played a major role in my life in my case Judaism being Jewish\nAnd it is good for Christians obviously the majority great majority of the you're listening obviously you're not Jewish but it doesn't matter or whatever it might be if you're a Mormon if you're if you're Catholic if your Protestant if you're evangelical\nOr whatever it might be what every it if it can contribute to your happiness sometimes it contributes to misery all of them can all of them can also contribute to your misery\n... nothing is a guarantee in life\nYou can be a you can be at war with your with your religious identity some people are\n\nWhen I first started radio I was the moderator of a program on ABC in Los Angeles very very very popular show I inherited a very popular show ...\n\nI was the moderator and there's a priest a rabbi minister each week different ones each week and then they were members of fourth religions and I\nWould get calls people would call in and I remember how many people called and it was amazing to me so much so that at one time\nThere were so many people who identify themselves as hey Hi Dennis this woman said of the priest I'm an ex Catholic or I'm a recovering Catholic and I I I I was amazed I was amazed at how many people still identify themselves that nobody called the say you know I'm an ex Protestant I'm an ex Jew [laughter]\nSo ... that we had this this these people were obviously at war with their identity one guy called than it was Ninety\nAnd he was still angry at the nuns who would do is apparently raptors ... through the roof or when he was when he was twelve I told them you know I Am and I'm not Catholic but it\nSeems to me if the Seventy eight years you might want to give that up [noise]\nAnyway I I Know that in my life those three identities religious national\nAnd sexual have been

Charlottesville, Virginia have their hair she was not a member of anti thought she was part of the majority of people opposing the narrow Nazis\nWho were simply residents of that town or students or parts of religious groups that are on the stand up to the organized racist\nOr I see the president celebrating and endorsing violence against a journalist in Montana I listen to his antagonistic rhetoric towards his enemies and now we have what appears to be a right wing supporter of the presidents president engaging in a massive assassination effort against\nThose anti antagonistic a credit to the president and I hear you say\nThat and ... is the biggest threat and the liberal ...\nNo no I don't know the Concord old and I said the ... say the left is I teach this part of the left I'll
