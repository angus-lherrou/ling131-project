children and to to know that God had a miracle take place there and Naomi life because she was praying\nAnd pleading with the father and he had it in his in his heart say okay now that Seventeen year old kid take that canister and go elsewhere but the ... the most vulnerable are being attacked him and not\nBad to me as a Christian man it angers me brother it it angers me and the the the most helpless mhm are being attacked by cowards\nAnd we're standing up and saying you know what in Jesus' name these Christian Brothers sisters of ours are not forgotten Naomi her blind her blind has been there eight children\n[noise] um\nYou're talking about pastor John to me just a bit ago he had a really ... what we had to he had to had his whole church burned down is that we're telling a Davis\nIs one of the things that is just an outrage when the flooding come through there specifically finding the churches of course the burning the churches down raising the churches doubt desecrated in churches\nAnd they take over the ... they take over the land and they'll rebuild the from the foundations of the church bill attempt to rebuild a mosque\nThat's why we can't let this happen they'll have to stand up for our brothers and sisters so John pastor John also from the Anglican Church\nWas one of these passers who was threatened he did a CNN interview some months ago and when the ... found out that he was speaking out against the persecution they targeted him specifically he told his family his wife and kids when you go to the marketplace don't use your last name\nBecause when they find out that we are in the area they're gonna they're gonna find where we are going to kill us [noise] so he was living under that type of fear\nAnd they came they destroyed his church and you know a pastor John he's got a great sense of Boulder slowly spirit and uh they lost their church but they found a a a mess of ten they're media inside that ten now as we're not going to let the full any stop us from meeting together [noise]\nAnd a church is continuing to this day and John continues to speak out as a threat of his own life\nOkay threat of his own life threatening his own family's life their church burned down yeah for any of us at any one of those things would have a stop us in our track say we're not going to do this we're out and we're not do the same work that's why his church is now they're meeting in a\nTent immediate attack and John is one of our partners helping deliver the eight in the region so he's not just like holding his ground he's ... he's helping others it's just phenomenal don't\nYou know I mean and you know this speak to this this is this is more fueling the tank for for Christians to be able to have the boldness to say\nThis is our ground this is our territory we love going to forgive but we're also going to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ regardless of what happens and we're keeping that\nHandled of that whole mess there are we not\nExactly like in the book of acts believers in prey take away the proof persecution there's a lot in the midst of the threats let you serve and speak to your word with great boldness and that's what's happening on to a church that delivers there that there are those that are standing up and say we will not give up we will not give and we will stand and speak up kingdom established\nHere are sharing with me too and I know we we told the stories um pass broadcast to in the campaign we had the the the philosophy some Muslims Islamic members are seeing the boldness and they're converting\nThere have been yeah there have been stories there's but I met people that were boldly witnessing to philosophy\nOf Muslims and imagine the youth if you're if you're growing up in the ... the Muslim community and you see your four or five you see this type of these acts of violence taking place but then on the up on the other side you see acts of love forgiveness\nUm people that are completely vulnerable that are only are responding with acts of kindness back to the ... what would you choose as a young person [laughter] you the way of love with the way of hatred and that's why this Dave in this campaign that we're we have right now is a way of showing\nThat Christian love is so much more powerful than the hatred of Islamists and this is not just happy in Nigeria this is this is the ideological global warfare that we're participating in on one level or another\nThat we are standing up with their brothers and sisters and say love will defeat this form of evil phone number\nIs triple eight to five three thirty five to two we're inviting you to invest in this restored hope\nI'm Christian solidarity international in the plight of the persecuted Christian Nigerian families\nThe safe refuge and what that means there's a roof over their head after these fellow brothers sisters of ours have had their village their churches there there are there\nTo burn down completely destroyed their land taken so that refuge means not only to have a roof over their head but dignity to be able to have a a a toilet to use I mean that\nGuys this is what we're talking about ladies and gentleman that safe refuge is that the food of course water yes medical treatment so much of a ... you're talking about the the children that were in the hospital and continue to be in the hospital recovering from their ma Shadi injuries are\nBeing shot so that medical treatment the counseling their crime why are they shot why are they machetes why or their ... their moms and dads being decapitated by machines because they love Jesus and they are not giving up the Christ\nThis is our investment providing the store at home so what's your best guess now two hundred and twenty five dollar gift provides a full package of eight eight eight eight to five three three five to two triple eight to five three three five to two\nWhat's your best guess now does she ten families care for at eight eight eight to five three three five to two Joel what do the\n... you talk to 'em you know we we talk to our our brothers sisters they're on the ground I'm a partner Franco I'd either one of our fellow brothers or sisters who have had their whole world up ended my loved ones killed what would the Nigerian Christian family why have they said\nThat you would say ... family\nA day but when I was there I was so impressed by the attitude of these ah brothers sisters of ours they weren't coming they weren't begging they weren't I'm dreaming of going to America and starting to live there they love their lives they love their families and the communities that they established they just want their they want their lives back again\nThey want the dignity reestablished and I think they would say thank you for praying for us thank you for standing with us thank you for giving so that we can ... that we can get back up on our feet during this difficult time third dignify people hardworking people are beautiful people\nAnd um I I Hope of some of you have the privilege of meeting some of them on this side of eternity as well because they're they're precious I enjoy the time with them so much we were other parts of Nigeria where we met at church leaders and enjoy the fellowship\nAnd the type of um [noise] church services they have their music and the dancing in the ... very much so and we have a lot to learn from them because they are um their faith is strong in the midst of these type of trials even so when you talk about pastor John yeah\nChurch burned down ... family being threatened and he says I'm not giving up on the name of Jesus and he's writing his church in a tent\nYou have that in helping bring aid to others I mean it's phenomenal the type of faith that's being you know I'm demonstrated during during this difficult time\nThe phone number is Tripoli to five three three five two to eight eight eight to five three three five to to the need has been painted the urgency I trust you hear\nTime is of the essence we have\nFellow brothers sisters or bars who are in need of medical treatment even now as we were showing Joel showing me pictures of Franco sending him pictures of of\nOf Christians were attacks on their way to pour this morning from ... in a\nHorrible atrocity cars being burned with families inside churches being destroyed lives being taken all because they believe in Jesus Christ what is your best guess now two hundred and twenty five dollars provides that safe refuge in the food\nOr water the counseling uh\nA triple eight to five three three five to eight eighty eight to five three three five to two thirty families in critical needs ... ten families for right now what's your best guess Joe thank you for\nLetting us know about this need\nSlowly you dig for\nBeing generous and and helping out our brothers or sisters during this time of persecution really appreciate a\nProceeding pre recorded program was sponsored by an eight Seventy the answer\nAnd now a conversation about re upholstery with Claire the head designer a drapery works in orange county\nRand Paul's tree is really a nice way to key piece of furniture that you've had in your home specially airlines people say you know I've had this charity and handed down and they just don't make furniture like\nAnd every day we come to you we've got a special to reward you and your family for tuning in so you can enjoy and keep your very best help today we're going to be focused on the help of your bladder and urinary tract\nThe prostate and of course the lungs will start a little bit of explanation about that [noise] uh of course the bladder the urinary tract the prostate in the lungs all\nIn common mucus membranes\nAnd you're going to see very quickly that support across the board and maybe the vitamin D three that you need because\nThere's been so much discovery there as to what's going on and we're going to get into that in just a little bit but let's start with the bladder and the urine or attracted many times\nPeople are getting up at night here and it it kind of disturbs sleep then\nIt's not terrible but it's aggravating when you don't feel as rested in the morning and it starts fairly innocuous Lee whether you're male or female and off than all the body needs is a little more in the way of bio lab annoyed\nAnd while one of the power houses for delivering about five hundred different ... is our ... floor\nAnd it's the best sores that I've found and this of course maybe taking two of these three times a day for a few weeks see if it doesn't hit the spot and work perfectly for you or if so\nThen after about three or four weeks most people can cut down to one or two per day\nAnd that can be just exactly what you need in terms of these ... who heads the sometimes the bladder you've gone on a long time with this and uh the bladder is I'm not happy in fact bio films can form\nThese are sick sticky sugary sex stuck on the mucus membrane like dried music is very hard and the best bet in helping the body\nTo clear this is the active fractions from garlic Allison and of course that's rich in the\nAh garlic citing product so this may be just what you need is to maybe take some bladder support because it's engineered to\nTarget nutrients toward the bladder\nAnd to provide all the broad spectrum of needs for the bladder tissue and then uh maybe taking two or three bladder support right along with two or three girl aside and support\nMay be just what you need for the cases where you might have a little ... film and of course he's mount films if they do form\nThen they form when we leave the problem go for a long time that's when we really want to and get help with the bio film\nAnd of course they can be formed by almost any age so bladder support meddling with garlic side and can be a big help there and this is shifting gears going from the simplest help to a more sophisticated support for\nThe bladder in the urine or attract so today we're lemon special pollen deplore garlic aside and so just give a buzz to our or to line eight hundred three Seventy thirty four\nForty seven eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven let's go right\nTo the phones ... Marshall PHD this has helped line live let's go to one in Miami and he's got a question about magnesium is linked to blood pressure go ahead and one\nCommercial thank you I was going you because I had to go um I was string for an hour and then I Do enjoy sports fan while extremely I developed my check and make a long story short I could go to the hospital and get a bunch of cats\nAnd then after many cats they discovered that have had high blood pressure at that time I watch them there I can manage my stress and strength and enjoy the sport\nI haven't read anything about him like getting like about it and I I can take a medication my luck I couldn't make it a thought that the medication question that I have is how do I know I'm going to be so why is it out of high blood pressure like I got to have it today\nWhat because I was listening when I look at my cash no way to show when like me she lego car\nSo it won't end the reason is that um blood tests the magnesium are pretty much useless because I'm magnesium is held in the blood by adrenaline\nAnd in my opinion it's unlikely that the magnesium was the problem\nOr it's more likely that you sweat very heavily you depleted salt\nYou ate food that may have had bugs in it and it got carte blanche to the circulatory tree\nThat's the most common phenomenon\nThat links us two issues with blood pressure's so could it be magnesium yeah but it'd be real hard to tell you could go in a good drug store known stick your arm in there and see what your blood pressure is no cost no obligation\nTo get an idea of where you are now what I see over and over again with athletes like you is you sweat very heavily and you're not paying attention to salt\nNow most Americans in my opinion eat too much salt\nBut athletes especially enduring athletes anybody doing anything and orange often deplete salt so the way you can test this one is when you break a sweat he'll reach over to the upper outer part of your arm and taste the perspiration\nShould tea you taste slightly salty\nNone anybody else you if it doesn't you need to take a teaspoon of salt like air dried sea salt or better yet a pink so for two or three days until you break the sweat and you can taste it then I Would cut back and hide monitor that so I always have a slightly salty taste [noise]\nNow you have plenty of hydrogen Laura casket and no little bug can get past your stomach okay now if you're still\nWant to support healthy blood pressure and when you go and check your blood pressure you may want to go on something like cardio PJ how old are you how much the way\nI'm forty five and I weigh a hundred and eighty pounds\n... show you'd want probably about ... four teaspoons of cardio PG than you would use that for about four months\nAnd that's designed to promote the best health for the circulatory tree and then if you maintain years old\nBut you're getting old enough that salt might it not even do the job the you\nYou really probably should begin taking a couple of quantum died just at the start of Maine cooked meals and then at the end of the meal\nMaybe three to four detain hydro chloride\nNow you have the ... times you had a twenty\nAnd nothing gets passed those guys so I think you may be fooled by what's going on here okay a magnesium is famous for heart rhythm and for any issue with heart rhythm I'm but I'm not so much for the blood pressure itself\nOkay thinking about in the fuel combined\nThem All right let's go right back to the phones\nLet's go to Kristen in California and they're trying to conceive Liz nine months since the fertility ... says her husband has a very ... right are you there Kristen\nHow old is your husband how ...\nWhat does the doctor recommend for this for\nOnly having cancer last fall and see your\nFamily that guy which is kind of fat out that ... that really\nIt's amusing to me they didn't let you know all the options\nThen\nThis is because sometimes is selling one option and not another um but you know you read proverbs it says through the council of many wise men was plans of made so you don't just listen to one guy\nIncluding including me okay however\nI have no financial axe to grind okay which is quite different so I agree that there could be a circulatory issue\nI don't agree that the circulatory issues solution is necessarily that surgery it may be that he played sports and he's had his incurred an interference field an injury to his low back toward to the ...\nHook it uh let me come to that limit let's let's stick with the immune system because obviously the three is a major player they're making sure but ALSO Holding the morning you were in ph what's going on with that\nI'm six four check it every day for a long time and it\n... and then it's not possible for you to have what you had so something's wrong here holding that ph with ammonia or something like that I Would double the amount of minerals and see if the ph crashes down to five\nThat does then you know you've been using ammonia there but for the urine and you've got a problem with that to the gum problem some\nSome chronic issue somewhere you gotta find that's holding the immune system that they show old burgers like the one you've experienced can re surface hooking\nYou see the ad him and now let's go back to the double vision them if indeed we're making ammonia and then we're going to have all kinds of problems with sensory perception\nAnd of course the decision is going to be one of the biggies so um my immediate suspicion is that something is severely irritating the optic nerve so what we need to do is get you on\nWell first of all you should be on ice support\nBecause everybody needs that but that's not what we need to hear what we need here is nerve support\nSo you'll get on something called nerve support your very small woman so to pre meal will be plenty you should see some some help\nAlmost immediately within three four days you should also see that that you're in the ages of false ph so there's some rotten to sort of something we've got to find and get rid of\nOkay take care of them by [noise]\nAll right do you guys will be right back [noise]\nWhy do you do when the medical community can't find out what's wrong with him\nCalled doctor might ... ton of health and not being ... believes in finding a pain in the nation self magazine maintain one at the top twenty seven care to pack you add\nLighting and count on my body wellness killing a thirty year practitioner combined multiple credit calls after hearing his life and death experience\nThese therapies including Dr Robert national plan coming\nDa lay him I Can't find concurrent prompting her life in fact replicating combination for his life he's been able to help me elephant ... doctor dealing now seven four five six Ninety One eighty\n... Dr ... and you can call me right now for free phone calls regarding any health concern you may have give me a call the number\nOne for like five six nine one eighty seven one four five six nine one\nAll right this is Dr ... helpline live and uh I Do want to cover one last the aspect of today's subject and that has been to discuss the prostate the urine or attract but\nAlso of course we wanted to touch on the lungs and the lungs are our giant mucus membranes that of course they're actually in Chinese medicine the backup to your large intestine show when we're not digesting well\nWe can expect jump to be dumped into the lungs and all manner of problems can arise with the lungs and in almost every case what we have to start with is to improve digestion when we promote the best health digestion\nWe can greatly reduce the load on the lungs when we get a vitamin D levels to the ideal maybe sixty to a hundred ... leader in the blood just about no one who's wearing clothing has a really ideal vitamin D three level\nAnd it's been shown to be involved in literally all of the immune compounds the body makes it's been shown to be very critical to the intestinal lining\nThe integrity of the lining to the health of the lungs\nAnd so much more so than jumping on R D three gold and maybe using six to ten drops a day if you're under forty\nUsually can absorb this really well if you're over forty than it might be a good idea to put those six to ten drops into a half ounces of water and he had two or three or four drops of Lyman that's essential oil of orange\nMix it really good and now it takes a deep three to ... tiny little\nDots and it makes it really an impulsive buys it so it makes it really easy for you to absorb it and get its maximum help for the intestines and for the lungs\nWhen another wonderful thing that can be done is dragging the Clintons LAX because of the extraordinary ability for the is clay to bind to a wide variety of toxins and the G. I. track\nAnd it can trap these toxins and about keep them there keep them from hitting the bloodstream and hitting the lungs and then they can be screened it and not ribs or by the body said today we'll have our deep three gold on special you buy one get the second one fifty percent off\nBut also have are dragging clans LAX give a ... eight hundred three Seventy thirty four\nForty seven minutes eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven All right this is talk to about Marshall pitch Davis has helped my live or answering your\nNutrition and health related calls he reaches toll free triple eight five eighty Seventy five Seventy Sixers go right back to the phones let's go to Richard in Boulder, Colorado and he's bloating and wants to track down\nSource of is intestinal gas so are you there Richard yes I Am doc thanks for taking my call Iraq I'm holding the man or even how much do you weigh\nForty three about one Seventy eight the odds are that the intestine when gas now is from either the gall bladder or your stomach is not able to produce enough ... Cora gas it and those are the two culprits\nNormally with intestinal gas does the gas you have to have an older boy does it ever\nOkay well that is going to tell you that fats and proteins are being are rotting and so we now highly suspect they she oh so do you have bloating almost immediately after you eat [noise]\nI think so I notice if I'm getting liquids for example um I'll do raw milk fair I don't really seem to have anything any of it that allows\nSmoking or non stop there say raw food does not require any digestive enzymes so that I Know no need for aid shell or anything so you got to exclude those we got to deal with the cooked food\nOkay yeah so yeah so that what happened is I've been taking ac out maybe two or three and acted Nader mhm I'm immediately after eating and then if I remember I was trying to take it ends up I don't use your mother\nThat's probably the problem let me tell you why [laughter] well I'm not here to knock anybody else's product but normally when you buy the teen hide record it'll contain perhaps and\nThe catalyst that make it work in the stomach we know that when you mix perhaps in with hydrogen gas it a Hydrox or a gas it's slowly destroys the maps and\nSo we put the ... in digest so you need to take a couple of our diet just at the start of the meal now you have pets and\nNow the end of the meal you take the ... and it works like downtown but I can tell you in the whole world I Am not aware of a single enzyme that works half as good as ours and I'm really I I can tell you with search the earth to get these\nIs a Japanese company that makes these they've been making them since Eighteen Ninety eight they have three airplane hangar sized buildings they supplied China they supplied so much of the world\nBut in America we're manufacturing these and we cannot manufactured to the purity of precision that they can at this time\nSo that is why and what I'm going to say to you Richard as you try ours if you don't think it's the best year ever reuse return it will give you a refund but I'm going to tell you once you get it you're hooked [laughter]\nSet in front of call that a few of them with like the first one or two\nDied just at the start of a meal even if you forget and take it at the end works almost as good in the end you would take a couple of age ... and you know that it's working because there'll be no plaque on your teeth and if you have ... you know you have low Hedrick Oric as it\nNow the other problem we have is we pass forty and that includes you is that we're facing a real gall bladder crises in America everybody has something going on with their gall bladder and what we have the news is that much of it is from eating highly heated\nCould well two things number one is going to be digestion\nIs she on digestive enzymes\nNo well there's no way she has to address their meal every time she eats the food's rotting\nShow what you need to do is get on the quantum died just or something like it will give her ... and ... two of those at the start of the meal than the end of the meal about maybe for between ...\nAnd now there's no more rotting food step on\nHer and step to the ... back\nThose patching laws of hair is almost Fisher linked to the adrenal so you want to get adrenal support\nAnd she would need to take about six of those at breakfast and she would yes and use that I got yes the news there ain't too much and during that might\nNot a wind up chicken pickup for the ...\nOnly at breakfast okay okay now she's got to you got to check whether it'd be sure she sleeps five straight hours or more\nThat you got to make sure good then you're going to make sure she has a new water which would be a half or waiting ounces of water so Seventy five ounces per day in jail to build up to that if she don't getting enough\nIs she can increase eight ounces a day once a week until she gets the water you got to double check salt if sheets all whole food not doesn't buy any processed food then she may need a little air dried sea salt\nOr better yet are pink so that they're dried she's all with\nThe volcanic trace elements added to it\nSo she needs to cover all of these issues if she worries a lot about something she may need some extra be and all these things will bring her back to the center for the adrenal function okay\nWhat about ... ... ... that would be if she has to get up at night deer and ate like for no reason to get one and she gets up once at night well that's not good yeah the ... floor would be good for maybe ... or at breakfast\nAnd shit and usually after about two three weeks you'll see that the body is then able to use it to promote the best structure there and you no longer have an issue\nSome ... oh okay okay thank you will keep them\nThank you for listening to

stood for truth justice and the American way while we're the motto Superman was always on time and he never fails and so I thought if I'm going to start a plumbing company I Want to be like ...\nOf ... sure yeah I have a lot of ah things here that we can help people with\nUm first of all if you do call in to our line right now to go live on the radio were happy to send you free copy of my book\nSome cells and platelets therapy and then the most important part of that title is the sublime which is regenerate don't operate what does that mean it means instead of putting a knife in and taking tissue out which for the most part and orthopedic procedures which are elective\nWe don't need to do that anymore we know can recruit the tissue with simple injections you just walk into the office you can have your blood drawn we spin it we'd take out the red cells\nAnd we inject the platelets and I've used that on many places on my body with fantastic killing results\nMy shoulder was locked up about a year ago from hitting way too many golf balls every night after work\nAnd um\nI didn't listen just like most do folks do listen when things start to hurt you keep at it and then uh the joint breaks down or the ligaments or the tendons around the joint and then you end up with a chronic pain area\nAnd that's what the platelets help get rid of we call it ... ... ... rich plasma and most of these things are easier to fix we do need surgeons I'm not putting down surgeons but for the electric procedures things you know like rotator cuff terrorists and the shoulders\nOr miniscule tears and the knees and many of the common arthritis type things and the joint\nWe can use your own cells from the body than when we have a tough case a advanced arthritis something like that we're gonna go direct to using your bone marrow we get that from the back of the pelvis\nIt's very quick procedure also and in the bone marrow there are stem cells and platelets together you don't need to take blood um when you're doing bone marrow it's already in the bone marrow\nAnd then we can we can inject that also in the area where you're having these pain things going on so I just got a question then it's his knee so let's see what that has to do with what we're talking about\nOh this is a very interesting person says the attended a seminar in their home town in Michigan on on biblical cord stem cell injections\nQuestion I have some interest in it for my knee and I'm Wondering how long the treatment will last\nI went to my orthopedic doctor and naturally he doesn't think this treatment will work\nAnd he said something like your body keeps losing stems cells\nWell a lot of that is true but a lot of it was false because if we take it from your own body\nTheir lives cells and especially from the bone marrow the sills\nContinue to duplicate and they attached to the area where there is a problem believe it or not these cells are already being released as you're sitting here listening to me on the radio without any doctor touching you and they help keep you alive\nAnd rejuvenating your body\nBut when you have a chronic issue you need some of these cells placed right in the area now the question is will things like on biblical cord stem cells help or not the same way because they're already did\nWhen a company takes cells from somebody else the drive them out\nAnd reconstitute them and those are not really active stem cells there may be dead stems cells in there but it's not the same as using what we call ... ... those are stems cells from your own bone marrow done right on the spot\nSo be very careful there's a lot of chiropractors doing seminars doing workshops and they're basically selling this did stuff\nAnd I don't recommend when we have the ability to take your lives cells from your body and put them back in I have played around with these and bill local cords and plus into tissue and all that\nAnd uh I didn't get a whole lot of luck with it but uh that's just me you may have done it and found it to be tremendous value if you do it and you like it let me know I'd love to hear about it and the police you can reach me\nIs on

WWW dot LA stem cells dot com that's LA stem cells dot com lots of research there and even in the new buck\nLots of good stuff so\nYou have a standing by and that\nAll do I have questions [laughter]\n[noise] um this one is about daughter's a seal ... okay so what happens if you have a tour and a seal will this procedure work I'm just asking because my daughter played competitive soccer\nTore her a seal she had surgery to repair her ... and her a seal she has yet to return to sports I was against the surgery and wanted to try other alternatives but they were denied\nWhat can you tell me\nWell I'm not sure what that means they were denied that means they that this person wanted to do something else but insurance didn't pay for it I'm not real clear um let me see I emailed this person back I haven't heard back from them yet to see what actually took place\nBut any rate [noise] most people that have an ACL rupture that means the anterior cruise ship ligament which holds the ... or the league from slipping forward on the femur or the thigh bone\nMost people that have that problem if you want to call it a problem don't have a problem\nBecause the knees especially of athletes are very strong and have a lot of muscle around there and other ligaments that hold the need together\nSo it's sort of I'll use a pun a knee jerk reaction to get the surgery done because an MRI shows a rupture\nMemorize can be wrong they're overly sensitive and they show things that are not real sometimes surgeons go into repairing ACL and they go oh my God the ACL is there the more I was wrong\nSo this is another one of those the horses are out of the barn how do you close the barn door and keep the horses and it's too late she already had a surgery repairs are miniscule switch usually does not have to be repaired and a repair it or a seal which usually doesn't have to be repaired\nSo what would I have done I Would have taken a look with my ultrasound inside the knee if there was some fluid and there I Would have taken it out which helps get rid of pain immediately unleaded heal up\nSo I don't know what to tell this person at this point I Need to examine that me and see what is going on but we do find that regenerative medicine helps most of these cases\nAnd I've used it on my daughter's knees I have twin Seventeen year olds who are soccer players with good success\nAnd um I've used it on some of their friends who have had quote a seal ruptures and healed them up also now will be a seal actually come back together I don't know the reason I don't trust the him arise to tell me anyway\nSo I Hope to make sense to all your folks listening be very careful about doing the surgery you do not need to do\nExcellent our number is one eight six six eight seven zero five seven five too and we're going to attack to David in Los Angeles [noise]\nPay that Dr Marc Darrow I understand that you have low back pain is that true\nAnd I got a couple of different issues yeah well I got low low back pain that hey I'm I've got basically all the wind is that's a\nCollapsed or well gee what a doctor put in terms of collapsing degenerative Scalia else is\nThey just basically I don't pay for it and I just do stretching stretching\nA good I was doing version of cable but I just had a heart issue down there ... told me not to do it right now to the American table\nWas curious I Try to stay not with you but I went to another doctor and I had a space so\nUm [noise] ... ah I I think there were a clone\nAnd the Arctic cells some online till I'm white for plus or something or turned out that set us yeah\nRight and I had a shot and I said the disc areas but they they shot it around that area towards the spine but on the sides is fine you know I felt the need to grow there\nSo you had dead you had dead cells put in your back okay what do you do in order to to put them into a bottle and sell them they have to be cleaned up and dried out and build and then reconstituted with some liquid so they can be injected I don't do that\nHow you live cells we called atomic is telling us means that comes from your body there live they duplicate\nAnd they're very healing cells I Can't vouch for the stuff you had done in one way or another other than to tell you these companies send it to me all the time they're gonna try it out on my body to when I have an injury and I've never had any success with it\n[noise] [noise] so the question it down and just saying it's not it's not the same thing right\nRight so my question is is I went to a total of eleven struck grass\nIssue in the ... with the treatment injected directly like hey man I mean for the treatment basically be\nShooting in the discussion they actually when they're so collapse of share some of them were close to build on well not quite low number 'cause I mean what would it be able to actually\nRebuild or improve the situation\nLet me ask you a question if I can get rid of your pain and you have full function do you care what happened\nIn August snow as long as it doesn't know it it yeah\nNo I you know you don't care what happened there are studies that show injecting the ligaments can reform the disks but I don't think it's relevant\nBut I think what's relevant is defined where your pain is coming from animal and he'll that area most of these things in the neck and back come from what we call an emphasis on top of the the emphasis is we're ligaments her tendons or muscle attached to bone\nAnd when it rained I assume I'm by the sound of your voice you're old enough to have had a sprained ankle and your life\nAll that number yeah I'm sixty five\nYeah you've had a number of times and so have I and it hurts like heck does that mean you need to have a surgery\nOr does it yeah\nSo we were very careful I mean I'm hoping that all you have is a sprained ankle and you're back\nHome\nAnd that's what most people have and unfortunately too many people get surgery when they shouldn't have had it to get surgery for sprained ankle [noise]\nSprained\nAnd your opinions are always the most important things so we try to get to some of these topics some of them are kind of
