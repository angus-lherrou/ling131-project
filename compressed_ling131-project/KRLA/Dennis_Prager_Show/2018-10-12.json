very good very good very good but I'm busy and I sometimes uh lose track\nOf professional baseball wearing Dodger blue today I Am are you seeing what a coincidence tonight game one of the national league championship series of course the Dodgers are taking on the Milwaukee Brewers\nMhm that's right and at the game I think starts around five o'clock at night can check that out for sure now the experts are saying that this is going to be a tight series however according to experts in the sports field to study major league baseball they said the Dodgers are favorite in this game\nAnd in this series despite the brewers eleven game winning streak this is a pretty big production because everything that that is in my heart makes me think that the brewers should be favored here they've been hot\nHot hot at all the right time but according to CBS Sports Dodgers your favorite in this game and the theories and that's good news rather than LA Jennifer\nYou said on this morning at your broadcast I think it was last week I think it was early last week when you openly said that you are fearful of the Dodgers playing the brewers and I believe you said the brewers are better baseball team well the brewers\nHave I think the British have a better record I have to double check that but the Bruce got hot at the right time and so that's so much about baseball is striking and at the Dodgers have not been streak each team they did a lot of winning and they did a lot of losing during the season they didn't really go on any long runs the brewers are\nYou're never gonna hot has a Dodger fan this use and you didn't get tired of when\nI have not been no I've never heard of winning as a ... it's going to be starting tonight keep in mind the last series I read it started at which

crazy oh come on I'll tell you why in a second take a listen to the over the top dramatic\nPromo for tonight's millennia Trump interview\nFriday night on the substance for millennia Trump is first leading Maloney Trump you did agree to the center of your credit no preconditions growing doctor could be some some questions [noise]\nCan win in the mid ... call us for this Friday night no question is awesome when you're not the first first lady to\nHave to deal with her husband's infidelity has has put a strain on your marriage exclusively the sort of a jacket ...\nWhy did you were with the person [noise] what's the biggest misconception about Russia\nBeing alone you know the first week of and special friday nine to ten and central on\nOkay ABC is leaking out snippets of the millennia Trump interview the latest one that we have is about her husband's the president's alleged infidelity where she sort of denies them more says it's the media blows it out of proportion\nUm it seems sometimes like I Know more about their marriage than she does\nWell I I don't know if that's true I mean she's in the marriage so she knows what kind of relationship she has I think it's interesting certainly that she's come out and she's really presenting herself to be and Trump either way has adjusted his rhetoric and talk more about what millennia says\nThey're they're presenting her as a partner to Trump and I'm Wondering just because I always look at the political and I don't think there are many accidents in politics is this a way to bring in more women to the party maybe women who are in the middle who might still like millennials who are saying oh look at this is his partner and maybe this is how they're presenting themselves\nWell it would be very wise ... it would be smart if that was the strategic a effort here because the gender gap that President Trump is dealing with\nOnly thirty two percent of females in America approve of the job President Trump is doing that is a significant gender gap and I can promise you one thing you don't win re election with a gender gap that wide\nAnd if you have someone who's presenting themselves like millennia it sounds we haven't seen this ... interview yet so all reserved my judgment but my speculation as we are going to the ... millennia present herself\nMy friends are here to be with you on this Friday maybe opening up with one of the most distinguished people back of our time in my opinion [noise] many if you will recall\nThat when Stephen Harper was the prime minister of Canada which he was a for nearly a decade between two thousand six and twenty Fifteen [noise] I was I said to you I think the best leader in the world at this time is Stephen Harper I said this when he wasn't listening he's now listen to me\nBut I said what he was it I said that\nHe was in effect the Ronald Reagan of Canada\nAnd now I have him on the line and use his book is literally hours it published today or published this week right here right now and it is his thoughts on what is happening in the world today specifically\nThe phenomena of Donald Trump the phenomenon and beat or Stephen Harper the phenomena of other leaders and the ignoring of a lot of their own citizens\nBut of course I Will let him explain what he's written and just say that it is an honor to have ... former prime minister of Canada Stephen Harper on the line well concert to buy show yeah\nThank you that bank you or you're very kind words I I Do know that you that it was well with it but I appreciate hearing it now at first\nWell I'm Glad you knew it while you were in office that that means a lot [laughter] I by the way I just ... just before we START I I Love Canada I have been to nine of the ten provinces I've spoken to nine of the pen provinces by quite a few courageous speech for me I'm prince Edward island\nThen I can say all in fact uh [laughter] so [laughter] I Know you we\nWe will keep that in my yes I Do have cloud [laughter] there are there are pretty a limited baking opportunity there I ... yeah [laughter] I mean a lighter bat\n[laughter] ... [laughter] pretty limited to speak he got it for two to do that was you're a best of the stick but All right so tell us the thesis of your book\nSo that I wrote the book uh obviously you know from my background that prime minister but in the context of who will lie no have I run my own global consulting business in which I one of the things that you buy\nThe claims around the world about ethical read one third man and how to respond and prepare for that but also I'm chairman of the idea would go at a rate of conservative party the Republican Party the United states and a twenty eight and I had been serving a obviously a theory of\nNew and unorthodox than unexpected electro Donald Trump's election boat primary victories in general election victory was the biggest but the ... ... ...\nA lot of the day to day reporting in calling this are simply not that bad and in terms of federal federal politics cup which I I Would not today considered the national posed the conservative paper\nIn terms of the day to day coverage in federal politics but its editorial rely light remains\nRelatively concern the more conservative papers are actually what's called the sun chain their tabloids but they are quite um quite consistently conservative\nShow where what an American goal for thoughtful Canadian conservative news coverage nowhere\nTo hide it tough yeah you have a while you have you have to you have to look um you have to really find individual journalists hum\nHum and and I would also say that you know that there's a huge market and particularly the phenomenon you have in the United states with podcast um you know I think there's a big market candidate for that kind of thing to take off as they say there is a\nYou know thirty percent of Canadians were always vote right of center at least thirty percent bottom it's kind of the ... the low number\nAnd so that that audiences in my judgment if I were an entrepreneur and the media business I'd be trying to figure out how to get to that audience which for the most part has very little and the way of of outlet servicing them\nWhat about young people or let me put it let me actually before we get to the young people you said something that's very important to me that the polarization in the United states left and right doesn't exist in Canada is ... not to the same thing right\nSo it was but but on the issues they differ ... justice clearly as the left white differ in the United states so is it because the Canadian temperament is just more subdued wow why isn't there that polarization\nI think the fact that you know I I ... I hate the generalized Asians about our country but it's a fact that Canadians having more civil public discourse and always have\nUm it it's also the case that\nA larger percentage of Canadians are not idiot logically committed the you know the number of people who would be\nHard core conservative or heart or left liberal\nWould be much smaller and the percentage of the population that for between party significantly bigger and Canada\n... ... I think the other factor that often for God\nWhen people can they can uh when people compare Canadian American politics as we have more than two party and that really changes the dynamic significantly I always say well you know the strictly to party them you know if a candidate a hack candidate B.\nHe can bring candidate B. down in a in a system where he got more than two party there's always a risk that a candidate a attacked candidate B. effectively the winner becomes Kennedy the who's\nNot oh how I listen to this has been a great honor ... book is right here right now it is up with Dennis Prager dot com thank you for\nThis is Pam eight Seventy answer\nTraffic bad\nBack in ... along the line heading south down to things like ... ... they shut down all linked to the investigation is actually gone down in laying down you're going to see a loading up by some Santa Monica mom I\nStand in Culver City when I was hired is on the phone I'll find eating like Washington Heights sentimental lanes boxing everything stopped some last here on the on the vine and Jamie ...

that it\nWould be advised for honoring apparent withdrawn or not really interested in being involved with me and my family like kind of stems back to divorce issues and what you're talking in the past our hum\nButton or I guess residual effects from a divorced childhood um but I guess in starting a new family started over which my mom has done the fame and she has a totally different experience but I'm with him and I don't know if it's more\nWhen I got me to understand something so he that your parents divorced and then he withdrew from you\nI guess not not in it or not I I'm not intense\nSorrow but they're like ... years haven't started new families both of them my father is more than of involved with a new you know it is my wife\nAnd right so I did some aren't sure why summarized you accurately you're saying that he withdrew from you because he became preoccupied with the new guy like oh it seems that way so you're asking how old are you honor him 'cause I'm a big one on honoring parents in almost every case so I don't know so\nMy my biggest ... about okay well that's my biggest example of honoring parents staying in communication if they don't if they are a\nAmbivalent or if they are recalcitrant are hesitant\nYou have to do what you have to do so uh you you make you make periodic calls or you send them email just checking in if they don't want to respond they didn't you\nWe have to do the right thing and again this is this is my single biggest example of why I Believe people need religion\nPeople or need to be told on or your father and your mother because of God wasn't behind that a lot of people would not honor their parents\nSo since got told me the honor my parents are unless it is an extraordinary situation of pure evil on their part I have to do that how they respond is their business whether I honor them is my business\nFor ... hard to have a a one sided relations\nYou're right so so you know what they said you send email\nAnd that's it you you will be able to uh have a peaceful life after your parent is gone you did your best\nYou will have no guilt feelings I don't know why don't cost you to periodically get in touch it's not a big deal or if there's no positive reinforcement than there is no positive reinforcement my father call his mother every night she yelled at him every night\nHe put the phone on the kitchen table I hear her yelling at him he picked up the phone and go yeah ma yam I'll put it back down and he and he had absolutely no guilt feelings after she left this world\nOkay [noise] okay All right\nThank you You're welcome ... it's ... and this is the beauty of of\nFeeling that that the almighty has the creator of the earth has told me what to do it doesn't say on or your parents provided they respond provided they're nice [laughter]\nYou don't need a command to honor nice parents [laughter] that's that's the whole point it out or your father and mother even if they're twins\nFact if you end up the Hebrew word for father and the Hebrew word for ... there you go\nYou know because you had letters in Hebrew letters all have a numerical equivalent that they go I'm kidding about the ... the parents are there was a
