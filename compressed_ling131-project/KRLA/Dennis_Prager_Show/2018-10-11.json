this for decades but I have now put it in the context of the current political situation I Believe that we will be seeing more violence from the left\nAnd I would like to give you a theory as to why I I mean my first theory I wrote up a few weeks ago in a very important column\nI Know it's important because it got just on town hall if you were twenty two thousand but what is it again what do I forget that we're not forwards or were people pass on to them no no no come on guys [noise]\nChairs yes I don't know why it's sick of shares its terms of stocks I think that's the problem\nAnyway I wrote the first reason I Believe that is\nThat the left unlike liberals again the left\nDo not believe that they are obligated to the to society's rules of behavior fact Hillary Clinton said that just now did you see that\nWe have we ever saying if we have a clip or any way if we do I would like to get it I Want and the Eric Holder to exactly right when they're down uh\nYou are part of the family

of myself as long as I Want anyway but I can guarantee you I have a lot of self esteem so I just want\nTo limit or ... or you know it's an important subject what do you think of giving trophies to kids who are losing teams\n... so you okay so I have two theories about your notion of self esteem which would have worked with mine one is\nThat there is when you said I Want you to know your child of God I couldn't agree with you more that's not the self esteem to the psychologist to talking about with regard to rapists and murderers and the like\nNot that they they don't walk around thinking I Am a child of God has promised to Seattle okay so I agree with you in that we are all in God's image this gives us the certain pressure ...\nThat is unique to every one of us I I I learned that as a child in my religious school and I believe that\nThe self esteem they're talking about is I Am terrific\nI don't think you told your children you are terrific\nAnd we you know okay you're even laughing so that that proves my point so isn't there at the other is you believe I I won't put words in your mouth I'll tell you say I Believe I Believe in er into self esteem I totally believe if you have done well and you have done good\nThen you should think highly or or well a viewer cheap and that's a very that's a totally healthy thing okay so I think we're on board on that the self esteem movement wanted you to feel good about yourself no matter how you behaved\nIrrespective of religion is asking sell us grew up Catholic got very angry at his Catholic upbringing rejected it this is a secular self esteem yours is religious self esteem I think there's a big difference I don't see eventually will Christians going out there\nAnd screaming at a legislate tours or pro choice stopping
