...\n... what is the what was the ... rhetoric that top Democrats would be targeted\nNow I Know if they'll say about media and that is that he he said that the ... and the enemy of the people\nNow if I could have ... on the show this is what I Would ask her I Would say\nI'd like to establish where our perceptions of reality begin to defer when they have to start at some point would similarity so

conspiracy theories\n\nIf I talk that clearly I really don't deserve a radio show this is not to insult to it it it's the whole life does that make these massive charges and I I I don't know what they're referring to what does that mean a battle of conspiracy theories\nIs it a conspiracy theory if she could think it's a conspiracy theory that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in a in the last election\n\nI'm curious which he acknowledged that is a conspiracy theory by the way you haven't heard much about that lately have you\nWonder why\nWhat if it turns out to be essentially nothing\nIs what will happen nothing\nLeft lies dominates the media for a year or two with allies they turn out to be lies and then they move onto the next why that's the way it works there is no

create\nA ... and I got older I got a lot of questions here so I I happen to know by\nBy sheer will not totally sure chance I cared a lot to know but I did go down to Honduras at the time with his lawyer a controversy or when she tried to install himself on undo the constitution and installed himself for another term as president\nAnd the ... the Supreme Court of Honduras and the Congress even his own party assumed that this is an untenable\nA book or he or she persisted in any event and then was kidnapped than maybe it was it was remarkable what time and a number in history so my first question is what\nWhat does the left in a in Latin America half the game with this caravan\nMay be more and I want to be more precise may be the miscalculated it seems to me and I think to a fair number of Democrats who she's only helping the Republicans\nAccurately and I think there was a greatness calculation um you know especially if they were trying to affect\nUs election or and U.S policy and for example with ally in Honduras and and you get a great explanation of that history with the ... it's basically an ongoing war with the current government and it's basically this continuous battle with the current government\nBut the destabilizing Central America stabilizes ... it draws risk\nIn our relationship we saw that they you know the United states government and the Guatemalan government have a very strong relationship but when you have this well a migration\nComing across their border and remember they're much more like the European Union a lot of people in the United states don't understand that but Central America allows people to flow freely from Honduras Nicaragua back and forth you know to various theories in Central America\nA ... it's so they can't really just close the border down if people have their paperwork\nSo what the Guatemalan government was doing while I was there is they had buses ready to go they were explaining to the people that have United States is not going to let you in\nThat the Mexican government that this is a very dangerous journey and there were some children there that they had been white to please hit on the bus let us get you back home let it get you back home safely now of course the organizers of the group we're talking against that no we're moving forward we're going forward\nBut Guatemala was able to actually return nearly according to their their calculations around thirty nine hundred to four thousand people back to Honduras\nThe problem however again is with that once the Caribbean started moving\nMoving through Guatemala moving to Mexico and movie ended ... more and more people were joining in so now you have it swelled to estimates right now are like fourteen thousand\nCreating a potential problem for the U.S I think we've towards the border which is the reason why the department of defense today under a James Mattis is now looking at a point eight hundred troops to the border\nOn to the U.S border in order to stop the penetration of these people from coming into the United states should be some concern you remember this is it just women and children which of course are going through it very treacherous track\nTo these countries um and and you know the heat and exhaustion and everything else that goes with it that dangerous to their own physical body and the

station McCall\nWell my friends the\nThe general tone of course of the media is what do you expect Donald Trump has been fomenting all this violent hatred and that's the reason for these bombs pseudo bombs real bombs not real bombs ... I don't I don't really know yet\nAnd the\n... that I have a vote I offered at the beginning of the last hour is very simply the the amount of rhetoric of hate and of calls for in your face physical behavior and the actual\nViolent behavior has been so overwhelmingly from the left that each it's almost surreal that people would say it's the president's rhetoric\nNow\nForgetting these this bomb issue about which we know nothing with regard to who sent them and why but putting putting that aside\n\nWhat speakers are threatened at colleges do you know the for the first time in my life of decades of lecturing\nI have asked for security when I go to ... Colorado State next week I have never asked for security I've been given it routinely but it's it's as if to me it always struck me as a sort of pro forma thing you know two wonderful police officers would accompany me for my car\nBut in this case I actually asked for\nThe rhetoric of hatred that has been directed against me in the in the Colorado State newspaper is is quite remarkable if it is it is probably the like lies\nIt is all made up everything about me is made up everything\nAnd it doesn't it doesn't matter to them because the truth is not a left wing value I said that my whole life this proceeds Donald Trump this proceeds Ronald Reagan this perceives ah\nIt emanates from my study of the left from a college graduate school on\nIt has never been a left wing value it's a liberal value to conservative value but it was on the left wing value\nAnd this is this is a perfect example where my mind is what I mean there are there are so many and the cost of violence but you wouldn't even Mika Brzezinski acknowledged Maxine Waters telling people get into the face of of politicians\nWonder what I'd like to know the last time that a member of Congress of the United states\nTold people to act on civil e towards fellow congressman\nThe other party I Wonder if there is a precedent to Maxine Waters truly an ugly human being that I'm not speaking of her physically I never in my life talk about people's physical or looks it has nothing to do with that piece ugly in character in temperament\nDecency and morality\nAnd it it but it doesn't matter because it's you know it doesn't matter\nBut to her credit Mika Brzezinski after blaming the president then goes through the let me of of including Hillary Clinton will only be civil if we win as she said that there was last week Lori Clinton will return disability after we win\nYes look the or the face of the left is coming through there is a way to defeat the left though there is a way to embolden liberals as opposed to a leftist and managed to defeat them\nIn this upcoming election you see it will be very hard for the left\nTo convince the Democrats other Democrats there are after all liberal Democrats not all the leftist they support a leftist party to their shame but they're not all leftists but they will have a harder sell hey our way is the better way if they can't even\nBeat Donald Trump owning owning the

a twenty dollar bill is probably the most controversial do everybody now for the left his controversial\nWho lived before them [noise] ah so that's not telling you much but uh we have a scholar on here professor of history and American studies would Hillsdale College Bradley burgers or\nJust written a new book which I Will be reading 'cause I I'm just finishing sliced sheer coincidence I mean in some very very very very very very very long book on Andrew Jackson and I'm real interested in the\nAmerican president and general and so on Bradley ... professor of history the book is in defense of Andrew Jackson\nAnd professor welcome to the dentist Prager show\nDennis Hi thank you so much for having me on great honor\nThat's very kind of you to say I am honored show the ... the the indictment of Andrew Jackson is I think the largely over his treatment of American Indians is that fair to say\nYeah I think that's probably at least since the late Nineteen sixty that's been the great critique of the\nOf course that's kind of ... feet into all kinds of culture and especially in the textbooks that our children are reading so yeah that that's where it came from and generally the other thing that people will argue about but that really the Indians problem is the main problem that comes up with him right\nSo what is your defense\n[noise] so [laughter] what a great question [laughter] especially since I have a book titled that it\nCan yeah I agree it's a little unfair yeah\nIt it well it is and it's also kind of one of those titles that that we've touched me and said why is that right ... but you know there are a lot of things that we could say about Jack the terms of putting into decline tax\nWhen it comes to the actual Indian removal\nYou know I actually think that that's what I Would love to jump right back in the court yes was it of course I I understand ready to go to commercial with the what I wanted to make was that\nHalf the time ... was actually considered as a moderate on the issue of American indian some ... really really went after him for being as they would have called it an American Indian water\nAnd the reason was because as president and he's really cutting costs cutting the budget which he did very effectively he also was laying out tons of money for the removal of the Indian to put their resettled west there were a lot of people who thought why is Jackson spending money of white\nPeople so that read people could settle in these great areas on the great plains\nI it was really sought after land so Jackson at the time so different from the day and as you say we have no moral knew what that certainly doesn't have the time it was a really complicated issue and chats and it was very worried without question was worried that\nWhites and blacks would have very very high procreate a birth rate\nThat they were just going to destroy the Indian culture simply by surrounding than out populating them to remove all to the western territories was way to actually protect the Indian cultures that we used to be talking about the again the execution that that was horrible but his intention I think was generally a good one\n[noise]\nThat that's fascinating and that's one of the book is an important book now you don't defend him on the Indian issue you have a general defense of Andrew Jackson\nYou know it's one of the things I found so I think we all do that and it's true that Jackson was an incredibly violent man there's just no way around that in every way he was but he also had really certain rules\nSo that violence never ever could be applied to women or children that was the same actually for blacks as well as for Indians and white\nGiven the prospect strangely enough thought or beautifully enough yet it's strange interesting respect that women are buried deep respect to the point actually he's almost ... times and he treats again Indian women as well as black woman or white wearing\nVery very well but the other thing I found about it and so he's got his violence but he's got this ethic that's really interesting but I also found that has been you know counter so many current politicians the guy was just\nUnbelievably artist in everything he did and I think it would it kill his soul to have done something that would have been misleading or dishonest that that's how much of a stickler was about living out this deep deep profound honesty and integrity it's really quite stunning\nHow did he get to I I I don't really get his a bullet wound\nOh well somebody at a couple of getting quite a few things in a number of Jules back he had been a pre teen in that scene at a Thirteen year old he fought in the American revolution along with his brother and they had actually been captured in\nJackson during imprisonment and mouth off to a British soldier that sort of it's stored can actually beat in Jackson skull I even feel it would Jackson died a dope male could still layer finger in that poll curries\nAdd it wouldn't be actually even with the rest of the school that was that's the kind of thing ... that would never forget by hitting people I'm sure you were thinking\nBy the way it was ... I I we have very little time but I bought an older from you was such a scholar and if folks you really should read this book I Can't wait to read this or is it is it fair to say I'm totally different would be if it isn't he hated the British more than he hated Indians\nI don't think there's any question about that this is yeah you just didn't cross Andrew Jackson and because that soldier did that go ahead Jack ... ever after yeah\nThat's what I thought you are a delight and uh the folks the book is in defense of Andrew Jackson scrupulously on us guys you can see the joy to speak to him\nAnd will do it again and go to a prayer for Hillsdale about ...\nAll right everybody I Am not back home at the studio so I Am not sitting on my sponsor the ex chair I give you my word I Wish I were if I'm so spoiled by\nThat in the studio I'm broadcasting in Minneapolis it's not going to the local station it's because I have to be in St Paul for meeting\nA where I'm sure their chairs are wonderful but I I periodically just keep standing well broadcasting or you will get totally spoiled by the next three go to X cheer Dennis dot com used the promo co Dennis you get a hundred dollars off and a free foot rests plus thirty days you could send it back\nOr I just want you to know but if you have your own office or you have employees\n... chair Dennis dot com I truly think you will thanked me next chair Dennis dot\nSpring here for American federal rare coin and bullying I've always been a strong believer in precious metals investments and I've always been\nFascinated with rare coin collecting I Love going\nBut owning the role of coins and only making dealers a lot of money can hurt your investment portfolio American federal rare coin billion specializes in taking people out of them performing coin portfolios and turning them into gold silver or platinum William Taylor a portfolio based on your goals and not what they\nWant to sell you will never experience scare tactics misleading hyper high pressure sales from older ... grove itch and\nIs very knowledgeable staff bill evaluate your portfolio show you how you're going to perform and take the time to educate you on the ugly industry practices so that you can make an informed decision smart people can make very bad investments when they're under pressure unlocked the facts\nGoal my friends at American federal rare calling in ... eight hundred two to one Seventy six million before that's eight hundred two to one Seventy six million before American federal dot com\nWhere Dennis ... of the morning answer team and walk Larry Elder get reliable in depth information on the stories in the news from the epoch times newspaper\nWorking you get the same trusted reporting from the epoch times newspaper the times newspaper is sexual and unbiased reason issue exposed China's attempt to meddle in our mid term election as a story about how TV news was rigged against Kavanaugh at another on the danger of tech giants influencing young voters\nYou also get extensive information on travel and health issues the epoch times newspaper is a treasure trove of information\nHave a range from I Am eight Seventy listeners three see both home delivery and digital access for only one dollar just by logging on to trusted newspaper dot coms complements me Larry Elder\nThat's trusted newspaper dot com get your four week trial for only a block at trusted newspaper dot com that's trusted newspaper dot com\nJohn's fly celebrates everything red and white and blue show your patriotic spirit and your home for a bright future with help from Johns lives in polls in riverside over\nForty years of courteous service in the old fashioned hospitality jobs is proud to serve in the spirit of gratitude and respect for old glory Jones is among\nThe leaders stuffing and extensive line of legs flood bowls him gifts\nFor ... hours and into visit John's flags dot com\nThat's John's flags dot com\nHere is our events director family with your ... to go\nJoin morning answer ...

...\nLast night in Dallas we had Sean Spicer ... very good guy\nAnd Larry Elder and\nLet's see Mark Davis\nAnyway it's these are wonderful evenings if you can get in I don't know if you can get in right now I think it's think it's over\nBut that's why I'm here\nAnd it's been intense week as you can imagine every day different city\nBut I have the\nPrager elder mid ... in Minnesota okay thank you that's an answer to that in life you\nTake the kind of take the the\nPerspective it's a big factor in my happiness my own happiness and in in my happiness approach and in my book on happiness you\nWith out prospective happiness is impossible there are many things that are necessary for happiness so it's an art happiness really is an art in fact I think there was a book about his book of the art of loving look there's a book the order of happiness the probably is but it is an art\nAnd\nOne of the things necessary for this artistic accomplishment just to have the a perspective\nAnd I think I mentioned this I I it's hard for me to remember everything that I say for three hours every single day but I think I think I mentioned this just this week as soon as in light of this\nEvery job comes with difficult parts every job is no such thing as it's not possible so you have to ask yourself is it worth it\nHe is the ... is the\nEr the rewards whether financial or moral or emotional\nOr so many others is is it worth it I mean it's not worth it then you have to if possible seek another job but it's it's all of life is like that you have to take the bigger picture is if you concentrate on the ... the pain of the moment it's a problem\nSo Megan Kelly is have been fired from NBC sixty three million dollars or something like that\nAnd I I I did\nNot to knock her I just thought it was not a fan so I'm not saying this because I was a fan I'm saying this because I'm a fan of\nOf a a society that has a ... that still retains the ... the notion of tape you made a mistake and you sincerely apologize it's over\n\nShe said something to the effect of talking about Halloween costumes and she didn't think they should be politically correct met a white can do looked like a black a black and looked like a white and then she got fired even though she apologized profusely tearfully the mix day because of the racist history of blackface in the United states\n\nSo that's what a yeah we could play let's play a short I mean if people should should here this is what the woman who also her livelihood over\nAnd you'll get in trouble if you are white per se or black or white but that was okay as long as you address character\n\nOkay so if you addressed if you were dressed as a character in other words you addressed as a specific human being\nSo\nYou could say it's foolish you could say you eat it it it it's insensitive\nTo the history of blackface in America but worthy of losing your livelihood is the punishment especially after one apologies the punishment not far greater than the crime\n\nOr looked so here's here's her ears are appalled this painful for me to hear the ... what the left forces it's really like these re education camps and communist countries where the the person ... ... for the for their life as it were ... and nobody knew how of of terrible they were ... book tear it goes [noise]\nHow I made in Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry [noise]\nWho made her that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it is ever okay for a percentage of one race to dress up as another black person making their face later or white person making errors darker to make a costume complete I defended the idea\nSaying as long as it as it was respectful and part of the Halloween ... fold okay well I was wrong and I am sorry\nOne of the great type a sitting in his chair and stay getting to discuss different points of view as I talk and sometimes I listen\nI Will say I learned I learned that given the history of blackface ... an awful way by race in this country and it's not okay for that to be part of our house so Halloween or otherwise\nSo why didn't end there I Believe that that's what she did learn I ... I don't I don't I don't get it\n\n... why why isn't she forgive him I had ... the a couple of weeks ago on the on the whole issue\nOf forgiveness and how it's like it's become a a\nA last item in the United states by the way I think it as an example I Do think\nI think people become meaner or in the in in America they have become meaner as they have left religion I Do believe that not everybody not every religious person who's calling that every secular person as me pay for those we went to graduate school and don't understand the concept of generalization I gave you the\nInformation but there's no question in this regard\nThat it\nIs just such a big feature of both Judaism Christianity forgiving the sincere tentative and ... if you don't think that she wishes she here in in her ... ... ... then then we'd have a different breed of what happened obviously\n\nSo I'll be now I'll give you an example which I totally understand is not an analogous I understand that but we remember it's gone crazy because we now talk about\nCultural appropriation where a white person can't wear a white man can wear a ... for example a a a a Mexican hat\nOr or or I don't know I guess you can't do a Greek dance so I don't know I I tend these night put on by churches these beautiful spectacularly impressive evenings of Mike to salute Israel might to honor Israel\nAnd churches around the country

any longer than that and I mean that may possibly be given the history there's no such thing as respectful are\nAppearing as a member of another race specifically white as a black may well be right but it it was ... it was so obviously not meant in a racist manner lose your livelihood\nThe next day after apologizing\nRemain replace folks that you can think the left\nI I it's I bring you the meanest that this is the core of left as him constantly they destroy lives would the ease with which you eat breakfast\nThat's their business destroying lives\n\nYeah look I I I'm the recipient of it
