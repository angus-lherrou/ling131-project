I'm already starting to get the mailers that come into slates have these cards for the different candidates in hand you know if you're not going to hear these good use from Democrats are you\nKnow you're not going to hear from the Democrats because the Democrats want to take control of the house and if the Democrats take control of the house we're not going to the the credit of accomplishment that we're seeing right now\nUh they are going to do everything in their power to try to impeach the president they're going to try to implement a more regulation and did they want to increase your taxes that mean Nancy Pelosi has cut down said she plans to increase taxes if they take control of the house\nSo it's really a choice between do you want to go back to the way it was under the Obama administration or do you want to continue to move forward and continue to have a bright future\nIn our country and I think the voters are going to say we like ... or the results I mean we're all about results not resistance I think the voters are going to like that\nYou referred to the money is crumbs we use the cells dollar bonuses different things that people are getting right now because of the economy doing better in business is\nHaving the ability to transfer to their workers from senators taxes I mean there's something to be said about that so it's really just a battle about that and

through California and so she has decided that she is going to try to take members of us out in Congress\nEspecially here in orange county you know I'm the only female Republican in the California delegation and I think uh she really wants to make sure that there are no females or the Republican side of the Democrats at Fort eight million dollars into my race recently\nAnd I think she wants to make a statement this is her last chance in my opinion to get the gal back\nA if she doesn't get it this time I don't think she's ever going to get it and she is pulling out all the stops and really really coming after\nForty fifth district describe boundaries what does that make up\nWe are on as far north as a villa park parts of orange Anaheim Hills comes down to a Tustin or buying a ... hills Laguna woods Lake Forest mission da ... coated to cause a rich of Santa margarita that's pretty much the area\nOr just a good chunk of such a diverse population some doing better than others what what can you say to the voters who are going to be getting their ballots in the next few days what message to them\nMy messages to have their voice heard be sure you go out and vote it's very very important to the um we need to make sure that Republicans maintain control of the house so that we can continue the agenda that we've put forward and we could make sure that people have a secure\nA future and they are prosper\nAnd that's what's really important to people security and economic prosperity and we are delivering for the people of the forty fifth district\nWhat message would you have devoted as well when we watch some in the mainstream media and the Democrats and the things they're throwing ya anything President Trump does what would we do remember\nJust look at the results I mean the Democrats are all about rhetoric and resistance and when we look at the results of what we produced and we've accomplished in this Congress since the hundred and fifty of Congress came in second January of twenty Seventeen\nWe have passed over nine hundred pieces of legislation out of the house I mean I think it's a record we haven't had that decades um we are doing what the American people have asked him or delivering a promises\nMade promises cat and we want to continue without agenda\nSo bad I guess we heard this week that even NAFTA has been renegotiated for the president doesn't know if Congress will approve of because they want to get Democrats Zuma don't want to have any success was for Trump\nAny thing that we have accomplished in the hundred and Fifteen Congress if the Democrats take control they will try to do everything and it will be chaos\nThey will try to impeach the president they will block them at every move he makes that nothing will get accomplished and I don't think the American people want that I think the American people are happy with the accomplishment\nShow who's motivated I mean you hear some of some of the liberal pulling she's very motivated but there's so much going on the news these days it might be motivating Republicans I mean maybe they're not so vocal about it but the crime we go in and vote don't they\nThey do and we feel very confident that are Republican voters will turn out and the ... election because I think they understand what's at stake or the less the far left\nIs very motivated um yeah they mentioned before you know the resistance to far far left a I've never seen this intensity and like twenty two years as an elected official on the left in orange county as I said at right now\nSo they're all about the resistance and on the right our people are really starting to pay attention to the economy there seeing the results we've\nBeen doing a lot of one on one meetings a lot of group meetings were really working very hard with our constituents\nAnd in talking to them and making sure they get the message and I really believe that they're going to come out and vote on election day\nSo it takes people listening they need to talk to their friends to help the fringe get out and participate in you know sometimes a lot of people who signed up to a vote by mail and everything comes in and it can be daunting and sitting on the counter got to make sure your vote twice\nIn my district in the forty fifth we've seen about sixty five percent of the people vote through absentee\nAnd that's a very high number I'm I have a a highly educated district and ah one that you know you basically when it in the ups and teeth\nIf you get people to send their ballot and there's going to be a very big effort on our part to make sure that people send in their ballot oh we're contacting voters on a daily basis\nAnd we will make sure that we do our best to get the message across to the voters how important this election is and how we have to make sure Republicans maintain control of the house\nBut yet there is this you mentioned millions of millions of dollars being pumped in to our region to trying to defeat you to try to defeat the others there is a team of Republicans that are names that need to be remembered after ... which kind of the Republican congressional Orange County team you like to get elected\nI Would love to see Dana Rohrabacher reelected I Would love to see young kids\nElected in the in the ... seat I'm\nDiane Harkey and the ... the seat and of course myself to be reelected a those are the four seats that the Democrats are really targeting a as I mentioned before I'm Nancy Pelosi is desperate to get that gamble back it's though they are pouring billions and billions of dollars into our races thinking\nThat they can defeat us you know Orange County is like the holy grail for the Democrats because Orange County has always been conservative and if they can take Orange County in California they think they've won at all\nSo we have to be very very a conscientious of that and we have to make sure that Republicans get to the polls\nThere are a new shifting demographics would still there are a lot of people\nWho kind of stand with Republican ideals here and really you know want to see a thriving economy like what's being done is really just to the left you just can't believe that the Trump won the dealer didn't get it it was supposed to be in the bag for what it all comes down to\nI think it is I mean I I Want somebody who didn't think that Donald Trump was going to win either\nI mean I was really surprised that media and all the polling they were showing us was was saying how Hillary was definitely going to win and then you saw the reaction when she did it and people were absolutely shocked and I really truly believe that they still haven't gotten over the fact that Hillary has it\nYou know didn't win it fill the far left not everybody in the Democrat Party of course you know it's it's really the far left for the most vocal which is the far left it's people like my opponents of followers\nWho are a A R super super vocal you know the Elizabeth Warren um people of the party the Bernie Sanders that's my opponent identifies with\nAh she's got the liberal policies of wanting to um\nImplement a health care for all where are the government's gonna cut between you and your doctor and get a health care and it's going to bankrupt our country ... thirty two trillion dollars in my ... won't even say how she's going to pay for it\n\nI disagree with presidents a carrot policy as I mentioned the goal is to get to zero terrorists that uh we cannot do that on the back of hurting other trading partners uh that are trying to play by the uh you know same rules\nSo I you know if we are dissatisfied with what a China's practices and I think that with the initial intent on why he went this way or we need to do that in a a you know you deal with it and the one country at a time\nWhen there's thirty ninth congressional district ... talked about the campaign or you should you know on a hands visiting a lot of places what are you doing to get the word out\nThat the exactly what I'm doing every single day I'm Out uh throughout the\nDistrict I'm attending four five six different events anywhere there is an event going on anywhere there was an opportunity for me to go and talk to the voters and residents that what I've been doing this is nothing new to\nFigure that running for office this is something like the day I Love connecting with the community I Love going out to the community festivals people need to know who they are representative as he told me to hell with it somebody there saying over and over who is fighting for that and that's what I've done for the last two\nDecades and I'm going to continue to do that this is the district I Know I Want to give them the confidence that when we like me\nTo Congress would continue to see a represented who's working hard on their behalf\n... to introduce yourself to those who may not know you just going to be one or two people out there what do you want them to understand about who you are\nI'm an immigrant from South Korea and my family came here to we'll like in that country and and I am doing that as an immigrant who's ... who has the ability to run and have the opportunity to run and let these and then the United States Congress I think this is a tremendous\nUh example of what America provides such a diversity that I live in the community where I raised my family is a community that I worked to represent then I also went on to serve them and the California state assembly which is a district I Know this is personal to me I'm running to represent my\nFriends neighbors like community\nService real I'm a real jail so people get out and you know don't don't forget to vote on November ... ... electric cars they decided by the bows and so on November six\nPlease go out and vote and start the sample ballot will be dropping and we can both by mail studying dissuade whenever he gets the habits don't wait as soon as you get it on that ballot and and it would be very helpful to us people get out and vote this could be decided by the above I Can't emphasize that enough\nLast minute here you know you've got you mentioned at the beginning you're ... the lottery and using the new zone we'll try to uh to win the seat in Congress you're such different you see your\nLong term roots or to the community and we know you you you're from the year you're not moving into dry when something\nRight that's what people would say and I believe our voters and the residents of the ninth congressional district are very very smart they know that and you get lucky once\nI'm not sure running for Congress is saying as a winning the lottery knew somebody who is grounded in the community and we can call you by first name because we have known each other we have worked together because that's what people was glued to the\nDirect talks to the website where they can learn more about you\nYoung Kim for Congress dot com young camp for Congress dot com young

a mini Orange County government agencies would give us kind of the elevator speech here the thirty seconds on where you are now how you got here and while you're running\nWell I'm currently the mayor of ... I've been on the harbor city council the last ten years I serve on Orange County wide transportation authority board the OC cheap bored I'm the vice chair of that board I also served on the board of directors for the Orange County sanitation district's\nA you know I happen to come into the city council ten years ago we had a real unfortunate situation our accounts of Manhattan ah died of a heart attack about ... unfortunately and that's what created a spot on the city council that Iran foreign anyway\nThat's how I got in and um this year we have our Orange County supervisor ... Nelson termed out of office he's done a great job for us but we need a new supervisor for\nNorth Orange County here so I decided to run for him\nOkay now to talk about the district that you would be serving the area and what it is that you feel it's important for voters who would vote for you to know about ya\nOkay the the district is the fourth district that includes law harbor a brain placentia alerts and the northern half of buying a park and\nKind of the western half of Anaheim so it's so six cities um I\nThink it's important that you have someone in this spot who does understand governments and when I certainly do and um I also teach a American government's part time at a local community college\nBut it's also important to have someone who does understand you know the business world to the private sector my full time job is with the local realtor association here I understand a real estate and you know what it is to try to suck your way through and the private sector as well so\nIdeally I think that's the right combination somebody does understand the workings of government but it's very sympathetic an understanding of the private sector as well I think that's something I Do bring to the table\nAnd in one issues do you see taking place are coming up did you want to help that are weighing in on I mean I've talked to a different supervisors they're dealing with things like you know homeless issues a needle programs I mean there's a lot going on it's very controversial absolutely\nAnd the county does have a little bit of their hand and everything I mean the Orange County government owns and operates John Wayne airports in the landfill system and you know you pretty much you name it uh the county has got a role there but you touched on homelessness Larry that is no doubt the\nThe hope that that's an opportunity for people to get together and rejoice and the fact that a lot of us to put in hard work and he'd been supporting any

month Dan thanks so much for taking a few minutes to be with us\nFrom thank you appreciate it we appreciate your calling attention to ah to the political spectrum of right now um it's a it's a it's a tough time out there and we um just wanted to get together and have a party and celebrate all the hard work that people put in um including\nThe candidates themselves the grassroots supporters like myself and my friends that I'm at congregated together a through social media and in person here in California and we reached out to a number of a candidate than\nSome of them had attended a party last year and and there'll be any again this year and some of 'em are new and we're very I'm privileged to be able to have a judge Steven Bailey who's running for California attorney general mark measure who's running for secretary of state a congressman in a war of Iraq will be there\nAnd some of these folks have become our friends it's um it's a very interesting opportunity and\nThere's a website for this I Believe WWW dot California a resurgence dot com or if people want to sign up more but give us some of the specifics we're already is when it is a one of the ticket costs what you will see kind of laid out for us\nWell I'm the event is our Saturday October Twenty years in the evening it's a five to eleven PM\nOr tickets are one hundred dollars and that includes dinner and drinks for the evening um it's just a nice opportunity to get together and meet some of these candidates face to face have some opportunity to speak to them one on one or in small groups\nTo listen to them speak briefly a and to enjoy the camaraderie of ah other um conservatives Trump supporters and supporters of needs to take a candidate that will be there um\n[noise] uh you know we we did this last year and this year we've kind of ramped it up a notch because\nWe're right here just a few weeks away from the election and we I'm meeting my friends and I that are putting on this event had just worked our tails off and try to get some of these are some of these large uh I'm named Kennedy to to be there and we're very appreciative\nSo what is the location I understand it's an Orange

Orange County\nAnd essentially this get together really is a chance for a Trump supporters conservatives to kind of enjoy the political season together with Kansas right\nIt is I mean it it I Hope the best way to describe it as a celebration um and the cold to vote 'em many of us had been cheating to the goings on in politics since Trump\nWas elected in November twenty six pain and uh we've been engaged ever since then so all my friends and I are trying to get\nContinue to call attention to that up and through these mid term cheering twenty chain\n'em and um you know keep people in food but also give them an opportunity to celebrate a little bit um this party is just a few weeks before\nThe actual election here on November sick so we hope that that's an opportunity for people to get

it's just the kind of good way to rejuvenate your political spirit make good connections with people find out more about the candidate and truly also thank them for all the hard work but they put in and at the pre she shouldn't we have for them as candidates they're trying to do their best for our state\nDo you get a sense that people are energized this election season there a few weeks ago with some of the media was saying I don't know just\nSeems like Democrats more engaged in Republicans and then the Kavanaugh situation came through and now they're seeing Republicans may be more engaged the Democrat either way there there is a high sense to gauge when levels it's unlike other years how about you\nKnow ... I suppose we all live in our own ... old but um I Do think that the conservatives are far more are engaged in a season if you will than they had been in the past\nI think Trump ... the spark that um that really brought people out that silent majority that Trump talked about so much during these rallies and ...\nAnd I think that that has a grown that those people are no longer silent that they become more public and become a larger more vocal boy and I believe you're seeing the fall through the twenty sixteen election cycle come through in twenty Eighteen and I do believe especially on the heels of the Kavanaugh\nConfirmations that um you have a lot of conservatives that are really fired up and ... the one\nWe the politics for what it really is I think a lot of us have for quite some time but I Believe that now it is coming to light more so that the people who have not been educated or engage in politics far far more aware of the\nGeneralized corruption and the goings on that the that the swamp uh the the swamp creates in Washington and we're tired of it I Believe conservatives are going to come out to vote on November ...\nDan Horowitz with us we're talking about a get together a party that is set for the twentieth of October ... you're saying it's Saturday a Trump supporters there\nYou've already secured RSP peas and congressman Dana Rohrabacher\nSuggesting Kansas more more your attorney general Kansas judge Steven Bailey and many many others\nAnd and this is an idea for a fellow Republicans to get together celebrate the political season share their enthusiasm and get to spend some time with these top notch candidate if people want to find out more let's direct into the website how do they connect what do they do\nA California resurgence dot com you can find out a little bit more information about it then you can see\nA lot or a keynote speaker it pass or mark birds are complete with the candidate to be adding more of a as they continue to confront them without um tickets are available for the website again there one hundred dollars and include all the ... in these for the evening\nOr will be doing a raffle additional costs and the raffle will of those proceeds will go to the candidates\nAre event is not for profit they tickets themselves are funding the total coffee event and or any shortfall that we have um will pick it up out of our own pocket so\nThis is just purely something that a few votes and decided to do to um you know celebrate these candidates and get people opportunity to meet them\nAnd really there you've got to also talk about the fact that there can be real friendships developed a when you get together with the campaign season you get to meet people who were likewise engaged in the same kind of issues ... there's a lot of fun to old ...\nAbsolutely ...

doctor objects the ... show\nThis Sunday Brock we'll discuss the news and then his theme the left uses every tactic available finding every battle big or small but never asking themselves with the fight is worth it next on any andme eight Seventy dancer sunny morning newsmakers with Larry Marino\nYour God willing and she [laughter] we got an administration choice I think Richard Burr now is very good uh there's there's so many other great choices out there and there was already one woman on tap I Believe\nAs she can complete redefined this position she told the United nations in no uncertain terms you guys are garbage [laughter] this is a joke we are here as a representative of course we we will participate\nNo problem there but make it very clear you guys are evil\nThe United nations enterprise is a shadow of its former self of what it used to be\nSo anyway Nikki Haley thank you so much for all the good that you have done and may you'll replacement be as equally good as you were\nA God Bless you and Godspeed to your next adventures we'd hope to see you in some great capacity in the future God willing maybe running for president or one of these days All right uh although she's confront you will not run and twenty twenty you know what I expect her to its doesn't make any sense for her to do that she knows that Trump is going to win [laughter]\nAnd and he will he really will it's just so beautiful [noise]\nAll right so um there's the release of this pastor in Turkey that's big news as well and you know I'm very happy that he's been released a what I what I mean even more happy about is that the circumstances under which he was released\nTrump basically told turkey released this man\nOr else and the or else was severe sanctions and that's the way he got them to release this pastor now this past uh really suffered maimed and make no mistake he was there for almost two years but he was released early because of the deal that ah the weather is no deal\nCould basically said we're just going to make it very difficult for you in Turkey\nAnd uh there was zero money exchanged zero oh like a certain administration ... previously lived at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue you get the idea\nTrump used the leverage of economic\nAnd the economic way to the United states\n... and also sanctions it worked and and by the way this is not the first time\nThis is not at all the first time this was happening it's happening all the time\nSo it's this quiet pressure that Trump seems to uh use very very wisely K n and really they ought to take she'd both Democrats and the Republicans they stabbed which meant Republicans look at how this man\nIs affects you waiting such great things\nThat maybe you're a whole approach of detente and getting along with terrorists and not making them angry and worrying so much about what the consequences might be if you move an embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem\nMaybe maybe you were all wrong\nMaybe this notion of diplomacy where you go in and you start making great treaties with a rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea and you're bribed them and such and you'll give them a hundred and fifty billion dollars so that they might make nice with you\nMaybe that doesn't work\nYou see this is what I Love about Trump is that put aside all the tweets and all the sort of brushed behavior on his part which is not so brash by the way they make it much more than than they pretend to be put that all aside\nLook at the effectiveness of this man\nHis whole approach is completely different\nThank God thank God we haven't\nAll right Hillary Clinton [laughter]\nShe's back right [laughter] and no doubt she thinks like she's a short snag are in the Terminator movie out to be back right okay no doubt she thinks she some tough cookie but how how is she ... this is from PJ Media\nHillary Clinton calls for and civility against Republicans so Hillary Clinton says on CNN you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about\nSpeaking to CNN Christian among poor the twenty six sixteen democratic presidential nominees said that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house\nOr in the Senate that's wants civility can start again but until then the\nOnly thing Republicans seem to recognize and respect strength [laughter]\nHi okay so in other words do item boys right and girls let's be fair 'cause they affirm the Kavanaugh hearings were both boys and girls involved right and they acted like little boys and a little girls didn't they\nBut Clinton's comments come amid escalating attacks against Republican lawmakers and chopping restriction officials by left wing activists\nAnd this is a from a commentary I may be wrong but I haven't heard of any Democrats and their families being chased out to restaurants or threatened with bodily harm by mobs nor have I heard about their personal information being published online Republican senator\nRepublican senator Cory Gardner from Colorado said Sunday that his wife had received a graphic text message with a video depicting a beheading\nAfter a gardener voted to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court before and after the vote thousands of demonstrators stormed the halls of Congress as steps of the Supreme Court to protest Kavanaugh\nRemember folks this was the ... thing that we discussed last week All right this was on top of chasing crews out of that restaurant confronting flick on the elevator ducks and personal than that or you know they use\nNow regrettably there is the decided likelihood that they're less propensity for violence will continue to escalate in proportion to its rhetoric\nWhen Collins is liable viciously has a rape apologist\nAnd the entire Republican Party is the same as rape publications\nWould any virtue signaling noxious is resist even if they could being cited urge to attack such villains\nSee they give them plausible deniability that's why that is what Hillary Clinton now has if Republicans are injured or killed by the mobs\nShe wasn't calling from violence UC just incivility toward political opponents\nSee the problem is that as McCotter points out her words have enabled thousands of crazies who believe the hysteria against Republicans in Trump that has been ginned up by those who know exactly what they're doing when they seek to create an atmosphere of violence and hate\nClinton has given her blessing indeed her permission for a left wing radicals to tear the country apart\nFascinating assault from PG media it's it's really an analysis [noise] uh and and look\nMcCotter's question here was just answered by Clinton yet the pressing question for those citizens of sound mind ... hearts is not what will be the next ... upper left vicious political a ... to be forewarned and for armed is truthfully all that one can do\nKnow the question hand is how for the future of our free republic the left can be constructively engaged and ... and political civility if not comedy restored\nTo this is these are fancy a editorial comments but it's a good one a really very well thought out Clinton knows full well that her virtual call for violence will be met with violence in response\nIn fact she's counting on it any response to violence by the right will be portrayed in the media as the right attacking peaceful citizens protesting fascism\nWhere have we heard that before\nWhere we've seen that before\nYou see we're constantly and former Trump's dog whistles and code words to suppose that white supremacists as sometimes is and racist everywhere in America\nBut there is nothing coated in what Hillary Clinton just said no no no\n[laughter] fascinating and it doesn't stop with Hillary Clinton\nI mean she's actively campaigning and urging people to engage in violence\nThis it's very you don't have to to um to dig very deep to see this and then you've got Eric Holder saying the same thing\nAnd a campaign rally in Georgia this is what he said [noise] they use the power that they have gotten for all the wrong things they want to keep themselves in power\n[laughter] as if the Democrats don't write a it is time for us as Democrats to be as tough as they are to be as dedicated as they are to be committed as they are told her I said\nMany coats Michelle Obama Michelle Obama always says when they go low we go high know when they go low we kick them [laughter] Eric Clapton said to him as the audience laughed and cheered and clapped the crowd than broke into chance of fight fight fight\nThat's a huge problem for the Democrats part of the reason why I predict the red wave this coming November\nMuch less than a month away\nWho [laughter] I just can't wait to see what happens it's going to be so fun and then they bring up a that Tonya west has a mental imbalance of some kind because apparently he made in these open about it he said he has some sort of the uh either depression or bipolar issue but you know\nPutting that down an plenty of that out mean somehow this person is not entitled to his own opinions iffy once had a mental illness got it\nI mean it's a breathtaking argument\nIf if it had been a Democrat who said exactly the same thing\nAbout uh about the you know a liberal person the person who once had a mental illness and the Republicans had pointed that out can you imagine the the backlash that the Republicans would have suffered\n[laughter] so so if you were once depressed or had a bipolar ... you're not into your opinions you you wave your rights to ever ever a legitimate opinion\nFantastic though the the ... the golf but Democratic Party the inability to see themselves in the mirror fascinating and then the ... the second point is that he was incoherent cutting or that he swore a lot you're right he said uh\nYou know the mother that Ford will say ... okay in the oval office and and the Democrat said that that brings down the reputation and the dignity of the oval office [laughter]\nI mean really Democrats your saying that even the ... I mean ... pure brought this up about how there was sexual activity right there in the oval office and and it's kind of a west who's bringing down the dignity of the oval office really you want to go there\nAnd you really think there was no swearing during Nixon's time or Lyndon Johnson's science or FDR or Truman well my favorite the latter who not only swore but made racist and anti Semitic comments which I think are are far worse right and that's the way it go here as I say\nInteresting that you say that or better yet really suddenly you guys are the party of rationality\nThis is the party that was happy to proclaim George Zimmerman is a white Hispanic\nAlthough there was no evidence that the flood or to block that while you if you know intentionally\nSame with ... percent or the oj didn't do the crime or the white cops are killing blocks for the hundreds of thousands\nOr that black should vote monolithic clean and have no business voting Republican and all that and you're all logical again it suddenly they're the party of parsing out words and whether some things you know sensible\nThat's right the party of feelings and mobs of claw at the Supreme Court doors and who do lap dances on the statue Oliver Wendell Holmes to show contempt suddenly very position to tell you what's decent and what's not that my friends is rich\nTruly rich right when we get back we'll talk more about the latest developments in the news in the force are themes about how the left\nDoesn't even bother to think about whether it's worth it to do all these crazy basic six Seventy five Seventy five to for your disagreeing calls don't go away we'll be right back [noise]\n\n[noise]\nFor Chinese ambassador to the U.S has it been very can be anything he ran for president kind of Iran train\nWent on Fox News Sunday the Chinese and they showed that China us relations continue to come and get a strain of confusion he says the math or some other countries and ... having the same problem and that nobody seems to know who is the final decision maker and he said the course the president will take the final decision but to explain what role\nOn NBC's Meet the path Josh Hawley the Republican candidate for senator in Missouri than Democrats are fighting mom like behavior\nThat can't believe the smear campaign but they lost and now this mob behavior that we're seeing all over the country it is motivating folks he's\nCampaigning on democratic Senator Claire McCaskill vote against the confirmation by Kevin I'm going to U.S Supreme court he says ... letters or angry or the cabinets hearing and are battling together we just don't think ... proceedings and everything you need to get started and fall project like over seeding and feeding your line or picking up your curb appeal with the molten bump plant whenever\nIt's on your to do last stock now and they ... helpline weather right now in Norwalk cloudy and fix the fact I'm Jamie well now am eight Seventy the answer\nI don't know how much clear I can make this but there is only one name to trust if you want to face or neck left without surgery Dr wrestler I go there and I put my name on it because I've seen the results Dr wrestler and the team in L.

thanks for staying with us [noise]\nAll right so we were talking so much about how the the mob is being cited\nRight by Hillary Clinton\nBy Maxine Waters and Eric Holder of course who says that when [noise] when Republicans supposedly go low which I I haven't actually seen happen [laughter] where where Republicans on low tell me\nI mean there's it's a very cute one I got to give that to Michelle Obama when she said when they go low we go high alright so which begs the question at what point did we go low\nOh wait a minute I Know when we refused to consider the nomination of Merrick Garland yes that was low\nReally bad and and where did you go high at the second question [laughter] where are the other than going high with with pot Katie's that you know suggesting yes other than\nI I think they need it [laughter] you know figuratively not drug in Italy um where do they go Hi what what class act did they do right I mean tell me\nThe only thing I could say that it was somewhat good or high is that Michelle Obama in responding to Eric Holder's comment didn't like the way he bashed her does what she's had said and she basically and and so many words a walk that back\nBut but not even but only ... she didn't say it aggressively unless you should have\nBut nevertheless where the Democrats acted in in some sort of dignified way where's the high the Michelle Obama was claiming the Democrats acted with ... tell me\nThe way they ... they handle the Kavanaugh hears that was high\nAnd what was so low about the way the ... the Republicans handled that oh because they confirm Kavanaugh so that was low that was cheating somehow not too clear on that folks\nIn the meantime there's more mob incitement this time important\nOr listen or Portland, Oregon and this is from Portland news bears spray bloody brawls at pay truck patriot prayer law and order a march in Portland which one would say was somewhat ironic\nSo terrible things are happening I mean it's pretty vicious a riot all of a sudden and they they go either way the Democrats\nAnd the left but particularly the Democrats who say oh well this these are not mom's that's cute\nYou act like a mob and then say you're not a mob is acute\nNeed disagreeing calls but I like you so much you'd call so many times in the past and you've always been very cogent and thoughtful go ahead\n[laughter] thank you the Democratic party and politicians are behaving in acting in talking with Democrats on black people are acting as if they owned by people vote\nAnd the black people are not allowed to think and vote themselves but they are they are black readers Democrat black leaders\nTo tell them how to think and how to vote and to vote democratic course around I it's amazing about Ninety I think that was Ninety five percent of black Americans do Democrats or as I'm\nAlmost all around with all the blacks were Republican after Republican or Democrat state of civil war for their ...\nYes of course of course well listen I'm ... you know you've got such a great point in my ... and I I still enjoy your comments about this uh but look he's right the good news Mike is that the black vote is going to be dramatically different\nStarting in November just less less than a month from now and definitely an twenty twenty you'll see Mike thank you so much for your\nCall one of the commercial and by may may okay go ahead\nTo this day it's not just history to this day the Democratic party still supports a lot of very racist and sexist laws for example as I'm sure you know the minimum wage law was created to prevent\nAll I Know I've said yes\nHeating with white or jobs because blacks hypocrite had lower levels of education they did not have skills may have no work experience so minimum wage is a very racist policy at the Democrats continues court today abortions is the Democrats continue this\n... Mike Mike I I I completely agree with you about this but at the same time we were going to have Janet and we we just simply have to move on I Do appreciate it and I agree with you Mike Scott blessed thank you for your call so\n[laughter] it's I mean he's very passionate and like that you are our listeners are so informed Mike is a good example of that right\nI mean what lefty wouldn't know the things that might just talked about right about the eugenics they most people don't even know that there was a eugenics movement at all they have no idea about that we can talk about that elected another day I've I've already talked about on the show but it's this very horrific part of American history that no one\nIt and it was it last for decades\nAnd it was the cause it was the the encourage ... of the Nazis to do what they did in the Holocaust right from from Margaret Sanger another people just like her\nEncouraging eugenics\nThe monsters and they don't ... they just don't see it do they\nThey have no idea of that their own history and that's the reason why the Democrats don't want you to learn history\nBecause if you did learn history you would see how horrific the Democratic party really was that it was the party of slavery that was the party of Jim Crow\nYeah that was the party of advancing against civil rights\nDon't you get it and my friends I mean why would you want to be part of this party\nWhy why would you why wouldn't you race to be a Republican\nIf you like Abraham Lincoln\nYou should be a Republican\nAnd don't tell me for a moment that somehow Lincoln would've been a Democrat today that's garbage\nAbraham Lincoln would be a Republican and it would be very proud of this Republican Party because guess what it has stayed true to the values of the conservative of a concern to them that the Republican Party was founded upon\nExactly the reason why he would be proud\nThey know nothing about history\nThey know nothing about their own double standards\nYou know it's it it really is fascinating\nAt this uh this this recent story about the uh the reporter I just mentioned you know I Wonder if you if it would fly\nRemember this this thing that the woman the all the famous surrounding her were saying that you could have just walked away right and I wonder if that would fly if you told that to the woman who mob Bill Cosby had raped\nRight you could have not been there right you could have just walked away\nCan you imagine [laughter] or the woman the bill Clinton attacked and allegedly raped as well\nWhat an interesting pattern that would have been\nAll right in the meantime Arnold Schwarzenegger apologizes for popular I seen the phrase girly man [laughter] I I you know [noise] why don't you just stay away from politics Arnold you're such an embarrassment right now\nAnd why do you even say this was some sort of clamoring for you to apologize about this or were were you trying to get ahead of the curve why don't you just stay home really\nI I got to say this man really set the Republican Party that brand back at least here in California he gave the Republican Party in California a real black guy I think only Nixon was worse than what he did to the Republican Brett\nBut boy I with with Republicans like these [laughter] I don't know many Democrats [noise]\nBoy oh boy how much time do we have left kitty about uh eight minutes or so\n... so come up with this other stuff\nThere is a um a new law and I know Dennis likes to bring this up a lot and I I think it's an important thing to to bring up which is that California is now going to be mandating that women occupy a board seats on companies and uh\nThat is such a bizarre phenomenon going on\nYou know and and and it's a dentist is point which is that it no longer matters whether you have the skill set to be on the board what matters is whether you're right you have the right genitals to be on the board which is bizarre\nRight I mean to say I mean what's next the pigmentation I mean ... why not have saying we need to have this many Muslims mismanaged Jews this many I'm handicapped people disabled people should say right\n... transgendered people what why just woman\nI mean what's what's to stop that\nJust ... we need to have a certain amount of Eskimos for that matter gypsies\nIt's it's very bizarre\nBut wait I say what if it's a man who feels like he's a woman\nRuled me that one Democratic Party right\nOh the tangled Web we wave write in any event I thought that not all women have the China's not all men happiness is right\nWork with me on this guy's [laughter] I read it through one of the women's march science so I figure it's gotta be right 'cause you guys believe this crap so what if you're a a shall we say China free women\nYou don't have one of those things\n[laughter] so are you but you're still a woman at least that's what the courts now would have you believe so is that okay\nKnow what if you feel it what if you only feel like a woman during that time of the board meetings\nAnd otherwise you feel like I'm In\nThis [laughter] it's like that or\nI don't know that the mountains commercial and uh you know and I'm a joy right sometimes you feel like I'm not sometimes you don't [laughter] and I don't mean any double entendre about that oh my gosh now I realize no I didn't mean a couple of times but\nUh when I'm going to have trouble with this one [laughter] All right let me get into my theme where there's some saber territory all of a sudden All right yeah the theme here is a very important one [laughter]\nBut the left uses every tactic available fighting every battle big or small\nBut never asking themselves whether the fight is even worth it\nSo this is of course inspired by the whole cabinet mess right but it's true really when you think about it on every issue\nGlobal warming especially everything is there a way or the highway [noise]\nEverything has to go to the degree gay marriage good example guns cops shooting black men supposedly because of racism read the whole country has to get up on arms about that\nDo you see what I mean not only do they not allow skepticism or questioning about a topic but if you disagree with them Katie you're evil\nYeah you're bought and paid for by the gas companies or the gun lobby depends\nEvery she goes to eleven there's literally no issue I can think of where they don't hold an extremely intense position about it even Social Security welfare or or minimum wage every issue deserves a riot or at least a massive demonstration on the street\nAnd if the constitution forbids it well let's get a federal court to say it doesn't\nAnd nowadays it's transgender rights right black lives matter and the so called me too movement and they'll use every tactic and the case of tap into that cloud of the doors at the Supreme Court\nAnd the case of building the wall\nThey found a lowly district court judge in Hawaii or on the Muslim immigration thing or they have been the restrictions on the on immigration to say that that law was illegal and to jam up the system\nAnd of course most recent picky invent a dusty of information to justify it buys a warrant against the president and then also fabricate a Russian collusion story to distract from what Hillary Clinton had done\nThis to say nothing about inventing stories about Trump of being a photo shop to the time covering the so called Muslim ban or Charlottesville right or the supposed rise of anti Semitism and anti Islam and some and racism after Trump's election [noise]\nYourself from yourself ... you have built\nA reputation of not managing debt properly or write in your life you know not me you built a reputation of trying to figure out how to uh buy things and and you go from zero percent credit card to zero percent credit card to six months a sixteen month famous cash when you buy a car\nLook those aren't financial strategies right you're the pawn\nThrough the park in the financial story because the the the credit card companies the car dealerships\nTheir job is to sell your car\nSo if there's a fifty thousand dollar car and they're going to give you fifty thousand dollars worth of value and it's going to give you what nothing back\nExcept the car and he said well I'm going to be borrowing money well that's fine they'll just charging fifty three thousand for the fifty thousand dollar cars I see no interest no interest on the fifty three thousand dollar car or you can do fifty thousand and pay interest\nIn other words you're not going there would be out of business if they gave you the car and let you hold fifty thousand dollars in passing the next five years so don't be crazy on this world thinking that you've got them I don't\nKnow their idea is managing your financial life\nWhere you are making them wealthy not yourself keep that in mind as we talk about your financial life you're on the total financial hour on a mate Seventy the answer give us a call a triple eight Ninety nine retire triple eight eight eight eight nine nine seven\nThree eight for seven out hey I was with a Larry Elder recently we were talking about financial stuff and he asked me some questions hey what do you think about or\nThis and the economy when we went over some idea of\nOne of the things that he said that that's brilliant as you said you know you realize that in in some communities this information that that that I was presenting than that I was speaking about\nHe said it's not available it was never available when he was growing up in their neighborhood certainly not when his father was growing up if you ever read his book it's an incredible book dear father dear son\nYou know part of life is experiences learning from them not carrying around the baggage but let me tell you if you have a chance to pick up that book\nI don't care what your background is like you're going to find your father your mother's relationship in their\n... and it's nice to hear commonsense approach a realistic approach that that is also true to the emotion that happens when there's a relationship and money isn't any different a lot of times the reason the fathers are opposite I'm going to speak traditionally but mothers you're in the same boat especially a single mother household\nA lot of the reasons that mothers and fathers are opposite\nIs because they're trying to financially prepare for the kids\nAnd when you become a kid and when you become an adult and you're used to be the kid that that ... mom and dad just didn't care about showing up to my baseball games no do you not understand the guys\nI mean maybe mentally you get it but emotionally it killed them inside to not be their their job was to provide for you so that they had a choice shop at the game and be homeless or miss the game or the recital or the back to school night or the open house\nThat provide you a chance at a college education clean clothes so you're not made fun of at school shoes that that are at least close to being trendy and reasonably new\nSo that you didn't have the the social stigma that came from being the poor kid look all of us grew up differently but I'm going to count on a basic premise here that\nMost of you grew up with moms and dads loved and cared for you not everybody I get it but most of you did\nAnd that manifests itself in a lot of different ways because we are not taught how to be parents we aren't we're taught to to say this is how I raise you take the good leave the bad did the best you can now you've got a whole different set of financial emotional\nRelationship pressures and good luck with that so keep in mind folks that\nThe financially speaking when you become an adult and now you're retired and you're getting down that road of at least preparing for retirement\n\nThe last thing you want is to have an emotional reaction thinking that the only way to preserve it is to take great risks the only way to be rich to be to have the shoes the cars the house the boat whatever it is that you want to take amazing financial risk sometimes\nHaving the first floor of safety having that foundation of just in case\nYou realize that Social Security and your pension if you're fortunate to still have a pension\nThose ... those are based on a financial formula that says we are going to give you a guaranteed income stream so that no matter what you're going to have money coming in forever\nYou know that's important that you realize that because for most people you don't have that option today it's what eighty percent of Americans don't even have a pension that means they are their own pension there were only receive Social Security if it's still there the Democrats haven't run it into the ground\nYou heard me speak about a on this program and I've done fourteen over fourteen years almost Fifteen Years of radio three thousand programs I think the last count seems like a lot\nBut in this period of time you've heard me mentioned that the only way to fix the economy you're California state pension your union pension your pension with the city state ... doesn't matter government the only way to fix\nIs one of three things ah has to happen most likely and and most probably all three on some percentage depends on who's in office depends on what the political winds are but the only way to fix the pension system\nIs if a one or all of these three things happen number one they're going to have to reduce benefits now that is not an easy conversation to have somebody who retired seven years ago and who now says up surprise or your pension used to be five thousand a month now it's thirty one hundred\nThat's the only way they're going to fix this if they're going to have to reduce some of the pension now they'll probably inflate the currency not they meaning the government or the system the economy is going to inflate the currency they've done it with Social Security right wages go up wages are what's taxed that goes to fill in Social Security\nBut what they're paying you said the same or goes down with inflation right so in other words by\nRaising minimum wage by raising wages by growing the economy more money goes into Social Security\nBut they're not paying the benefits if you've been taking Social Security as a payment for the last year to ten whatever you've noticed that it's not gone up very much at all some case or if it has that has gone up a hundred dollars Medicare has gone up a hundred so it comes on the front door goes out the back door by\nSo they're going to have to inflate the currency and inflate wages no question about that the third thing they're going to have to do is they're going to have to do something very very important which is grow the United states economy they\nThey have to grow the economy and such a way so that it doesn't matter as much\nIf the dollars inside Social Security are low right in other words we're going to run out of money and twenty thirty three because we're putting in in piling a massive amounts of dollars three and a half four percent growth rate\n... ... ... you guys look at President Obama he he was not somebody ... in the media in fact he thought the media was was his friends of course they picked on now and again but very rare\nEarly look at the media research Institute you'll see exactly how much of a percentage wise that were bad stories negative stories against President Obama very rarely\nAnd the quotes from him you don't have to look at you can pull it up on on on the Internet\nIf you think you're going to grow the U.S economy at\nThree percent how's it going to do it as you just going to uh pull it out of the air not going to happen never going to happen what does he making up stuff never going to happen and of course we had four percent growth rates\nThis year will probably come in for the entire year that will come pretty darn close to four point one when you when you have the entire two thousand and Eighteen now just so you understand what four point one is is it doesn't make sense to a lot of people I understand\nBut it double

like the next president after him is going to have and has had problems with the economy and with the international it isn't a secret you guys\nDon't let them try to say that oh well well the President Obama's policies those weren't the problem the problem was the just the timing of his presidency\nBut isn't true\nJust do the math dig past page one of your Internet searches and by the way
