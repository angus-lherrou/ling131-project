I Want to say this because I mentioned it on my fireside chat and I want you to know that I Do fireside chats virtually every week we have about a half million views [noise] it's a lot of use for a fireside chat but I think a lot of people a lot of other people should see if\nI just get from my home I talk by a fire side by a fire talk about life take questions mostly from young people it's it's fun and it's intense\nAnd I mentioned and I I admit this that I have I I did and verify it yet but the source that was told it to me was a very very reliable one\nAnd I heard about other cases but again this is one of the rare times I haven't looked it up but it's so sounds right\nThat even if it's not true it's worth saying because we live in an era where this is exactly what would happen and the the word safe brought this to mind\nThat fourteen year olds are not allowed to trick or treating in certain cities because they don't want anybody older than kids to be with them do you understand that\nDoes that make any sense to you\nLook look look it up look it up fourteen year olds\nYeah not not allowed to trick or treat the point that I'm making is because I'm totally you know what I'm passionate about ... passionate I'm crazed actually and so I'm telling you what the outset it may not be accurate so why would I tell you something that may not even\nYeah Chesapeake heard about northern Virginia that's what I was told\nIn years yeah\nAll right so there you go an ordinance that bans anyone's Thirteen not fourteen Thirteen or older from trick or treating\nOkay so there you go I'm Sorry it's in USA Today okay so there you go I knew I knew the source that told us to me was reliable that so it's very rare that a report something that I haven't specifically checked source but there you go\nSafe they uh Shaun ... play a better safe than sorry the new it's the ... this is my new and ah to the national anthem we had the land of the free of the whole of the brave as how Americans saw themselves the land of the free and the whole there but we don't we don't think that way you gotta\nOh I'm\nSo sad\nPeople don't understand yeah of course it's funny it's the reason we plan to to Larry is when you think about it but it's it's hilarious about a very sad thing\nI I looked into the camera yesterday's the fireside chat and I ... ... but I think would you say the ... more than half of those you in the first chapter young people [noise]\nIt's ... so almost by definition about at least sixty five percent okay and I said no\nWe've we've real sadness I got to tell you the America you're growing up in is so different from the America grow up and then I Know people I Know what the left has yeah of course 'cause there's less racial Muslim for you by the way that right\nThat's correct there is less racism homophobia agree with that\nBut in in so many other arenas heat is so different than a bad way\nTo freedom issue is just protect killer\nCultural appropriation\nTaxes weird as this as safe as safe spaces\nWhy use it bad I don't even understand I understand there are other stuff as as bizarre as it may be this one I don't even understand a a a white Anglo saxon Protestant where's there's some\n... on Halloween or for that matter to a a a Latino party\nOr ... some of the costume party and that's wrong\nThat's morally wrong\nIs there one person listening there are a lot of people listening right now is there one who can explain to me what his role I mean it I Want to understand that it doesn't make sense\nIt goes from from my perspective it goes under the rubric of causes\nBar to the left what oxygen is to biological life theory there always has to be some fight against something oppressive\nWhen I tell students that I I don't think anybody is oppressed in the United states\nThey are not about Austin's many students just are so relieved to hear from adult they can't believe it I mean it's just like I said I had I said a a an expletive they would be less shocked\nNobody is oppressed\nBlack girl came over took a picture by the way we're starting to do something to put those pictures up that I'm sending you from young people will just be me their reports and stuff it's fun and they put their first name of it was at all to id them ... and ... did you see the picture of the security\nPolice security that I had at Colorado State to like seven to ... these guys look like they're going to fight the Taliban I thought they were the armed forces\nOh you got to see we got to put it up at these guys were precious but all of these guys thank you by the way to security folks I it it it ended up thank God I don't think it was necessary but I I saw so much ate directed against me that I decided to do that\nSo back to back to this issue of bogus excuse me so there was a black girl came over to pose a lot of young people came over to get selfies with ... which I Love your show so stay a lot after a speech noise do that\nAnd so she was a black girl wearing a mock I have right make America great again hat\nNot Monica\n... is that right ... she's running America ...\nOkay fine thank you so she's wearing America have now I Want to see a few things\nI I recognize the guy with the Dodgers have a beard and\nHalloween tonight [noise]\nHeard by the way\nThis is Dennis Prager back from\nOne of the most intense ten days for eleven days of\nMy life on the road it was unbelievably gratifying ... unbelievably hard it is truly living ... what is it the songs that says those are so into your ... yes that's called by the way wisdom it's not my wisdom\nYou know you don't want to head start I had in life because I was taught the Bible as a kid\nYou know what I Want to incredible\nBurden is on children that they're not talk the Bible where on God's earth or if you will know God's earth\nMother Earth we're on Mother Earth are they going to get wisdom from\nParents are all very wise maybe so maybe so\nWhere do your children kept wisdom\nFrom where do your children get was the\nThat important or is it the knowledge that is important to let me tell you something in the marathon of life wisdom is more important than knowledge by about a factor of four hundred and seven to one well All right I\nMean it's it was a very very rewarding\nThe Colorado State event was very powerful I Love speaking to college students a folder yesterday so their paper covered might say two articles\nAnd and the\nThere were fine I have that one was less than the award was fine\nBut it it is so remarkable how they coach students are saying they didn't feel safe did you see there\nIs a new thing it's brand new this ... ... we never ever ever ever talk it never occurred to anybody\nConservative or liberal speaker\nComes to campus you don't agree she don't feel safe\nI pity it's usually women I pity these young women I pity them\nYou know how strong you have to be in life to get through life this is not even if it doesn't even entail string [laughter]\nSo\nOkay All right talking about safe\nOne look this up because this I heard from a ...
