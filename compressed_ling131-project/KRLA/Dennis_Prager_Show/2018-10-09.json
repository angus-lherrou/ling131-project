rules do not apply to us we are allowed to break up Senate hearings we are allowed to scream at Republicans as they have dinner\nBecause normal rules don't apply to us that that that some of the but the real reason against for the opposition to Columbus Day is they regard him as a genocidal maniac is a monster how could you have to have a day named after a monster\nBut the the bigger issue is if

of life the third our [noise] my Tuesday show [noise]\nReally really important our\nI\n... it to having a map and you know exactly where you are\nBut you have no idea where you're supposed to be going the ultimate issues hours about where we're going\n\nAbout about the map of where we are a little bit to wake us [noise]\nToday is going to be a little more political than most are not in the sense of direct politics but the subject has political correct political ramifications I have a have a sad realization that I'd like to share with you\nFor better\nMaybe I shouldn't put it is sad realization I have a question to pose and by my earlier statement that said realization you'll have an idea of what I think the answer is but here's my question\nTo people prefer liberty or to be taken care of\nSo you don't like you know my answer even if you have never heard before just by the fact that I said said realization you know what I what I Believe I've come to the conclusion that most people prefer to be taken care of and lose liberty\nThan\nHave liberty\nAnd not be taken care of them have to take care of themselves\nNow obviously up to the extreme that\nYou can find a doctor you can't find the hospital you can find a policeman obviously there's\nWe're talking about within certain bounds [noise]\nUh that is how that is how people think\nI Want to be taken care of\nThat if I lose liberty and the process that's okay [noise] America was founded on the belief of liberty\nAnd I think most Americans assume for a while I don't know I take that back I think a lot of Americans assumed that that was in a chord with the human the universal human desire freedom\nBut it it it is it do you know the New York times are you ready I'm telling you this is going to shock you\nShock you in terms of its stupidity\nAs much as in terms of its politics the New York times had an op ed piece in the last few days I did not mention it but I read it\nAnd I have to clean it up I mean there wasn't it wasn't that all profane but you know kids listen to this and I'm aware of that that but also put it in a very general way\nAnd somewhat opaque\nAdults will understand it was an article about women who have lived under communism\nAnd then lived under freedom so the East German women\nAnd then the wall was torn down and they mail had freedom no longer living under communism the article was a serious article you must understand subs NATO lampooned this is not from the onion [noise] it was a serious article claiming\nThat women under communist Germany living in communist East Germany\nHad a more fulfilling sex life than women in the west Germany\n\n\nYou read that correct about the argument was they were show taken care of that the absence of the freedom to even speak did not trouble them as much as they felt rewarded by all the benefits of a communist state\n... by the way a series of articles in the New York times about how life and less free societies can be better\nSo then there was another article just the let's see what today Wall Street journal what's weeds give up for free money\n\nI moved to Sweden for love or money but I was happy\nTo learn that merely living in the social democracy also entitled me the paid parental leave benefits who couldn't object to free money handed out by the government to oil Swedish parents then I became a father\nAnd he talks about the you know everything free health care subsidized housing paid leave out employment benefits job training pensions\nAnd you know he said this system of internal laced welfare programs is the government to attempt to realize the political and social ideal that has seemingly universal acceptance among sweet tooth as noticed it T. R. Y. doubled G. H. T. T.\nRight\nSo it's it's the feel so comfortable and secure everything is taken care of\nNow\nOne of the prices you pay is that you know you pretty much have to think like everybody else you know think of the box\nAnd you just in my life becomes this is me I'm not reading from the article life becomes I've often said about Western Europe life becomes really a debate about\nHow many hours I couldn't get off how much vacation time I can have how much I can travel and it sounds awesome it just I mean what could be better I work less I'm taking care of this is utopia\n\nThen he continued six months ago my two year old niece broke her leg the physician who treated the girl told my brother in law that his daughter would be given a full body cp scare\nToo which you might say huh\nShe broke her leg and the doctor wants to give the the girl a full body seat the scan\nThe doctor insisted that the procedure was mandatory but not for any medical reason I Wonder if a single one of you listening knows the reason the doctor ordered a full body seep T scan of a two year old girl\nThat's a lot of radiation by the way a two year old girl gets a full body C. T. scan for a broken leg\nEverybody I Know the reason there's no way you don't think there's anyone that I couldn't catch fire was thinking why she giving a full body see peace can write\nThe doctor insisted that the procedure was mandatory get it mandatory he had no choice but not for any medical reason rather the Swedish social services administration\nRequires such scans to look for evidence of child abuse while\nThe doctor did note that the broken leg was the result of an accident [noise]\n[noise]\nShe told my brother in law the matter\nWas out of my hands that is the doctor saying that it is out of my hands I I have no say whether your daughter\nGet to see the sky when the girl's parents refused to subject to this unnecessary procedure the hidden machinery of the Swedish welfare state spring into action [noise]\nMy brother in law and his wife were required to attend multiple interviews with social workers\nAnd to submit friends and neighbors in in their small town for questioning social workers even inspected their phone\nShut believe decisions is benign as what milk to buy see potential evidence of parental deficiency my inlaws feared their two children might be taken from them in Sweden the state reserves for itself ultimate responsibility for children's wellbeing\nAs a parent my job is to give my kids the three you get that set Swedish term for this great all the developing security necessary to become productive tax paying members of sweet of society that is why I receive financial support a medical benefits\nTake care of people take care of my if you take care of me take care of my children\n\nThat's why people who home school their children are looked at very often negatively but a lot of other parents the state should teach your children who the hell are you to educate your own children\n\nSo this has been a revelation in my life is the ultimate issues that are because this is an ultimate issue do we do we want to preserve liberty number one or take care of\nBy take care take being taken care of now obviously there's there's got to be an element of being taken care of we we all understand that but an element is the dominant which is dominant liberty or the other\nEven being taken care of to the point where I don't want you to have the liberty to speak because what you say may offend me\nAs another example of liberty being downgraded on behalf of\nBeing taken care of I I don't want to hear anything that may hurt me\n\nOkay ah let's\nGo to a are too busy to Greece so you get some first hello or doesn't agree Allentown, Pennsylvania Hi\nHi Dennis I think they want to be on good terms\nLet me in a plane\nYou're [laughter] you're talking about ... ... ... everything is like a teenager culture rated the teenager right\nWhen you're even though they're getting in a in a crate and they joined a gang\nCulture that is right there\nForever [noise] controlling ban anything parents every culture the punishment is worse than anything parents ever did\nSo because of the question [noise] two things one is we want to be a charm\nAnd the second thing is what terms we man a large part determined by how ...\n...
