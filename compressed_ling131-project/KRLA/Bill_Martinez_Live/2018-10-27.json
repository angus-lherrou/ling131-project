at you every day thank you so much for joining us six minutes after the fact that they are and Bill Maher payments from on prevention others do go to Bill Maher tennis live that Congress cop and joins us\nYes our favorite historian is back a syndicated columnist popular speaker and I'm just I'm ... it's always great to have Bruce here because you want to get out you know paper okay and take notes because he's got the facts jak as they say Mr Bruce how're you doing buddy\nNew hey we've got lots of talk about but before we get into a winning a recent columns about the courts usurpations of the Democratic process\nSpeaking of which let's talk about um the Democratic process of agitation here a British in history I mean ... ... we had anything like this or is this\nYou know you know just something that we can look back and say well at certain points in time um this is what we've run into in our country\nThat we haven't had this before in the run up before the civil war and the country was divided if it had never been before in my opinion never been in Congress [noise] I mean the number of fight but Congress really got into the number of the number of\nBut they got into the issue over the issue of slavery\nA divided Congress away for I guess about ten years in the run up to or after the compromise of Eighteen fifty which kind of\nThe weight of a war but we're not going to prevent it because the Congress voice that I remember Congress has at each other's throats over that issue so I Would say it's been worse\n... well I'm right now I'm ... and you wonder you say okay well what is the catalyst of all this uh\nYou know many want to blame but certainly on the left you know they want to blame Donald Trump and his verbiage but what's here there's acts of violence on the left that they're just surrounding that of course the the media is and not not about to\nPublish um and I got a report this morning here that just went through a litany of attacks on Republicans and\nUm you know they're out there trying to campaign or Republicans getting attacked I mean beat up any\nYou know a a ... you know they're ending up in hospitals there you know sitting there leaking oil as they're trying to campaign 'cause they just been beat up and\nYou know I'm you know you got Maxine Waters things you know chase him getting their face a\nSpartacus himself [laughter] you know talks about or you know getting in a elected officials a face to face and he got to Eric Holder saying hey when they go low we kick 'em and you know which was a spin off of what Michelle Obama said about when they go low we go high uh I guess now we just kick 'em ... is the shortened version\nThe updated version of a you know of that whole deal so this is this is really gotten out of hand and you you think oh gosh you know what are we going to end up with something and then of course there was no reference or\nAbout uh you know the ... the the couple of what the ah ... music artist thing um you know when was the last time a president was killed by an actor you know\nYeah [laughter]\nYeah but I think that this is going to her I think this is going to have their publics in the mid term election that Republicans in mid term election though I think that the ... the fair minded people in this country are looking at this craziness\nGoing on for people I Want representing me and and the national government might be wrong about that but I Do notice that in that ... that I'm older now showing that in the contest and states and now at least on the outside whereas there was like Thirteen fourteen percent advantage or on the Democratic side a month ago is now one two three\nThough I think that this whole um these attacks are hurting the Democrats they mentioned I think that hopefully this will reflect the self and the maternal actually\nOr the Democrats owing hands Bruce that they can't see the damage that this does to their own party I mean 'cause the thing is this let's just say let's let's let's say Democrats to take over and and even if they don't regardless I mean we've got people here they got some serious mental problems I mean they got there exercising themselves\nAnd this is all you know the mainstream media is not reporting on it it's almost like it's acceptable so even after the election we've got their mentality and they're anxious to deal with I mean this isn't like suddenly going to go away I'm In you know after the election\nNo it's not no it's not it started when Trump was elected certainly not going away after it's not going away anytime soon now but but I but I Wonder though I mean I Am\nI I think okay so the Kavanaugh hearings or another example okay for the media you know they they couldn't they couldn't hide that they were broadcasting they may be hearings\nSo they couldn't play down how the Democrats embarrass themselves in the country and the way they treated Kevin\nMhm right\nWell I mean surely cook who you know the the cook political parties are kind of D.C grew and this is a quote those who led this out of control demonstration on Capitol Hill against the cabinet nomination have any understanding of how much damage they did the Democrats and the party's chances of winning majority in the Senate\n... well now there is no\nWay I Do think the capital here just like the creators you were talking with Maxine Waters Cory Booker Kamala Harris all those I think that this is going to be a problem for them and in terms of how to be fair minded average American is going to look at look at at the at the in the mid term elections\nAnd again I maintain a Bruce the sad thing about all this is that\nWe need Democrats in the fray here to be on deck to help us you know come up with solutions\nTo solve the problems I mean they are so unhinged right now they've lost their mind because they hate Donald Trump so much just like whoa you guys go figure this out go call time out go out in the woods maybe you'll find Hillary out there I don't know but maybe you might find the other part of your mind that you lost\nSo that you can come back and be a positive part of getting this country back on track because to be so unhinged and to lose your mind in the ... ... you know to this degree\nIt's like I'm I'm thinking man what do we how much longer is this going to last year we've got a lot of positive things happening in our country could you imagine\n... and not the distance you know I I don't know if we've ever had a ... you know a ... and ongoing kumbaya moment with Democrats in and bipartisanship that we could look back and say hey this is what this looks like a ... you know we can certainly talk about nine eleven but that was so short lived\nA you know because then it was like okay go to respective corners there and you can even talk after a Steve's beliefs and the Republicans got right um uh got attacked on the softball field but you know it just can't seem to\nSustain itself and um you just I don't know Bruce I just hope and pray that uh you know some a silver mines will um will take over here\nAnd stop the insanity because of the trajectory years very dangerous I mean it's one thing that you know physically attack somebody but uh you you know if somebody is that a couple I think Rand Paul says somebody's going to I mean and he got hurt but I mean right on many could get killed here yeah\nYeah and and the problem is that you mention is that if we don't have we need Democrats you're right we need Democrats to\nMeet us halfway All right that you don't get any laws passed in Congress unless there's bipartisan support\nFor the law Congress' job is to pass laws creating public policy in order to do that you have the have to compromise both parties have to compromise both parties have to meet each other half way you're not going to get everything you want to legislation but if you get enough where you want to support the legislation then that legislation will pass\nThat the national government is responsible for national issues issues that affect all three hundred and twenty five million Americans such a national defense in the states\nAre responsible for practically every other issue but especially cultural moral societal issues there is a sign them individually\nLet's face it the people in Oregon are very liberal so they will pass that that would ... the people in Texas and the jury them or not liberal or conservative they will never cast that act the point in being in a state that people have different approaches to\nMoral issues and that those differences must be respected that is the whole point so yes the people should decide the issue but should be state by state each state deciding that issue on their own\nYou know and if you don't like what your state's doing 'em hey uh that's why you haul it exists\n[laughter] I get it all back to it and he moved to the border and\nUh once again Bruce as we've discussed many times and the show a this is the beauty of our constitutional republic as we've got fifty laboratories here and they can experiment and do it and uh and this is what originalist a ... a ... looks like what a just a Justice Scalia presented to us\nYes absolutely so people are I mean\nAgain the founding fathers wanted a legislative branch to be first among equals why because the members of Congress members the legislative branch most holding to the people the ... the people on the sovereign power\nJustices or not elected they're appointed their decision should have nothing to do with politics their decisions should be based on their interpretation of the language in the constitution there is no language in the constitution dealing with suicide and he's obviously cultural issue again as I in my column over ... is a perfect example of this\nRight before the Supreme Court decided that gay marriage was to be legal in all fifty states\n... ... ... ...\nOkay uh let's see if we can reconnect with him here okay um and then you had the big wind up in the pitch and getting ready to come through here a bit again relevant to what a you know Bruce is articles pointing out to this is what a\nA you know an originalist perspective of a our law looks like and why are the Supreme Court\nOr you know has to look at it in terms of how it affects everybody hits a national perspective\nNot a local perspective and this is the problem or when the Supreme Court gets out of its lane and that we run into this is why I wrote the way it is so problematic still is this something needs to be the sides of the state level\nNot on a federal level\nAnd I you know and you'd think that we'd learn but a ... you know just as a as Hillary Clinton made it clear you know it's not a\n... in you know it's problematic for them when they feel like ah everything that they have fought for his they they you know the the Democrats everything that they've fought for the uh it is being lost in the process so ah you know they feel justified in their lack of civility Briscoe had he had a big wind up with a picture on ... versus Hodges\nRight either we go if it is perfect example of this so that that's often the station and decided that individually through the political process route what happened was that five judges on the Supreme Court decided that gay marriage is is to be illegal in all fifty states before over found was decided\nTwenty six states made a poetry to stay\nTo the state court decisions twenty four other states decided through the proper political process passing us how Lebanon voted voted yes on gay marriage Thirteen voted no but that still means that the court you surf the right of millions of American citizens to decide for themselves\nAnd issue as longstanding Hannah deep seated past traditional marriage that is not how it's supposed to work\nExactly will in California we keep citing ms or you know there was a a\nA ballot measure about the definition of marriage one man one woman eight million votes in California and said hey look this is the way we define marriage one man one woman\nAnd a one activist judge in San Francisco who happened to be homosexual says bad bad decisions and he vacated eight million votes and it's almost like nobody said anything it's like Atlas Shrugged Bruce\nHow are we going to leave it right there ... bill Martinez thank you Bruce
