Ford\nIn Mississippi the other night I made you a promise that we weren't going to do that with President Trump everywhere you go you hear media bashing this president and I gave you a pledge that I'm not going to do that [noise]\nYou know this shows an alternative to all of that and I let you down a little bit because I I pushed back on so focused on getting Kavanaugh\nConfirmed but I'm so worried about the senators who\nTurn but you know what he knows what he's doing I had a caller yesterday who beat me up pretty good and she was right I think her name was Janet so\nBecause I Need to be the alternative\nAs we've been for two years to the media is hatred of this president come to the show it's different matter\nForces two of my favorite people in America\nDoesn't want you to see we're going to visit with the Mac and we're in Atlanta\nLenny we got one coming out and busy breaking news additional might gather show continues [noise]\nWe've been talking about all the things that are up for grabs in November Medicare is on the ballot the government program dedicated to seniors the one that we've paid into our whole life under attack by the Democrats they call it Medicare for all it's not an idle plant\nRight now in the house floor Seventy Democrats have a bill that would turn Medicare into socialized medicine kids couldn't be enrolled in Medicare at birth illegals can Bloomberg has reported that the costs of Medicare for all would be thirty two trillion dollars well Medicare is on the ballot but a Mac\nOr not good I mean this is this thing has just exploded and we've lost all manner of demeanor have we know\nWe have and one of the problems is bill if the if you remember while there are two things one didn't used to be like on Supreme Court nominations not on Supreme Court hearings they were usually pretty much pro forma state affairs ...\nBut the problem now is that the stakes are so much higher because the Supreme Court if you and I discussed has involved itself in so many issues that it has no involving itself and\nSo the argument the confirmation hearing the argument between Democrats or Republicans over Kavanaugh is basically the Democrats fear that once he's on the court\nRoe v Wade may be overturned exactly\nCertain any roe v Wade was an issue that the Supreme Court no court should have been involved in\nThe right the number one there's no language in the constitution that says anything about abortion there's no language in the constitution as anything about general right to privacy which is what role was based on but the problem here is that it's not a legal issue no constitution mix of it so what does that make it\nIt's a moral issue it's a social issue it's a title issue abortion\nThat's those are moral societal cultural issues those are political issues those are issues that shouldn't be cited by the people to the political process\nNot to the court right and yet the court now whether it's whether it's over to felt they are now involving themselves in so many issues that they never were supposed to involve themselves in and did not in the past so the stakes are so much higher so Supreme Court nomination hearings are going to be that much more controversial\nWell little did they know at the time in Nineteen Seventy three when this activists judiciary did what they did in a you know in instituting roe v Wade\nUm you hear what Brett Kavanaugh said of course a different case for him\nBut ah the same result is that ah you showed the USO the wind and you end up with a whirlwind and that's what we've got right now over this whole situation because now you talk about it being a moral issue and we have a a a post modern secular rise society\nAnd so a word as morality come from\nYeah absolutely and I but I but I Do not think that um\nThat that there's any danger Robie\n... waiting overturned anytime soon coming up with new kid on the block for and he will be the youngest will be the rookie judge right when the leaves leading the charge on that what I what I Want Kevin on the court because future cases like roe v Wade like over ... felt he will not want to\nRule on them mhm okay they ask for the past but even but because he's an originalist\nRight so he he ... he ... his rulings on what the constitution says it's legal or not we exactly\nRight so so what what I Want him in the court if because he will not be tea will not want to take on cases that the Supreme Court has no business taking on in the future I'm not sure I some point maybe roadway will be ... that would be tempted but I don't see it happening anytime soon\nWill you have a real be way being nipped at the edges by the states which is\nWhere this will probably ultimately be solved Bruce in or is that the states are stepping up and uh you know making modifications as you and I discussed on many occasions these are the fifty laboratories of our country when they're allowed to work as conservatives well\nYes absolutely and that's that's ... that's a very good point though because\nOn roe v Wade or write more cultural societal issue it's a state by state issue if not an issue because let's face it the people in California but certainly different attitude about abortion than the people in Alabama or Texas\nSo California have the legal constitutional right if they go through the legal constitutional political process not the courts named her right to say\n... will be way to find where the people in Texas and Alabama have the same right to say no it's not playing with a battery is it's a state by state approach just as you say\nBruce I Want people to understand when you talk about the political process I Want people to grab a hold of this is that the process starts in the voting booth\nOkay and this is what's happened right now is that we have followed the rule of law we voted we voted in Donald J Trump for president\nAnd one of the key issues according to the voters was that he was going to um ... you know choose a judge's with a conservative bent and an original is um you know heart toward the constitution I mean he was real clear on that so you had sixty two million plus people\nSaid Donald Trump is our guy he's here and so um yeah you know interesting that\nWhen it's the other way around the Republicans will yield to the presidential desires has there been debate a when a Democratic president has chosen a a judge you no doubt it\nIt's been it's been debated as a Lindsey Graham pointed out with a soda my or and Justice Kagan a day at a hearty debate but at the end of the day he says well you know um I\nI Can't dispute their capabilities and so he gave them a thumb up vote and that has been the attitude of most Republicans toward democratic nominations conversely the Democrats more and more\nHave a kind of thrown out the concept of um be a you know the electorate and that um you know elections have consequences only if it works for them but not on the other side I guess\nYeah and and they've thrown out reasoned debate okay let's take three ... samples Brett Kavanaugh\nI'm Robert Bork if you remember that the more curious how did he have a bit of Robert Bork America will be an American which return to segregated segregation wrote knocking on doors children not being able being not being taught evolution not be taught\nAt being taught evolution and I'm ...\nAnd ... and the return of a coat hangers in back out and everything\nSo that that was for me so that's how they and then [noise] then Clarence Thomas [noise] okay [noise] all of a sudden they bring up the hill out of nowhere just ... the former was brought out of nowhere\nSo yes where's the Republicans have been I mean there's been rigorous debate over the qualifications of the nominee of a Democrat not so much\nBut now it's come down to what's in your book and allegations that is the order of the day\nBut this was a real learning lesson or you know for all of us to really take hold and apprehend of what's going on in our government and yes we still have a voice and we can do something about it we'll talk more about it on the other side of the break with Bruce Hoffman our favorite historian right here on Bill

... you know we're not supposed to be ...\nCalled the separation of church and state in ... bibles aren't allowed in school but ah now that's not true at all that's what some would want you to think but the fact the matter is is that a look at our freedoms are still rained it said this degree and um this is what it's all about\nIt is and you know one story really account for heart I ever catch me right now for me I'm On a flight to lock\nThe ad and I'm sure you've heard about that sure there because we can't have scripture our culture today there are two religious organization to come to a drink quaint jarring time and a lot of the library you round but am I find that one of the people I Know\nHe's an I'm Patrick ... moving a lot of things going\nOn and we've got to get clean certain

into the stew I said poor he's been in the stew\nAnd uh and and it did no harm show this is what we should learn from this yes we're in the world not of the world and uh be in that sense um you know our government has allowed a contrarian view\nIt as a contrary and do but uh you have to trust\nIn the power of the truth and the word of God\nA this opens doors discloses doors it changes hearts a into a ... you know it is what is needed even for a time such as this and we're going to touch on this for just a moment because\nI Want to mothers perspective on what we find is going on out of D.C in the confirmation of judge Kavanaugh but you know either we believe in the power of the word or we don't\nAnd there is enough experienced there should be enough experience out there amongst adults
