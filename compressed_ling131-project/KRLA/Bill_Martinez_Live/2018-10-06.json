{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "All right so you're a little bit of history being made and you hear in the eyes and you're hearing the nays are the nose and a ... I don't want to kind of dragged it out for you because uh what what matters is what they're going to do and were reported it to you but here are the yes as Jeff Flake is he yes this is the cloture vote part one\nThe second part would be tomorrow for the full Senate vote on the confirmation of judge Brett Kavanaugh flake as he asked Collins is the gas and mention Izzy yes which is a big surprise today or\nA well again I I'm ... and I was speculating do shows how good I Am with productions that Heidi Heidi Heitkamp could be a no I mean yes rather because of Heidi Heitkamp votes no she's going to lose her Senate seat in North Dakota she did announce yesterday the Jews or no vote which means\nShe's absolutely going to be the former senator from North Dakota she's out\nUm but there you go three of the four key senators voting yes let's get your reaction to all of this one eight hundred six five five Mike\nEight hundred six five five six four or five three great to have you here in the relief factor dot com studios as we are uh watching history unfold right before our very eyes Terry Europe pay tearing welcome aboard what do you think\nLike a guy from New Jersey and I I take it a little more of a historical view this short kind of compare this situation or the civil war thank God the only difference is if we're not killing anybody yet\nNot yet one and I don't want to get one of them tried on a baseball field in Virginia remember\nYes absolutely but the reality is that Republicans Republican if they don't understand when you're an hour and you don't you learn and they were very well or they don't\nKnow there's this idea of a civil war is very real to millions and millions of Americans in that's fair um I've talked about this for years and I I remember being on a stage of ... of a few months ago with a colleague who sort of rolled his eyes at the at\nThe idea that we are in a cultural war we are in a war we're in a war for our nation shoals ... we're in we're in a battle over what how we want our country\nTo be what we want represented in this country what ... what are what our standards our values our laws are going to be a very big presumption here of guilt ... until you can prove your innocence we have turned American\nUm standards and values and mores honest here by the the by the activism or the left\nAnd it's frightening you know and and I I'm so I was reading about the Ellen DeGeneres announcing this week but she was a sexual assault survivor\nAnd you know that breaks my heart I think she I think she was a a ... if I saw it correctly she was Fifteen and that's horrifying that that helped define and shape\nHer that trauma that robbing of innocence and and everybody gets shipped pathetic and and an agonizing over such a horrible crime against an innocent defenseless child and we have had a robust conversation about women in the workplace\nBeing being abused and and\nTreated terribly by powerful men but then there's me to thing has extended into the cabinet process where allegations have been made from high school and early college that haven't been able to be corroborating\nAnd in this conversation about cabinet I keep hearing the left used that term you get to speak my truth this is my troops\nAnd honestly at last I'd love to find the caller who can help maybe somebody on the left and I don't mind I Would love to hear from you actually\nTo explain to me what my truth means because my truth may not be the the truth and it seems very clear to me\nThat the pursuit should be of truth\nAnd I I don't really understand that we can clear align Lance and see if we can get a caller who can help explain to me what it means when when when some of these um advocates and activists and voices say\nThat Christine Blasey Ford gets to tell her true true this is my troops this is her truth his troops will ... is that there's that kind of a shuttle acknowledgement that it may not be the truth\nWhat if Christine Blasey Ford believes with all of her heart the Brett Kavanaugh did it but he didn't so I'm just going through a hypothetical process what if what if it was another boy what if it was a memory that she has wrong\nIn the way she is recount in this some thirty six years later does that mean you can you can defend\nThat truth that isn't the truth in other words it does hurt truth supersede the truth I think about this as it applies to Brett Kavanaugh if that's the case\nThen a false who stands a man has ruined\nFamily is destroyed and reputation is shattered because truth the truth hypothetically Tim says he can explain it to me how you doing Jim welcome to the gallery show thank\nYou uh it it comes from the education system and the philosophy behind that education system and they operate on the philosophical axiom that perception is reality\nSo your your perception of what happened is your reality which you and I know it's not true right as if somebody believes pillow or seems a pillow as wrong ticket and after Iraq yeah they they quickly learn that perception is not really\nWell that that's an interesting way of looking at it so that that but maybe you're right maybe the belief is your perception is reality therefore that stand and frankly to most\nAmericans that's wrong that's not a normal logical understandable process\nBreaking now Mike Gallagher show All right the Senate has voted fifty one to forty nine\nTo advance the Kavanaugh's nomination there was a fifty one to forty nine vote and a shockingly to some Lisa Murkowski\nVoted no it was believed that Lisa Murkowski could be this was again considered one of the big swing votes one of the undecideds she voted no which of course signal she's going to be a no vote tomorrow in the full confirmation process however senators flake columns and mansion Joe mansion from West Virginia\nCame through and voted yes so you got a fifty one to forty nine vote if you were to lose some how in the next twenty four hours any of those three flake Collins or mentioned say one say last one of them let's say I don't know\nSusan Collins decides to join Lisa Murkowski and voting no\nYou still have ... the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh because Mike Pence has the president of the Senate breaks the breaks the tie he cash the deciding vote and uh you would win by one on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh Michelle is reacting to Lisa Murkowski's how you doing Michelle\nBrandt sound good because I was actually turn your radio down for me five before the hour here against\nFifty one to forty nine the cloture vote go ahead Michele [noise]\nPilots ... like Herman as as an academic out case a cell phone to vote for that cap now and I um I haven't actually I felt that that I just find that ... will let all these helicopters they're sexually\nAbused women are going to want to hear another side of the story she starts out with them just completely brainwashed by all of that which I feel like that's how she voted today and we just got the ...\nIt's the same it's a real shame and I and I believe again just like Heidi Heitkamp is going to be the former senator from North Dakota Lisa Murkowski is now going to be\nThe former senator from a from a from Alaska she betrayed her voters\nAnd she said no but thankfully we've got enough yes vote so I think we're going to get them across the finish line [noise]\nHaving up your reaction to this historic day will take a lot of calls were streaming up Mike online dot com again the Senate votes fifty one to forty nine to advance the Brett Kavanaugh nomination it's down to the Morrow senator and make it back from his wedding in Montana or time or not stay tuned [noise]\nThere's so much on the ballot on November the six Medicare is on the ballot the government program dedicated to seniors one you'd pay into your whole life is under attack\nThey call it Medicare for all and it's not an idle plant one of the house floor Seventy Democrats have a bill that would turn Medicare into socialized medicine you know who's in the middle of the fighting this you know who's on the front lines a Mac\nA Mac ... association mature American citizens my buddy Dan Weber an I visit every week talking about all the great things they're doing it the perfect alternative to the a A R P why do you need an alternative the A R P\nIt's simple the a P as liberal lobbying groups there pro Obamacare they had been all on board for lots of liberal policies\nI Am I Am I'm delighted to China payroll [laughter]\nIt's always nice I mean somebody's got to pay for you know all the right and there is like that I mean or or or do they pick you up now\nThat they've done that for quite some time but uh no I'm I'm kidding I'm really happy and you know part of the camera and yeah it's fun and enjoy it\nWithout a doubt I bet well Liz I'm great to have you here with us to talk about this\nA rollercoaster ride the brains are still exploding on the left over the Kavanaugh issue a couple of weeks ago you cited a this controversy is serious and a GOP has no option they've got to get this right\nOh I think that got to get it done what's interesting is that I think the Democrats have over their hand high interest is staying at a college thing a confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh or they first started to all kinds of printer thought as to sort of low tactics including\nA as he said character assassination and what's interesting is the American people don't like it a way of saying all kinds of calls shifting over the last ten days I think\nI was at first and say hey look at the generic ballot you know all of a sudden that's gone down a one or two points it had been moving in favor Democrats now it's really against them a Trump polling has caught up a little bit\nOf what most striking is that so called enthusiasm gap where a higher percentage of Democrats than Republicans are valid that they would go and vote that they were fighting about voting et cetera that's been cut in half over the last week though\nYou know I I think way late I always come back to this I think Americans are fair minded\nAnd they don't like the the ... the thirty seconds ago we all\nConsider it a matter of enormous and tanker base in say a lot of biased because it's his family has friends at a liar by his peers\nAll of a sudden bang characterize with no proof whatsoever as a land as guilty of sexual assault gang or a ... and all of these charges that as I said so far are simply that there are a lot ... than there is no evidence\nAnd I think people are really pretty horrified by that\nI was I was concerned when they first started talking including the president of the United states when he said that Dr forwards testimony was credible and that's not the correct to use the word it's one thing to believe somebody like an actress playing the role of someone who is very believable in that role in that part that they play\nA but it's something altogether different to be credible to be credible you've got to have evidence you there's gotta be some substantiate ... to your claims and after everything was said and done all the hours that we went through and\nThe show boating by the Democratic senators um there was no you know there was there was no solid evidence that you could hold to to even you know you kept saying you know and like I could go and kill give her the benefit of the doubt let's give her a lot of space I knew a lot of people were real sensitive\nAbout saying anything whatsoever hours the other night the president really caused to\nThe less brings to explode when he was a basically utilizing her testimony [laughter] you know presenting the facts there at the campaign rally and you know the people in the you know some on the left we really didn't like it\nBut I got to tell you some on the right to you know the well it's it's not dishonest what he's saying you know it gets back to Trump's ah you you know his style and and his tone I guess\nWell and I think really what happened and he was saying out loud what an awful lot of people in a in a country what thinking exotic was you know all the ... what's interesting to me is a way this thing has shifted and you know your your list starts like fantastic so there's a website that in real time\nA site betting odds and when she can testify the odds of\nCabin on being from it they went from putting reasonable high ... high odds at all because everyone thought oh my gosh and by the way Chris Wallace on ... because it was his toes speakers have such a good job\nAnd I wish I was shocked to Chris Wallace rolls I thought he rolled pretty quick on this I mean he went to any level I don't know just say\nEverybody was afraid to say anything other than that I think honestly but what's interesting is when cabinet started baking the odd but right back up again so it truly by the end of the day was shape than a audience\nGenerally found both of them believe Hubble and so there we are again no proof no evidence that allegation which\nIn a second and third generation to the point where the third with an audience quiet charging angry and they can't ludicrous and I think actually I think if any one individual I Would fight to individuals who really hurt the Democrats\nA quest chair wanted Dianne Feinstein because I think a lot of people that come here saying wait a minute she sat with us Matt in her office this good person again so highly respected et cetera and she never even asked him about these allegations how in shale minutes that I mean to me that's just plain\nThat sets it honestly and conceivable the second person is ... and for anyone was interested I wrote a piece about him\nI don't know ... weeks ago at the request of thought that I didn't know anything about the guy but I did a fair amount of research on him he is a horrible individual who and miss two by every partner every white ex wife everyone is ever had business with basically as they would have for\nShooting for ... for dishonesty so people should look into this guy but forget they get all the time that day\nExactly will lose um were you surprised a\n... you know we're just like I mean he got hot box to his good friend in fact I wrote a column on this as well as I was concerned that\nThere you know the last a week or so where ever since he got hot bucks by Chris Coons I think the Democratic leadership so whatever you do do not let him get out of your shadow you say hook to his ship\nYou keep drumming him with [laughter] you know with a dialogue and you know he's kind of or he might be our insurance policy after everything is all said and done\nBut really it it seems that um you know just like to the country to favor\nBecause look at the numbers you know to your point now that the uh Best Buy this seventh background check has come out about this that doesn't you know it's still the same I mean there's no there's no big bomb coming out of this thing so far what we're hearing is a look at the numbers I mean they have a ... that they are\nA dominant now to make sure that Kavanaugh gets confirmed\nYeah that was the interesting thing too is\nThey are polling and a lot of days swing state Senate races where I think the Democrats are putting charged up and now they're ... they're charged up so you know look at some of them ... looks in trouble seriously a high Catholic gone oh she's hassle I think it's a serious trouble\nAh they kinda go down the list and there's really a shift in some cases\nAlmost double digits in the last week or two as people look at this and say hey you know what ... like I said it is incredibly important to what I Want to have accomplished that country\nUm and by the way it Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed which chair point I think it will be a bad and there's also a task that there's a lot of justice\nSaid that comes available particularly if down ...\nIt matter or we have to go through with another justice and our ...\nI I think it won't even be as terrible as it is I think it's time for people in the current member is Paco said well why didn't Gorsuch has such a big problem well of course that twist take her ... and that did that change the ... the court\nLives we ... we say okay we'll pick it up from there we come back more realistic after this [noise] fears that\nHouse being trashed while a gang seas around

connect the dots disjointed Li like that to come up with that kind of conclusion\nWell I think that and I think also the fact that uh I'm actually\nGlad that we had that extra week because people are finally beginning to nip away and chip away at first story her story has changed on for a little different brain counting of place time\nEvent et cetera and there are other issues coming out I mean I've written about by all of them which are little things but to quote up all people Richard Blumenthal in mind may want to make it out all the rest and when she talked about all she had she needed more time\nTo drive across the country okay it sounded fishy that we know it's that's playing ally and not only if he's lying about\nThat for apparently political reasons what else she lied about well there's a story out I don't know if he had read it about the second door\nYeah yeah yeah\nYou know that that\nWas okay it was a business decision not a psychological and Ryan\nLet's face it like trying to get around Sony laws because they were taking in borders need a second door so that you know that you're now the Democrats today I think I think this is certainly interesting that they're reading the\nFBI report the supplemental report they're coming out saying oh gosh you know there's so much that really wasn't on for example we really need them they should have interviewed Christine Blasey Ford\nI tell you what be careful what you wish for because I think the FBI I sit down to grill her about her recollections about the four different stories she's given about this whole second orange that I think she is Taliban and this whole narrative goes that way I Do they really want that\nNow for whatever reason I think they're pretty sure it's not going to happen so that's why they're talking about it\nWell is going to leave it there is always we appreciate the time and inside she's a contributor to Fox News Fox News now you know why she was brilliant and this is why\nWe counted an

uh let's pause for a second and have an FBI\nHave the FBI looked into these matters you know we'll give it another week and that will be at that will be the scope we'll we'll look at these issues here and have the FBI well the FBI his process this report and what we know and what we've heard so far is that um there's no\nThere's no mother of all bombs here or there is nothing is it's just um you know again it's he said she said ah is we've been saying here I take great exception\nTo the idea of the use of the term credible it was like wait a minute you guys are some people you know most of you graduated from college the first good number of you are attorneys and we understand what you do with the English language already you already make up words and do all that if you think not talk to a court reporter\nFor up to take dictation and uh you know it's quite comical dear friend of mine and many years ago it was a court reporter\nAnd she would tell me the stories of ah these attorneys and the words they would make up and it was their job to straighten it out and to interpret what it was um you know we're adding to the language but um you know the thing is is that and even the attorneys no what credible means\nCredible means there's evidence it means that it is a ... it's more than believable but it's believable based on facts based on evidence not on emotion not on a somebody being able to\nPerform as we've talked about a very believable in that you know\nIn that starring role that she played and um but uh that's one thing but to save somebody is credible especially when you're talking about something like this and the and the idea that this is not a court of law yes that's true because let me tell you if it was a court of law\nAt least none of these cases would have come before the court they just throwing it out and that was my big question early on look at it this big violation is taking place why didn't Dr Ford\nTake it to the city tickets to the city officials take it to the police and say look at a um you know event this memory is come back which is you know that's a whole nother a consideration in the legal parlance\nOf a a a recovered memory in terms of it's about a validity but nonetheless okay uh she goes in and present your case\nThat's where it should have been presented not in the court of public opinion and here it is she
