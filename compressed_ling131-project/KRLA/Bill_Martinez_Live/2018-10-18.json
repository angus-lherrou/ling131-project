I I'm thinking about\nPeople being held to restaurants and shouted down and Hillary saying there can be no civility until we the Democrats when she said until we win in November we never act that way we never do that to other people we never we would never do that and we wouldn't accept that there is a stark difference between the way\nPeople on the right and and in fact many independents react and the way these activists\nI'm behave and punish the the fact is the the the lack of denunciation by Democrat leaders\nOr the lack of condemnation over some of this egregious behavior it's a it's a it's a powerful and type it on the Democratic party of twenty Eighteen\nIt is very revealing and certainly to the degree that we can dramatize that and make them pay a price on the ballot box we should\nBut I Would go beyond that and say that if I got getting even more out of hand which I think it's quite likely particularly if the Democrats don't win the house Republican poll the house on the Senate and then we're on the twenty twenty um\nI don't expect it to get worse and I think what this means is that a certain candidate to particularly the glue by Berkley talk back to end up spending and the national guard a and\nAnd I think Republicans ordinarily would find that the extreme shouldn't because protecting people First Amendment rights I mean what could be more fundamental than that\nThe theme of death of the nation and I am so proud to make sure everybody knows\nThat a way to see the movie it's streaming it soon going to be out on DVD but you can get it now you're going to death of the nation movie dot com not since Eighteenth sixty have the Democrats so fanatical he refused to accept a free election and leave it to the national issues\nHe was not alive and that and probably been tortured to death [laughter]\nI'm Still not sure though whether it was the Saudis per se or whether some other actor in the region had a role in getting that team over there\nSo I think you know it's just a super complicated situation for the United states to be in because he has\nCancer fault and they're also our ally in the region and it's just one big tight rope for the president to try to walk to figure out number one what the facts are as best we can and number two what to do about it if we find out it's like we might think\nWell like you say there there are a key ally there are a big part of the future and a policy and part of the eye you might say the Trump Doctrine for the middle east\nThere are a key Lynch pins all this stuff and of course you know we've got oil in the middle of this uh you know they're a position to I'm really help with the you know the middle east peace effort\nAnd all this now is in question and what aggravated this even further sitting here and tell me if I'm wrong here was that you know the Saudis were very slow\nIn addressing this issue I don't know what they thought if this was just going to go away and it was only until a year in the last day or so that you started to hear that ... you know first of all President Trump said it may not be the Saudis it could have been somebody was rogue\nIn all of a sudden that starts um you know coming out ever so slowly so the I I think the lack of a you know direct information from Saudi Arabia\nHas put them in a in a bad light over all this don't you don't you think\nIt has that that could also be a reflection of them not having authorized to begin with and kind of being blindsided by it too\nBad I'm kind of curious to pump ... went to Saudi Arabia first night I mean if it had been me either gone to turkey and go on to the\nOpposite building Hochul it or whatever it was and gotten any tape to watch the videos or listen to any recordings are interviewed everybody would talk to me you know maybe they've already gotten that information I don't know\nYet quite possibly well then you know initially\nUh when it was announced or that he was well first of all he wasn't going to go it was like the trip had been cancelled and then the following week is now it's back on and uh you know and and your point is well taken 'cause I'm with you on this is why do why don't you go or maybe he's already has the information is going to sit there and say\nOkay you know um we got damage control here what what are we going to do\nYeah yeah it's just couldn't be more complicated\n'cause you're I mean you have basically a he's not a citizen but he worked for 'em and American or outlet and Washington\nYes and so ah so here it is and and then again it's deja vu one more time and it's not the Russians this time but now it's Saudi Arabia and with everything hanging in the balance here it's a really makes this very very difficult\nIt does I just feel for everybody involved because it's going to be\nIn video recording that's going to be really hard to get to the truth even if you know did what and exactly what happened in that room there's not going to be a recording or a video of the orders given or you know\nAnd of course the Senate wants to cancel 'em you know military purchases we've got a hundred billion dollars plus\nAnd of course that's painful for the president ... he knows that's going to work against a ... you know his local alliances that he is struck up with a with Boeing and the other uh\nUh aircraft manufacturers or this puts all this at risk and and you've got senators ah yelling hey cut it off where we we don't you know we want to cancel you know we want to cancel the deal with Saudi Arabia now in light of this\nWell if we did that just bomb somewhere else what good does that do except and all but business to another country\nRight and I think that's in part is the president's point is that\nUm and and and then not to mention the fact that you know we've got to get to our brains are around the facts of the matter here we we don't know if this is somebody who's gone rogue or this was as some have suggested authorized by you know the king himself\nYeah and I've also seen speculation that Iran may very well have something to do with it since it would like to drive a wedge between the U.S they used to be a good way to do that\nWell and it's interesting you know in terms of turkey as well you know a ... ... what ... what does this do you know with the with our relationship with turkey\nExactly and how the hell did they let this happen\nRight exactly well um if we can uh a big question I repeatedly get from people on the heels of a\nYou know the whole Kavanaugh [laughter] um the circus as some as refer to it a a course to the judge a judge the justice Kevin no now his case has been referred to the temp district by chief justice Roberts explain to our audience that process and what that was all about\nI'm ... I'm assuming you're you're you're talking about the allegations against him had been referred to the gym circuit\n... what happened was he was it was more um you know ethics was called into question about justice Kavanaugh's response during the hearing and I I think there were twenty five complaints that went to chief justice Roberts and he decided to refer it\nTo ah the temp district he did he didn't want he could have done it himself\nBut I guess a for transparency purposes and um you know the show or you know no prejudice on this he turned it over to the ... district to have them look into a ... you know the complaints that were filed against judge Kavanaugh\nYeah well I'm sure that it was going nowhere there was I Can't imagine any sort of a legitimate complaint against him as a result of this testimony\nThey're not given the position that the Democrats and squirted cut him and when nothing short of appalling but Justice Roberts would have done that because number one it's a colleague on the court now the Supreme Court justice now than\nJustice Roberts and the Supreme Court could have handled it but ... not and they have to refer to it I mean the is they have to send it to one of the ... circuit court to review and that would not be the these these circuit because that's where a judge Kavanaugh so that it will be an ...\nAn independent ethics review by the tenth circuit but I'm I'm sure [laughter] I have no doubt they will find that nothing in an appropriate Iraq\nExactly sitting here ... where there's got to go quick break stay with us America this bill Martinez\nUnited States of empire is above their claims the United states is the empire of the world's\nGeorge Washington had warned us against more and more as the United states of empire shoes the world war is one and two left one broken piece for my call and tell us how to save the empire\nWas there ever a vote who do we fight for the deep state began with World War one of the United states of empire by James duff\nDebatable at Amazon Books\n[noise] let's come for much talk about down home values late in the usa ...\nLike you more as a kid I remember\nThere's now\n\nBaseball\nTeam the way they\nVoted down and cry\nMany\nOf them were good old fashioned comfort Vietnam and got the genes every stitch guaranteed in order to vendor motorcycle income scale or reinforced C.

since uh Donald Trump was elected president they've resisted\nTo the point of where they're totally unhinged and they don't care if they blow everything up\nUh they're they're just like all in with all this insanity are they not\n[laughter] yeah they are all and when the insanity and the leadership and the Democrat Party even seem to be on getting it out and ... ...\n[noise] well it's what the

in and he he was in targeting politicians he was as you stated in your in your article here in your column\nA he was going after Republicans I mean\nThis is a and I and I say this the conservatives need to wake up and realize and I think slowly they are but they just it it almost seems like they don't quite gather just how diabolical this is because it it's not necessarily within the conservative mindset\nTo see things see violence like this and this kind of unrest as I'm there it is you know just something we see every day it just seems so on American\nOn it it is definitely on a on American when you don't want an election Hillary Clinton\nLecture Donald Trump and all of this that when you don't win an election year for us to allow a peaceful transition of power and yet she couldn't even come out and on the night that it was clear that she was not winning an election actually even give us a statement she had to wait till the next day and\nDuring that time people under ... began\nProtesting from the night of election day on twenty sixteen and they have continued I ever since and then it's gone from peaceful protests chew very rapidly to violence that we've seen in
