all lying down here in the background oh how cool sweetheart I don't know that we can loon at the ballot box or a higher level and on ... straight Republican\nThat what do you mean what ... what ... what do you mean we don't know if we can win at our level what does that mean of course we can win every poll suggests we\nAre not believe that the corps and that's why we voted for Donald Trump I generally with all my heart we as a people know that there is an element in our government that has not been good for that and we hit rent Bowden voting Ronnie\nBut rather you can run that you can't lose face now you can't give up now\nMy faith is itself from that I Am telling you I feel\nLike I Am and the people and I I visit with the people in rural neighborhood are there any my church and good you know their own factor alone stuff that we're scared but we did go in there\nYeah but that I you know whatever they call it that that\nThere are a part of the government in our that core\nThe deep state the state I got your rather listen I'm Guy got a bunch of people that want to talk and let me say this and I hope you listen to me carefully don't waiver now dear God don't waiver now this is not a time to get a weak stomach this is not a time to say well maybe we're not going to know that we're gonna when\nWe got to where we've got to fight for this country we have got to be engaged involved you got to get your friends that you're talking to so lovingly in your neighborhood you got to get them to vote you got to encourage you to vote you got to tell them to vote Republican across the board\nAnd that's how we win this it's not it's not a battle of which with a bunch of ... people who are blaming President Trump for hurricanes and pipe bombs\nLooking at a period in which we have to sort of sidestepped the fed and\nUh try and sort of figure out what they're going to do next um but there are a lot of headwinds things that used to be tail wins like lower oil prices suddenly became\nHead when it's when gas prices went up a dollar is going up again which of course hurts a lot of multinational companies were translating overseas earnings than at a a less favorable rate you know so there's some stuff going on and there's no question and of course we have the mid term so exactly\nThe way and not and not to mention seven thousand and counting [laughter] my average than they caravan heading north you know from uh where they are\nMore and more and in fact I think the number has gone up since last tuned in and now there's a second care of and so you\nKnow they're sort of hurricanes that keep us and now they're caravans they keep coming at it but you know I think all of that means\nThat there is no calming of our political waters to put it mildly a and of course today these bombs that have been\nFound at CNN and Hillary Clinton's house and so forth I think have people on edge I frankly I think Democrats are delighting in the fact that they can\nThrow the whole issue of misbehavior and extremism and violence back and the Republicans lap and somehow blame Donald Trump or for everything you know by you know it's it's just a pretty uneasy time\nWell you know the Democrats had been leading the way and their lack of civility calling for civility and of course Hillary Clinton says will be simple as soon as we are back in control so in other words we're going to bully you into uh getting us back into office and having a Nancy Pelosi at all\nUm you know on the steering wheel I mean uh yeah we we we tried that for eight years and it works so wonderfully we just have to have them back right\nWell I think yeah I think that's right I mean I ... it it's worth noting that for the first time in years in September all of a sudden Republicans had higher approval ratings than Democrats dead I according to Gallup and I think that came about partly because of the\nWay Democrats handled that Brett Kavanaugh hearings and I also think it's because of all the\nSort of civil disorder\nAnd and the misbehavior they've been prone to and particularly since they've gone after individual like Mitch McConnell on most recently and I think Americans really just despise that kind of behavior there's no place in our society for\nUh people to harass others just because of their political leanings and when you have to\nYou know senior members of the Democratic party calling for that\nLike Maxine Waters Cory Booker et cetera it's pretty unnerving to ... to me frankly because you know somebody who is on Fox lot any kind of wonder if some learn text gonna take issue with your very being right it it gets a little scary\nNow is pretty aggressive and I heard a one a liberal commentator\nA last night ... pretty emphatic Lee a call or a you know Sarah Sanders Huckabee hug Sarah Huckabee Sanders a liar\nAnd I said well this pretty harsh I mean and yeah pretty much justifying this kind of a\n... not rhetoric but activity that uh it's okay to go ahead and and attacked people and you know confront them at a restaurant and all this I mean come on this this is really out of control but you know what what is really prevailing here lives at the end of the day I think commonsense\nUm I Know it's been a rare commodity [laughter] that's that that even makes sense to say that that way\nBecause almost sounds like an oxymoron to say the common sense is a rare commodity but it seems to be that these days but\nI think that what happens is uh households in main street America across this country are sitting down and actually having a conversation and saying hey we want this kind of insanity do we want mobs versus jobs are now you know do we want to kind of momentum that we're having here even in spite of the things that\nUm you know as you mentioned earlier these headwinds are brought to you in part by\nCertainly Nancy Pelosi the Democrats the resistance party a party this really lost itself I mean they're so unhinged it's it's like they've lost their personality and uh they're just out of control it's like they need a therapist real quick\n[laughter] you know I think it it's amazing it all kind of boils and goes back to the election you really couldn't stand the fact they still can't stand the fact that they lost the election to ask the sixteen and part of that really\nIs on a mass media because everyone heat up Democrats to think they were going to win and when bank and when they didn't win this\nPilot non politician who had no money to spend no background as a politician et cetera\nCame through in one person that they considered a buffoon joke et cetera or worse or you know they really just kind of went haywire and\nYou know living in New York from ... ... it was really kind of a sad thing because we won the election and boy the next thing you know the streets are full of protesters and that really hasn't stopped I don't mean that the protests have been\nAs huge and noisy and annoying as they were in those weeks after the election but really the sort of whole essence of the Democratic party is the resistance it is\nUh basically protesting and just you know kind of think what that word means the outcome of the ... the sixteen election and as I say I don't really think it's working for them I mean I you know we will see very shortly what the mid term elections turnout to to be\nBut it to the extent that they've been pulling back their expectations of blue wave\nA I mean I'm told that the polling and at sixty districts that are actually content contested or in the house are that is basically dead even at this point things are um I think they'll go completely berserk and they don't win the house that's\nThat's what I was going to tell you that Tom press now he's going I don't want to even talk about a blue ... we're not talking blue wave we're you know I don't even know who brought that up you know oh yeah you're right it's in some self from this but you know that's the thing that makes you wonder they went ballistic and twenty sixteen ... and they're saving grace was\nWell twenty Eighteen we've got a wave and they've been talking this up I mean what are they going by\nDoing you know ... they're not really doing anything to win back those voter athlete who they lost in his house and the sixteen and I\nKind of I just had a piece out today about it I mean if you think about what are they offering the middle class that's really the big argument in this country right now and not you know the poor people because all those programs are kind of set in stone although some want to amplify them certainly\nIt's not wealthy people obviously nobody cares about them but the real question is what\nYou know whether a whose policies really are going to attract middle class voters then I I watched his top pretty close and I got to tell you all I see from Democrats appealing to the middle class is lying about the tax cuts which which they do they say that the middle class didn't benefit and in fact the middle class\nDid benefit to the tune of something like five to Fifteen Percent in terms of what your income level was it isn't huge to be sure but\nIn addition lying about the fact that the economy and the growth of the economy filters down\nTo those workers when when unemployment is three point seven percent when wages are now\nAccording to the Atlanta fed tracker going up almost at four percent when everyone seems to have an opportunity to upgrade to a better job exactly the middle class folks and they are doing very well so in fact I'm I looked at some polling yesterday\nSaying well before we go there are we going to go down Greg more from Larry ... stay with us [noise] here's a\nSon of a house being trashed while a gang sees

Venezuela supposedly is part and parcel they're paying for the migrant caravan I mean like you know the story never ends here\nWell and then my grand caravan going back to that where we started um I think is yes it has been funded apparently by left wing activists in central and South America a ... and\nIt was for the sole purpose of embarrassing Donald Trump and it is pretty remarkable because what really is the outcome of that is just exactly like the wave of\nFamilies that came across the border when Obama as president Americans come face to face with the reality of our immigration problems that we don't have appropriate laws that we ... we cannot allow tens of thousands of people just to stream into our country generally speaking\nNone of us knows about this we're not watching it we're not watching the five ten\nFifteen thousand people a month that are coming into our country but now we are because of this thing has garnered so much attention but you know what this is on Democrats because Trump had a proposal on the table if you're a member a many months ago which was made up of very reasonable\nUh positions on immigration including by the way allowing the dock of people to stay which was sort of the original uh energy behind us but also including things like getting rid of the diversity visa\nReforming our rules for who can come into the country cutting that chain migration all those things and you know what if you go back and look at polling even Harvard falling on that people like those ideas\nLike rats didn't even come to the table to discuss it\nLives

way like it's America Martinez you're twenty minutes before the top of the hour waiting on a call from a Anthony Scaramucci are going to be talking about his brand new book from the blue collar president also of course\nAre talking about uh you know the more reveal a some more reveal on these are on these alleged bombs\nThat have been distributed things there's eight maybe nine now and counting I'm and I'm a you know it makes you wonder you know I've got one report that there wasn't even a detonator on these bombs that is certainly a scary thing nonetheless a but a lot to be still analyzed and considered here\nAs a our resources a bit as the president has called them out to do everything they can to find out who is the perpetrator of 'em are these bombs so I'm curious to get Anthony Scaramucci's a read on this as well\nI'll tell you you know you hear his name as nicknamed move towards ... you know as as kind of a child when your name like Scaramucci I mean you're going to be known to scare moods or whatever\nUm and his good you know it was the mood so ah you know you think okay ... what what is what is it about this guy um who um you know kind of rose through the political ranks and ah you know became um yeah I mean he was a American financier not print or a political figure\nI I mean his background is quite story he's the first of the kids and his family to go to college graduate graduate from tough goes to Harvard law school\nI'm a successful business career and uh you know than a is asked by the president to be on the transition team\nOr if you recall and then from the transition team um he ends up as the as a consultant or as a um oh what what you get more than a consultants he was a um [noise]\nOh a chief strategy officer there and I'm so lost my mind here for just a moment chief strategy officer of the export import bank and then he was asked by the president come in the service of communications director and of course we know that that lasted\nEleven days and since then of course he continues to carry water for the president and a and I and I say not only for the president before we the people\nWho are um ... you know grateful to have a um as he was title in his book a blue collar presidents someone who's looking out for main street America I mean again I go back on that or\nAn operation speech that ah the mainstream media said was rather dark and I think they'd be getting originally thought it was dark\nIs that they realized that uh there's a new sheriff in town and it was going to be totally different than\nThe previous sheriff in town you know going along to get along and you know kind of of going with the rhythm of the bureaucracy and the deep state I'm not I'm not going to happen you know I'm not going to happen that way and what Donald Trump is more concerned about that is that um\nHe's concerned about the forgotten men and women forgot you know he's concerned about our country you know this republic\nUh supposedly driven by a the U.S constitution and there are those forces that want to throw that out I I just don't I mean really to me the midterms that's when it comes down to is that either we're going to continue to protect this constitutional republic or\nGo along with the way the Democrats are moving because they have Trump so much\nAnd um they're willing to forgo um moral to any semblance of\nReflection of our U.S Constitution I mean let's be socialist you know that that's that's the answer really wow we got a pretty good close look at it uh you know for eight years under Brock Obama you know he said he was going to fund fundamentally remember fundamentally transform America really and while he came so close\nAnd look what he did look what he did to our debt\nLook what he did in terms of people that uh you know went on welfare that a ... you know it was suddenly found themselves with this growing\nReliance on big government this is what Democrats do\nI mean this is their way to sustain their lifestyle is if if they're in control of the levers of government and the bureaucracy pay they can make more people reliant on the government by handing out supposedly free stuff and I guess okay yeah as long as you have free stuff to give out\nA as Margaret Thatcher loses you know the problem with this [laughter] socialism is that\nEventual you run out other people's
