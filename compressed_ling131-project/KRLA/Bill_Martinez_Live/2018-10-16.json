AOL\nNow he'll be even more invigorated\nTo call her Pocahontas regularly\nWith great relish\n... this is what really looks like [laughter]\nI mean Donald Trump wins again the president wins again\nHad Pocahontas evidently as one\nA little tiny little little little speck\nOf Indian ancestry in her\nAnd her history [noise] wow good for you Pocahontas [noise]\nMay see rod because honest to goodness she likes to roll around in the mud clearly she ... she tried desperately to stop him\nOne in five hundred and twelve chances I guess to the right she perhaps as wanted more than five hundred and well it\nMakes them\nWell and that's all it takes to get you you know a a Harvard job to the tune of a half million a year I guess that's that's the that's the anti it's all you need now\nI guess we're all Indians now I you know that's of course we are right and then when of course when you look at in Texas said oh ... pretending to be a Hispanic\nI was running against Ted Cruz so and the Democrats can't just run on\nA you know a platform of course they have to inject identity politics and every thing and and this is just so absurd you know the Democrats right now are rejoicing on Twitter this that's crew she's Indian or whatever it was that she basically that\nYeah well I I I could be a real smart alec and asking along the way she have to find somebody else's birth certificate to but uh you know that's a whole another topic but you know ... it's just a ... you know a\n... we've been lied to before we've been told that something is that isn't and ah you know whatever I'm fine you know I I don't think that uh it it's going to be a disaster for is just another way for the Democrats to waste money so you know go put it in her campaign you know\nWell and Donald Trump all such wait it out to the original point about the audience that he is like a ... over to study Arabia king\nBecause of the mysteries surrounding the appearance of this journalist but it's also it's interesting that came out over the weekend bell is that the it's reported at least by Turkish officials that this journalist\nHow I was wearing a um apple watch and he recorded his own\nPerhaps murder murder or an add up all loaded at least a good portion of that video to his computer or I found that his girlfriend or fiance was holding up the time [noise]\nUm so this mystery will begin to unravel but um you know all really arrows right now all all gases are pointed towards a Saudi Arabia\nWithout a doubt and and here we are I mean you know of course the media's been having a field day on this because uh you know first of all time pale was scheduled to go to Saudi Arabia and\nAnd uh so then it was well maybe he's not going to go and everybody's energy acting you know their opinion there's a lot you know there's lots to work out here and understand I mean you know it was Saudi Arabia has been\nAn ally and of course in Saudi Arabia responds to the media response well if they do something else you know we're going to retaliate and you know this sort of thing well you know ... let's see let's see we've got the facts it'd be a purely Anderson\nI'm not a problem let's lay the facts out there but it's a rather suspicious that you have somebody who's been critical of the regime and a seemingly he's he's no more\n... and on top of that it happens ah it it hasn't even happened to him and happened junior\nEmbassy but you're in a foreign country you're in Turkey where this happens no brainer\nRight and when you look at study and hurt either both our border on it but sometimes you have to ask yourself with allies like that but it doesn't have any time and now we have two of our allies are fighting inspiring against one another\nAnd we're kind of getting dragged in the middle because obviously are journalists got dragged into that all of these two countries and we're just trying to connect the dots and figure out what happened to him\nBut the media of course wants a perpetual state of chaos the corps so uh yeah that that that is a Democrat or the computers and the chaos dependent on the up all the uprising attention benefits the Democrats are and so you know\nBe surprised if you're seeing headlines that are more like warmongering pointing fingers that any facts because that's journalism these\nYes right exactly yeah is the is definitely the era of fake news and world rabble rousing get all this I mean\nObviously something seriously has occurred with the with the journalist ah there's no doubt here he is he is am I a we have no idea and ah you know at this point without um ... you know have IOUs corpus you know what can we do\n[noise] factly and and the Democrats or you know they are now the party of your presumed guilty before proven innocent they probably would have watched this body already they don't know the power\nExactly you know those planes that we're sending to where now where we are sending 'em your way but there are loaded and they're coming they're coming to attack you're just getting do not misunderstand what I'm saying here ladies and gentlemen because I don't want a you know things are out of sorts anyway and yes but the Democrats\nSeeing Lee enough we were talking these days about civility um you know of course they're on hinge moment is really affecting their world view is it not\nWell and it's interesting that you bring that up because the ... bond but the latest Republican ad and I was very happy to see what she or he put out what I Would consider a very smart political attack ad whereby the GOP now is using\nThe Democrats actions as well as their guns down\nThat they've put together kind of like a minute compilation of Hillary Clinton Cory Booker Maxine Waters quarter leading Democrat Eric Holder calling for violence against Republican than their checks to post their calls for violence lack of stability\nAmongst the page or Bob like an sci fi ... and the woman that reacts chance that cabin on that was a paper or not\nUm and so it was an excellent ad and you're absolutely right I that's just what happened on the Democrat was power they will they be come out of control they resort to violent tactics violent rhetoric\nIn order to create chaos um and and they can do so because they have a cage or\nBut good faith\nDo it yes thank you very much George Soros and white American why why his mom become the new n word ... I mean\nBoy I'll tell you the mainstream media were you know CNN I mean absolutely when sideways and you know when somebody brought up you know mob always found them I Will agree can't talk mob you're just like okay well [laughter] you know ... how could we talk birth certificate oh my gosh you know much hands explode [noise]\nWhile the Democrats believe they own language and I'm not sure what dictionary they're using that there must be an aggressive form of the Webster's Dictionary because now whatever they're guilty of the other party of doing\nIt or they don't want to be referred to it the ... and what they are\nExactly and as you say this has been their modus operandi and this just isn't happening yesterday I mean this has been going on forever and ever it just keeps metastasize ing and redefining itself I'm you know like I guess if you can get away with it and uh they have been thank you very much mainstream media for under reporting on that more for making bars after this\nEver wonder how bitcoin Kareem were created are so many you as well under some companies and will make your own reason was watching and you have many art and giving back to the people\nWere so media companies regions of millions of last year alone during among the seals versus the public why don't the currency revolution were so media dot com V.
