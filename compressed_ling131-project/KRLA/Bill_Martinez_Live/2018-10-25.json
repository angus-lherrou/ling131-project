developing and\nThis will definitely change the narrative perhaps of those who are suspicious of ah Democrats being behind this mail bomb story because now authorities say they have intercepted a device that was intended for the White House\nA suspicious package containing a pipe bomb that was addressed to the White House was intercepted that joint joint base bowling in Washington DC law enforcement officials have told authorities atoll have told the reporters\nAsked him that this pipe bomb intended for the White House was similar to the ones center the homes of Obama Clinton and billionaire investor and major Democrat donor George Soros which was discovered earlier this week the devices appear to be rudimentary but functional\nThe White House addressed device also contained projectiles also moments ago the New York city police department\nAre confirming that the time Warner center in New York City where CNN has a bureau has been evacuated was not immediately clear who the package there was addressed to but CNN evacuated the newsroom as a precaution I'm also again the\nUnited States Secret Service edited intercepted too suspicious packages addressed to Obama and Clinton\nOr earlier this week so this is again this is why speculation as irresponsible it's not a to sit around and say now I mean what what does this do to your narrative that you think the Democrats are behind it\nOr I guess if it's a Democrat who's behind this\nDo you think sending a package above pipe bomb to the White House um\nChanges that that that theory we have to be responsible\nLet the Democrats with their stupid wild speculation about Trump being behind the murder of cars shockey\nA ... in the in the turkey constantly let them run their mouths and do all that kind of crap we we shouldn't we shouldn't do that and I don't believe we should speculate but obviously many people disagree with it that's okay that's what we're here for eight hundred six five five Mike\nHere's Darrow on this breaking news story hey Darryl welcome to the Mike Gallagher show how are you\nAt your much like a cliche yes and on on the situation because it's very important uh we'd all get these people it's kind of credit because it's just\nA prominent party to a Democrat because they ... they fall on the president and secretary in the United states and a crime against any former president Oh hi ...\nThe United states crime against the people you know so and then and then we have to realize that one day out President Trump is on the former president do we want things like that it happened they had\nYou know so we shouldn't we cannot allow them to be credited any party when they caught because that's an important day committed a crime and they should get paid to it but I find that it can make Evita\nAnd it doesn't matter what your political affiliation is not know how to write it does it does not matter of fact you're\nDaryl I appreciate very much that's kind of you I again I but I get the speculation I understand cynicism I understand I'm deeply skeptical way we're we're treating the the ... the the the arena right now we're in the arena we're fighting the top of a tough battle\nAnd there's some nasty ugly vials stuff happening out there for crying out loud somebody through a Boulder through a house majority leader Kevin McCarthy is office\nIn Bakersfield, California\nUm we've seen the the angry mobs and the and the the viciousness of people\nChasing people out of rooms ... but again this is this is not limited to Democrats Nancy Pelosi was harassed at some of them the other day by a bunch of uh of loud mouth or angry people who were cursing at her and calling her name's assure her out so\nAgain we got to just take a breath\nWe got to take a step back and we need to be calm we need to be adults we need to be responsible\nAnd it's not responsible the moment there is a a breaking news story like this of reports of pipe bombs being sent to the homes of the Clintons the Obamas but White House CNN Soros\nNo no I really think that's true you know on my mother's side I come from a from Irish immigrants and and they were longtime touch a staunch Democrat they would never recognized you know they were a yard there a pattern that I Would never recognized Democratic Party today because of their party was about patriotism and\nUm and workers and labor unions and frankly I wouldn't describe too but certainly in terms of the ... those are the party\nWas very much in America for a party\nAnd it is not that any more now now it's a party of globalism only interest and I think the worst of all it's a party a division that's already been a show\nUh taken an obsessed with identity politics\nThat they only really see us now not an individual is not as American as people in my soul\nBut instead as as people who need category based on ethnicity slash race and gender and and that's about it and nothing else really matter to you you belong in these pockets\nI'm ... and it's really a sad way to view our country to do our society thankfully I think Trump represents a revolt against that kind of thinking but it's it's a balance cultural battle of the political battle weight\nLoss was executive recalls thinking thinking and we got to get rid of that stinking thinking that isn't the kind that\nExpands everybody expands this country and uh you know continues to enlarge our family members as well\nSee you know the Democrats have really embraced and entitlement mindset not only for the entitled to a that they believe but also themselves they feel it's they're they're and they're entitled to be in power\nAnd is there a former standard bearer said um you look at you want us to be settled and give us the keys to the car again and start throwing a fit right\nWhat does that unbelievable you know I have to say as much as I Can't stand you know her comments on our philosophies and I am an American I recall I hear those kinds of things\nAlone bargaining with the people you know we'll be civil yeah your hand if the keys can come up you know that's how it works out really should be the starting point\nBut I have to say this as a as a Republican I'm I actually take some ... joy hearing her talk that way because she's revealing who they are taking the mascot law and showing us what they're about which is just sure power\nPolitics and certainly be damned a reputation for him to have you know all about how do we get from eighty eighty Z is power and and you're so right about that I'm ...\nI'm a mindset we saw in ... I mean I think Clinton with a coronation she really ... in the mainstream media did and that's why when when you want are incredible I call upset are trying um which surprised me not by the end anyway I was well until pretty late but then I really believed late in the game\nBut it absolutely astounded so many people are within the media leads and politically to this country because again they bought into that in title that mindset well she just has to be a ...\nYeah first woman and all this good stuff the glass ceiling everything and then if you are if you're a woman and you didn't vote for him you know a\nA metal in our own rights or someplace in health for you\nI'm a I'm telling you all that stuff in and of course let's throw in a deplorable comments here and there to just a really alienate yourself further but you know look what's happening again in twenty sixteen Donald Trump's out there are thousands of people coming to his rally here we are two years later thousands of people coming\nFilling up stadiums Brock Obama can't even barely get two thousand people that you and me are you kidding me seven hundred and fifty dead and I'm standing here and I talked about the last time we got together and you know so this thing's really falling flat and it's no wonder now we're starting to hear\nThe Democrats are getting nervous or they can only hope\nFor some possibility something good to come out of this a midterm election uh but I'm like you know more and more I Am I Am thinking that Democrats are ... they don't have the gavel to Nancy Pelosi not because she's not there in the position because they're not going to be the majority party in the house\nWell yeah sure I sure hope and pray you're right I Believe you're right I Do we got to keep working two weeks ago we were really hard we closed the gap tremendously though I have to say the Democrats unwittingly help us close that gap but things are merely primarily by the cat like I I think that was such a\nJust deport talking about the horrible and I actually I don't want you to work and I like to work really I Wonder if that was such a reprehensible display\nIn that in in those hearings on the underhanded tactics of the Democratic senators are typically Souter hunch died how dishonest and abusive and just totally unfair they weren't the American people saw rallied our side it could've been a lot of independence\nStay number one we don't need to give him a power and on Capitol Hill to these people but also number two that if we do um they're going to this is a dress rehearsal peach I strongly believe that article about it a real clear politics what we saw in the cabinet are hearing was just a taste of how they will get\nIf to impeach the president I Believe that would um and he would not have to go on a show trial last Saturday there will be much like the cat when I hear and what what many factors worst so you know let's avoid all of that\nOr by re electing Republicans and Dan electing in in the house I Believe a much better speaker or listen I'm critical of Republicans I think Speaker Ryan did some good things tax cuts were amazing um when he was not very helpful as did my opinion to the top agenda I think we can get a much better speaker\nI'm it perhaps McCarty or some other great candidates as well Jim Jordan whoever it is I think we're going to get much better more conservative more Trump Ian speaker of the house as long as we get the majority of Republicans and then we can do some great things in twenty Nineteen including middle class a more tax cuts with a medical\nAdult title is that all I Know the president announced that ten percent of middle class additional tax and hopefully we can from it with the right to majorities in the house and Senate than we can secure that and make it permanent not temporary\nRight now and and I think that's that's critical that we knew this because I'm trying to tell people is\nOn the negative side and Democrats show who they were ... on on the negative side look at this caravan what's going on in in Mexico right now and the need for real border control I ... I should say immigration in trouble at the border and in turmoil internally\nPeople again they're showing their hand even though they shouldn't be down ... they want to lemonade ice I mean that's an increasingly popular trend and not just on the outskirts of their party you don't just wacko fringe elements I mean from\nFrom sitting senators governors and big city mayors are they are increasingly becoming the power the guard that the parties shoot me of open borders and the wants to let me and I saw that the negative side to be up to oh boy did on the positive side trying to persuade voters and motivate them to\nThe incredible progress we've seen over the last almost two years ah it's terrific kitchen making America more confident more prosperous more secure but we can accelerate all of that if we give the president about what he needs which is Republican solid Republican majority of the house that I've done it twice I\nGot to send in reinforcements the court has is with us more from him after the break stay with us\nThe United states of empire is above their claims the United states is the empire of the world\nGeorge Washington had warned us against more and more as the United states of empire shows the world war one and two left one broken woman calling us had to save the empire was there ever a vote today we fight for the deep state began with World War one\nOf the United states of empire by James done little at Amazon Books\nMarijuana has unleashed the Green Zone Russia grocer nice is creating ... billion dollars new wealth a year and every day is transforming more and more Americans into millionaires and historical event former speaker\nOf the house John reveals how to become one\nJoined him on line for the American candidates some tendons is one hundred percent free spaces limited secure your spot checks and enjoy the full force zero\nFive five is the first time ever in a steam panel reveal which kind of sucks more time to deliver a life changing when in the weeks and months plus they will soon to become a ... investor backing the hottest started off school for\nThe potentially become worth billions of dollars\nAnd joined American kind of the summit joins too full force you know five ... tendencies three join for ...\nThe sound of a house being trashed one of the gang of these ransacked\nThey will ... will be destroyed\nHere resolve not to be the next victim of a breaking due to the TV dot com and discover a device to create the illusion someone inside is watching TV even your miles away security is the mindset of the TV should be part of your security solution will be vigilant but not fearful TV dot com\nI'm David\nFounder of ... where we're proud of our hundred percent grown in stone American Made Jake\nWhether you're out for dinner working on a farm or on the road diamond guessing genes offers a full spectrum styles inside this for ... years visit ... dot com\nBust U.

Mexico and America and uh but to his perspective is really um it it's very hard\nTo ah to embrace because it's so biased and prejudice and Hillary he he's hurting the cause he's not he's not helping by not reporting a with some sense of objectivity here I'm refusing to accept that their\nImage Thirteen gang members that there's a caravan of seven thousand people is a mixed group and uh you know Sarah record or even tweeted out yesterday she's there in location and saw Europeans are people from the Mid East so uh it's like\nWho's who's lying here is there a quarter lying is Jorge Ramos lying is the mainstream media lying or is this all just part and parcel of hey let's let's stormed the border and cause more problems for Republicans and Donald Trump\nAnd [noise] I I don't know I don't think they can liberate effort to chew khat heart problem for for Donald Trump or not but in the in the way it caravan of it is continuing to corral and state ... head north\n... very very concerning and I've watched it on\nTo have seen any of the people coming in trucks and buses are helping them out along the way it is\nJust starting to and they're carrying plaques of other ... they they\nThey walk away from their country in the middle east the it it ... ... these are people who are still I obviously or at least some of them though and carrying the flag of other countries are so proud that there are other country and yet they they are coming to America and\nSome have reported they tend to it to seek asylum here which which doesn't make a lot of sense it's interesting that you mentioned Sarah Carter we actually are are melting and by promoting I mean just notifying our supporters at ease tell that she had that and\nSo I'm Glad I'm yeah I'm Glad you brought that up because I wanted to talk about that that this is ... go ahead and this new documentary\nYeah it's a twenty five minute documentary called not in Spain and it's about the opioid crisis in America and it it ... ... how drugs come into the country including across the border but also the larger impact\nOf what of what's going on with this opioid crisis and President Trump's stance quite be signing\nA bill to help address some of the problems with the opioid crisis\nI just I really encourage everyone to go check out the ... the only twenty five that song it doesn't take very long at all to watch it it's called not in pain\nAnd work and they go to check it out I'm\nActually not anything got caught the eye and not yeah I Am just right but not in pain dot com\nYeah you want to you want to check this out and the thing is that I mean you talk about a perfect storm with this opioid crisis has been going on I mean we have ... you know you want to say hundreds of thousands\nOf ah addicted a patient's this started out you know that they got a legal prescription ... you know from their doctors\nOf the doctors were told by big for a minute this is a you know this is going to help with pain and in fact it does uh but uh let's read the fine print and see what happens or in terms of the addictive attributes the come into play\nSo now you have all these people that are now addicted looking for drugs or their health care in terms of ah being able to provide for this is is out in some cases some is that uh you know the patient ... says they're in trouble\nAnd so what do they do they're in pain and so they're scrambling they can't get it to legally so now I'm you know they're they're roaming the streets\nTrying to see what they can do and here it is in it you know it's all part and parcel of just as you said Jenny Beth I mean and this documentary will demonstrate to everybody and and help you understand just how complex is is that there's a lot of moving parts here and I feel for those people who are addicted\nThat uh you know we're we're part of the system you know doctors said to be based on big pharma that all this stuff and you know and this is what gives the wrong impression of
