... guide you saved my Linda ... del keep fighting the good fight safe travels and tell the president were all polling worried about praying for him [noise]\nHello to your listeners\nAs well um let's talk about what's going on in our country right now the vitriol are Democrats 'em upping the ante we just had a an outbreak here in Portland again and ... says on the run and it seems that ah\nYou know some of these cities are sheriff or just um you know they're welcoming this kind of violence or\nIt doesn't seem like they're interested in really you know standing or this kind of a addicts that it's a you know that is you know continuing to grow across the country you know what is it going to take some something really out of control before they step up and start being responsible and supporting or you know law and order\nForcing either that or law enforcement officials and I'm not talking about the lines are under orders mhm law enforcement officials are going to have to put these\nFrontline officers in a position so six to ... to keep the peace now they're being told to stand down there and the ...\nUp and in other areas of fuel rods are made and and the plan has to contain a contingency to print things from spilling over from turning into a riot really I mean and if it's out of control\nTheir mom they're right there on the totalitarian because\nThey're not as he passes the body fascism totalitarianism they sure do one thing\nNot to counter protests that demonstrate\nBut to instill fear and intimidation to initiate confrontation they fight not only with the group that they come to impose but they also fight with the police but there's nobody else around a fight with we've seen it they've thrown rocks bricks\nAnd you're still balloons and police\nAnd that for an anarchist group insurgency group they advocate for killing of cops they advocate for the down to the holy constitute in government but wish that the law enforcement executives are mainly talk about the higher ups the chief so to speak\nAbout what you recognize this group for what they are fighting for the Democratic party oh they're just like the brown shirts that were the fighting force of the Nazi Party that's why you will see anybody\nFrom the left from the Democratic party stand up and condemned the antics Atlanta for a they see them as a useful tool to you know places like fear and intimidation\nThat was going to say they're useful idiots at this point but sheriff in it you know with all the training your background I mean this goes against everything that you've ever done in your career and that is when you see danger coming you want to strike it I'm from its origin not wait until it comes to your street right\n[noise] yeah exactly look at least exist for two reasons I mean there are some other things with a range of reasons other or the rule of law and the second reason which is just as important\nIs to keep the peace All right uh prevent things from happening from breaking out into a situation where and its citizens get hurt or killed\nWe saw in Charlottesville where cops police officers are being injured and these are these confrontations and so I don't know the law enforcement executive but I was one for\nNearly sixteen years as the elected sheriff Milwaukee County I Would never put my officers on the phone line without the ability the resources and the ability to first of all keep themselves safe that could lead to then they just they say so that they can\nGo out and and and keep the public at large say prevent property damage that when they don't do that I think it's an ad in the case of that responsibility and their role in society\nWell not to mention they have families to they want to go home they want to be with their families\nThey don't want to you know a be a you know be victimized on their job when they're there to uh maintain order and as you say protect the peace now the thing I'm curious about is that we often hear that there are the same players behind a antifa and these radical groups that are funding them\nI mean we're sanctioning governments or for interference and\nUh things that work against the good of the American policy and American interests or why are we leveling sanctions on um these are\nThese perpetrators these people that are behind and teeth I and others that are supporting and paying for all this stuff\nWell that's a good question I don't think there's any will do anything to be honest with you\nI look around I looked at the Charlottesville incident and recently announced that they arrested for people who came to Charlottesville from California [noise] uh looking for trouble they they they came ready for battle\nThey said they use enhanced digital identify occasion capability to identify these perpetrators and then they ah they structure indictments or the federal statute\nAnd are these guys are are now in custody and I was wondering why or why are they not doing that\nAnd these other uh answer for ...\nAnd that's what I said I don't think there's any will to do with that was an easy one with what Charlottesville I mean I I'm\nYou know my hat's off to they're doing it in Charlottesville but all of a sudden now when it comes to a situation like you know we're talking about now I'm not just to Portland but in other areas near the FBI kind of hands a hands off but they don't get involved in it and I don't get that\nYou know well as you say the local governance is have a you know even told their local officials stand down and let them ride as you cited earlier and that's kind of been the attitude but um you know look what's happening in Chicago even uh the the neighborhood leaders are saying we need Donald Trump in here\n[laughter] yeah you know the resources the federal government to help to us or are they haven't asked for\nA little bit of a sticky situation if you force a poor should weigh in with the federal government because no crime fighting is a local issue older parents play a role in it as well\nBut it would be nice if the mayor of Chicago and this is not going to happen on exactly you know one would contact the department of justice and say look we need your resources in here come on and here was plan will use all combine all of them are limited resources\nBut let's get to get control of the street let's get this crime and violence under control because good law abiding people\nAre being hurt and killed him necessarily many kids shot and killed and drive by shootings\nBecause the streets are out of control is to reach out of control because to Chicago police department\nBut not for them or not by their superintendent Eddie Johnson them by the Mayor Rahm Emanuel and they're also under a consent decree from the Obama administration whether answer to design and more time doing our ports than they are on active patrol\nYou know this is a is counterproductive and and sheriff Clarke is as you noted earlier I mean this is a dynamic issue I mean if we're only talking about any teeth and that would be it but you know we've got a broken immigration system or we have MS Thirteen all kinds of you know we had sex trafficking\nI mean a law enforcement has their hands full right now and it's almost as if we're we're really not getting the help and getting a fair shot at being and being able to win if anything you\nKnow we're putting their lives in jeopardy and then asking them to keep us safe\nRight and and all the officers really important points to be powered motors that means to use reasonable force when necessary and then if something goes\nHaywire in this crazy world that we were just unpredictable world we live in a no fault for the officer the officer does want to become the next Darren Wilson the least off your chair I don't want to be the next\nYeah excuse me a second we got to go to a quick break we'll be right back more from sheriff David Clarke after this [noise]\nThat's the sound of a house being trashed one of the gang cease ransacked [noise]\nAnd what they don't ... will be destroyed\nAt least here resolve not to be the next victim of a break and go to the TV dot com and discover a device to create the illusion someone inside is watching TV even when you were miles away to use the mindset of the TV should be part of your security solution will be vigilant but not

at a time\nThe United states and empire is the most of their claims the United states is the empire of the world\nAt George Washington had warned us against more and more as the United states of empire shows that World War one and two left the England broken its former colonies are us had to save the empire was the river of votes moody we fight for the deep state began with World War one\nTo represent us to go whether it's the state capital or or to go to Washington DC to actually get something done exactly and I'm just going to take some time though you know only one or two years' worth talking you know a hundred years of or fifty years of the way things have been so it's going to take some time for him to reverse it but uh\nI Know with our with our encouragement with our support he can get this done\nLeanings reinforcements and that's what we need to do in the midterms and send them some reinforcements so that he's encouraged and maybe the media finally figures out once and for all that the American people are not represented by a radical fuel on the left or that a mainstream the forgotten man and woman\nIs um is a bigger group and maybe there that big part of that silent majority that we experience previously and uh they need to not be so silent and uh let their votes be heard loud and clear\nCome to terms uh one final question as we wrap things up here ... sheriff Clarke oh what'd you make of calling us coming to the oval office\nWell you know the optics are great kudos to the president for continuing to court the black vote it's something we don't see we haven't seen a Republican president to at least not in my lifetime and not\nTo see that that over to the Democrats but the president\nOr ask for the full ... before he was elected in eastern give me a
