I'm\nA ... I guess it's a it's a matter of fund raising these days it seems to be more the more the objective than it is uniting uh this great country of ours\nCan morning no morning the Democrats are definitely using this cabin I hearing just pockets ah because they had such a devastating\nAnd in the Senate over this weekend the Democrats lost that the American or one or the constitution widely now have two appointments by and confirmation up by President Trump on the Supreme Court judiciary\nThat have sworn to uphold the constitution as it is where do we have a rich less than federal is not in the image of Anthony's ... you know Hillary Clinton were to on this election I she would have turned the Supreme Court in the Ninth Circuit\nWhich is the most aggressive and widely overturned court or in this country and so now we kind of breathe a sigh of relief where you have a generation that it's protected under the constitution instead of a generation that could be targeted right through it and so after that\nAnd and I think not I mean look at the response\nHere American Bar by the way lazy and my brother on so quickly 'cause we're we're just so used to have their week she's the national spokesperson for me the equalizer dot com founder proprietor of Reagan babe dot com and a young man I mean when you look at the display I mean this was there was a clear\nA delineation between conservatism and liberals I mean liberals we're totally unhinged\nAnd it's amazing how radical and their commentary and how mean spirited they were and you know people being paid to do certain things on behalf of activists and then they get all upset because Brett Kavanaugh's defending his name as family as children\nAnd like that's a bad thing you know I'm you know but yet what they're doing in terms of ah you know bang you know\nUm what what are you know debating and yelling and screaming at senators as they're\nWalking the hallway and yeah you know bombarding their offices\nAnd things like that um I guess that's that's acceptable but Brett Kavanaugh defending himself is not\nRight and we've really seen now because of this nomination gr belly laugh didn't go to the left is now he's just shine a light on a date you know that they\nResort to violence mob tactics [noise] um I have watched that for years\nUh it's more on display now because we've never had a president that poking hornet's nest quite like Donald Trump is doing and that's exactly what needed to be done at the last needed to be exposed to their network of paid activists needed to be those\nUm I have I have a file at George Soros he has at least up until two years ago a hundred and eighty four\nOr five oh one C. three that operate in this country and it's not to do this tree parrot down exactly I ... when you look at all of these activists that were screaming and wearing matching T shirt holding them at this time it's\nA well they're all paid for along with their shirts dying so where does that money come from\nIt comments from one of those one hundred and eighty four or five oh one C. three operations which I Believe\nThat show it Jeff Sessions doing now\nAnd then perhaps take an opening and Korean an audit I edited just maybe half of those that maybe a third of those and he will see that he's five oh one C. three are\nEvery rule if you will that is a forward it to five oh one C. three is they are not to engage in political activity on behalf of what can or God\nWhile they are there's a lot of time and time again so ah investigate store would be a great hash tag ... is something that needs to start and I think we would see many of these people perhaps go back to their jobs at Starbucks\nIf they have a job at Starbucks or you know that's that's part of the activists\nSo thank you for pointing that out the activists that corner just like any\nElevator or illegal I mean shaming him she makes a hundred and eighty thousand dollars a year and I asked ... head of one of these organizations so yeah being marks that's being a socialist I and being an operative for the Democrat Party certainly pay as well as\nThe unity quote unquote community organizer\nIt's a great gig for her and I don't know if you read but Ocasio Cortez pointed out that she's not even documented she's she's illegal in this country\nAnd there we go we have another uh another person to\nBe making it to me making that kinda money here in this country and ah being here illegally uh here it is you know and this is a this is what the left continues to do it and make space where this illegality\nAnd uh you know they're the they're the group they gave you the sanctuary cities the end of the murders of American citizens in the streets of this country\nRight and even if you're an illegal alien and you're not working for George Soros one illegally crossed our order the left is going to fight you an immigration attorney I see you can basically skipped town and disappear into the shadows\nAnd then what you can do it you can get an I kind of number and I talk to you about this work exactly which is not a Social Security number but it acts like a Social Security number where if you are working\nOn it they will take out the federal tax that's from your eyes to number however I as I can hold are you win the lottery because you get your client\nTwentieth dependence and ... and childcare credits and you don't have to prove it does depend on this\nSo as not legal alien and we'll get back from the federal government twenty grand a and and cold hard cash a for twenty of your quote unquote shelter don't have to be related to you know or do you have to prove that it's really good thing or legal if you look at it\nWell and this is I I Know we've talked about this before making but this is what is\nYou know are blowing up the heads of conservatives because this makes no sense on any level but the Democrats continue to run away with this and this was the\nSame party that if you listen to the mainstream media is close to taking over the house once again in this country and the idea of Nancy Pelosi having her hand on the gamble in the house I I I'll tell you if this doesn't shake you up if you think somehow this is okay then you got to help me understand\nBecause I don't get it and we went through\nEight a horrendous years recent I mean this was recent history\nWith Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and uh this is the ilk that you want back in any kind of leadership I mean as a you know Lindsey Graham made it clear you know this is all about a power grab and I hope you never get it and it's up to the American voter to make sure that that's the case is it not\nI think much like Lindsey Graham or cops during the hearings and realized that he can't reach across the aisles and seals the fact that\nI think many Americans he thought well that I think the fact Kavanaugh hearings backfire on the Democrats I think that it has limited their ability to create a fully ways\nBecause I Would say that many more Americans are fair minded than they are either get along\nWithout a doubt I got to go to break more for making bars on the other side of the break stay
