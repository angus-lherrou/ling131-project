Robert for all his record it starts to get out of ten you're dealing with the Obamacare\nFailure dealing with thank God and the Democrats got slaughtered in which serves their concern you at all\nOh my gosh Ben guys it was a blip on the radar for the mainstream media are you kidding me\nThe only people that were covered Ben gods eat were were conservative media outlets that are that bothered or dared to go up against the Hillary narrative on that the media gave that a big pass it was a giant yawn an Obamacare for the mainstream media was a you know like a curing cancer\nThey thought that was the greatest thing in the world no not even not even a little bit no\nComparison no comparison whatsoever you know you look at the polling numbers though and I I Want to go back to the story about and this is really interesting analysis from of all places CNN [noise] this is an analyst or analysis rather from a CNN reporter\nThe house forecasters ... the Democrats win two hundred and twenty six seats and the house majority Republicans will only when two hundred nine seats\nThe forecast percentage and this is CNN talking now [noise] although we haven't generally presented a percent probability the model that we have showing that Democrats hold the house I mean take over the house is about Seventy two percent chance\nSo Harry enter an overt CNN says\nIt's not as if all hope his last for Republicans indeed I Would point out that it's important to watch the margin of error it's still gives Republicans a decent chance of maintaining control again remembering that the model gives Democrats without a Seventy two percent chance of winning control the house that's among the lower chance is the most models give\nOr is it mobs is jobs is it I'm just a a a continual a disc member meant of this Democratic Republic heading towards socialism or a or a\nFair minded and and people were common sense or that one smaller government they want a government of war by the people\nAre they going to come out in record numbers for this mid term well making birthers with this right now is we review the Sunday TV news shows all kinds of things and lots of moving parts and plenty of talk about making of course national spokesperson for media equalizer dot com founder proprietor ... dot com Megan how we're doing\nAnd doing well how are you oh I'm doing terrific thank you so much except for a little bit of a back ache or you know I'm a I guess an improper golf swing yesterday you know set it buckling so I Am I Am recovering so uh if I sound to medicate it or something you know why and so it will that\nWill be your cue to take over All right down in ... well uh speaking of pains in the back a ball tell you this\nUh the whole weekend was still abuzz over the ... you and I talked about it in terms of it being a murder last week\nAnd everybody was very delicate are holding back in understandably but I mean it was clear that he was taken out no doubt and now I'm as Saudi Arabia finally had to admit the inevitable and exactly what happened is that are\nIn fact his ... murdered and this puts a\nLot of stress you know I think my back is nothing compared to what President Trump is having to deal with right now over this\n[noise] yeah I mean I think\nThat's a story on it is a little bit overblown and what I call 'em you know when you look at the facts and then the other come forward uh yes it looks like you know Saudi Arabia that it that he died in that fight might be a little bit more than that but it's not an American ... you might be a journalist but he's not a citizen\nI answer this issue I Believe set the between Saudi Arabia and turkey but I don't find the outrage from the class so\nOther murders specifically American citizen murders like the more that died at that and God the were murdered by Richard ...\nHit on a warm where ... in ... in North Korea correct\nMhm not only that the young girl in Iowa that law lost her life and have an illegal alien ... and other young girl that was her life at the hands of an illegal alien\nInstead of the list goes on and on that's rich a we know who murder background but yet across the team to show that much interest I think that the the overblown hysteria over this\nStock shot in the case is directly related to a political sabotage right that the press and the Democrat Party has that are working together are against this strange that I ordered they'll do anything to paint than than this race and in a bad light\nWell it's not like the Saudis or haven't been doing you know they've been playing nice for a long time let's face it uh because of uh some economic um\nYou know advantages I guess if you want to put it in those terms um you know we've continue to dance with the devil so um but the devils still a devil is not going to suddenly change here why\nUnfortunately we have to answer many of those you know there are there are dictators around the world there are now there is a yeah cats you know we have to maintain some sort of a relationship with some of these countries and I don't remember the outrage with Saudi Arabia yet what when he was\nYou know throwing gays off buildings not allowing driving out the perils of living under story ally ... that the regime has been brutal and as the ... century instead of what they did here cause shot he\nReally is kind of not abnormal on their behavior that they've demonstrated over the course of time and let's look at turkey turkey has had a snake\nA turkey has and president uh many many journalists and as you know Turkish president aren't a cabin on on the um\nOne of the night the ... sign running and these are these are places cells are hell on earth\nI and so you know we are dealing with these quote unquote allies as we kept on for decades and so again I think that that is a journalist that um that this was journalism related shot and he has is\nMhm mhm okay well speaking of 'em is speaking of the illegal aliens who have been here in this country and murdered our citizens so we've got thousands of people\nAre on this a march from Honduras a that is moving along you're a lot of pressure on Mexico to ... do not let them you know pass go collect two hundred dollars a and so this is a timing issue there are um those forces\nThat would want the Republicans and particularly with President Trump to be greatly distracted as we head into the midterms over these thousands of people they're going to be storming our border in Mexico is allowed um if if Mexico gives them an Ole pass\nIt seems like Mexico it's giving them and only appears Mexico can control the drug cartels are we supposed to have them all but seven thousand people idol looks like the cartels are as big as well as I did my nationals are assisting God he's invaders\nI kill our border and I don't think it's a coincidence that these invaders these illegal invaders will arrive at our borders doorstep\nRight around the time of election but I really don't think it's a bad photo op either [noise] I I don't think that majority of Americans want to save seven dollars and mainly men are from the most violent countries in the world\nOr a ride on our doorstep are demanding a asylum\nThought they could have taught asylum in their first country they ... they could have bought asylum and Mexico are plenty of places along the way a set of again another photo op uh another political tactic are all very well funded contacts that\nYeah we saw we saw pictures of a money being handed out or you know to uh to these ... you know these refugees if you want to call them however you want to describe them or ... marches from Honduras I mean so\nThey're doing what they can to support them local of course local officials in Mexico are providing aid and comfort to them as well or because they feel for him but you know clearly what they're doing and they've interviewed several\nPeople I have two things here we are one thing ... that you mention is that it's mostly men\nBut yet the pictures if he knows the pitchers the footage that we're getting is mostly women and kids right\nBut uh yeah you know so so that that's a fallacy a thing as I mentioned you know the local support they're getting but in discussing directly with a\nYou know some of the leaders I mean it's clear they just they just want to come you know to the to the United states there's you know there's no sweat here is just the idea that what has happened is previously we've trained\nA people and you can think Rocco bomb especially for this to march the ... storm the border come in and you'll get lost in the United states and that's the golden ticket to forget about the immigration the natural immigration process\nYou know their storming the border and the reason they continue to do it is because it it works for them or we'll see if this will be you know if this won't work is good will see Fifteen\nMinutes after the top of the hour Meghan bars is
