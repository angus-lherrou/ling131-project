coming up October the twelve friday October twelfth that Ohio Dominican University if you listen to us on Ninety eight point nine FM the answer in Columbus I Hope you'll come out and join has got a great line up and they give you those details on how to get tickets in just a moment but\nAs I Do these events around the country and we kind of have these town hall style gatherings with with people who are fired up for people who are motivated I always try to continue the theme that I I have on the radio fight and pray site and pray it's important\nTo remember our faith during these tough difficult complicated times David Limbaugh has written a great new book called Jesus has risen Paul in the early church this is the fourth book and David series of Christian Bible guides\nFor people who all if you want to learn more about their faith without you know becoming a bit of having to be a scholar or pasture I Love the way he tackles this and of course I Love his political voiceless welcome to science or else the sky\nDays you can watch our conversation at Mike online dot com or the great David Limbaugh Hey David great catch up with you again my friend had you been\n\nDavid in a big fan of yours or do we should we broke up there at the very beginning you're back there with me how are you yeah it's really good that you hear me now now we can mount loud and clear how are you right we've been friends a long time and I've been a fan of yours of ... ... ...\nI've been a big fan of yours for a long time as you know I Hope your brother gets his radio career off the ground has that come\nAnd see working on it I think that I Can't you know that it really\nWell you know he's kinda he's got a struggling but we we pray flattery he's flattery we pray for him to first of all Jesus has risen can we talk a little bit about this crossroads this disorder juxtaposition of politics as you show brilliantly delivering your columns and in your appearances on Fox News and all\nAnd your deep faith for some people make some uncomfortable but frankly at at at times like these I think I think that crossroads that intersection of faith and culture and politics is perfectly timed\nYes you know it's so interesting we have a situation where they got a bad at ... ... I I don't wear your son and great though okay I accept the site that I the\nOnly ones who are living in a very ... as we as I ... ... ... ...\nFor the survival of this country and we have I Believe in a very effective president and Donald Trump that I didn't initially support I supported Ted Cruz I'd been with from ever since he won the primaries adamantly or I'm we're facing the left you know I I mean this here is conservative constitutional conservative and I am\nAs I sat on Sean Hannity's show last night at a feckless conservatism is an infinite conservative right and we and we liked Trump because he fights back and get things done and I think he's actually become a pretty strong ideological conservative he certainly in effect that one that we had the left\nOut of the woodwork trying to destroy him trying to destroy everything in his path including ... having a\nHand they think they have a monopoly on morality and I think they their world view is so ... I'm Sorry to say it and I think it's self evident when you see I hate all they are how much safer jak how much they are exactly the opposite of what they claimed to be I eat compassionate tolerant of loving\nTheir hateful they're mob there they'll do anything to destroy people the end justifies the main\nHimself when when John Adams said\nThat the constitution is only going to be a war only gonna work for a moral and religious people I think what he had in mind where people like the left who will destroy the court for example instead of upholding the constitution that legislate from the bench and it end justifies the means they'll do whatever they want to do\nAnd we had to fight back in Christians who say we can't fight back because we're not being questioned they're wrong we have a duty we're not just on this earth to sit here is bystanders we have a duty to try to preserve this culture\nFor our kids and for ourselves and what made America the greatest nation in the world and so I don't buy into this thing that we ought to be passive we ought to be active at work or but there's one other intersection and that is\nThis is so controversial so contentious and our culture but I think sometimes we need\nSomething greater to look to and that that something greater in my view is Jesus Christ and so I think ... the book that I write on the subject are designed to get people into the Bible and reduce their intimidation and increase and accelerate their learning curve so that they all ...\nAll the more comfortable and going to read the Bible for itself and that's really my bill\nI'm grateful for your voice and I'm grateful for this book because we're living in a time you know David to those who uh who call themselves who are conservatives and spiritual\nWho oppose President Trump with everything that with every fiber of there being because they don't like his tone they don't like his tweets they don't like his temperament they don't like the kind of person he is\nWe're seeing what the alternative would have been to Donald Trump pushing it all displayed right now with this cabinet debacle in all its glory the left is what we would have running things if it weren't for the election of Donald Trump\nOnly tell you note for words where ever spoken socialism\nOr leads to the stats and it leads to poverty and ultimately as high it talked about at least ... you can see that as well you can see it in in the left in the United states I said the other day on Twitter and I really mean it and\nI seem like a radical I seem unreasonable I see my hands when I say this I Am not I'm pretty mainstream\nI Believe that the lab the far left and sadly that's encompassing all to the larger of a component of the Democratic party right would put us in re education camps if they could have many of them would I mean look at the things that are good they have no clue about destroying Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd his family and and they don't have any complaints ... anyway\nI thought I understood radical I've I've read they've taken radical to new heights and it's and unfortunately the face of today's Democratic Party in many cases David\n... yes and my ... think about what they're fighting for they are I sorry if this offends people they are fighting for the right to twist to the constitution into a pretzel so that it will allow them illegally to continue to terminate destroy kill babies\nAnd I think that we all need to rise to that standard if you lie and one thing you ... you know you're disqualified you lie and everything that is the suggestion from the Latin phrase and we go back experiential Lee with people that we dealt with and uh you know that's the one thing that are liars do they lie you know they can't help themselves\nAnd so when when do you believe that you believe them at your own peril is what happens time and again\nSo I'm you know we need to be better discern owners of the media and the news that we are consuming but I also say\nThat uh there's nothing wrong with us a disqualifying people and I find my I find myself doing that more and more these days\nAre and I can understand I mean look at we make mistakes have you made a mistake come back and say hey look at it I I misspoke guy I said this wrong or what had wrong information whatever but uh you know that doesn't exist in the beltway you know it just goes out there you know Harry Reid's ... you know makes up a story about a Mitt Romney\nAnd then later laughs about it or you know basically he lied and last about ... while he didn't get elected anyway right the way you know I guess the all that matters and that's\nThe whole routine that is what President Trump was saying yesterday\nAnd the Democrats world view it is the the end justifies the means\nThis is what we're going on with the with judge Kavanaugh it ... you know the heck with this character heck with his family has kids I mean it's down to the point I don't know if you saw this uh there was a cartoon that that was totally you know out of line um it was just terrible the the cartoon mocking a judge Kavanaugh's daughter\nYou know praying and that oh yeah you know this is like prayer number two to got oh God forgive our dad for being a rapist or whatever it was that a bit you know to that that point to suggest young and was a you know it was disgusting\nThat they would do this but you know it all stair I guess all fair love or in politics on the Democratic side but God Forbid that any Republican\nOr an particularly a white male Republican on my gosh that's the trifecta you know according to a senator Hirono of Hawaii I mean if you're white if you're a you're a male and a Republican that that's the world trifecta your really your bus\nOr this is what has come down to and at what risk you know what is what kind of messages to sending out to our boys as we talked with a doctor I'm In a war in fairly yesterday the author of the boy crisis in John Gray and this is very dangerous\nWhere we find ourselves today but we have to speak out we asked to take a stand and uh let let me say this and and I spoke with\nSo many people and and people of faith and people who are secular and but even the people who are very secular realizes that this thing is so massive is so big what's happening in our culture right now that they have no answers\nI you know I asked him I go what what is the answer what do you think's going to happen ... do you think that's certainly one day people are gonna wake up and be nice I mean do you think that's the answer um do you think or Nancy Pelosi is going to see something in her toes that all of a sudden she's going to convert and and change you know what what do you think ... what do you think's going to happen they have no idea is\nNow people have faith that what we've been doing I got to tell you more people are praying and and I really I really appreciate it I I tell you I'm so grateful for Franklin Graham and leading the way and I know there's others many others who are joining hearts and hands with Franklin Graham a and praying for this country all in the spirit\nOf second chronicle seven Thirteen and fourteen\nYou know if my people who are called by my name\nIn just grab a hold of that okay so God is saying not not secular America\nNot the Muslims of America no it is the people who are called by my name's so you know who you are if you were called by God's very name\nThen in his us that needs to lead the way when you consider every major change and alteration of course that has happened in our country has been people who think that the bloods away\nWithout exception now can you gather that for just a moment going back to the early founding of our country it was people of faith\nWho led the way who even came up and were able to assemble the ideas of this great American experiment didn't come up with some ... board or you know some other outside interest\nThis is clearly as George Washington said Thomas Jefferson is by divine Providence they understood that what they were pulling together I mean you talk about it you know these oh yeah moments had a dear friend and pastor who would always talk about these\nWow moments that you would have when you would uh read certain passages of the Bible\nAnd I say not only just passages in the Bible but when you come in contact with God in your daily life and you know that some things you know something supernatural that you just have this ... this wild moment that you go oh wait a minute I touched on something sacred and supernatural\nAnd I got to imagine that our founding fathers this they were assembling all these ideas\nThat they kept hitting in these aha moments realizing that they're not that smart\n[laughter] not that brilliant brilliant but not that brilliant and here is where we are today is we've got a lot of smart people\nAround but we need something supernatural and even more brilliant me on the smartest people that we think that are on this planet that can help and this is where\nThis is where it got comes in is if we ... we can't handle this ourselves\nAnd I and I said this going into\nThe cabin a hearing I saw what was going to go on I could see this clearly and we're not even after you know the seventh FBI investigation and this one a little bit more targeted because there are some specifics to this one although as we spoke with a former FBI agent who conducted these interviews\nOr you know for Thirty years for a number of his years in the FBI et cetera is ... you know bill is pretty extensive and we'd go back to ... I I was surprised you know he said we go back to high school\nSo it's pretty extensive here\nBut what will happen just as many have said not one not one Democrat will vote out of that committee\nOr judge Kavanaugh not one nothing's going to change the only thing that will change as maybe three or four senators who were on the border there\nThat are on the line they say\nOkay look at we gave it a fair shot\nWe play nice with the Democrats we gave him what they want\nWe have enough information to support the confirmation of judge Kavanaugh but I'm saying above all this and we'll we'll pick up the conversation on the other side of the break stay with us [noise] uh this is beyond our capability and we have to look to a higher authority [noise] this is bill Martinez we're live at Fifteen after the top of the hour\nSon of a house being trashed gang a cease ransacked\nAnd what they don't steal will be destroyed\nThe sheer resolve not to be the next victim of a break him go to the TV dot com and discover a device to create the illusion someone inside just watching TV even when you're miles away to charity has a mind set of the TV should be part of your security solution be vigilant but not fearful TV dot com\nAnd don't let them come for much talk about down home values late in the usa ...\nLike you wore as a kid I remember\nThere's ways now\nMade\nBy\nThe way they\nVoted down in the crowd you\nDown and\nSomeone noodle version of comfort diamond Gus that gene ... guaranteed in order to vendor motorcycle gene gums gambler reinforcing seeing them a G.

this incredible search engine Matt welcome to bill Martinez live good to have you with us how are you sir\nParade I'm happy to be here back well much\n... ah well we appreciate um you pursuing the truth I mean this is what the show is all about and tell us about creepy line and um you know the response we're getting from people that saw it\nAbsolutely the creepy line is a feature documentary about how Google and Facebook manipulate their users and also to potential they have to undermine democracy by shifting opinion we received amazing kind of a feedback audience is and we've also\nGot a number of bit of pushback from people who don't want the message you get out there are all known as a very successful so far\nKind of interesting that when you think about it when I was growing up there was a big issue about subliminal advertising member you go to the movies they'd have a a little you know quick cuts that was a you know sliced\nIn the movie that uh would direct you to uh buy coke products and other things and this was a former that manipulation now we have something more blatant being an exercise here I mean there's no holds barred with the things that Google and Facebook and these other social media giants\nAre doing to our brains and um you know we're somehow in trusting the government to protect our wellbeing here\nWell here's the thing the government is by design inefficient you know these companies are not in a special their stupor ... smart people\nSo even if the government were to intervene\nTheir legislation and their capabilities are in a car you keep up with how fast technology changes\nSo as they come up with a law or anti trust or any of these things Google and Facebook are ten Fifteen steps ahead of the things on top of the fact that they know all of our information they can shift to vote towards one candidate or another and they spend more money in Washington are lobby than even big oil and big pharma\nYou know it's like you say it's the power
