twenty six hundred to a hundred thousand dollars and the money can be in your bank account in ours\nNow HGH has been found to be the key and feeling decades younger however the HGH injections are controversial because it's a hormone and although it has powerful benefits it can cause side effects\nOkay but so there is no hormones and the G H R platinum\nNo no hormones it's all natural love\nThat so let's talk about what the G H R platinum will do for us but first why are we aging and why are we getting old\nWell there are many factors but one major reason is due to the decline of our youth hormone is HGH\nOkay so briefly for those that don't know what is HGH\nHGH stands for human growth hormone\nAlthough most of us older adults still have it\nIt has its highest peak when we're young then growing into adulthood mhm are young bodies absolutely why when those HGH levels were high\nBecause it enabled us to have so much energy is kids from we didn't know what to do with it all and our metabolism works so remarkably well we could eat tons of calories even junk food McDonald's whatever we wanted\nAnd we could still have a fit body\nWe build muscle easily we slept deeply we bounce back from injuries fast yeah beautiful skin\nYeah and I used to eat tons of ice cream and French fry a boy I miss that being able to eat all that stuff but what happens all that\nWell I'll tell you what happens after we've physically stopped growing usually around the age of twenty five are growth hormone level drops significantly and then immediately we start to age and get old\nOkay so this decline of the growth hormone is really known as the beginning of the aging process right\nNow they're dropping growth hormone sends a negative domino effect throughout the entire body and usually in our early thirties we start feeling that ripple effect\nI mean we may start off with just the fuel wrinkles and then some excess fat right and we lose energy our hair are eyesight and\nOur quality of sleep lessons we simply slow down and this affects all of us research shows that the lower the growth hormone the Bastrop person ages inside and out\nOkay so if you're middle aged ... like me about how much of the youth hormone have we lost about eighty percent oh jeez eighty percent so five lost nearly ... percent of my youth hormone at my age I feel like I'm thirty just an older body\nWell you're you're not alone Jody [noise] this is Sherry okay about one third of all adults forty five years and older not only have low growth hormone but are extremely deficient\nWhile okay you know that's scary because it seems like the deficiency of HGH it's completely out of our control so there is there anything that we can do to reverse\nThat absolutely we are now living in a time where we can naturally and safely restore our own growth hormone and start reversing aging symptoms immediately by replenishing what our body loses as we age\nAnd you've been doing this through your

important topic I I was amazed sharing by the stats on a number of people\nWho are injured in falls and how many deaths actually happen from this thank you so much for being here today to share this important information with is that\nThere isn't that closure well we're going to focus on talking to your pharmacist which is what you are because I understand the pharmacist really can be the key to helping to understand\nWhat may be going on with drug interactions of different things people take walks into the story and he was a little background on how important good communication with pharmacists doctors use on preventing falls for being a medically related\nWell like the medications that people are taking as you get older you are taking more medication which is no way there's a lot of interaction that happen in your ... is your key point to look for this drug interactions\nThink about what other are trained in can be available if you're happy side effects from the medication\nAnd then offering laid to manage sometimes we'll fight back where it said that thing that you take medication\nA fireman is really play a vital role in medication therapy management because of what they ... or it's a really good idea to being very thorough with white here taking\nAnd even in college or over the counter and your herbal medication because all of those and how different drug interactions that we want to be caught up in Congress and have\nA particular types of drugs or combinations in particular you look out for that that may lead to things like balance issues or or dizziness or weakness which may lead to falls under certain categories that are kind of red flags\nAbsolutely on there are things that you're anti anxiety medication you're anti seizure medications medication they use for blood pressure medication for use or how hard and your heart rate them\nOn other medications even antidepressants can cause back that sedative factor sometimes\nAnd that where you may be an increase in the fall um mainly that when we look for though are you're anti KUVO an anti um hypertension because those are where we see a lot of fat\nSo how much of this does it have to do with how you take your medications when you take them whether you take them with food how you how do you kind of balance the challenge of a certain category that could be a problem with how you take your prescription\nThat's important because first of all them crying side effect that you have a medication that makes you more tired or makes you on the ticket at night you see less of
