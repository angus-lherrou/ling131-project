each gender we finally have the science the natural ability to say probably increase the women's youth hormone and the men's with two different formulations and it's helping reverse aging symptoms to a degree even doctors never thought was possible\nThat's often okay so let's talk more about this new supplement and we're going to do that in a bit but first isn't HGH bad\nOh I think there's a lot of confusion about it many feel HGH has just for body builders pro athletes or it's for making ... which is not true it's absolutely good and vibrant for our health\nIt maintains bodily functions like our metabolism energy tissue repair muscle growth and brain function throughout life\nNow HGH has been found to be the key and feeling decades younger however the HGH injections are controversial because it's a hormone although it has powerful benefits\nIt can cause side effects okay but so there is no hormones in the G H R platinum no no hormones it's all natural love\nThat so let's talk about what the G H R platinum will do for us but first why are we aging and why are we getting old\nWell there are many factors but one major reason is due to the decline of our youth hormone as HGH\nOkay so briefly for those that don't know what is HGH\nHGH stands for human growth hormone\nAlthough most of us older adults still have it\nIt has its highest peak when we're young then growing into adulthood mhm are young bodies absolutely thrive when those HGH levels were high\nBecause it enabled us to have so much energy as kids we didn't know what to do with it all and our metabolism works so remarkably well we could eat tons of calories even junk food McDonald's whatever we wanted\nAnd we could still have a fit body\nWe built muscle easily we slept deeply we bounce back from injuries fast we have beautiful skin\nYeah and I used to eat tons of ice cream and French fry a boy I miss that being able to eat all that stuff so what happens all that\nWell I'll tell you what happens after we've physically stopped growing usually around the age of twenty five are growth hormone level dropped significantly and then immediately we start to age and get old\nOkay so this decline of the growth hormone is really known as the beginning of the aging process right\nNow they're dropping growth hormone sends a negative domino effect throughout the entire body and usually in our early thirties we start feeling that ripple effect I mean we may start off with just the fuel wrinkles and then some excess fat ... energy our hair are eyesight\nOur quality of sleep lessons we simply slow down and this affects all of this research shows that the lower the growth hormone the faster person ages inside and out\nOkay so if you're middle aged right like me about how much of the youth hormone have we lost about eighty percent oh jeez eighty percent so if I lost nearly ... percent of my youth hormone at my age I feel like I'm thirty just an older body\nWell you're you're not alone Jody this is Sherry okay about one third of all adults forty five years and older not only have low growth hormone but are extremely deficient\nWhile okay you know that's scary because it seems like the deficiency of HGH it's completely out of our control so there is there anything that we can do to reverse\nThat absolutely we are now living in a time where we can naturally and safely restore our own growth hormone and stark reversing aging symptoms immediately by replenishing what our body loses as we age\nAnd you've been doing this through your ultimate anti aging supplement called G H R platinum for over a decade are Christian radio stations across the country but now your research team just took the natural restoration of HGH to a higher level\nYes and we're very excited about this we released a new advanced formula called G H R platinum for men and G H R platinum for women which is the only natural HGH complex made for each gender for optimal result\nOkay so we're talking about two different formulas one for men and now one for when and why is this important\nIt's because men and women are different and they age differently ... our body compositions and hormones are different than the aging symptoms we want to help with differ as well right so the G H R platinum for men not only naturally increases HGH but also has its\nThat starts drone and sexual libido and answer belly fat burner muscle booster and ingredients for healthy person that has\nA lot of great stuff so this one product addresses almost every concern that males have that's incredible\nAnd now the G H R platinum for women is the only natural HGH release her in the world made specifically for the feminine body\nAnd we added a hormone balance your body fat burner wrinkle

Halloween Night he's also known as\nHe's especially W night there was a high number of drunk drivers on the roads and the increase in pedestrians during the evening hours this is a crucial time to remember that while we head into the Halloween holiday\nIt's important that we think that we plan that we take steps to be safe we're joined by Camille travels from the California office of traffic safety who's joining us to give some helpful tips on how to have a safe and phone Halloween Camille it's good to have you on the program today\nI thank you very much for having me I appreciate it\nWell a lot of people will be heading out going to parties I'm Down to ... will be no shortage of costume parties and for those who planned on drinking was talking about some alternatives some things that people may do show they're not tempted to drink and drive\nYeah sure so are they all know drinking and driving just do not mix at all uh you can't do both so you really need to leave your car keys at home if you're planning to go out and celebrate with cocktail there have a drink I'm so anything that doesn't involve getting behind the wheel after you've had a drink and there are many options now so you could either\nDesignated silver driver take a cab there many ride sharing services out there like ... or lift and you could eat than take public transit\nUm it's important to point out that even if you have one drink that can just be too many uh for some driver so that that is to just drive sober power at a designated driver and if you plan on drinking or\nLeave the car keys behind that there is no car for you to drive you won't have that problem or the temptation to drive at all\nRight and even if you drive you don't cause an accident but you get caught I understand there can be some severe financial penalties and things that you're going to have to do to solve it and it's very expensive to get a do you are\nVery expensive for one at the hits here driving record 'em your finances but most importantly the consequences can be deadly not only to yourself that to others that are on the road so for starters those caught driving impaired and charged with a DUI can expect to pay at least ten thousand dollars on the California highway\nPatrol estimates it costs around Thirteen thousand five hundred for those who are charged with the deal alive so that would include um defines the attorney fees\nDUI classes and not to mention insurance hikes and restricted or suspended license and so um you know we all know the alcohol affects your ability to drive and so kind of prescription drugs or marijuana on but people continue to get behind the wheel and when when they shouldn't\nUm so there are real life consequences to that and they're the ... that they should be so it's just not worth it to even chance it\nBut I understand the officers really are out there in force there looking for things on the Halloween Night they're really keeping an eye on things can you elaborate on what law enforcement will be doing in terms of DUI enforcement\nYes a law enforcement agencies will be doing saturation patrol\nWhere they're actively look for those the fact that of driving impaired or they know that will be more people out celebrating during the holiday as well as parents with their kid's trick or treating and these patrols really are there to make sure that everyone is celebrating Halloween responsibly and they say\nWell since costumes doors are open and in full swing and\nWhat tips you have to give parents to make sure that the kids are visible to motorists in their cost you remember when I was a kid and we get these costumes the whole didn't really line up it was very hard to see out of these things that maybe they were kind of moisture you put them on and it was very uncomfortable but\nVisibility was definitely reduced\nRight so you know obviously things faith and being comfortable as important to the parents\nShould keep in mind that light colored costumes are best um they should also look at adding retro reflective tape to the costumes that may be hard to see at night as well as carrying flashlights you know the more visible every one is I think it's a you know the safer everyone is and then\nWhat about motorists who'll be driving during the peak trick or treating hours when it's night time it's dark what what advice do you have for those you on the highways\nWell Halloween is another reason just to be extra cost conscious and slow down um that there's a night where there's going to be heavy foot traffic a\nDue to the fact that kids are out trick or treating and kids can be unpredictable they may cross the street Mitt block they may start out between parked cars\nSo a driver's nature especially walked watch out for the children in the costumes um their heart to see and if you can just avoid residential areas altogether more kids are likely to be trick or treating and you should think of those neighborhoods
