prevention hormone replacement therapy he's been saving lives which has recently won ... most valuable position of the year award for the state of California that's awesome\nSo for over ten years now you've been developing groundbreaking all natural age reverse in supplements that have changed thousands of lives and today you're going to be a revealing something new what\nIs that I Am so happy to announce that we just released the world's first natural HGH supplement specifically formulated for men and another just for women called G H R platinum for men and the nude G H R platinum for women cruelly the ultimate anti aging supplement on the market\nAwesome this is huge this is making waves in the medical and vitamin world because it's taking natural repeat natural human growth hormone science to the next level helping increase our own HGH to a degree that no other supplement has ever\nTouch absolutely and that's because it's designed for each gender we finally have the science the natural ability to safely increase the women's youth hormone and the men's with two different formulations and it's helping reverse aging symptoms to a degree even doctors never thought was possible\nThat's awesome okay so let's talk more about this new supplement and we're going to do that in a bit but first isn't HGH\nBad I think there's a lot of confusion about it many feel HGH has just for body builders pro athletes or it's for making couch produced melt which is not true it's absolutely good and vibrant for our health\nIt maintains bodily functions like our metabolism energy tissue repair muscle growth and brain function throughout life\nNow HGH has been found to be the key and feeling decades younger however the HGH injections are controversial because it's a hormone and although it has powerful benefits it can cause side effects okay but\nSo there's no hormones in the G H ...\nNo no hormones it's all natural\nLove that so let's talk about what the G H R platinum will do for us but first why are we aging and why are we getting old well there\nAre many factors but one major reason is due to the decline of our youth hormone known as HGH\nOkay so briefly for those that don't know what is HGH HGH\nStands for human growth hormone\nAlthough most of us older adults still have it\nIt has its highest peak when we're young and growing into adulthood mhm are young bodies absolutely wired when those HGH levels were high\nBecause it enabled us to have so much energy is kids from we didn't know what to do with it all and our metabolism works so remarkably well we could eat tons of galleries even junk food McDonald's whatever we wanted\nAnd we could still have a fit body\nWe build muscle easily we slept deeply we bounce back from injuries fast yeah beautiful skin\nAnd yeah and I used to eat tons of ice cream and French fry boy I miss that being able to eat all that stuff so what happens all that\nWell I'll tell you what happens after we've physically stopped growing usually around the age of twenty five ... our growth hormone level drops significantly and then immediately we start to age and get old\nOkay so this decline of the growth hormone is really known as the beginning of the aging process right\nNow they're dropping growth hormone sends a negative domino effect throughout the entire body and usually in our early thirties and we start feeling that ripple effect\nI mean we may start off with just a few wrinkles and then some excess fat ... energy our hair or eyesight and\nOur quality of sleep lessons we simply slow down and this affects all of this research shows that the lower the growth hormone the Bastrop person ages inside and out\nOkay so if you're middle aged right like me about how much of the youth hormone have we lost about eighty percent oh jeez eighty percent so five lost nearly ... percent of my youth hormone at my age I feel like I'm thirty just in an older bottom\nWell you're you're not alone Jody this is Sherry okay about one third of all adults forty five years and over and not only have low growth hormone but are extremely deficient\nWhile okay you know that's scary because it seems like the deficiency of HGH it's completely out of our control so there is there anything that we can do to reverse\nThat absolutely we are now living in a time where we can naturally and safely restore our own growth hormone and start reversing aging symptoms immediately by replenishing what our body loses as we age then you've been doing this\nWho your ultimate anti aging supplement called G H R platinum for over a decade on Christian radio stations across the country but now your research team just took the natural restoration of HGH to a higher level\nYes and we're very excited about this we released a new advanced formula called G H R platinum for men and G H R platinum for women which is the only natural HGH complex made for each gender for optimal result\nOkay so we're talking about two different formulas one for men and now one for women why is this important\nWells because men and women are different in the age differently ...\nOur body compositions and hormones are different than the aging symptoms we want to help with different as well right so the G H R platinum for men not only naturally increases HGH but also has a testosterone and sexual libido enhanced her\nBelly fat burner muscle booster and ingredients for healthy punch\nThat has a lot of great stuff so this one product addresses almost every concern that males have that's incredible\nAnd now the G H R platinum for women is the only natural HGH release her in the world made specifically for the feminine body\nAnd we added a hormone balance your body fat burner wrinkle reduce your cortisone regulator
