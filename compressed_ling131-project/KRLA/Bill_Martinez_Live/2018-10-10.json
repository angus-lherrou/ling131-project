Dr ... you're talking about chaos bring me the kind of chaos that results and judge Brett Kavanaugh now\nIn the hill who oh in the hit in the history of book charges\nHas there ever been a more perfectly timed book than your book why we fight defeating America's enemies no apologies because let's be very blunt here sometimes America's enemies are from within and what we witnessed over the last few weeks I I I Know you you had to be as disgusted as the rest of us\nAre totally because I Lived and I've been through it you know all the accusations made against me in the White House and you know we ... we had a saying in the west wing when all this stuff was going on you only take flack when you were the targets but but this\nWas disgusting and the interesting thing about my book why we fight which of course I wrote long before\nYou have an old was who was nominated right\nIs that in a chapter in there by the great American here so the book is about all the threats America faces and ... the president's going to do about them but then I have these ... stories about or amazing American heroes and the last one is a guy called wicked chambers that most\nAmericans probably Ninety five percent of millennials have never heard of but where they could chambers most the capital before ... was born so just just a little sound bite\nThis is a man who stood up for the food in the first televised congressional testimony ever in Nineteen forty eight right he stood up to say I was a former communist and I can tell you who the comment is honoring by the government and what happened to him\nThe left went crazy they accused him of having an affair they accused him of being a ... a homosexual they used to being responsible brothers that all of it might was a line that I teach to live and\nAt the end of the day he won because he stood up to the truth so anybody who said that he was just going by the treatment jobs have been overseas a guess what the Democrats have been doing it for about seven years\nMind and and it's gotten so bad that it's almost at a fever pitch and and frankly I'm hoping and praying that Americans remember\nWhat has happened over the last month come November the six because you know there and they are on record you know it and we've seen them promising left and right impeaching Kavanaugh house members threatening and promising an investigation of Brett Kavanaugh they don't want this thing to end\nAnd if they get control the house in the Senate We're going to be we're in for a world of hurt\nWe look at shows that the title of the book for a reason why we fight we still have the will to protect the republic I'm thinking about this for second do you remember what Harry Reid said about the lives some said he ...\nHe won didn't level and he doesn't win did he he didn't win by\nYeah that's that's what we have to face Mike yeah the left is made up volunteering with the devil they have that that\nEnds meaning getting power just defines what ever means whether it's lying about Mitt Romney's taxes or whether it's accusing a little boy scout I mean I have an aunt\nIs a boy scout for the last three years and we've been accused him of being a serial rapist gang ... women gang I mean yeah\nIt is it pure evil yeah if if we think\nThat they're going to stop because we won this one to get about it\nThey're going to ramp it up you've already seen the article say we have to go even further wants to I mean let's let's remind ourselves who James Hodgkinson mind I mean this is a name that should be done in the brain of all Americans James ...\nWell they need some does volunteer right left who took an automatic rifle in a hand gun to a baseball field in Virginia with a hit list of Republican congressmen any almost killed Steve ...\nWhere does the right down the ... when does the riots actually normalized violence so whether it and she ...\nWhether it's a baseball field in a rifle this is how should that you get when you said the ends justify the means and Mike a lesson from from my book\nIf you if you buy into that lawsuit philosophy what does it eventually lead to we see it in the last hundred years he leads to the good relax leads to the death camps because if you'll ends couldn't justify any means then you'll do what ever it takes\nThis is why you got to get his book why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies and I'm not kidding you as the as the Kavanaugh bloodbath unfolded I thought\n... Sebastian Gorka is the smartest guy in the universe title his book the way he titled it because it's ... it's a primer for later right after November the ... get the book and Dr Sebastian Gorka thank you for fighting the good fight we appreciate your voice and thanks for reminding me to pump the brakes a little bit because maybe there's news about Nikki Haley is going to be bad after all [laughter]\nDark democracy in any way to mark is with a lot of critical issues I think we see now that all starting to slowly turn back toward the people toward liberty in the way our constitution is supposed to work\nWell and it was why the Democrats were fighting so hard over this Steve I mean you were moving their cheese I mean they work\nA long time to get this thing all set up an 'cause they knew a you know doing the hard work of legislation and debating and doing all this like hey we can short circuit this thing ... we'll just get you know the right guys on the court and they'll do are bidding for us right\nYou're exactly right ... that's the honest truth to that they wanted minimum ... who they don't like the messiness and hard work and democracy you know there was another government\nKnow small are Republicanism instead they'd rather rely on so called it leads to determine whether its economy you know central planning Obamacare are those are things on that one of the economy or whether it's other aspects of our lives up things like what life will come to the marriage all of these in our question economic question societal questions\nOr they want them to be decided by the ... the lead to know better than us and nothing represents that more I think that the abuses quite frankly recent decades on the Supreme Court\nAnd the left is unwilling or unable to engage in the kind of dirty work and getting your hands dirty I don't know I mean right hands dirty\nAnd persuading people and ... and um and I think slowly are starting to return to those principles and it's it's so important and I think also one thing about judge justice Kavanaugh being now confirmed it so important as we returned it to the presumption of innocence which was on ... on civil that we agree on really under attack\nThat was real scary state when it came down to it is that all of a sudden in the courtroom public opinion which was going to carry over I think Alan Dershowitz called it out as a you know it's it's campus politics campus justice has invaded the mainstream of America that this was all okay I mean you heard the comments of\nSenator or ... her ... ah I thought she might very dangerous Blumenthal of the things that were saying\nI mean if nothing else the electorate got real clear message of the two parties are Republicans were willing to fall on his sword for the rule of law and the U.S constitution that Democrats\nBe damned with the constitution that you are guilty and you and you're not even don't even think about innocence because we're as long as we call you guilty that's it it's going to stay with him\nRight and and you know I'm always glad even our comments were reprehensible center oh I'm Glad she said when she said because she works at ... and blunt enough to say the reason I don't given the presumption of innocence is because of his logical answer I mean that was fascinating I mean it was a whole year that was sitting US Senator\nBy I think it was also very revealing and and in a way good pretty my ... year that that she actually admitted I think a lot of them believe she said it publicly and said out loud you know we do not give the same rights and principles to people with whom we have a political ideological disagree with that really kinda unfortunately sums up a lot of what a last\nChance go I actually have an article coming out ... later today on real clear politics and and I call this dress rehearsal for impeachment because I really think that the circus that we saw in the last ... for the Senate Judiciary committee that wasn't dress rehearsal it was unfortunately a practice session essentially what will happen if we give\nThe house of representatives to the Democrats have no doubt they're being Cory I'm Out of there being slider not saying that very much not many of them but they will impeach the president\nAnd they will engage in a trial that actually makes the runoff proceedings look tame and fair I think by comparison what they want to look Donald Trump is on trial before the Senate and so I'm really encouraged and you're listening to everyone here me\nGet motivated to get out there because you you got a taste of what they'll do the trunk but they need to Kevin\nWe've got to maintain the intensity otherwise the rule of laws out the door and ironically enough to your point about a senator on which you know she brings this stuff up and then what she does is she causes people to look back into her history I mean look who are mentor was and look how he went out\nAh you know of course he was he was a hero and in many respects but then you find out as he was going out he was a there was alleged sexual impropriety and harassment coming out of his office\nAnd but she didn't you know she didn't say anything about Daniel in a way\nYou know I wasn't even aware of that so she never spoken about that no no\nNo covered that that was her mentor so here it is you know if it comes out to Republican and ah you know even at the mere allegation but yet for something that there was actually pay off\nA ... you know for what are you know the former senator of all why he had done and I'm you know but nope it said it was all\nYou know under the carpet a which is what they've done out of a sudden you know oh I'm the champion for the hash tag me too movement oh well that's kind of hard for me to get there when you weren't for so long\nAnd listen I think too you know as a society or does it and just political obviously I think all of us need to ... really come to terms of how do we agree with with a two to approach allegations because of course accusers I didn't need to be taken totally seriously we need to be treated respectfully I think the court was treated very respectful of that committee [noise] um I\nThink if they weren't they weren't for the Republicans not for the Democrats because correct jeeze you know she wanted to maintain some sort of anonymity and we know Dianne Feinstein did and I'm I'm waiting Steve I'm waiting for\nSome sort of censure or you know something you know to come down on Dianne Feinstein as well as senator Cory Booker for the antics he pulled\nI mean you know the dates they turn this thing on his head\nAnd really turn this into a mockery the other thing is that happened I think the takeaway for a Senator Grassley even though I thought he did a good job but when he picked this thing up I said oh no don't do you do not want to pick this up\nBecause he he legitimize the court of public opinion when he picked up the deal when they came in and said hey we got a problem here he should have just said hey that's not our responsibility if it's that much of a problem\nShe has recourse she needs to go see a the police in Maryland to address this issue not the Senate\nRight now in your in your right to if there's you know there's there's a lot on fortunately no ones I think in this story about the worst of the ... and I think some sat on this information there are there are ways and this is not a precedent\nWhich has come up with other similar situations you know it is highly sensitive accusations in previous confirmation hearings there are closed sessions which are not all of the press and public\nShe could have done it one on one literally with catalog she spent all our attempt she never mentioned that\nShe could have could the anonymity in the accuser she could coach grassy\nThere's a myriad of ways they could have done FBI investigations at that time they don't need to go to the White House and Senate requests yeah looking things up all this could have been done\nQuietly respectfully and early in the end what it should choose to do she sat on it and then she felt that car from a bomb on the back at the eleventh hour when she thought it was politically most opportune because they were losing a confirmation\nExactly exactly got to go to break we'll be right back more from Steve court as after this\n[noise] here's a\nSound of a house being trashed one of the gang a seesaw ransacked [noise]\nAnd what they don't Steve won't be destroyed\nHere resolve not to be the next victim of a break and go to the TV dot com

before the top of the hour John Tammy is joining us now director of the center for economic freedom at freedomworks John how you doing\nGood thanks for having me on\nHey always good to have you here to get your inside of this might be a little heavy stuff we're going to talk about central banking or and or do they would think um it's about them something we'd like to call them the Boogie Man of the economy uh but you write to not necessarily so\nNo no I'm look the reality and and this is happy happy scenario the reality is the credit is the cost of credit the set and the real economy um it's not set by central bankers this notion that they can\nBasically ask the rate at which credit isn't too easy or or too tight\nLaughable were talking about access to globalized resources there is no way central bankers kids have access to even us and tell us the information necessary to come up with such a rate and the result is but in the real economy rates are set in the private markets there not set by the central bankers\nAnd it really is I mean we get back to the basics of a bit of the free market don't we there's John\n[laughter] yeah um and and and to think of it this way if central bankers for a fraction of as powerful as as soon as\nWe would not have a booming economy nor would it be remotely a\nRemotely free market omelets remember none of us would accept a the USDA Saturday Sunday and price controls on on hamburger meat more allowing the mayor of a city to set the price of apartment when we know that scares the would result also what his credit\nWhen you borrowed dollars you're borrowing access to everything in the world and theoretically to everything so the idea that the central bankers could set that price effectively is just not serious we act in the real economy is so the fed doesn't exist and that's a positive thing\nWell John ah to your point if the central bank was that powerful in uh being at a a zero percentage rate for as long as we were a under the Obama administration you would have thought that ah we would have done a lot better\n... of course if in fact the fed can make credit cost less which logical you cannot do credit would have been very easy to get during the Obama years but in fact and this isn't it that this isn't a political statement\nDuring those years is very difficult for most small businesses to access any credit at all and this is normal credit there's always an everywhere expensive there's a reason\nThat investment bankers are so are paid so well they are because it's very difficult once you've got a business idea to actually find financing for ... and and you know if you if you go through different industries if you go back to when Donald Trump was in real estate\nUm this is a political statement either he went through parents were banks wouldn't touch it didn't matter that the fed was setting rates at certain rates\nDonald Trump was viewed as not credit work I talk to a movie makers they'll tell you their turn down the vast majority of the time even the best ones Ninety percent plus the time when they come up with a movie idea it's very hard to get ideas finance is this idea that the back and say oh we're going to make credit\nCredit costs so that people have easy access to it doesn't work that way\nNo and and and empirically\nWork you know you look back historically a that's all a delusion we find ourselves the looking like Don Quixote chasing windmills if you follow that one as safe as you say John ah the fed is at best rate follower not a rape setter\nYes of course it is the idea that the fed it set a rate it markets would take seriously just as isn't reasonable and and and what's got to be stressed again is what are you borrowing when you borrow dollars\nYou're borrowing access to trucks tractors computers desks chairs are most important of all humans you're borrowing access to labor\nExactly fed cannot multiply that and what's important there is that logically men\nCredit is going to be more abundant during economic boom these what's happening during the economic boost investment is greater as a result production is great much the same when the economy's contract\nLogically credit's going to be more difficult to obtain a because there's less production going on but also those who have access to it are going to be more careful with a good thing it's a reminder the recessions are self correcting there the drivers of recovery\nIs it's it's the economy's way of starving the bats can direct precious resources to get\nExactly and John I think what some people miss sometimes is that you have people you know who have the resources they have the money okay the ... you know call it whatever you want to call it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill
