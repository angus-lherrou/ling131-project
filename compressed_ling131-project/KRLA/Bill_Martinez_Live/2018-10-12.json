Jesse on here and just I'm always the press secretary for the national Republican congressional committee I Want I Want a big picture take on a\nRational races because we are twenty seven days away from them again I Know it's cliched I hate even saying these words but it truly is the most important\nElection in our lifetime if the Democrats take control of the house and and or the Senate we are in major major trouble but you got to see the way the Democrats are behaving and I know we've got a lot of people standing by for this video or about to we're about to play it for you here out of Seattle, Washington\nA protesters and demonstrators taking on police officers get a brutal way it is so profoundly sad uh so it's a standby for that we're gonna play that in fact will play it even while we're talking to Jesse Hunter\nHe's a former communications director for Senator Richard Burr Scott Brown press secretary for the national Republican congressional committee joins us on our guest line\nWe became great having you on the show how are you [noise] not bad thanks for having me\nHelp me understand thank you give us a thirty five thousand foot view an overview of the congressional races what's at stake what we're up against because quite bluntly I'm I'm tired of hearing well the Republicans are going to hold the Senate but they're going to lose the house is that a foregone conclusion\nAt this point in time we are seeing a very volatile environment so from the outset of the twenty Eighteenth cycle we knew was going to be very competitive Democrats are very energized they want all out of ... that is that is their\nTheir their overall agenda right now what we're seeing with twenty seven days to go is a resurgence of Republican enthusiasm\nPost a Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings [laughter]\nThat is due in large part to Republicans coming back home\nOnes who who might have been a little or is interested in in the mid term election but are seeing what the Democrats have plant we're already seeing Nancy Pelosi and other House Democrats line\nUp a litany of potential investigations they plan to undertake if they get control the house and we see on a regular basis their candidates talking about issues like\nAbolishing ice undoing the GOP tax plan and protecting sanctuary cities if they're able to regain control the house that is what's at stake in this election and I it has a way of turning off independent voters in motivating a Republican base letters\nYou know I I heard something less than a TV made my blood runs cold Kevin McCarthy pointed out Maxine Waters will become the chair of the house financial services committee if the Democrats take control the house\nLike gosh I I I think that just motivated about three million people to crawl crawl across broken glass to vote for Republicans in November to have that ... in a chairmanship position anywhere I mean we're seeing the difference the stark difference Jesse between the angry mob\nThat has been embraced by the Democrats you heard the comments Eric Holder Hillary Clinton were not going to be civil unless until we when my gosh the the protesters and they are all Democrats Jesse these aren't Republican protesters\nOne hundred percent we don't Maxine Waters is someone who who kicked off this a reprehensible behavior of saying that they should go and the cost of the White House officials are cabinet members\nAre Republican elected officials in their in their whole you know near their homes in restaurants at gas stations wherever they are is that is the type of rhetoric it's being used by the Democratic party day\nAnd that will become a kind\nOf common practice\nIf Democrats getting Charles how that's why it's so important for Republicans to get out there and vote to match that democratic enthusiasm because this is what they what we saw it ... you know you had the\nPotential twenty twenty presidential candidates up on stage you know during the judiciary hearings for a cat or you saw the way that they behaved that is going to take on a more of an emphasis as we move past the mid term elections in it to the presidential years that you know if you combine that with a a a house led by Nancy Pelosi\nIn a democratic presidential primary going on you're going to see some really a a porn behavior from the Democratic party if they're able to regain control\nJesse ... national Republican congressional committee we appreciate you joining us on the Mike Gallagher show very very much here it is here's the video this was taken by somebody in Seattle or a rope police officers are\nAs you listen on the radio on bikes are and they are trying to control a crowd and the mob and listen to the way one of these protesters treats all the police officers she encounters up and down the line watch their ship your Mike online dot com you'll see it and you can hear you're on the radio is extraordinary\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice officers show as there is this guy is in ... every one of their faces reading out their badge number are you going to shoot somebody today F. U. F. you up and down the line [noise]\nOr do we got a lot of great things to celebrate we still have a lot of problems here in river city\nAnd it's a time Dan I'm you and I I'm a you know with our backgrounds and and that the wind or stand when there is problems it all hands on deck I mean you're you're on the west side there\nOf Florida se you dealt with a little bit of a the wind you weren't a direct hit right it was above you bright bright where a hurricane Michael went through\nBut you know what you have right now is neighbor helping neighbor uh this is one of the key legs that a\n... you know Mr Brock a from homeland security and uh you know from um\nI'm On my brain is\nI'm getting ahead of my brain here from FEMA\nYeah uh what he talks about in in terms of the the key legs to you you know any kind of success of getting out of these situations in ... you know a restoring 'em a communities back you know back to normal I mean you know\nThe damage that Michael did is going to be devastating and and it's not you know it's funny that that um\nYou know hurricane went into and it didn't just hit Democrats or didn't just hit Republicans I mean it it Americans\nAnd this is what we have to get out of ourselves to think that you know it's party first no it's not party first it's America first it's Americans first this is what Donald Trump is trying to promote but we know when you have people for the sake of their own\nDesires Lindsey Graham said for a power grab that there are so blind to the concept\nTo understand and appreciate that we're in this together it's not about being low and kicking somebody or you know whatever other you know ingenious kind of brutality one is still on somebody because they're not behaving the way you think that they should be behaving\nRight I'm working at it as just before you call this morning I'm working on a new commentary that the working title is [noise] [noise] but new\nOn civil war in America yeah\nAnd I start off with a\nRamp like as a nominating speech for the Senate and the state of Illinois there what is called Al Gore's famous house divided speech or you know the scripture yes house divided against itself cannot stand\nAnd later and they came sixty three in the Gettysburg Address he talks about [noise] uh one has to wonder whether our nation has arrived divided ... uh I I think that um [noise]\nGod in this particular article and and I think it's important to try and figure out if if possible why we became a divided nation [noise] and I think I've come up at least with one answer\nAnd I'll give you an example of of what I've\nFigured out recently that the Irish Government put all of a referendum on the ballot for the people to decide what they wanted to do in their country mhm and they decided\nThe current issue on the ballot as to whether or not abortion was going to be legal in value most Catholic country and probably in the world\nAnd they are if people voted and said yes they wanted it to be a real bind though there were a lot of people disappointed\nBy comparison bill can can you cite me a house bill or a Senate bill number for roe versus Wade can you cite in the house bill or Senate bill number for\nThe definition of marriage no no absolutely\nHave we have we we had five individuals on the Supreme Court who decided\nThat they were going to define marriage define what had been defined for thousands upon thousands of years of humanity these individuals decided they were going to decide\nTo define what marriage was they also decided that they could only arbiters of decision as to a woman's right to choose medical procedures that point bill is that we never as America there's more than ever asked our opinion\nWe never had a chance to vote on those things and as the Democrats legislative from the bench\nTime after time after time things that they could not get accomplished\nAnd the legislative process because they never would have passed mhm they use their position and their influence and the judges in this in the third branch of the government the judiciary to legislate from the bench and what happened is that people had no voice\nBut people who are in favor of abortion or happy\nPeople who are against abortion no voice there was no process but allow the American people to decide\nWhere you're exactly\nYeah you're exactly right here down to you know this is what happened and you know I was in California when they voted for the definition of marriage eight million votes than eight million votes and the Democrats ironically are the ones that oh you got to protect every vote you know you you know where where are the\nChampions of every vote no voter id all this other stuff regardless of the proof that\nThat you that comes out that there is a you know tampering and the ballot box and voter fraud and all this and even um you know not that long ago the former attorney general Eric Holder\nInsisted that there is no such thing as voter fraud that anybody that says there is it are just absolutely delusional\nOr you know that's his perspective on this than I ask okay well if that is the case Mr hold her then why um why are people getting arrested and convicted and spending time in jail for voter fraud if\nVoter fraud doesn't exist you know so um but to your point of these activist\nJudges and what has happened and the sad commentary yet to be realized\nIf yeah the the this is this is a sad deal that you had people rejoicing\nFor evil in Ireland here it is the uh the bastion of Catholicism\nUnderstanding you know for many years you know saying hey can you know we're not going to approve but then they've got a small minority of voices out there yelling and screaming going you're making us leave our country to go get abortions\nBut now that they've accepted it and then get ready I think that there's going to be something in a obvious manner that's going to affect\nThe Ireland as a result of this decision and there is a big difference between having something like this imposed by the leadership\nVersus the papal accepting this kind of um [noise] this kind of a abomination that God even says I never asked you to do such a thing why are you doing more from ... after this stay with us\nThe United states of empire is the most of their claims the United states is the empire of the world\nGeorge Washington had

to allow abortion to come into the ... you know come into that a island country I mean that country or for so long resisted abortion\nAnd um you know and they were able to hold it off I mean it's a Catholic nation\nAnd something has gone wrong here that they have a you know they've turned and you know accepted something and especially in light of the empirical evidence that stands before them I mean just here in America loan um\nAnd we have great relations you know with with Ireland a I cannot believe that they didn't understand\nYou know the horrors that we have gone through here in this country was sixty million babies are boarded\nAnd uh you know than Planned Parenthood selling baby parts in it so goofy that uh the whistle blower Dave delight and he's the one that captures or you know these people doing illegal activities selling baby parts none of them go to jail and Dave is being put through the ringer\nI mean he's been in jail or you you know and what is still before him is unconscionable you know and or maybe maybe President Trump's waiting until this plays out before he gives him you know some sort of the exoneration\nBut he is he is one who needs to be greatly considered for you know some presidential clemency\nI couldn't agree more there's like five things are like kind of ironic that you always somebody amazing point Ali yeah there's so much to talk about

Believe that but it's all about ... months ago that guy what a I Can't help construct Planned Parenthood yet because I Can't do rent it at ... air and he won judging day there how illegal it that\nWell it's the same thing that happened before you know there's another topic we're talking about earlier and that is that uh you know Californians had a in they voted\nOr that a marriage should be defined as one man one woman or a million people voted okay an activist judge and activist judge in San Francisco who was Oh yes he was homosexual he\nSays the people got it wrong and so ...
