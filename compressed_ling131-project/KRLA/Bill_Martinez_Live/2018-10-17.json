couple of hours ago NBC News ... will look at this a double digit lead for Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania hardly the first double digit lead for Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania this is the third one we've seen in a week or so Donald Trump\nPennsylvania is a big target but all the evidence we have right now says Pennsylvania is still favored to be a democratic state\nActually you know they they don't [laughter]\nKnow short for Hillary Clinton [noise]\nWhat about Ohio we have a brand new part of Ohio down from doing a little better here but he's still down in Ohio a five point gap so again right now Donald Trump targeting Ohio just like he's targeting Pennsylvania but he's not there right now Clinton still meeting in Ohio\n[laughter] maker production right now\nDonald Trump will oh\nAnother one brand new NBC Marist Poll out of\nIowa today are getting a little bit closer but a four point lead for Hillary Clinton this is supposed to be a light target for Donald Trump he added convention eat had chances here he was out there in that for the caucuses early this year he still trailing in this poll in Iowa closer he could turn it around but again for right now is Donald Trump ahead in Iowa not in this poll\nRejects Donald Trump will win the state of higher\nWe don't have new polls today but Wisconsin Michigan these or other state Donald Trump has talked about living with the rust belt strategy we have not seen a poll that puts in the head nice state\nProjects that Donald Trump sharing the same with ... electoral votes you\nKnow again the boat and is still on Donald Trump to show that he can do something and Mitt Romney in a whole bunch of other Republicans over the last generation or so couldn't do and that is actually when the state that's the first thing is going wrong for Trump the bigger problem is this still needed a blue state he thinks he can flip\nHow about the red states he needs to hold how about the state's Rodney one in twenty twelve the Trump maybe it's just assuming he's got a whole will check this out\nBrand new numbers out of North Carolina North Carolina was Mitt Romney state in twenty twelve well right now in this poll Hillary Clinton has delayed very close certainly Donald Trump could still when I called a tossup states but we have seen polls putting Hillary Clinton ahead there it is possible Hillary Clinton could end up flipping North Carolina making it a blue state\nOf another soldier projected as I said it was her line of being out of what I say it's only about Trump's Fifteen electoral votes\nTrump's problem no gets a lot worse than North Carolina look at this Georgia new poll seven point lead here for Hillary Clinton not the first poll that we've seen courting are heading Georgia this is the state the last one democratic back in Nineteen Ninety two again\nDonald Trump could still take Georgia but Hillary Clinton certainly has a chance to flip Georgia\nSeeing an art project for Donald Trump will carry the state of Georgia [noise]\nBut if Hillary Clinton could sustain kind when she has leaked out and to an end to this race you could see other state that suddenly get crazy states it wouldn't be the magic of South Carolina even the taxes they could at least\nBecome competitive and what it would mean doesn't mean Hillary Clinton's going to win all the it means we could have more competitive states than we ever imagined you think\nWith these with South Carolina and Kansas you would think that would be not as likely that likely slash slam dunk slash and guaranteed flash obviously there's a ruby red South Carolina in Kansas but instead they're like read there just lean Republican now South Carolina leans Republican\nState of South Carolina has gone Republican in\nDonald Trump we project wins Kansas with six electoral votes [noise]\nAnd if those are the top states\nCan do the math associated with all the electoral votes from all the states that they go that way you have to lean Republican and the likely Republican go read and to lean Democrat and likely Democrat and go blue [noise]\nBe assigned those out that way\nThen he say that Donald Trump has the best day in the entire world completely\nOut performs expectation and he wins tossup states he wins\nThe days after he went to all of the top so to be insane because nobody when all of the top states even Donald Trump dead when all of the states with Phyllis\nStructure too harshly or\nEven with the best intentions\nIn terms of what still atop\nStates that are still considered a top that right now Florida\nTime CNN project

and the Democratic farm but this is a real calling from this is legit methodology\nPoliticians trust the voters not supposed to say\nChristian Wilker standing by Clinton corner\nWhat we now have had it over here again without that it\nTo learn to leave it on our well over an hour now\nOur values our politics and our future than now bill Martina\n\nHello America though my famous is six minutes after the ... the our great to have you along with the sharing a part of your day for more information on the show even go to bill Martinez live a dot com we've come at you Monday through friday nine to noon eastern six to nine Pacific and always good to have you along for the ride Dr Michael butler is with us now\nIs a public policy analyst economics expert and professor of finance Stockton University in New Jersey a Michael good to have you with us how you doing sir\nGood morning bill how you do and it's my pleasure to be here\nHey always good to have you with us here or hey let's talk about the Democratic party I'm Bernie Sanders says that um you know America wants to become like Venezuela really I mean is that true\nOh well that's what Bernie Sanders us banks that is true\nIs what he wants to believe anyway\nI think it's really just just the opposite I mean he appeals are a true I think a relatively small portion of the American voters mostly are people that are lower income and are having done real well or\nEconomically um for those people they take a look around and say well look there's a lot of people doing well CEOs are making a whole lot of money\nUm and that's just that's just not fair amount um so Bernie Sanders says okay hum it if we believe it's a farewell ... century redistributing income or so that we are raised taxes on people that are the most\nAnd give that tax revenue to people who for whatever reason I haven't been able to earn um anything um they're constantly talking about how this income inequality problem is worse than I Am and that has to do something about it\nThe other side of the argument is um if we have a situation where are some people are not doing well\nMost of the reasons for that is the economy has not been able to provide opportunities to those people and why not because the economy has inexperienced us three percent annual growth rate\nAnd the year two thousand five ... haven't experienced that four percent annual growth rates in the year two thousand that's almost two decades ago though President Trump got into office and he said look if we want to give opportunity to to everybody especially those who are prepared for it might learn the skill or\nGet an education or or or somehow are able to contribute more on the way to help everybody is to get the economy growing again so he got into office\nAnd he said look why why aren't we growing well we're not growing a for a couple of reasons one or the taxes things to be income tax that seem to be relatively high especially on the highest income earners who provide a capital for our capital intensive economy to\nGrow it said also\nFound the prior administration never primary concern economically was to to make sure perceived social injustice that has been done justice everybody doesn't have health care but soon justice that wealthy people make more than a\nOther people it's an injustice that big banks and corporations take advantage of consumers\nDo all the policies that Obama put in words are intended to cure the perceived social injustices room while every one of them tend to a slow growth\nObama put in regulations so consumers would be protected at it for the cost of business that couldn't grow so what did President Trump though he got into office in January of twenty seven people in February and march [noise] a a reverse\nHundreds of counterproductive regulations 'em and by April of last year the economy started growing at over ... percent rate\nThan he said really stimulate growth I'm going to take a look back in history and I say that I'm President Reagan and eighty one taking effect in eighty two uh and Kennedy Johnson and sixty three sixty four they both got personal income tax us for everybody including the highest\nIncome earners right past so that's exactly what he did\nAnd then he also last year convince Congress\nTo repeal many parts of the Dodd Frank bill which again was designed as secure as social injustice\nThat its banks taking advantage of consumers getting loans they shouldn't have given them\nAnd the problem with that fine ... and what they called predatory lending tended to land a to a reduced all bank lending and when that happened that tend to the slow growth so guy\nTom convince Congress to repeal parts of Dodd Frank [noise] put the tax cut into effect everything started in January of this year by April of this year the economy is growing at over four percent\nRate this third quarter number will be out the end of the month I think that's going to be maybe a four and a half percent\nGrowth rate and I wouldn't be surprised\nNext year and I was a lot of variables fair but right wouldn't be surprised to see the economy have a quarter or to a a five percent growth rate that once the economy continues grow fight that\nThat'll solve a lot of the ah social problems and a lot of the income inequality problem why is that for the last ten years\nMy graduate smart my students graduate they're lucky to find one good job opportunity because again the economy was averaging only have two percent growth rate for the last ten years many of my students take jobs for which they were overqualified\nOr as a result of them doing that taking a job he really didn't need a college degree for people without college degrees but not any opportunities at all no they ended up dropping out of the work force becoming so discouraged they drop out of the workforce or that two candidates to create more income\nInequality and social problems\nWell once the economy starts growing as it has a now since Trump's taken office under employed college graduates turnout finding jobs I'm Better more suited to their qualifications that opens up the job market to these discouraged workers and\nThere's about five or six million of them are hundreds of thousands of already come back into the workforce\nThough are the idea of trying to cure the social injustices perceive social injustices through\nSounds socialistic program Israeli counterproductive and we should be doing exactly the opposite which is what President Trump is doing and it's starting to have some good results\nWell you know Dr ... late this out I mean this is brilliantly state it I mean do you watch you right through the exact process\nAnd um and it is amazing that people would still be subject to what I call this a socialistic mindset and victimization that Bernie Sanders at all or trying I mean that's they're counter idea I mean we were yeah we've we've got a robust economy I mean there's clear evidence that this is working\n[noise] and um forget about what the former president would want to tell you and some of his uh his Alcoa lights are in saying that ah you know\nYou can ... Obama for it um I the only thing we can go a block Obama for is a appreciating that there was a clear difference between the Obama economy days and uh the era that is now be done with Donald Trump\nExactly right you know and if you look at the history of the U.S [noise]\nYou know we went from a new country\nPretty much number one and everything and all over a hundred and fifty years and there are countries that have been around for hundreds in some cases thousands of years and we asked them the reason was\nWe encourage them you know that means there's individual responsibility that we recognize we have the social world\nMichael we gotta we gotta go to break I Want to stop great there 'cause I don't want to cut you off in the middle of the the explanation is is an important more from Dr Michael ... after this\nUnited States and empire is mostly claims the United states is the empire of the world\nGeorge Washington had warned us against more and more of the United states of empire shoes in the world wars one and two left one broken woman calling us does save the empire\nWas there ever a vote for food we fight for deep sea began with World War one of the United states of empire by James done on the level at Amazon Books\nDon't let them come much talk about down home values made in usa blue jeans\nLike you wore as a kid and remember\nThere's money in them using\n\n\nEnergy use of the way they\nVoted\nDown and\nUm the about what we talk we talk about dignity Michael and this is one of the things that Donald Trump brought back to the country\nPeople can start holding their head up again because they were you know if they're out there getting you know taking advantage and and they knew they were in their heart of hearts\nIt wasn't you know for it you know what the government was doing and you know to your point here\nWas were dragging people down ... at at the expense of their dignity ... you know that's not what America is all about and so now Donald Trump comes in mixed jobs available and people are again you know that's why they were so excited I said we had all this pent up energy productivity just waiting to be expressed\nAnd we made away but we still need to go deeper because there's others that are not quite caught up yet and even some that are you mentioned a you know some of these ah workers they got pushed out when you got\nA highly qualified a graduate student with college degrees coming in and they're pushing the marketplace pushing pushing labor's out will I say that they didn't all just go home and did nothing I mean they still had bills to pay what they did was they they started working under the table for survival\nAnd you know that has yet to be fully redeemed yet you know and because you've got a lot of tax money that's out there that still being handled on an under the table type basis not to the degree of was\nTwo years ago but certainly it's still measurable\nYeah that that uh what's it called the underground economy you know it's very difficult to measure but you're right people have to survive\n'em and if there is no opportunity for them and the uh more forced to end up becoming a discouraged worker and President Obama made it fairly easy for people to stay out of the war for the increase the amount of food stamps people could get\nTook away the war or choir meant for welfare and then he gave everybody for free health care so if\nYou're if you have money for food and money for a living expenses in your health care bills are paid there's really no one can go into the job market and take care of\nYourself the problem as though all the people are my experiences and the people that are receiving these government handout very what does that fall the fact that they have are in a position that they have to take these exactly much rather be able to earn their own kids get their self esteem acts\nAre feeling better about themselves\nAnd instead of being out of the war correspondents or what do you do you just sort of around or you look for an underground economy type thing which is breaking the law you know you're you're forcing people that wouldn't normally be law abiding people just sort of pushing them into that actually the law\nWhen Michael this conversation has to continue as always we appreciate you being on the show Dr Michael butler Bill Maher teams
