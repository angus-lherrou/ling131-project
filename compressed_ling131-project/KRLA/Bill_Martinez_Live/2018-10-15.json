formulations and it's helping reverse aging symptoms to a degree even doctors never thought was possible\nThat's often okay so let's talk more about this new supplement and we're going to do that in a bit but first is HGH bad\nOh I think there's a lot of confusion about it many feel HGH has just for body builders and pro athletes or it's for making cows produce our mail which is not true it's absolutely good and vibrant for our health\nIt maintains bodily functions like our metabolism energy tissue repair muscle growth and brain function throughout life\nNow HGH has been found to be the

the G H R platinum\nNo no hormones it's all natural\nLove that so let's talk about what the G H R platinum will do for us but first why are we aging and why are we getting old well there\nAre many factors but one major reason is due to the decline of our youth harmonious HGH\nOkay so briefly for those that don't know what is HGH\nHGH stands for human growth hormone although most of the older adults still have it it has its highest peak when we're young then growing into adulthood mhm are young bodies absolutely why when those HGH levels were high because it enabled us to have so much energy as kids we\nDidn't know what to do with an R metabolism works so remarkably well we could eat tons of calories even junk food McDonald's whatever we wanted and we could still have a fit body we've built muscle easily we slept deeply we bounce back from injuries fast we have beautiful skin\nYeah and I used to eat tons of ice cream and French fry a boy I miss that being able to eat all that stuff so what happens all that\nWell I'll tell you what happens after we've physically stopped growing usually around the age of twenty five ... our growth hormone level drops significantly and then immediately we start to age and get old\nOkay so this decline of the growth hormone is really known as the beginning of the aging process right\nNow they're dropping growth hormone sends a negative domino effect throughout the entire body and usually in our early thirties we start feeling that ripple effect\nI mean we may start off with just the fuel wrinkles and then some excess fat right ... energy our hair are eyesight and our quality of sleep lessons\nWe simply slowdown in this affects all of this research shows that the lower the growth hormone the Bastrop person ages inside and out\nOkay so if you're middle aged right like me about how much of the youth hormone have we lost about eighty percent oh jeez eighty percent so if I've lost nearly ... percent of my youth hormone at my age I feel like I'm thirty just in an older body\nWell you're you're not alone Jody [noise] this is Sherry okay about one third of all adults forty five years and older not only have low growth hormone but are extremely deficient\nWhile okay you know that's scary because it seems like the deficiency of HGH it's completely out of our control so there is there anything that we can do to
