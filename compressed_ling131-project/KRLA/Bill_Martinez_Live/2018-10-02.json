the first thing I thought what she's having a good time\nBut I don't know that she's having a good time and I don't know the best necessarily fair um again I Am always mindful and I've said this before bottom line is\nA there are sexual assault victims who don't have cooperation and I think we need to be mindful of that it's important to be mindful of that it's important to remember that it's also important to remember that like it or not it comes there are things that come down to he said she sat\nIn this case senators are going to have to decide and after judge Kavanaugh's emotional powerful testimony following her emotional powerful testimony\nIt's tough call tough call\nThat ... which seems to me as a senator's expected to do here is frustrating\nAs it is how do you not hold the possibility\nBut it's not correct the accusation isn't true a day after Brookhaven, Mississippi police officers or the police department lost two men two of their officers in a shootout\nA third Mississippi law enforcement official was an officer was killed off duty trooper Kenneth Josh Smith was fatally shot Sunday as other gunshot victim not sure on the details of that he was off duty the

eight eight eight Ninety nine I get what you hear about\n... police officers and how they react to\nSplit second decisions they have to make eye witness something Saturday Night in a Burger King in midtown Manhattan right across from the Port Authority on west forty second street it's actually a very dangerous part of Manhattan\nYou've got a lot of conversation over the weekends I'm no doubt a everywhere I everywhere I went Megan everybody wanted to talk about Kevin all they wanted to talk about their impressions and in and it was almost to the point that they didn't care if I'm\nThere was a a sensitive feminist nearby it was just wait a minute this\nIs a there's just something real wrong about all this\nYeah and you know I talked to a lot of people this weekend as well and that was the same but I got the people that I talked to 'em I think most people believe that something did happen it Dr Christine forward\nAnd those people out for her because obviously she's been through multiple decades therapies she's got to fund doors at our house in order to you know prove I guess that she has cost the addict diet in some sort of paint TST from an electorate that end up from a prosecutor\nProsecutorial standpoint according to the Mitchell Report which was a lawyer who had examined Dr Ford and\nShe basically said no credible prosecutor would take this case because there is no accurate that correct um there is evidence that she had had a lot of therapy\nBut there is no evidence as to what caused her to have so much therapy and then there's so many in a consistency is her story that majority of the people\nAround her lacking\nCredibility I Won the fact that she said that she was afraid to fly but she has been to Hawaii you know at times it out the back that Europe\nIs is that all over the world can buy 'em a circus that you know when she was ... kind of an outline a lot of people don't overlook that because that's not something that you should\nNormally lie about because you do have if you have to prove that you're afraid of flying obviously you're white history\nWhat ... what's your take on it so when you look at the whole day or march right now the feminist glass eyes that all survivors last the belief well first of all you have to establish what exactly they survived\nMhm [noise] yeah ... and and the thing also the way this\nUh the way this was playing out\nMy initial instinct um and I was talking with a friend of mine is we were watching and he was in a different different part of the country and we were watching the testimony of a doctor forward\nAnd I just I actually something's wrong here that this doesn't this doesn't seem right almost seems like she's acting and he is a um a highly decorated police officers had a lot of experience in this and he and he and his response was bill I'll guarantee you she doesn't teach and that voice\nAnd a and then I had a I was watching a a an interview\nFor my body language expert and you love these people who have that kind of experience\nThat can bring out the nuances and it was the standing you know she she referred to as her pretty girl posture and someone who has been a charming and are we and we know people who have been charming and how they can get away with it you know\nSeemingly murder at times because they are just so doggone charming and you just want to believe them and they kind of have a way of disarming you and\nDr Ford disarmed\nIt you know the senators and except for some of them that uh you know had to be careful because and I think we all are walking on eggshells over this deal for the sake of you know the women who have\nIssues and and that have been victims and that you want to ... you know you don't want to be so hard hearted that you cannot hear the truth when it comes to cause\nIt's just that this is suspiciously I'm\nSuspicious I guess is the is the word because you know the way this is all being worked out the people that are behind her\nThe way this was played out is that you know really if it was a problem if this was really a problem why didn't she go make and why did she go to the local authorities because there's no uh you know there's no statute of limitations for sexual abuse in Maryland she could have taken this right straight to the officials and say\nI've been violated and the story and that still\nMay happen or where they go to the police because they're not getting their way and they're doing everything they can delay they've delayed it now to where the court is now a eight it's one member short because of what I'm you know the Senate or didn't do\nWell All right yeah and she could still take the Montgomery County police department and the question that's why why why how did they did this is my point a white ... if this was stolen or aid speed resolved and he'd be investigated\nWhile in the first place her lawyers can go look for them or not for\nThe first place for that they only hire lawyers or the edge to the to the police department because there is no statute of limitations on assault\nBut then you have to ask ourselves okay if I go to the Montgomery police department where every police department going to go much like the question Estela whereas the IRS going to go to the doctor or can't tell us what House what she's already holding\nThe idea of the amount of different people that were there and the poor people that she claims that were there all deny that her allegations are even truthful or that ah that that there\nThat that they remember things completely differently uh they said they were that were at a party that they'll recollection of already um and so all the evidence that she's tried to put forward has kind of fallen flat\nI Am torn apart if you will have the police you know the American people watched her testimony we saw all the police if there ever if they ever receiver for real lawyers\nAre going to see the whole county prosecutor Bob ... is going to see the whole she would never have a case\nIn fun criminally against fought in front of a judge or a jury and criminally again but cabinet\nAnd that was Rachel Mitchell's conclusion as well and the other thing that happens which of course is heartbreaking to see what the women the victims are subjected to a but\nYou know in order to get to the truth you know she's she's opening yourself up to her background a interestingly over the weekend her uh information about her high school annual which was up was suddenly professionally scrub why was that may\nOr social media to file before she you know the answers are anonymity in order to go and buy a judge Kavanaugh so a lot of things happen and stuff from my past the ...\nYeah I mean and the thing is is that when you are there were some people that were able they were smart enough he said this is going to last long so they saved the material and I read the copies\nI mean we're going to get into a little bit more of the detail of what her
