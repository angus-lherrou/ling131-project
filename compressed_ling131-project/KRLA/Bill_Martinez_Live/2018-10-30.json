from the same trumped arrangements syndrome a shepherd Smith had all the rest of them go see somebody go see a psychiatrist go see a pastor go talk to a friend who is normal and maybe you'll get your head screwed on straight [noise]\nDoing great lots to talk about here a week in review course\nAh what was on um all the pundits mine was a this rise in violence back to back situations I'm just an awful what happened particularly with the you know they're in Pittsburgh at the synagogue and uh it is just amazing how no matter what happens is Donald Trump spoiled\nI mean let's not even a ... you know I I was listening to say okay because I told a friend of mine I go there not even saying anything about the bbs movement\nYou know boycott divest and and um\nSanctions movement a nothing whatsoever and of course that that's come out of the college campuses and there's been a lot of\nAnti Semitism born out of the college campuses but nobody wants to say anything about ... what are we missing here\n[laughter] well of course we're missing they were missing the old adage that the left always default too is that everything is Trump fault I doesn't matter if this shooter the synagogue hated Trump was goalie against Trump on social media\nI also expressed his outrage and I guess it was the boiling point whereby a twin when Trump moved the embassy to Jerusalem that really set him off and again we have another arranged leftist\nI'm ... you know you look at the mass shootings in this country and always Democrats watch default it's a Republican and it's a craze Republican it's the ultra right again it's the gun\nOh no it's actually it arranged Democrat with a gun Ninety nine point nine percent of the time you know if we'll go back even the Gabby Giffords specifically remember them claiming Sarah Palin and the Tea Party\nRoute for Gabby Giffords' shooting immediately out the box they came out and said well it must be someone that's upset over the health care issue\nAnd on and on and now again it was a registered nurse arrange Democrat and\nJamie and I and another and another under reported situation because all you know in the interest alleged to for truth you know they'll go ahead and let all that rhetoric fly around and then they wonder why you know you've got this kind of a instability going on people are just tired of you know the the media is not doing their job in terms of\nYou know calling balls and strikes on this uh that's fine hey look at if you want to report that uh you know in your perspective or some people's perspective this Republicans fault that's\nOkay you know enough of that but how 'bout how 'bout just recording the truth door there's balance I mean you know when you get Ninety percent still of the media reporting being negative towards Donald Trump ... what is it what is that going to tell you that's going to frustrate somebody sooner or later\nYeah I remember when James Hodgkinson walked on a baseball field with the kill list and nearly assassinated over a dozen Senate Republicans\nAre the only reason he didn't make off with us kill list and fascinate fourteen Republicans us because the Capitol police were there because they have the least was reckless and and saved a majority really and save the lives of fourteen others\nAt that time Nancy Pelosi was outraged that we're pointing out that James Hodgkinson was a Democrat and how dare we blame the Democrats for that first the first one after\nNearly fourteen Republicans were assassinated she asked for you know pays she asked for there's a lack of size must wait we need that you know tone down their language and then a week later she goes back\nTo what I got I got to make and I have to both sides arguments I really do frankly because you got a call up the people who are responsible it's like you know and when I was in corporate America used to drive me nuts when people would send out these general memos\nYou know about correcting your behavior you know they didn't have the audacity that they have the information that there were certain people that were doing something\nBut no let's let's put the whole problem on everybody's back as if to modify you know the problem that you got the problem you have is you got you know certain people that are doing things and uh and even the media they want to keep up with this narrative that can be negative and somehow attached to Trump I mean to to watch them over the weekend on the Sunday TV shows\nTwist and even even the people who were there\nTo um interview a Chuck Todd I mean you go right down the list you know wait a minute you guys are so obviously prejudicial here\nYou're really not interested in pursuing the truth you want to find ways I mean you keep coming back and asking questions about well do you think it's Donald Trump's fault I I ... you know kind of deal and and even after the situation with the the pipe bomb or a you know they find\nOut that he's in a Michael Moore movie and he he's very very anti establishment anti Trump\nAnd but yet because of some bumper stickers on his band or he had to be an a deranged Trump\nFollower [noise]\n... yeah and and going back to the words you know and they have the political ...\nWhat was hardly dry on the baseball field in Virginia and she's calling for stability and then a week later she goes back and starts calling us Nazis and Trump Hitler you know it's interesting to watch the Democrats ... dance and how they can tort themselves into these manufactured chaos and outrage it's\nFor their as dangerous as the Democrats want us to believe they are then they're certainly the guilty party of stoking the violence the hatred the instability I you can't call sixty three million people not safe\nWhich is basically what the Democrats are doing and not have some on the hinge Democrat won a punch Nazis chicken at shooting at the\nMap course don't you want to defeat the Nazis all yeah we don't back World War two but all of a sudden I guess the Nazi their back on this type of inflammatory language that the left of false and the thing I can cause violent reactions and we've witnessed that time and time again\nAh but the left does not want to own the responsibility or only accountability for their own hate speech are generally find it interesting that Democrats are never accused of hate speech\nNo no but it's always justified because what happens they they modified by saying well both sides to it and instead of right now I'm just saying oh you're right ... you know we're responsible for our part\nNo let's let's just talk about you know it's it's all Donald Trump's fault is all this rhetoric yes they can see the problem but what they can see is that they're um you know they're leading the way because when you look at these things who's always during the first punch I guess that's what you're you're asking your Megan\nRight and then you go on to the pipe bomber and you know immediately they want to make sure it's a Trump supporter well the guy only registered to vote in two thousand six pain\nWhether he supported Trump or not it's really kind of beside the point the guy with the terrain lunatic and put together a bomb appropriately and um I still call them hoax bombs I don't care what Christopher I\nI think I think I think you're right I don't think he was serious about it I mean now a ... and you know and I think that's his out that keep you know that cuts down a number of years for him being in jail is that it was it was all a mockery you know it was set tires and you know that kind of deal so that that's what they'll argue you know making birth is with us we'll get more from Megan on the other side of the break stay with us American Fifteen\nMinutes after the top of the hour writer

consensus is we can see things according to our own eyes or this is manmade this is what we crave it I mean you want to talk about global warming and all this stuff I mean you look about the insanity right now that is a prevailing this country\nIt is man made I Want to bring on a I'm a retired a lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis is good to have him back it's been too long since I've been able to talk but his new book alliances evil has the mystery of the end times finally arrived rubber good to have you back with is how you doing sir\nI'm doing well Bill thanks for having me\nWell I I Know for you are and we've talked about this before um you know we we can have all the conversation we have you know want to have about America but you're not going to hear this and a lot of radio stations very few that what we're dealing with is a spiritual issues are not\nWell of course was spiritual sugar in the course that's the nature of mankind unfortunately but the vast majority are not spiritually alive and those that are about the the you know the spiritual dimension in a way that um\nYeah influences the everyday activities whether the mass killing their in Pittsburgh or its bombs or its war around the world uh this is not a new issue but one perhaps back then and the audience or wherever they may be that are not spiritually connected warm understand\n... and my prayer is if you're not and it's not like we're speaking of some sort of secret code here or what Robert and I are talking about is the empirical there has been evidence time and time again that this is the case the media can't talk this way\nOf you know some of the leaders that you look to cannot talk this way they can give you the truth is kind of like conscious pilots sitting there in front of the truth himself and he says what is the truth you gotta mocks it's kind of given up on on what truth is and look what led to\nAnd I would say to you ... do you may get frustrated and think okay what is the truth\nBecause the media tells me all this other stuff well first of all if you're relying on the median politicians as your source of truth\nOr you're in trouble right off the bat or you're not rubber snow\nAbsolutely you know that reminded me of um ... mark chapter six where Jesus goes into a burning them\nAnd he speaks and of course it's the local community now ... there's not that far away Bernie among the deli mhm than a Jesus is speaking in a way that\nYou just fascinate these people's says yeah this was a carpenter from ... isn't he the son of Mary which was a slurp courses fine because right everybody knew that Jesus was\nYou know in the ... and understand that conception but that he was conceived out of wedlock\nUm which are really perplexed ... very much in attacking knows that we're spiritually alive began to understand that course it really took kind of cost before people\nTruly understood because they had the Holy Spirit within this\nExactly but you know here we are
