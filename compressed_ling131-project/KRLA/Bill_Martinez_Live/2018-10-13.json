wait six oh three for ... my genes [noise]\nThis is going to surprise you know the mainstream media doesn't really talk much about President Trump's accomplishments of the first twenty months\nThe Washington Examiner put together a list\nIt's going to blow your mind and more on ... visit with the president all of that coming up stay with [noise]\nWe've been talking about all the things that are up for grabs in November Medicare is on the ballot the government program dedicated to seniors the one that we've paid into our whole life is under attack by the Democrats they call it Medicare for all it's not an idle plan\nAnd ah you know they they basically gave a the Obama administration a lot of cover\nAnd now here we are a ... you know counter mandating a you know the the holes that the Democrats dug for us and I don't mean while it's like some of the Dirt's coming back on us and look who's holding the shovel but the feds\nFunny what their act like they're doing right now\nAre the opposite of what we're doing so well because of President Trump's policies like hey we got to maybe have a little bit of a give us a little bit of caution because we're doing so well\nYou know what the what China with the Chinese government's doing now is actually there is because they're not doing as hot as we are because we called them on their training and frankly during the last ... years and it's very very and it just print money very very quiet anything\nVery easy to lower interest rates may get cheap to borrow a hard to do is produce an economic environment that's conducive to entrepreneurial growth that's conducive to describe an hiring and wage growth\nThat natural old fashioned way exactly President Trump's done this but what do you\nAnd the senior Chris is that we're talking unelected bureaucrat when they're not even bureaucrats I mean they're their own entity\nAnd their social engineering this and somehow thinking that whatever they do has causal effect but the causal effect that they and they are doing is they're actually putting a stick and the economic spoke to this country\nThat's exactly what it is you know when you hear candidates are here you know greater than fifty percent of Democrats believe socialism is is preferable to capitalism a you know you kind of had to think you know what's what's going on here and they do take control of the house you know what kind of\nThings do they try to push through a you know that are going to be and this is a good for the economy you know the exact opposite of what we need you know they're doing exactly that you know when you have a front front leading candidate you know ran for president last election cycle and Bernie Sanders who wants to\nSpend a trillion trillion dollars for a single payer health care plan and now you have a an emerging millennial and Joe Cortez\nWho's looking to spend thirty million dollars or more I think the numbers more than that right exact ought to get this plan in place you know you have to think these days with the next wave of Democrats I don't know that we're facing too great of a threat in twenty twenty\nYeah I go back to the you know the basics Chris and I've been asking this question forever is that you know um how much government do we want to buy how much government can we afford and here we are still trying to you know swallow down a three four trillion dollar size government and the socialist ideas that oh no that's\nEnough I mean we're barely keeping up with that we got twenty two trillion dollars in debt staring us in our days\nAnd uh you know and they go oh we got a better idea let's expand Medicare even more so we're going to go back and\nRevisit Obamacare two point oh I'm In ... and this is what the Democrats saying ... it's just\nNot quite never and not be if you just gave us a little bit more we can figure this out and it's like look at we can't afford it we've already giving you a everything we can give you and it's not working you know when do you cut your losses and move on\nWell you know that that racket right I mean a racket for Democrats and when they run for office as they promise free stuff it's very simple\nAs I said earlier you know an economic terms just print money and you know kind of give it away and you know lower interest rates make it easier to borrow but you know you have to have a healthy economy you have to do it the old fashioned way will operate and domestic economy and where we are we operate and a global economy and so\nYou know that's the whole racket they if they'd been riding uninformed uneducated voters think\nGreat gimme gimme gimme game or\nThe government will take care of me I wrote a frog bills\nI don't have to worry about anything and I have to worry about\nAnything that you know I should do to improve my own\nA market ability as a as a worker or even as a business owner of the government will just take care of me Uncle Sam would just take care man that is the exact opposite of what we were founded as a nation um you know we're a capitalist free market economy were competition has good healthy it makes products better tries prices down\nHere and it makes it makes everybody better off that's why millions of people uh you know hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty and acting as a free market system that Republicans a spouse\nChris this secure as our liberty I mean this is this is what drives all this I mean the reason that people want to come to this country is to really be free you know to allow their ideas and their dreams to be ... in this country of towards them that and uh\nYou know every time the Democrats are in leadership I mean all you gotta do is just look at the city's look at the states were ... were Democrats\nAre involved in their leading the way I mean it is absolute misery for the citizens there for the most part and you know it's like a you know what the voters can't figure this out even in you know let's say California you know with the pain that they're under I mean here it is\nUm you know you got a governor talking about supposedly this robust growth that they've been having well they're still at a net negative they chased away more businesses out of that state and more jobs out of that state but yet you know with a straight face the governor says oh we've you know we've added so many new businesses\nYou know to the state here is like wait a minute you know you're so you're so far behind that you know we need that and then some in order to get back to parody\nAnd that's exactly it it it's kind of the same terminology bill as when they say you know during the about aspiration how many jobs\nNot know how many jobs they created how many jobs they have to start it but it's not an economic metric you should be proud of how many jobs you saved or created it should be how many jobs they created it reminds me when I came into the Trump Administration department of commerce I ran the minority business development see\nSome of the metrics that we had help minority businesses okay how many businesses that we have we helped\nOr how much that we have to them and getting contracts with every dollar amount\nAnd then I came in and I looked at this new metric and it said how many jobs were created\nOr save [laughter] we're getting rid of that that is part and we can we create and I'll tell you during the twenty twenty uh Eighteen fiscal year we created ten thousand new jobs with that small agency or just a just a small budget\nAnd that's because President Trump's a bust economic plan and and the domestic policies\nExactly to the centers frankly the opportunity to just give them the ball you know you have to have all the end zone\nAnd we got and I got to go to break will pick it up there we get more from crisscrossing after this stay with us\nEver wonder how big going into Syria more created personal media has owners of companies and individuals

are taking a toll here and uh I'm not the bearer of bad news on the bearer real nurses actually happening out there so of course long confused with yeah the long term treasury the ten year treasury\nHas gotten over a three point two percent ... after the first time in quite a while when I started hearing about two percent to point one woman writing about a really big move up words\nA means of mortgage rates have gone up over five percent on thirty year fixed rate mortgages right\nUm and the federal that's long term rates and short term rates the fed reserve controls\nAh they went up again in June ... June ... September ... uh looks like they're going to do it again in December so that means that ...\nJust for you can't raise the rates going into Christmas can you tell them well I guess they can ever they were they wind dries\nBattle before interest rate increases us here most of that means that what you pay on credit cards and student loans and car loans and business loans all that's gone up three times a year ago four times probably three times at least\nNext year so it's costing consumers more money tomorrow when they're trying to slow things down on them and they're starting to have an impact of seeing the housing market definitely getting weaker than it was before with mortgage rates going up to over five percent how does that help because well I mean other than the feds view they kept interest rates too low for too long\nAnd their so called normalizing of getting back to normal right now they're fed funds rate controls at two and a quarter I think what they would consider the neutral rate\nIs maybe three and a half percent so another point or more from where we are now which means that you're going to be even more on a loan you know going forward I mean it helps the fed and when I look at it helps us particularly definitely slows the economy\nAnd particularly bondholders are really getting hurt here you know I mean\nIf you have money in a long term treasury bond and the yield keeps going up as an has been you lose more than ... than you were in an interest in getting three point two percent on my long term on today and ready to go to say three and a half percent which I think it's likely\nI I think you could lose a lot of principle so you got to do something different because right keeping it that way you're going to keep losing money\nWell the reality is is the fed is the sad and I know that when these things kind of happened when the dynamic tension starts\nPulling a little bit more in their direction people started saying why do we have the fed anyway uh they're really not helping the cause especially at a time when we're we're trying to recover ourselves the everyday consumer uh for eight years of bad news real bad news\nAnd bad experiences and or course or you know they feathered that whole situation by not raising rates are all those number of years so I guess we're we're paying for the feds passed since I got\nTo exactly that's a good way to put up the fed felt that they were too easy they pumped a ... the fence balance sheet was about six hundred billion dollars before the financial crisis and after about four and a half trillion so they pumped about four trillion dollars into the economy\nTo keep it from kind of going over the edge and now we're paying about their kind of\nReducing that a bit so if we can this was talking about what people should do if they've got money and I'm gonna get hurt 'cause it's it's not a pretty situation I mentioned before the most popular even though I get free Webster's about these secured real estate from yes because they can get an eight percent yield\nBut the price of a share of something to offer them it doesn't stay as a pen dollars a share and don't have any movement that way\nA website so that is secured real estate from dot com they're lending money short term to commercial real estate projects all over the country\nThat's got a good track record so if you need income that to me as much more stable way to keep your money instead of these bombs which I think we're going to keep getting hurt as some districts keep rising\nYeah and I like to the minimum investment because I misunderstood I thought it was much higher but you said a five on five thousand dollars that's a that's a pretty good a pretty nice and there'll be ...\nTo get into a neither am I was going to be full amount that you invest goes right to get to the present and then you could do it in an hour if you like as well\nAnd have a compound you can either have to reinvest it on a regular basis or take monthly checks which every like well so in this ... I mean I was just in a conference last week when they were saying this is the beginning of a new bond market\nBear market basically really we've had pretty much falling interest rates since Nineteen eighty two down to a low but the treasury head about one point seven\nAbout a year and a half ago and that was the low and now after three point to and I think that's going to go much hotter so you've got to kind of adjust\nTo the new reality of the bomb bear market exactly so uh we want to um uh keep\nA close eye on her stocks but look at bonds now because there was a stock market world for a while and bonds or being ignored but now they're on the upswing huh\nWell but you are on the upswing here at the prices on their downs way is right and that that's why the stock market has gotten so well here is if there's more competition from miles from there had been when bombs were two percent or thereabouts there wasn't much competition but now there is the stocks and getting hit the most bill or the highest flying", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Martinez Live", "city": "Glendale", "day": "13"}
