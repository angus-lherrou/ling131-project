you are the air thank you for listening today I think it's useful for me to introduce you to new and emerging voices every now and then one of them is Scott Galloway\nYou heard earlier on this show this week Alan Greenspan emerged to talk about the wonders of Amazon and out as creative destruction personified well Scott Galloway does not agree with that he is the author of before\nMost recently gave me forty five minute talk on the future retail but Savage Amazon I always tell people I own Amazon I Love what it's doing for me as a financial matter but I Am worried about big tech Rob Galloway welcome Scott Galloway welcome to the program\nUm what do you make a Twitter controversy involving Louis Farrakhan as a way into this\nThank you I'm a a nice view issue so I think it's a it with respect to Twitter and Google or I Believe these companies have warmly embrace\nA the the margin the celebrity and the influence of media companies but they seem to be allergic to the responsibilities of the fourth estate and I think that most of these examples\nAre essentially demonstrated one thing and that these companies um don't want don't want to acknowledge that they're not platforms that immediate firms and that they are responsible for their content and the responsible for ensuring\nThat these problems aren't paying weaponized so I'm generally on the side\nOf of of thinking okay we need we need to hold these companies to the same standards you tell the other media companies do for decades or or even centuries now\nI I spent much of my MSNBC show talking about the need to regulate\nA Silicon Valley and its bags that I read in the New York post your quote I Believe our society is effectively going through this very uncomfortable transition that is bad very bad for America bad for the planet where we no longer worship at the altar of character and kindness we worship at the altar of innovators and billionaires and I said a man\nAnd we got to do something uh this is sort of like the age of the railroad billionaires yes it is an age of tech titans your effectively controlled and frankly for his book world without mine scared me and now you're preaching the ... but I don't know what to do do you have a proposal what to do\nThough I don't think the world is what it is I think the world is what we make of it and I think initially I think we need to America has proud history of when a company turns into an invasive species and starts killing small companies in the Caribbean prematurely euthanize in big companies that are better taxpayers and better employers we move in\nAnd we break them up it doesn't mean they're evil that doesn't mean the bad people it doesn't mean they haven't we haven't benefitted from them or we haven't been net gain or the people at ma bell weren't even the people the railroads were evil but when we have one company Amazon but control fifty percent\nOf all the commerce when we have one company that controls Ninety three percent of whatever content you see after you declare your intentions search and that's Google\nWhen we have one company or that is responsible for eighty percent of time in ads where we spend eighty percent of our time and found on our phone that Facebook it is time to move in\nAnd break these guys a competition is the answer to I'm actually not regulation guy and regulation has unintended consequences but it is time to oxygen marketplace issue we need voices like you come to the light we need these companies\nBroken up and we need to do a side with macho initially people have sort of a gag reflects that you talk about breaking these guys up\nIt makes you somehow a socialist or worse European\nIt is very Americans and moving on big companies when they become an invasive species and we're at that point market\nWe were they are they are information trusts now and and and trust busters are needed I Am particularly appalled that Google is selling the instruments are tall during control to China\nAnd I don't think people understand that would be like selling weapons designed to the crop iron works in in Nineteen thirty three it is it is really a remarkable excess John Bolton told me last week he thinks we need to go to export control but maybe break up would do it although it wouldn't stop that Scott Galloway\nI'm not sure that it wouldn't show in the case of Facebook you literally had the G argue weaponized the object of our affection Facebook and detonate this this weapon in our face and\nI mean the the flags here we're not only rag read they were they were you know come ... Russia tastes are these ads trying to reach topic in our society with rubles and Facebook decided to ignore it and didn't want to didn't want to understand\nThey're just as just as the tobacco companies had a difficult time connecting tobacco with cancer social media is gonna have a difficult time connecting unfettered content and not spinning their advertisers\nWith bad things I think if you broke up Facebook into for companies Facebook what's happening around the messenger one or more of them would decide that to appeal to advertisers because there was greater competition they would make a requisite investments\nTo ensure their platform would not be weaponized by bad actors there's a lot of advertisers who are civic minded and would like to not advertise on Facebook but right now they don't have any choice because it's a do awfully Google and Facebook command two thirds of all digital marketing so competition is absolutely be answered\nHere Scott Galloway where do people find out more about ... obviously they can buy your book before but what do you run a website as well\n\n\n\n\nEvery morning breaking news and talk you can trust this is the answer with Brian put Jennifer

referendum\nShe is the referendum so voted for him or he promises he living walking talking referendum he promises to eliminate the high speed rail he'll join us at six fifty called a mile and\nA lot about ten minutes from now we'll talk to Carl and about Fifteen minutes he's the guy behind\nThese rallies a candidate for California Governor John Cox comes along at seven fifty and we look for you got plenty of room and a ... donuts and plenty of town right next door and I got to be a great how good could he be we've got we've got yes we've got election swag and doughnuts in coffee\nThat's a recipe for success that's a recipe for a wave of some sort of effort for two guys like you and me I have a political literature coffee and doughnuts absolutely to me that's a weekend\nThis is a this is it yeah the yes on sex and you made a good point in November six think yes on sex I like to isolate gray\nNovember six yes on six reveal the gas tax and not only are you repealing the gas tax this is an important\nElement of the proposition that was passed that now is on the November ballot is not only are you are peeling the gas tax you're also repealing Sacramento's ability to pass a gas tax again in the dark of night it's got to go to the people because that is a constitutional amendment\nThat is part of this or a part of this deal\nThat language is incorporated into the proposition that we're asking people to vote yes on and it's fun scares me to do this rally with on Dix this morning 'cause when you have a rally you want to be of like mind\nAnd uh yeah I'm a proud liberal I'm a I'm a nice guy who happens to be a Democrat they called me the lovable liberal round here but for a long time I've been I I've been somebody who's been against the gas tax so I feel completely comfortable rallying high fiving and even forming a mosh pit with you folks if you want to come in and really get wild it is\nActually it does feel a little like a an out of body experience sitting next to someone that holds a number of diametrically opposed political views and here we are on the same side of the said this is proof that you can have consensus you can't have conversation with someone who's political beliefs are\nWe're we're living examples of that yeah we are when we say to vote yes on prop six and when we talk about repealing the California gas tax and we're holding our lives rally and broadcast\nThis morning from the parking lot of the Walmart super center right here on north victory in Burbank near the Wendy's near the Krispy Kreme Best Buy is right on the other side of the a lovely greenery there and Men's Wearhouse I think you know where we are\nI'm One of the one of the one of the arguments is that um [noise]\nCalifornia should be more affordable than it is grocery prices on the rise gasoline I talked to a friend who pay four dollars\nAnd thirty cents a gallon and uh and he was that he was at the end you know he was ready to run so you had to pull up the whole or a car and it's not necessarily but a big car cost them a lot of money I mean it's just a ... and the guy drives a truck for a living is so we're talking about a lot of money here this is\nThis is this is you know like if you're a very well to do person who doesn't have the concerns are that most of us typical I don't wanna say normalcy I don't like that term but typical average statistically average Californians\nOr don't have the wallet for four and a half dollars a gallon for gasoline well especially\nIf you're a commuter out in the Inland Empire in the ... in the range of am five Ninety there are a lot of people that wake up in the morning and they look forward to an hour hour and a half two hour commute\nAnd both to and from work and that is a lot now you're talking they talk about it being an extra seven hundred dollars a year is what this gas tax uh translates to in terms of what it costs each and every one of us just to fill up\nBut if you're a commuter if you're somebody to spend that little extra time another hour and a half you know to a commute doesn't matter how far you're driving 'cause you're still in the car running the engine\nThat that translates even more money\nHow many gallons of gas do you think is a is used when you commute from the I eat done\nTo come here for example today to fill in for Jennifer Horn on our morning answer was a fifty mile drive and of course at four AM in the morning that's an honest fifty minutes so I could I could actually make it it's a pleasure to drive the Gulf War by the way folks if you want a tip on how to avoid traffic\nGet up early you can go to work and then and take a book to read sit in the parking lot read our cars okay as long as I Know that while you're driving no I I I Want to amend that if you want to to avoid traffic on says get up early in the morning no no\nIt's called the middle of the night she people when we do the ... I'd rather be in my ... year number seven\nPeople have said a bright you get up really early I correct in ... with a smile of course I said no no no I get up in the middle of the night\nAnd there's a big difference between I write five AM\nIs getting up early in the morning anything before five I called the middle of the night absolutely but if you get up early you can avoid all the traffic yes fifty miles so that translates for me I drive a Jeep Grand Cherokee I get about twenty miles to the gallon okay that's a that's a three gallon drive and three dollars are closest call at\nFour dollars a gallon to make it easy to make it makes your ... this time in the morning\nThe rain is now I got a yeah you do not wired to do the math at six AM you charge and the thing about Brian during his impersonation that you have to know that when he does it\nHis face literally transforms into George Bush does that that's part doing a good a a good impersonation ... I think so I mean I've always done the physicality along with the voice so it costs me twelve bucks to get over here yeah right okay uh so we are live cut on by we're kicking it off and the weather it's it's kinda nice it's cold\nAnd what a nice change and we had to deal with yeah absolutely it's not hot it's a great day to a a turn the kids on to some political activism on the way to school as you're on the way to work come to Burbank north victory but Walmart super center look for the vote against her alive and look for the big yellow bus\nJury that says I told her body zooming in right

vote yes and get rid of it\nThere are an awful lot of Californians who planned to build the other way the polls show it's going to be a close vote on this pop\nAnd some people say Carl and I actually sometimes you know look I agree the state of California needs resources for much needed infrastructure improve agreed and they need to get those funds from somewhere I tell people bridges don't rebuild themselves by themselves\nOr the government has to fund that show to the people here in our morning answer and hearing this lavish rally and broadcast to repeal the gas tax\nWho are requiring and saying well hold on a second where does the money come from to fix this free that my car bottomed out on last week half way to work what do you say to that\nWhen I say as you've already paid for those those repairs the money has been stolen it has been diverted it has been wasted and we actually have an alternative plan on the website that shows and these aren't my numbers these are the nonpartisan legislative analyst office that scored our a proposal\nWhere if you take a hundred percent of the existing lowered gas tax once you pass prop sexy of a lower gas will still have the fourth highest cats act in the country so you're still paying through the nose will still be getting ...\nAnd and you take a hundred percent that money put into the roads that's a net increase annually a to point three billion dollars for road projects above and beyond what the politicians are\nGetting us in terms of crumbs right now plus we take the sales tax on cars existing sales tax on cars to put in all other forms of transportation\nNet seven point nine billion dollars proof find without a tax increase how do you do it you tell the politicians get your damn hand out a cookie jar and you're like yes on November six to repeal prop six done Dick\nCold you mentioned that your sign your swag the yes on six lawn signs are in then supply everywhere except for\nWhere we are today yes but if the

the conscience you know so we did as you say vote for you is actually a boat to absolutely get rid of the high speed rail if you're elected controller\nYes uh because a lot of times most of the times even your audience listening doesn't understand what the controller does and the controller is elected in the state many states they're not\nBut the reason why there is the chief taxpayer wash up their number one priority is to root out corruption waste fraud and abuse and when payments don't comply with a lot of their duty to go ahead and stop that so when we take a look at\nWhich was the authorizing age it back in two thousand eight\nJust looking at three simple things won the state was going to pay for most of us to have a matching funds from the federal government in the private

continuing this rally to vote yes on six and repeal the gas tax am I right my friend that your schedule is so packed\nIt is literally we were in the forty five foot bus behind us because we made it a working campaign office\nWas asking a staff member I say oh did we get that out he said yes that was yesterday morning I said oh it seemed like it was four or five days ago that they are very long but we're getting the message out in every part of the state and and uh you know these rallies are really part of our our effort\nTo get people the material they need to influence the vote amongst their neighbors and their friends\nAnd on and I were talking about this a break\nUm people even a Democrat enclaves are finding great common ground yet with other Democrats who say yeah this is a unfair regressive tax it hurts the little guy we ought to give them enough money I'm going to vote yes and so this may be the one time when you can actually agree with\nOne of your friends who you always vehemently get into passionate arguments about well this\nThis is the moment Carl for Don and and me uh because uh I'm a proud liberal right some call me the lovable liberal I just had another a lovable liberal who's a morning answer listener\nApproach me off the air during the break he said Brian come on what are they doing over there to get you to say yes on sex I said my friend I've always been opposed to the gas tax because I'm thinking about families with children and uh and and I know the funds has to be raised Carl we talked about this last hour\nI'm all for infrastructure I actually support Donald Trump and his\nRather aggressive plans to improve infrastructure nationwide actually support that\nA lot of Republicans don't but most Democrats do and I do but on the gas tax I just feel that we in Southern California are victims\nOf the geography we need cars to get to work to get the kids to school to put dinner on the table to support our families to seek these funds for the government to see these funds at a fairly vulnerable point the gas pump I think is wrong headed and that's why I proposed\nAnd we already pay enough prior to the increase we had the fourth highest gas tax and the country I have the highest gas ... and people don't understand this is not going to be on auto pilot you know that it increases every single year big jump next year it's the only tax\nIt's like one of those zombie films never dies it never stops along a medically grows a girl and there is no sunset there's ... and so it is a terrible terrible tax program\nAnd we need to say no you have enough money to spend the money the existing money we already give you a sufficient amount on the road so we can have the best roads in the country we we lay out or alternative plan on line at gas tax repeal dot org\nJust by putting a hundred percent of the existing lowered gas hacked into the roads to point three million dollars and by the way we also document the waste fraud and abuse of our existing gas tax fund saw the ...\nIs with us sort of one of the masterminds behind this campaign to vote yes on sex and for your information it's complicated and the language of the proposition could fool a voter who hasn't been informed\nA yes vote on prop six when you get there if you vote in person on November sex a yes vote on prop six repeals the California gas tax and we've got lawn signs in free bumper stickers here this morning live in Burbank\nIn the parking lot of the Walmart super center my question for you call is this\nA because I don't know the answer and if I don't know it and we talked about on the radio all the time I'm sure some people hearing the show might not know the answer\nTo this is the yes on ... campaign is successful and we repeal the California gas tax what is in it what what a safety measures are in it to prevent the people in Sacramento from coming back in a few years with kind of another\nVersion of a gaffe that well it's a great question we actually I'm a put together a constitutional amendment this isn't just a repeal of their dirty deed\nIt prohibits them from increasing the car a gas tax in the future without a vote of the people and that can be a simple majority but they have to make a case to the people that they somehow need more money and I don't think that case can be made but at least we got that protection you mentioned the confusion on the ballot I Want to return to that\nIf you open up your ballot book you will not find gas atrophy on the ballot and it shocked people when they find that out in fact I've had a lot of angry people calling said Carl you said the gas tax repeal is on the ballot I Can't find it I said\nI say yeah we're dealing with the problem the politicians at the last second before ballots are printed took a ... pen struck the word gas tax repeal off of the title of the ballot which was the official title\nAnd all the it's a three cents initiative it's not like it's hard to not complicated and and so they struck that down and they were replaced it with a very confusing poll tested\nA series of words that that are designed to ... making anything but gas tax repeal it says ... eliminates road repair funds which is not true by the way a and and so we've got to\nPoint out that there's an error on your ballot is I tell people say it that way tell your neighbor there is an error on your ballot look carefully at ... six the title is wrong just read the three sentences of what the mission of does and you'll realize it's the gas encourage extra fuel and you know what it is\nThat is what it is you mentioned earlier that you have a very busy day busy week leading up to November six tells a little bit about your day what's on your next to me I tend to raise so that listeners in other areas might be able to connect with you\nSo that the official stops on the bus to work today are here in Burbank or off the five freeway north victory at the Walmart it's not it's really easy to see us\nAnd then we go over to Long Beach or for a press conference in a rally at eleven thirty then we're out in were exactly that ah it's on our website but shoreline yacht club okay we're in the parking lot and then we're going to be at those law goes\nIn riverside drive around in the river say area of you're driving down the Fifteen if you're anywhere in the corona area

right now\nPropositions on our ballots I got my sample ballot in the mail last week and of course I sit there and read through it because I you know the social calendar is pretty thin so I read everything on the sample ballot and it can be tricky and folks for your information\nThis is a tricky one when you look at proposition six when you vote on November six it won't say anything about repealing the gas tax but that is the proposition that repeals the gas tax and if you want to repeal the gas tax it requires a yes vote on ... yes absolutely [noise]\nIt really does because that you know a dies in Sacramento they changed the title of the proposition politicians will do this literally took confused butter which\nIs why we also need a new at a new attorney general along with secretary of state along with gosh the controller so and John Cox who's going to be coming up\nHere shortly Yeah John ... is a few moments away here on your morning answer look for the big yellow bus

time by the way uh for the people at the DMV that's a cool thing people it is a very cool thing incompetence and government there we go yeah that's right no that's what you're going after let's talk about the gas tax we had exposed and will continue to expose\nJohn ... how confusing the ballot is proposition six it doesn't say gas tax but that is the gas tax if you vote yes on ... repeals the gas tax as a candidate for governor and a guy who understands what's going on in Sacramento what is it about the gas\nTax that you think when you talk to voters has really touched a nerve because we've been on the radio here for a long time and taxes propositions come along many of them don't get a lot of attention or or conjure up a lot of emotion this one really has to what do you attribute that\nBecause it hits so many for gotten Californians I mean I Can't tell you how many people I have met in all my travels in this campaign who have said to me\nYou know Mr talked we can't fill up our tank anymore gasoline is now close to four dollars a gallon in some parts of the state it's over four dollars a gallon\nAnd and people just look at it that and it just it's more money out of their pockets they're already having a terrific problem paying rent because the housing prices and rent prices are so darn high and then you know and then they move\nFarther and farther away from their a job because they can't find apartments that they can wreck that's reasonably priced\nAnd then the legislature in a stunning act of just you know failure to listen to the voters goes in puts another gas tax on those hardworking forgotten California's it happened on new Gavin Newsom watch\nHe agrees with the gas tax he agrees with lining the pockets of the contributors to Jerry Brown and the legislature we're going to repeal this gas taps and we're\nTo send a statement around the world that we've been taxed\nEnough already John Cox is the Republican candidate for California Governor on November six he is on the ballot his opponent is Gavin gruesome I'm Sorry I knew some\nAnd a ... you just took the words right out of my mouth yes haven't is gruesome Don ... says here for the vacationing Jennifer Horn says the slick guy that warming Don no yeah but again\nI was about a slick here he he takes like do a whole new level you're kind of a really good policy guy down you really know what you're doing maybe run for office sometimes ah come on now as governor would you hire me\nYeah well if you're gonna if you're going to cut spending and ... ... that's all I Know how to do is cut cut cut cut cut this and ask him a question\nQuestion as well as governor you're going to do something very different than Gavin Newsom will do Gavin Newsom has a track record into visible track record it's a track record that the citizens of San Francisco get to deal with every single day as they get off of barred walk into their jobs\nThey have a little they have a little of course they have to dodge people that are sitting in the hallways of the ...\nI was going to say they don't actually walk they have to hop Scott's around the pilots right around the around\nThe pilots but also talking about the people that are that the the homeless problem to gather new some broad promised that he was going to remedy and he did he promised that two thousand four and it's two thousand Eighteen fourteen years later he had four year buffer and his own timeframe he didn't do it\n... you know this is just another failed promise of Gavin Newsom which is what he promises for the people of California\nEarlier this campaign for governor is a job interview and you have to figure out who you're going to hire to be the leader of the state for the next four years right\nLook at what his record as he got an office all full of himself and he's going to get rid of homelessness in four or eight years give them eight years he spent a billion and a half dollars\nTrying to get rid of that problem and what is it today it is way way worse than it ever has been conventions are canceling in San Francisco is right people are putting full page ads in the local newspaper saying watch your back\nBecause people have to worry about somebody going after them they're dodging hyper during make needles and up piles of human waste and this was a guy who wants to promotion contrast that I've had a forty year career\nStarting from nothing no sugar daddy to help me and I built a business based upon results based upon achievement based upon delivering every single day and that is what I'm going to do for the people\nDennis there's a tactic where you can pursue what's called requests for admissions many trees just don't use this but we submitted many requests but they didn't even respond to at the at the outcome if\nThe other side does not respond in a timely fashion you can ask the court to deemed those requests be admitted as a consequence we had all sorts of admissions now

among them come by to the gas tax the guy right here up my gosh it's two hours ago about a nice gentleman I said what's your motivation\nA he said well I'm against the gas tax and I said why and he said Brian I own service stations and he said All right I'm looking out for my customers he said that that is the cost is outrageous for a gallon of gasoline we have someone\nIn the Inland Empire that owns the largest arco station in California might maybe perhaps the country well and he is doing the same in fact he is so incensed that he's actually now running for political office and the sixty four it's assembly district his name is Ali Missouri\nAnd he's running for office this has got him that fired up the people in the Inland Empire or the or or commuters\nAnd they're suffering under this under this law they're the ones that are going to pay the bulk of it and it's aggressive tax Brian ... means that the people that make the less money or the most impact\nIs you know we had a last hour a junior morning answer listener Elizabeth she she was so\nCharming and very smart and articulate we had her on the air folks twelve year old told us that this gas tax is bad for mom and dad's wallet that's right a twelve year old told us that's it so I ... a repeal of the gas tax uh according to the stats and our friend called the ... who will talk to and a few minutes\nShades of the California average family of four or five hundred bucks a month\n... ... a year for a year a year\nWe get a lot of people actually if we if we did what the state that which is that if we did what the state bureaucrats did did the wording in yes on prop section we stood on the radio when you said you're going to say five hundred dollars a month\nWe will be doing the same thing that they're doing that we're not going to do that now we're going to correct it when we when we know it's just like they should correct the wording on the ballot initiative it's five hundred dollars a year\nAnd the truth is they won't corrected because the wording on your ballot for proposition ... was amended to be confusing yes and that to me and\nI look I'm a proud liberal that to me is inexcusable the people in Sacramento charged with honest and fair elections and setting them up and executing honest and fair elections when they are working\nAgainst the voters in a disinformation campaign to try to literally changed the name of a proposition so that you are confused when you read it\nAt your polling place is inexcusable\nWill it is it's inexcusable and it's further inexcusable that they're using tens of millions of dollars of our tax money of the money that the bureaucrats in the politicians in Sacramento or have of ours\nIn order to promote this initially by putting signs on the road these big sides that are nowhere near construction projects at a cost of thousands of dollars per sign for each a song for each shot\nThey're putting these on the road to encourage people to uh to deceive them yeah actually to to see but there's there saying SP one of the scientists are showing them that there is a project in the area where there is no project\nWell uh that's why we're here and that's

proposition that we encourage you to vote yes on prevents them from doing that it\nDoes and these policies in addition to everything we just said I mean I think that what we've just said is enough\nTo

one thing if we had been paying money\nTo ah keep our roads maintain ended up at and that money had been used to that and there was a genuine shortfall\nThis isn't this is a manufactured crisis
