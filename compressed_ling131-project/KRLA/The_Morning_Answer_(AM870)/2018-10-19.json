defeating America's enemies with\nFor tickets before they some of the um eight Seventy dot and fall and your data\nI mean some of the answer to hear somebody the last one of your friends to have a donut stores or Google Play curious all around town\nAbout your marriage or your with Dr Larry on we're talking about the Senate or the United states in our ongoing Hillsdale dialogues all things Hillsdale\nCollected Hillsdale dot edu all of our conversations including the last many about the constitution certainly will go on to the bill of rights but we're not we're moving along at a at a Larry or like pay switches deliberate that's a nice way to get\nA we're talking about the Senate today and in the last segment Dr later on I made the statement that the Senate I bet that the people must rule eventually\nTo which left his critics like this fellow from GQ would respond but the Senate prevents the majority of from rolling so I'd like you to expand on on how in fact the majority will work its will as it did in the thirties it just take some time\nThat trade well so you know obviously if there's if there's a public opinion\nSo [noise]\nSo Madison many in there to supply places in the federalist where Madison's a describes what will be achieved by the constitution and in the fifty first federalist forty ninth I Can't remember now sorry he says I'm\nA a\nIt is the reason alone of the people that should be placed in control of the government their passion should be controlled by it\nNow how do you achieve that well you spread authority across the country that is what the Senate does\nBut then the second thing is even bigger than that and this thing just the whole structure of the constitution if he were the argument to get rid of the Senate is an argument to get rid of the whole constitution\nBecause the house has represented from districts every two years and the Senate is elected for six years from states and the president is elected nationally every four years and then a lot of the power is is lodged in the states\nAnd they have lots of different systems right\nAnd that means to get a big dramatic thing done you have to ... you have to ask the people their opinion over a series of elections\n[laughter] isn't it it's just that you just gave the game away though yeah it's an attack on the constitution right it's not really an attack on the Senate it's an attack on the constitution hold their whole thing and and the to the end of what that's what we really got to get to wire people attacking the Senate in order to attack the constitution what is the motive Larry are what is their objectives\nWell the cat the attack on the constitution started with the rise what live you know they've been several there was one on slavery became a big deal people decided they loved it under the influence by the way of a bunch of ... ideas of the evolution foreign to the founding of America\nThey they then they were attacking the constitution\nAre supporting it you know abolitionists would attack the cops it does it protect slavery a southerners wanted more Confederate white more slavery would attack it because it doesn't give us enough protection for our slaves in the territories\nRight so these things are not new but the current one starts in the Eighteen eighties nineties ... Wilson is a big author and what he says is this regime of checks and balances\nIt's a it's a like Newton like his picture of the universe but now we have Darwin and we know that government is living organism and has to change right so the progressive movement is very impatient\nWith this because the effect and people should understand is right the effect of the constitution is to make public opinion\nPowerful in a sustained way in the and even today where the government has its limits on more than half of the economy right even today it does matter so very much what the people think\nAnd to sustain that and get that that is what the constitution does but their idea that progressive Joe Wilson for example what he thinks is experts people who know people can apply science to public policy should become much more influential in the government\nAnd that's what gives rise to this fourth branch of government which now makes most of our laws and in forces them and and educate them in their independence it hundred and fifty or so independent agencies\nThat that's where all that came from and it is by the way a changing the nature of suffer\nBecause sovereignty came in the in the American revolution according to the nature of the individual than you're born a person you're not on a horse or a dog and so you have to be by your nature government only with your consent\nThe new way as we have power over nature now and if we use science and knowledge\nWe can perfect society and people who have that science and that knowledge they become a new kind of suffering and so of course the competition must be swept away because it's specific\nAchievement is it it keeps the people in control of the government for a long time\nElections on November six we talked a lot about November six yesterday and are live broadcast from the Walmart parking lot in Burbank or yes on prop six\nTimes to repeal the California gas tax rally want to thank the shores of mourning after listeners who showed up for their free lawn signs and all of their\nYes on six paraphernalia we had a great life show thanks to everybody who came out we talked a lot about that date November six that is the date of the midterms up to date\nThe California hopefully votes to repeal the gas tax that's the day we picked a new governor in California and President Trump Don ... said for forty days you would be campaigning for forty days before the midterms\nAnd I haven't run the numbers exactly but it appears as if he's kept that promise because he's always out doing these rally campaign stops\nHis stamina on the campaign trail is other worldly I noticed this during the ... the run up into the election two thousand sixteen four five six campaign events I think in the day and the two days leading up to the fact that there are days where you'd seven rallies that is a gargantuan\nEffort president was out yesterday in Montana home of Greg gee in forty you remember Greg gene forty the body slamming congressman\nWho have picked up that reporter from the guardian I Believe and choke slammed him down onto a table president actually references Greg Gianforte before Montana crowd here that in a couple of moments but a first off President Trump last night\nIn Montana comparing a his comparison of course between Republicans and Democrats\nChoice to not be more clear Democrats\nProduce a mob\nRepublicans for this job\nWhat in the world does that mean ... ... jobs versus jobs no one mobs do Democrats of produce\nThe mobs like the one that appeared in corona last night [laughter] I don't think he was talking about he was not but mobs you know at the at restaurants mobs at restaurants mobs up in Portland mobs of people throughout America that are are against this president\nYou mean the you mean demonstrators the demonstrators are now called mobs like the resist movement the peaceful protesters of course the overwhelming majority of them are who get out there they're they're mobs now they're\nThey're not I think I think they get colored in by the people that actually act like Bob's\nMm it's unfortunate because there what is there was a time when a we respected our First Amendment and people got out there to demonstrate exactly right we're lauded and ah sometimes given accolades for their exercising of the first amendment there was a time there was a time here's Trump more Trump and Montana\nA pond during a presidential reelection campaign against democratic candidate Joseph Biden here's President Trump\nHow 'bout sleepy Joe Biden slippage you don't fight and that was fine [noise] that one I said it wouldn't last long it'd be down faster than Greg would take 'em down\n[noise] [noise] All right\nPresident Trump referring to Greg there That's Greg G and forty now he gets to it and this is an interesting one and on a friday will mix it up here a little bit with our six o'clock club done Dixon for Jennifer Horn couple of things have happened or in the last year or so\n... forty a horrified many but a tacit league got a wink and a nod and a thumbs up from some Republicans who wouldn't say out loud\nThat uh what he did was wrong or they say what he did was wrong but they were sort of smiling about it when he picked up the reporter at his campaign headquarters was asking him questions picked him up and subtle aimed them down\nAnd then a couple of months after that something much more terrible happened on the baseball field back east where Steve ... was shot and then the country had a sobering serious conversation about violence in politics and how violence can never be celebrated and those who who commit acts of violence\nA must be must be a rabid\nOut of a political debate and the whole process\nAnd it was people like guy who said well what about Greg gene for you guys seem to cheer him and everybody's all know what he did was wrong but he was on a listen here President Trump is back into the Greg gene forty smile and a wink mode in Montana so I was wrong\nA lot of the leaders from other countries is talking about all sorts of things that I heard about it that way indoors very early\nBut I had heard that he body slammed the reporter\nWas way\nWay up and I said oh this was like\nOh the election or just before and I said oh this is terrible elections and I said well wait a minute I Know Montana pretty well\nI think it might help him [noise] ah is a great guy looking\nLike a great guy tough cookie okay he's a grudge and forty who committed violence against the reporter who was a uh doing his job under the first amendment free press member picked up and choke slams in a A N e before the election as far as I recall ... how do you compute the president's comments there last night I I find them outrageous so I Would\nRather not say those kinds of things but he did\nAnd he did because we're in a political environment where you've got both parties in most cases I think the recent memory of what unfolded during the Kavanaugh hearings where you had people acting like a you know yelling from the gallery is they're trying to take the vote for judge Kavanaugh\nIs that appropriate behavior no he's not body slamming the reporter\nThe difference between saying things and and hurting\nPeople and and and what is the intent of the of the process that unfolded against cabinet there are a lot of things that are have contributed to a a heightened political environment where\nThis kind of stuff is okay where you have people like Maxine Waters saying you know go to wherever they are confront them uh you know we have Ted Cruz being yelled out of a restaurant but then you have Hillary Clinton\nIn an civil behaviors okay\nWell we'll hold a okay uncivil behavior so I'm asking you dont to focus on what the president said about Reggie in forty a and he said uh well like the ... it actually might help them I Know Montana and then the crowd applauds they're applauding Reggie in forty they're applauding\nOr the president's a conclusion about the candidate choked slamming\nA reporter uh there was there was not much for in Republican quarters shed against ... at the time then again as I said a moment ago Steve ... release\nThe tragedy of a congressman being shot thank goodness he's recovering and seems to be doing well he's back at work amen prayers are answered the country got very serious about violence after the shooting on the on the ball field\nNow here we are in October have we done forgotten all that and we're back to celebrating the violence committed by congressman gene forty\nWell again I Would rather ... rather Donald Trump did not said that but again you have the attorney general the former attorney general saying when a when they go low kick him\nI mean the the the the call to action that has occurred and in our politics is not a call to action to civil behavior and we see this time and time again and it's it's getting it's getting ugly unfortunately\nYeah last question I Would have to be my friend on this issue is from home in the country should we expect the highest standard of behavior and\nThe person that that is the at the head of the at the head of our country that\nWas a ... what are the United states so for him to be a to get the crowd cheering Reggie and forties actions and saying it was helpful thing that gene forty did a back on the eve of his election to the Congress\nOne I did the same [laughter]\nWhy not use it for like you got to fame down here just body from the from the U.S [noise] get\nOkay so that was what it sounded like when we first learnt than I'm Greg gene forty so ah more about that the president a final clip here ah for our six o'clock club members of the president's rally in Montana last night there was a lighter note where I think a lady screams I Love you and the president goes out of his way to find out who that is\nThe Democrats turn I Love you too [noise]\n\n[noise] it's\nFinally a woman you know I get it from the mental\n[noise]\nEvery guy that said I Love you just not my time\n[laughter] [noise] I finally earned it from a woman thank you [noise] All right\nThe president last night keeping up his promise that he's rallying he is campaigning during these midterm elections all the way into what do we have Nineteen days to go down\nNineteen days before the big day November six yes on six

mean this this government has cleaned that it's a reformist government now that they're reforming Saudis you know evil quote unquote way\nAnd this this appearance I think the appeal to the media to answer your question a briefly\nThe appeal to the media is that this mysterious disappearance heightened and sort of made more mysterious by the footage of the journalists being seen in the consulate\nHas the has the makings of an old fashioned who'd done it but you're right geopolitically and focusing on Saudi Saudi Arabia and and and the reforms that they offer rhetoric about from within their own government\nSeems that that rhetoric seems to be blown out of the water by these actions if indeed the action and the action would be murdering a\nJournalist working for the Washington Post different data happened\nYes I had a complicated relationship with the u._s. you go back to the nine eleven attacks there was a lot of criticisms of the of the George Bush administration for the way that even relatives of Islam a bin Laden who are living here we are handled in jettisoned out of the U.S in the hours after the attack\nAnd I remember how we all of our heads churned what we saw that picture of President George W. Bush are former president a holding hands or with the with the prince and sought Iran's\nRival bomb of bowing to the Saudi friends actually right so this is a longstanding complicated relationship and part of what we're dealing with now unfortunately is the geopolitical a challenges of the relationship with Iran who is that you know on a war on a path to nuclear\nNuclear is Asian potentially because the J.

certainly the U.S President Trump's\nA reaction to the disappearance of a journalist who worked for the Washington Post ... we're into our third week now since she disappeared inside the Saudi consulate inside of the nation of turkey this a Washington Post columnist\nA entered the Saudi conflict which is in Istanbul never to be seen again\nThe president was asked yesterday if ... ... the journalist is dead\nPresident Trump said and I'll quote the president it certainly looks that way to me it's very sad closed quote and then he was questioned about consequences for Saudi Arabia if it's found to be involved in his killing President Trump said and I'll quote the president again well it'll have to be severe I mean it's bad bad stuff\nWe'll see what happens okay close quote\nA President Trump a that's a that's a harshest rhetoric we heard from President Trump with regard to the Saudis now the the news item you need to know which broke last night Thursday night maybe you're already in bed or\nOut with the kids are uh maybe having a lovely dinner with your wife or your spouse or your boyfriend or girlfriend maybe you did that maybe you did something fun last night there was a report from ABC News that our secretary of state Mike Pompeo who done we've talked about has been to Saudi Arabia to talk to the crown prince and\nThe king he's been in meetings with Turkish officials all about the disappearance of Jamal could show gay\nAnd according to ABC News a Turkish official claims that our secretary of state Mike Pompeo hurt a recording\nOf ... suspected murder and it was also given a transcript as well a couple of days ago Mike Pompeo was asked if he heard the recording and he said on Wednesday quote I don't have anything to say about that close quote\nAfter ABC News went public with their story or publish their story\nWhen somebody says I don't have anything to say about that does that lead you to believe that they know something are often it can yeah I Do feel that way but it's it's striking to me when somebody says I don't have anything to say about that it doesn't mean he doesn't know anything about it\nSo I think the state department tried to do their part last night after the ADC news bulletin and Heather Nauert spokeswoman at the state department said and I quote ms now or secretary palm pale has neither heard a tape nor has he seen a transcript related to ... to show these disappearance close quote will\nThe New York times is reporting audio offers gruesome details of Jamal ... killing Turkish officials say and\nBy the way the details are but just going to tell you because it's information uh the the story suggests or or the ... the media reports suggest that the journalist was killed and then dismembered\n[noise] yeah and ... and ... and does that say that they listen to the tape who have given comments about it uh offer a very gruesome uh accounting of this but\nSo when you have when you have a variety of different news agency starting to weigh in that there is this audio tape that people have heard it\nUh it does lead you to believe that it's out there and you would think that the U.S who is taking an interest in this uh killing you know you don't send my palm pay the secretary of state over to that area of the country if it's not an important issue to the United states\nPalm pale told reporters a this week yesterday I Believe a little bit about his meeting with Saudi officials and what he shared with President Trump\nHad a chance to talk with him in Riyadh with looking around for I've told President Trump this morning that we ought to give them a few more days\nTo complete that so that we do\nTo wait on setting up a vast surrounding back which point we can make decisions about how the United states should respond that secretary\nOf state Mike Pompeo well of course if the worst case scenario is true and uh I'm presuming it is so so I'm a full disclosure on on making a presumption or if it's true\nIf a ... a Jamal ... was killed by a by Saudi officials are the Saudi Government inside of the consulate if he was dismembered if there's a tape of this uh this is the this is an act\nThat ah the United states of all countries on the planet a should should or\nShould should counter or in the strongest possible terms fish would be the killing of a of a of a of a journalist ... of of of a free journalist and then we regard of course I'm a despite the rhetoric we still have a First Amendment in this country or that upholds a journalist and a free press uh\nYou're right down deaths in pointing out earlier this morning sure other journalists have been killed but that does not diminish ah the situation involving Mr ...\nHere it is interesting though that this is getting so much attention and I think part of the reason is because this entails a nexus between national security\nOr the relationship between Saudi Arabia in the United states has a deals with Iran it's also a ... at the crossroads of this I'm a planned in ... in infusion of capital from a variety of different or the industry the entertainment industry is called off\nA plans to deal directly with Saudi Arabia for the development of entertainment property they're planning to build a whole new city all of that you had a and now to the new should withdraw from an economic summit\nThat's right and to even personalize it further I mean there are reports that Jared Kushner has a personal relationship\nWith the with the crown prince and Saudi Arabia who's a very controversial and very unstable ruler and and you have also of the Saudi royal family when they come to the U.S they say Trump properties so the President Trump's rhetoric about Saudi Arabia\nOr has been damp and if you will to my ears so maybe other people are hearing it differently but oh so you're not and so you agree with me\nNo I mean I'm saying that there is that out there he ... this was the first country he visited as president so you you've also got the fact that Saudi Arabia is representing that they're going through a reformation\nAnd ... show he was very critical of that reformation as well so an describing it as an authentic is it really happening or isn't it and I think in order for these with these different industries to want to do business with Saudi Arabia\nThey have to understand that there is this reformation coming if it wasn't happening then they ... they would call off this investment\nContinue to follow the story as it develops the disappearance of a jerk\nIt was ... a columnist for the Washington Post inside the Saudi consulate inside a in Istanbul in the in the country of turkey more ... more details and tough talk yesterday from President Trump\nA on this issue and and what should happen in response if indeed\nAre the worst case scenario is true we're into the third week where the journalist is missing and he has not been found as we continue on the morning answer finally a

Don buckle up for it because it's a doozy on a friday around here and you get in a lot of people it's awesome\nYeah we don't train the calls and you've got one and one thought only a yesterday President Trump\nA shorter toughened his toughened up his language with regard to Saudi Arabia as evidence mounts over the disappearance of ... a columnist a reporter\nWho worked for the Washington Post when we last saw Jamal to show the he was walking in to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey and we had a I guess so much surveillance footage or just you know security camera footage and we see the the columnist walk into the Saudi constantly\nAnd then you never see him again and you don't hear from him and now we're into the third week of he is a\nMissing status and the president was asked yesterday by reporters outside the White House\nIs ... is dead President Trump said and I quote it certainly looks that way to me it's very sad closed quote the president was questioned about consequences for Saudi Arabia if Saudi Arabia is found to be involved in his killing President Trump said and I quote the president\nWill it'll have to be severe I mean it's bad bad chef we'll see what happens okay close quote a all of this is going on in the aftermath of a secretary of state Mike Pompeo Don ... making a trip to Saudi Arabia and meeting with Turkish officials about the disappearance of the journalists ...\nI'm a I'm a little intrigued now with what turkey has a Turkish officials are embarking on in order to solve this mystery\nThey've actually gone out to a bell grad forests on a farm land out there to see what they can find a wonder what it is that's directed Turkish officials to go investigate in forests and farmland in order to try and solve the mystery of what's happened\nTo his body well I mean obviously I is the answer is I don't know I don't think anybody you\nKnow we don't know ... ... ... you said earlier this week we have more questions and we have answers about this sure\nAh but ah but your curiosity and wondering about the tip that would lead them out into some farmland again this is a this is a ... this is fact in information the reports suggest that um has not confirmed so this was an information about the reports here at the end it's a little gruesome so I'll do it fast\nThey say that the reporter was murdered and then dismembered\nAre so they're looking for a for the body or we're obviously but at that they're looking to find this person or who has been missing now for I Want to say sixteen days or Fifteen or sixteen days done\nWhat led them in this direction is the fact that two cars there were Fifteen individuals now that are being applied as possible a conspiratorial ... in the disappearance individuals whose passports show having checked in\nTo turkey within the last twenty within the previous twenty four hours to his disappearance so get as close as a couple of hours and these individuals' all have linkage to the Saudi royal family in fact had been part of different\nUh ... let's just call them a guard guard Bridgette guard or a groups that guard the Saudi family ... individuals with a you know knowledge of spy craft and how to ah let's just say dispose of humans\nIs a very compelling story for a number of reasons one of the elements that is talked about\nUh occasionally which I I'll I'll shine a spotlight on here\nIs that while the reporter Jamal 'cause she'll be the columnist who wrote by the way he wrote op eds that were very much a a very much called out the Saudi royal family and the Saudi Government and called in authentic their rhetoric about reforming\nInside Saudi Arabia so ah so we understand his columns and is is is final piece was published after he went missing\nBut a really eerie and mysterious is\nUse the right word the ... uh the ... with\nWith what happened here because when the reporter went into the Saudi consulate his wife was waiting for him in the car
