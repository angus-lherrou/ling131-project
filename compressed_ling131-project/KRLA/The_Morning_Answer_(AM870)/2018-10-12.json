is in constant contact with state and local authorities in Florida Alabama Georgia South Carolina and North Carolina fame and first responders or on the ground\nAnd we have teams currently conducting search and rescue mission is by the way the coast guard has been incredible they've saved many lives working to restore power\nDelivering needed supplies\nWe will do everything in our power to\nHelp

native for Fifteen aviation outfit assets from nine other states including six helicopters helicopters from New York Mississippi Maryland and Ohio National guards I Want to thank them for that\nAs well as nine Black Hawk helicopters from New York Wisconsin Colorado Louisiana and Kansas National Guards and I want to thank them for that and\nMore on the aftermath at Florida faces after hurricane Michael hit real hard hears US Senator from Florida Marco Rubio last night on Fox\nPieces like that or a place where we just don't have any communication as we know crude search and rescue crews have been there and are going house by house but part of it it's just you know there's some of the landmarks that you would rely on in the aftermath there so I I don't know if there's any areas are completely cut off but I Am\nIs there an fortunately some people that might be in it that we won't know tripping out no way to call in on the phone\nNo Internet no way to call nine one one or or get anybody to come to them and they're not as the challenge really started out as\nUm the inability to to communicate with people who might be a need after the fact and that's where it getting this without power by the way even or even if we were able to restore communication smarter people that will be able to charge a phone as an example and be able to communicate that way so\nI think that would be my bigger concern is is being able to survey all this\nArea um it's going to pick up a bit and um so you're a great people doing everything they can but we've got a real challenge here in America or to the\nUS Senator Marco Rubio of Florida finally a statement from FEMA on the aftermath and the recovery efforts in Florida after they got hit really hard specifically in the panhandle as we said geographically speaking by hurricane Michael primary efforts\nAre going to be on search and rescue for the next to\nA couple of days we all sort of looking at the health and medical lifeline window out some hospitals out and buy county that we've got disaster medical assistance teams throughout Puerto agency had health and Human Services is assisting or the efforts there in Florida so by

twenty four\nDays away making this the perfect time for another morning mixture madness update\nRight here in California we have a race for the U.S Senate to Democrats are going at it Dianne Feinstein\nIt was held that seat for five terms I think\nA is being challenged by former state senator Kevin daily own who describes himself as a more progressive candidate\nA used more to the left than Diane Feinstein he actually although she beat him by like twelve points or or more ... more than that in the primary them he got the endorsement of the California Democratic party the polls still have Feinstein leading\nA they will be debating this is what's important and makes it a morning answer mid term madness update\nThis'll be the first I think and only debate\nBetween Senator Feinstein and Kevin daily own it happens next week on Wednesday just after twelve\nNoon yeah how where does that twelve ten PM and it'll be streamed on line\nYou know we had John Cox and Gavin Newsom debate on the radio and you know I Love radio as a medium that there's something about me that Mrs an old fashioned debate that I go home for that I watch at six o'clock at night maybe on a local news channel so I can actually see what the body language looks like it actually see if there's some real substantive issues that we can get into because I think\nBrian as a conservative in California when you have two Democrats on the ballot you got to make an educated choice if you're going to show up and vote and I want to actually I mean obviously we know Dianne Feinstein But Kevin daily on what I've heard is not great I Want him to tell me why I should vote for him instead of voting for another six years of Feinstein I thought\nYou would set a couple of weeks ago you were you're you know was a tough day for you but you are resigning yourself to the fact that you would vote for Feinstein did the cabinet controversy and the letter and the accusation\nAlthough she denied it time and time again that Feinstein leaked the identity of Dr Christine Ford and that process being bungled as many critics said it was by find songs office\nIs this all make you rethink your\nDecision like you know what I saw a man because you are gone right now\nI I absolutely reevaluated but here's the thing I actually had you know we've had to mentor madness events and we had one last night which is so much fun and you're all end up the Nixon Library the night before I\nWas in Ontario at the devil tree hotel we did a an event with Don Dixie was there and about Fifteen other candidates and Dr Dog who's a chiropractor that listens to this program every single day came up to me and he said what are we going to do in the fines and raise the ... and\n... it's a question that a lot of people have I I was going to resign myself to vote for Feinstein because she's obviously more moderate but I Want to protest her now because I Do not support the way that she handled all of this cabinet steps you weaponized information she didn't know favors for women in the state and the way she handled that so [noise]\nAh the thing is she's she's older and so if we're looking at your taking I argue about it and see now you railed against me about six months ago when I said Dianne Feinstein is true all over the I'm not actually I'm actually going to vote for her because she's too old and this is because of Kevin daily and gets elected he'll\nBe there or at least we would guess he could be there it's possible that he could be there are a lot longer than Diane Feinstein\nDianne Feinstein has maybe one more term left right you'll ... if Kevin\nDe Leon as your senator for like the rest of his adult life you'll be infuriated every time you read or hear about him because he's the polar opposite of you politic\nThat and then that's right and so that's why I guess it goes back to holding my nose and voting for Dianne Feinstein because that means there's another shot in six years or or maybe less ... not saying I'm not wishing any ill will but there's\nA you know there's just she might she might retires something might happen so this is probably why I Will ultimately make the decision to vote for die and five and even though it will infuriate me I cannot take because it will be as high as Kevin de Leon go if he could win a Senate seat in California\nThis is not a person who's going to run for president this is a person who would sit and write out a Senate seat for very long time if it was possible\nOkay want to say good morning to the aforementioned morning answer listener of the day a chiropractor Dr Doug who approached Jennifer\nIn Ontario and said what are we going to do on this Feinstein race actually said he's a chiropractor right Ira factor Dr Doug I say to you what are we

congressional candidates and one of the issues\nWas being so close just over three weeks away from election day and the midterms\nAnd one of the questions for the congressional candidates assembled on the panel before hundreds of mourning after listeners who came out\nTo get as much information as they could about these raises\nThe question was what are you guys a lot of them were Republicans what are you doing to mobilize voters to energize voters with only twenty five days ago that was yesterday until the midterms and has the Kavanaugh confirmation battle which has now not even over the battle rages on the protests\nContinue has that Jennifer mobilize Democrats more were mobilize and energize Republicans more\nI think the answer is that is both I Would say\nIt I I think there is more emotion certainly behind Democrats behind the women's march movement who his bed really they've done a great job registering voters and getting maybe people who've not voted in elections before to get excited about going out to vote Republicans have always struggled with the get out the vote effort as far as voter registrations go I've seen on\nSome of the cable news and I watch 'em all I've seen excuse me some Republicans concede that it appears as if\nDemocrats are coming out of the cabinet confirmation battle a bit more mobilized and energized to vote Republicans out then Republicans have come out uh of that battle with the energy to vote out Democrats can you can see that or do you think it's an even split\nThere are also as we're planning for a very long term recovery efforts in

the hotel the ... remain nameless I mean I I think the station is paying for this should we were getting breakfast it's quite nice or what could possibly be wrong Jennifer\nWell at all I Know it's I'm sitting here minding my own business\nAnd a Richard like who is our onsite technical guru Richards fantastic is a is coordinating the delivery of the breakfast and I hear from this one over here Brian ... says oh well first we ordered the same thing makes sure yours doesn't touch mine\nLike can you put it across the room because I don't want to accidentally take a bite out of yours or have you take a bite them [noise]\nWhich is clearly you just don't want richer eating off of your plate we all heard that we all are the underlying word from you because we know you're not worried about yourself eating off a Richard plate you actually don't have faith in Richard to keep his minutes up yet [laughter]\nActually you're right you're wrong okay give it to me you're right that I don't want Richard eating off by plane and I'm not a hundred percent certain that he won't make that mistake unless my plate is on the other side of the room from him so you're right about that\nBut you're wrong when you say I'm I have no problem eating off of Richard's like no I mean you would I say you have no problem doubting that you're not\nWhat I'm saying thinking that you were going to eat off of Richard's like this was really I'll know who is ... I Know where my food is right now in someone's getting close to it and giving me all of our our friend Don dictated by looking at your plate of food right now\nI Believe he might be breathing on it no

my plate for yours and your ... going to be in my bacon you do hear though when you hear this back you do realize that this image of craziness when you're sitting here you've got a microphone in front of your baby to Richard Move your plate across the room I don't like that you do realize that\nJust mentioned that he right I don't think it's not I think it's I think it's I think the biggest responsible I think it is responsible and I think it was for Richard benefit as well and it was not just about me it was actually Richard you feel safer now that you're across the room [laughter]\nLet him back in there I'm not quite a thank you Richard you just don't confuse that's my bagel and who were fine\nLet's get to the very serious issue of the hurricane if I Can't believe that without you obsessing about my eating habits you know President Trump a talked about the aftermath on a more serious note of hurricane Michael which was downgraded\nIt became a tropical storm remarkably it's not just Florida not just the panhandle it's a several states that have been impacted even in Virginia which is significantly north of Florida for people brown from the water brought by Michael\nYeah they ... at eleven and five of those deaths came up from Virginia and that's because for people drowned with all the standing water and another person died in a car accident it seems that the states that are really affected by that\nAre not just Florida and Georgia but also Maryland Virginia South Carolina North Carolina at Alabama\nHere's President Trump yesterday\nBefore going any further today I'd like to provide an update on hurricane Michael which made landfall along\nFlorida's great panhandle\nCredible people\nAnd then they went through a lot [noise]\nFollow day really destructive pass\nThem through Georgia and fluids in South Carolina\nThrough our prayers are with those are lost their lives\nAnd with their families and our hearts are with the thousands who were\nSustained property damage in many cases entirely wiped out\nPresident Trump continue that the White House yesterday about the aftermath and the recovery efforts underway in Florida\nAll residents showed he knew all local\nWarnings and instructions my minister ration is in constant contact with state and local authorities and for Alabama Georgia South Carolina and North Carolina fame and first responders or on the ground\nAnd we have teams currently conducting search and rescue missions by the way the coast guard has been incredible have saved many lives [noise] working to restore power\nDelivering needed supplies\nWe will do everything in our power to help those in need [noise]\nAnd we will not rest or waiver\nOnto the job is done\nAnd the recovery is complete\nHere's governor Rick Scott in Florida on the rescue effort to for the\nNational Guard has needed for Fifteen aviation outfit assets from nine other states\nIncluding six helicopters helicopters from New York Mississippi Maryland and Ohio National guards I Want to thank them for that as well as nine Black Hawk helicopters from New York Wisconsin Colorado Louisiana and Kansas National Guards evidence about and\nForgive me that's governor Rick Scott in Florida thanking other states for helping out in the rescue effort after hurricane Michael really hit the Florida Panhandle very hard this week\nSenator Marco Rubio who of course is from Florida represents the people of Florida as a U.S senator has been very prominent during this a natural disaster he was on Fox last night with Martin Mikhail I'm Talking about the issue of power loss many utility\nRate payers are without power still\nMexico reaches that over the place where we just don't have any cash crude search and rescue crews have been there and are going house by house but part of it it's just you know there's some of the landmark you would rely on in the afternoon there\nSo I I I don't know the area are completely cut off but I Am sure that there are unfortunately some people that might be in it that we won't know doctor they know where all and they're on the phone no Internet no way to call nine one one or or get anybody to come to them and then out of the challenge really I'm most concerned about it\nUm the inability to to communicate with people who might be a need after the fact and not for getting this without power by the way even or even if we were able to restore communications tomorrow there are people that won't be able to charge a phone as an example and be able to communicate that way so\nI think that would be my bigger concern is is being able to survey all the\nBarrier hum it's going to take a bit and um so you're a great people doing everything they can but we've got a real challenge here and there are part of it\nAll right Senator Rubio talking about the power last more than a million people are in another two million one point two million people in a number of states are ... are still without power or yeah Marco Rubio said this morning I just a few moments ago he said it's as bad as it gets any surveying the damage in Panama beach\nMexico beach in Florida is also just devastated it's wiped out the building everything's just levels\nAs we continue morning answer on a friday with Brian and Jennifer the other insanity that took place inside the oval office at the White House yesterday we have tapes of the freak show\nThat to happen there a starring President Trump and Kanye West will share it with you as we roll on for a friday feels good on a friday doesn't it\nIt's a sixteen [noise] cause your interest morning\nWas a really at the forefront of this is the late prince prince was somebody who really a a ferociously I I Would say a enthusiastically guarded the rights to his music but prior to the death of prince the pop star you couldn't go on YouTube you can find his song on\nThe Internet but now since he's passed away you can there on their right I don't know why that happened but it has happened\nYeah so this was a this was a big deal at the White House that's why many people are wondering what kid rock was doing there in ... they were they're all for for this and it just so happened the president's been extra time with ... who was taken apart by the media this really irritated me watching CNN does sometimes irritate me watching Don Lemon almost always irritate me but yesterday it was beyond that\nHe used the N. word in describing at ... she said this is a panel I should be clear his panels that this is what happens when and where do read\nBut he didn't uh in fairness Jennifer no fake news or I Want to be clear he said a ... a black people African Americans fifty years ago in this country were called negroes or that is not the N. word that people think\nOf federal out of style and it's inappropriate and the way they address calling us look like he didn't fare let's be fair to Don Lemon about what he thinks fair to the whole situation me\nMomma let's be fair to Don Lemon about what was said and what wasn't said the N. word in quotes in air quotes that we all think of as the N. word was not set it on\nCNN about time I Would say if you say this is a this is a man this is what happens when negroes don't read when you call him a menstrual when you do all of these things to take down the capability of cutting us this is clearly political this is not\nThis was a political takedown of ... a threatens them you have someone who has a huge following who's an African American man who has a respected a lot of young Americans and he's actually pro Trump and the media is trying to silence have in fact they tried to make them look like a crazy person on MSNBC they actually told their viewers\nTo turn the volume down because it would it hurt too much to watch a man to have a mental breakdown on television I don't I don't\nDisagree with you that some people in the media and maybe Don Lemon I didn't see the program your referencing but I take your word or in your characterization\nAs factual or no doubt his motivations are in in diminishing Kanye West could very well have been political show since you brought up political motivations what in the world do you think President Trump's motivation is to have Kanye West sitting across from him in the oval office of course\nTrump is not ... he's a lot of things dumb is not one of\nThem okay well the celebrities flying in and out of the Obama White house nobody questioned what they were doing there he was ... with beyond say and ... I'm going to say if I can invite someone in if he wants but look honey is actually working on prison reform and Tim Garton Ash and actually help get someone released from prison and this has been an initiative of the Trump Administration I'm Glad they're actually having this conversation\nDo you do you do you and your real smart to your mission you're certainly no dummy you don't sit here and really think Jennifer\nThat President Trump is not calculating and fully cognizant of the political benefits and the the potential political benefits of a young black male being very much in public his\nBuddy and his pal absolutely but look I think it started with something legitimate Kim car Daschle and rallying the White House it wasn't the White House rally in Kim ...\nShe went to them for help with this particular issue\nAnd it may be they reignited a friendship that they had post president they look politicians use celebrities all the time to get their message out and of course there is some of that but the fact that we're taking down calling us and calling him\nYou know mentally out of it or he's having some sort of break down because he likes Trump's I'm sick of that that they're going to be kind of news coverage but he said it's going to cost Democrats election\nOr I'll give you the last word I'll say I'll say my thoughts about Tanya will have to be continued alright alright here are now on the morning after friday the world famous morning answer friday free for all you get the last word of the week at eight fifty four when we fired the phone screener and your calls or an screen for content\nOn the friday free for all taking off the weekend morning answer style\nCollege rented to supplement I've been talking a lot about over the last several months Bryan you've heard me do it and it is because ... actually\nWorks that we keep talking about accounting at the supplement that you take that helps restore your body's ability to produce college and when your body produces college in it you feel better and you look better you even sleep better there's an eighty six percent success rate when you take ... for weight loss\nAnd there are no side effects only good side effects like sleeping better looking\nBetter your skin absolutely gloves and your joint pain starts to diminish countering as one hundred percent safe it is stimulant free so you don't feel jittery and it's made in America ... either to take all you do you take for cap let you go to bed at ... work while you sleep there is a money back guarantee and a whole certified team of support that\nHelp you through your weight loss journey so go online and check out ... at top last dot com that steel P.
