Hugh you wrote about it earlier this week this is a\nVersion back to McCarthyism by the Democrats I mean it is outrageous that character assassination the Democrats are burning a very bedrock of our democracy and that is the presumption of innocence and this and this character assassination is the the new low in my time here in Washington just unbelievable you\nKnow your colleagues center and told me earlier today that adds some corroborating evidence of Dr Ford's testimony specifically she will be I guess about do you believe that the one Republicans will have the same standard apps and corroborating evidence of doc Ford's testimony\nI Do you I Believe that uh we done everything we can from a\nChuck Grassley the chairman of the judiciary all the way down to this latest FBI investigation we done everything they've asked for\nThere's absolutely no corroborating out as a matter of fact the Democrats say well this is just a he said she said and we have to decide who's telling the truth though it's more than that because she bought cooperating witnesses story who could not cooperate her story\nBut they did actually cooperate his story so I Believe that we will get fifty one votes later this week\nNow there are also troubles with their testimony and the president brought them up last night and he's been criticized that I got to tell you in the first Arab today

this whole process is Dr for the Democrats promised to not reveal this this could have done been done confidentially which is what she wanted instead\nSomeone up you're either in the Congress ones will Congress woman's\nOffice on senator Feinstein's office somebody leak that letter\nAnd now after that game public is just outrageous and by the way that shut three weeks after dying Feinstein head this letter she had her personal interview with judge Kavanaugh she didn't mention it at all there was a one word of conversation about the letter when she met with him probably the first time\nHe also has been abused and I believe I've been thinking about this a lot 'cause I've never seen this kind of reaction has been no radio since Nineteen Ninety [noise] is that\nA ten year old daughter and a fourteen year old daughter her going to be hearing about this from friends and photos and cheap shots for the rest of their lives they're going to hear their father accused of being a gang rape is they're going to hear their father accused of being a drug and it's all without any kind of precedent\nAnd I think Americans are revolted by that center but do\nYou this is what's going on let me let me give you some quotes of the Democrats my wife was physically accosted this week at the airport here in Washington I was physically accosted by members of the center of public democracy now these

the gas station they're not going to be able to shop in the department store get up in their face absolutely harass them I mean this is not the America that I came to serve this is not the American

this whole controversy about drinking it's all manufactured the devil's triangle it's all manufacturing he did not lie and Jerry now they're threatening perjury proceeding is a joke does anyone take that seriously\nNo not up here not that people who know the facts I mean we've looked at the testimony we've heard all the witnesses I mean this is an absolute zero case there is not a a district attorney in the world are in the country that would have taken this to a judge for prosecution I honestly I I think that you know when I'm\nWhen Chris Coons says a judge Kavanaugh's who speak in a lifetime appointed the Supreme Court and I'm reading this and who are now think bears the burden of disapproving these allegations that the U.S senators you\nI'm calling these guys out because this is the bedrock of what we fought for all these years I mean the presumption of innocence is what McCarthyism challenge and you call that this is the closest thing to McCarthyism I've seen in the last fifty\nYears ago last question do you think there'll be confirmed by Saturday\nWaging to battle against fake news every morning this is the morning answer with Brian with Jennifer Horn [noise] good\nWednesday morning to you a rainy day Wednesday morning I Can't believe I'm saying that I'm Jennifer Horn Ryan Whitman is out a little under the weather today in Studio at my buddy\nReid is absolutely a great to be with you but I've got a call I don't know some\nYou know what's going on well hundreds of this stuff all over the ground I have no idea it looks like sprinklers have gone out of control there's a water main break Rachel water main break something is going on with the with the sprinkler system in\nGlendale give yourself some extra time because over the street\nIt's not it's not they knew that that is called rain and we can expect about an inch of it maybe today if the weather report to actually play out brain yeah is that what stuff that comes from the godsend to down to a\nShow out of the land of many people are going to be triggered by this change in weather just\nWait for traffic already starting to sprinkle a little bit in some parts there's just some spotty a little pockets of rain but the uh the big range should come later today and into the evening\nEither staying up to a between forty and Seventy percent chance of some substantial rain falling in Southern California I Know we need it so I Love days like today but it is tough on the roadways especially when it's a slippery after it's been dry for so long\nI was a I don't know I was in shock it really it really did strike me see what ... what I was looking for the broken sprint\nI couldn't tell you look ... I I get it All right well speaking of being ... any of you who have been watching all of this that's been going on about Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh will you might be feeling a bit befuddled Chu I we have some new information for you happening overnight\nThe wall Street Journal broke that story is that the FBI may be close to wrapping up their investigation into misconduct allegations are accusations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as soon as today maybe later this afternoon\nThis is according to a source with information on the matter of Fox News is reporting on this CNN Wall Street journal again broke this story this would clear the way for a final Senate vote\nOn his confirmation within days now Mitch McConnell Don\nHas said that the vote will happen this week he hasn't said exactly when it perhaps friday is the thinking but if there's FBI investigation wrap today the report would be given to senators only senators and then a decision would be made whether or not to move forward on contract in confirming Brett Kavanaugh\nThe also the reporters also supposed to be delivered to the White House so I guess there's going to be people watching to see if anybody\nIs creating a large document into the White House so that a President Trump can in the White House can review this we're going to look back on this entire affair as a very a dark day in American history\nI Hope that ultimately all this translates to people being outrage and taking that outrage into the voting booth encouraging their friends and neighbors to vote this is a pivotal moment and we need to treat it as such because\nThis is this is demonstrating the quest for raw power by the Democrat Party\nOr French Hugh Hewitt and others have been calling this a McCarthyism maybe the biggest example of that in our nation's history and that is because this is a it has been a takedown in pile on on a on the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh now\nObviously the people with honest intentions want to know I Want to know if ... is a sexual predator\nBut it has gone so far beyond the question as to whether or not there is something to the claims made by Dr Christine forward and the two other women that have come out against Brett Kavanaugh that it does feel like an attempt to ruin the life of Brett Kavanaugh with\nThe focus on him drinking too much going to parties in high school and the biggest shock or of all was laid out perfectly by Mitch McConnell on the floor of the Senate yesterday ice skate\nI thought the New York times on large this major story got the drug capital may have been accused of throwing some ice\nAcross our college bar in the mid Nineteen eighty talk about a bombshell on at all and and what new bombshell madre published today or tomorrow\nI imagine that's Mitch McConnell Reid students grandchildren [laughter] ...\nVoice you know this this really points out the depths and the desperation of the Democratic party there's also report now circulating that a former a friend or associate I don't know how you would call college buddy of Brett Kavanaugh's is rez reported to the FBI\nThat Brett Kavanaugh may have been in the state of Connecticut at the same time that a fraternity somewhere in the state of Connecticut may have hired a prostitute for fraternity party this is just gotten so off the rails you know\nThis ice skate\nThis is exactly the ice is being talked about on every TV I Know you turn from MSNBC to ABC CBS and it's nothing but ice ice ice ice\nAnd it really speaks to the diabolical nature Brett Kavanaugh because here he is using a a Web but his weapon I think I was in water melts and the weapon itself disappears this it it's so bizarre this is we're no longer in the land of real\nIt's it's become ... and that's what Brian and I will talk about this a lot you know Brian I think is inclined to believe Dr Christine forties made that very clear\nAnd I think both of them under oath told very credible stories I Believe something happened to Christine for it I don't know if I Believe that it was Brett Kavanaugh that perpetrated that crime and because it because of the way he defended himself\nSo many people now who are saying okay maybe we can't connect sexual crimes to Brett Kavanaugh so now we're going to attack his temperament\nAnd so a lot of you'll see a lot of people and left a lot of talking heads in the media a lot of Democrats now saying well you may not be a sexual ... but he may not be a sexual predator but he's certainly doesn't have the temperament to be a judge and the highest court in the land\nAnd Don I'm not a man\nAnd a knock on wood even as a woman I haven't been ... knew of any of this ... years and I don't have any plans to switch or I or switch my identity\nI haven't been accused of something like this but I Would say if I were you Don and you obviously have not been accused of anything but I Would I Know you and I know how you think and I know how responsible you are\nIf someone accused you of that you would fight back that's a natural or get on a ... that you would yell you these are really serious allegation and we have a camera absolutely and and so I think the nation is to fight back I Want to see someone\nWho's going to fight back so these are these issues now have moved on from sexual allegations south to temperament what\nWe're what we're really seeing and all of this Jennifer is that post modernism were truth is relative has moved from the laboratory of the university into mainstream politicians and\nThe left realizes that this nomination to the Supreme Court could upset the balance of power in the Supreme Court from their perspective for generations they use the courts to\nCraft public policy and without the Supreme Court in their pocket to severe limit or in the progressive the ability to use the judiciary in order to craft public policy\nAlright Mitch McConnell who of course leads the Senate to gave that impassioned plea to senators to take a look at the information and get ready to vote he promises once the FBI yet investigation wraps which according to multiple sources that might just do today Mitch McConnell says there will be a vote\nThere's a ... vote ... rear all this ...\nAre democratic ... after twenty four people really\nWant to be up to ...\nWe'll hear that even the very same supplemental every August ... Democrats hubs a lovely demand ...\nIs no magic or really\nNo longer ...\nOf a opportunity to vote no on the politics of personal destructive role\nAt the alternative oh ...\nThat's the voice of Mitch McConnell who has not wavered in his support of judge Brett Kavanaugh again awaiting confirmation hearing most likely this week and five senators are in the crosshairs to see if this confirmation will take place we'll have more on that\nBut President Trump at a rally in Mississippi a broke his silence of sorts on Dr Christine Ford took her on and it's catching some heat this morning we'll tell you all about it next does your morning answer continues at six sixteen\n[noise] insurance morning\nJust said that problem in that we'd have to deal with that that the other because of a crash on the lot heading south and I tell 'em a boulevard this one has the far right lane blocked off that a bunch of emergency crews out there helping out as well\nAnd you get a T a damn up from the Ninety One you're also getting the delay in China means new hotline where we had her back in lanes on the ... the managed to push it on over to the right shoulder now but things are still pretty tough on the seven hand\nYou know I think that a wreck you bring up a good point and on I Would I Would ask you this chew\nIn watching it President Trump has been so measured not to overstep I think in his commentary on Christine forward over the past week he's been\nDefinitely more responsibly and gone off the deep end like we've seen Trump do sometimes I think maybe he has an inkling as to what's going to be released and the FBI report since it is wrapping up and since he is the one who ordered it the FBI would be reporting back to him\nI think a sneak peak of the of what will come from the FBI was shown to us by Trump last night\nWell that that could be but Trump has to rich point Trump is his own surrogate he really is the person that likes to go out and speak what's on his mind and speaking is plainly to the American people is a hallmark of Donald Trump it's what ... years in\nTo the American people is what keeps his popularity up is because he has a direct connection [noise]\nAll right Fred is in your\nHome town of corona Don good morning Fred\nAre you doing I think what he said was great I have no problem with your partner with it but it's worth if we could have been in Saudi remember we're about to say that about about Martin\nRight yeah of course there's an\nInteresting correlation there Fred thank you for the phone call I don't know I don't know if I like to connect those two things I think they're both very serious matters in this country and\nI obviously Obama made some comments that I think didn't help race relations I Would say that this is a sign of just how polarized we are in politics Trump knows that his base has come to rally around calving off and he's not going to get any blowback from anybody that would consider voting for him for making those comments\nWill get the ... President Trump does enjoy right now a certain amount of a protection from his with his base he got to the latitude to be able to go out and say whatever he wants to say and know that it's not ... ...\nIs not going to separate him from his base Donald Trump is the only person that can separate himself from his base in so far that's never happened alright\nCourage to in yucaipa aren't that great mission\nTo be a good morning ... what did you think of the president's comments at his rally last night [noise]\nCorner John Donne thanks for taking my call what everybody's thinking my office makes exactly the same thing and that's why we love it exactly what John just said that he's dead and a prosecutor agreed with it\nSo let me ask you to lose weight or did he wait too long did they something should we have seen this from Trump but we can go\nNow I think you know for one see actually didn't over ... didn't attack he laid back but there are so attractive upon during some evidence moral ... they're all over her side he said what everybody believed\nAll right Chris thanks for the phone call I I don't know I think that I Am a little torn on this I feel like I don't I'm not upset by the comments made by Trump because I tend to agree there have been some whole soaked into the story of Christine Ford but that being said maybe was sick like two days premature\nI think people are more reacting to the to the the reality that there's a presumption of guilt by a cab and all in this he has not been given his due process rights even the ACLU has come out and attacked\nBrett Kavanaugh and they're the ones that used to defend our bill of rights and now the ACLU has turned around and they forgotten the bill of rights they're attacking him\nA lot of spending they don't need fans in Washington DC just lots of stuff going on as we continue on your morning answer for a Wednesday proposition thinks it's coming to a ballot near you in less than five weeks at the gas tax repeal and there's a brand new polling suggest just where California\nSets on at this the gas tax repeal good morning at six thirty\nIs her answer morning\nSo let's think somebody's having heart trouble and counting valley look out for them they broke down on the foreign fine heading down than just above our cars\nAnd they're plugging up the far right lane right now it's down looking at a slow down from beach provides only down side of the qualify as you come out of the ... will be something to think that we're going along slowly at six o five and it stays busy three signal hill telling on ...

I think even at Eighteen or twenty your mind is still impressionable and developing ...\nUm you can't tell me that these video games don't have an impact in according to a twenty four studies from countries including Canada us Germany Japan they found the video games like I mentioned were far more likely\nTo create behavior such as being sent the principal's office for fighting or hitting a non family member so and and this study goes on though as a whole variety of behaviors that they've started to notice and people that spent time playing these video games\nYeah so my question is for parents if you are listening to the more to answer in the six o'clock glad you're a parent maybe you're getting your kids up and ready to go to school on a Wednesday\nOr how do you limit screen time and what is your prescription for video games to keep your kids healthy is it a concern do your kids get unlimited amounts of this is used as a reward how how do you set this up for your kids I'm curious because I don't have kids on your daughter is a little too old to be\nCaught up in a in this conversation the number to reach us is eight five five Seventy five eight to five five that's eight five five Seventy five eight to five five\nInch screen time for our video game set up as a reward for your kids are they just to give and do they get unlimited access or are you a bit of an arbiter as to what your kids are experiencing right now because\nI think it's really easy for studies to say this and I'm all about being realistic it is easy to say that your kitchen fleet nine to eleven hours it's easy to say that they should get an hour's worth of exercise every day we all should we know how easy it is to say that and how little that actually happens\nAnd it's easy to say that they shouldn't be on a screen for more than two hours a day\nBut it is that realistic is there a way to actually make sure this happens do you especially with both parents who might be working in the classroom\nHow do you how do you make this all work in your daily life\nI just don't see I I Know when I I don't know we're in my life as a young adult I Would have fit\n[noise] the uh made some of the church everywhere here is she'll go on your mate somebody smartphone advantage of modern technology to know on Amazon and Google speaker just ask for like seven or you're listening\n\n\nGym for now is the conservative crusader Brian or lovable liberal\nTo be a good\nWednesday morning to you and is it your morning answer on a rainy day\nOf rain expected in Southern California they almost an inch in some areas and boy could we use it I'm Jennifer Laura Lippman is out sick today John Dick ... is in the studio with me and President Trump in a bit of\nTrouble after a rally speech last night Tuesday night in Mississippi\nAt this rally President Trump took the opportunity as you've seen him do many times to talk about his economic achievements he talked about his new are meeting upcoming meeting with Kim Jong lunar new summit underway Mike Pompeo will be in North Korea on Sunday trying to negotiate the terms of that\nTalked about his renegotiating NAFTA done for uh the u._s. MCAA that it is now like in place awaiting congressional approval\nBut the topic of conversation turned to something that Trump has been avoiding in rallies and that is judge Brett Kavanaugh and Dr Christine Ford today\nThe president has been pretty mum about what he thought about the accuser of judge Brett Kavanaugh Christine forties and very measured and how he answers questions about her with the press\nBut last night at his rally and let it let it out a little bit to the ... some people say he was mocking her we want to know what you think we're going to take your calls on this that eight five five Seventy five eight to five five\nWe want to know whether or not you'd think that these comments made by the president were are appropriate for a miss irate five five Seventy five eight to five\nThirty six years with no ... I had one right I Want to be\nWell you know I was wondering\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how\nMany I don't want to do and I don't\nKnow [noise] I don't know what\nWas it and I don't know where's the\nHot zone where was I don't know but I Wonder if that's the only thing I\nSee how the president there John at making a bit of fun of Dr Christine forward and her testimony under oath to the Senate last week\nYou know it makes it a little hard I I you know anybody that has had to deal with any kind of sexual assault\nUm you know my heart goes out to them that is not something that um it changed your life if it does and what I'm ... were torn with though right now is that sexual assault has been weaponized against\nPeople applying for jobs ... cabinet specifically the left has weaponized why she weaponized it they didn't they didn't take Juanita Broadway Broderick seriously when she brought forth her allegations go Hillary Clinton was just a in a in a a a\nA presentation\nYesterday talking about this how women need to be believed 'em and so it is you know when the left is so hypocritical about it when they only use it when it when it allows them to advance their political agenda\nWhere was this where was the Saturday Saturday Night live cold open skit on Harvey one ... I think\nThere is a there's a fair bit of hypocrisy to be played it to be fair on both sides of the aisle at President Trump again has been quiet for the most part about Dr Christine Ford and this is a is an important time we're learning if you're if you're just waking up a bit of breaking news read that the FBI will probably wrap their investigation up\nToday according to multiple sources by this afternoon which means that Mitch McConnell is going to push for a vote in the Senate confirmed Brett Kavanaugh or to kick him out this will happen over the next couple of days and you need some people to be on the on board with you you need all of the Republicans for almost all of the Republicans except for one\nTo be on board to confirmed Brett Kavanaugh because you can't count on any Democrats coming to the table to vote for him\nAnd with comments like this you're already hearing this morning from Susan Collins who is one to watch is on the fence she said that the president made the comments that that he made were just plain wrong that was a direct quote from Susan Collins\nThen you have Senator Jeff flake from Arizona who is a known critic of this president he was on the today show this morning and he called the comments appalling well I've heard\nWas no time and no place for ... for something to do with a political rally [noise] right [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nSo whether or not the president is frustrated I think clearly a lot of people including a including me Don I'm I'm frustrated by what this process has turned into I like the process is appalling to use one of Jeff lakes words but when you know you need a certain amount of people that a confirmation vote is not a given in that situation\nCould it be possible that President Trump miss fired here or was he playing to his base which could also put pressure on Republican senators to vote yes for Brett Kavanaugh I guess the question is MIT's fire or well executed political calculation\nBut I don't know there's a lot of a justification for looking at it from both sides we've got a bunch of cold here that or you know looking at it mostly from the standpoint that Trump may have gone too far\nAll right so we'll take your phone calls on this eight five five Seventy five eight to five five again the breaking news President Trump at a campaign rally in Mississippi made these comments about Dr Christina\nAccuses oh this is a I have one right I Want to be\nWell you know I was wondering\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how\nI don't know [noise] I don't know what\nWas it and I don't know where\n... where was I don't know but I Wonder if that's the only thing\n[noise] All right Rob is waking up this morning in lake Elsinore good morning Rob what do you think of the president's comments but it's a political calculation or miss fire\nI think it was a myth far em I'm firmly behind a few\nBut this is not the time to be talking about why he did because we have three Republican senators is probably a few Democrats that are wanting to come to our side and vote yes for Kavanaugh\nBut then he comes out and says this and it just makes it look really bad because\nYou know the people on the left are looking for a survivor and then for him to poke fun at a survivor just doesn't look good if you're trying to win\nA well I Would say uh you know I don't know if he's going to win that women vote or if it if we are so polarized right now\nThat people are either you know with you or against you I don't even know if there's any room to finagle anybody to your side of the aisle at this point with out giving maybe economic deliverable that might make them independence or people in the middle either vote for or against the party of the presidents\nAre a lot of areas that you could have gone after they would have ... same thing he could have gone after ... keeping for keeping this letter under wraps and then what she's done yet you know that that I think is a very fair target in this process\nAll right that more of your phone calls on this again the big story of the day President Trump\nComments about Dr Christine Ford at a campaign rally in Mississippi Jeff Flake senator from Arizona who is needed to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh has come out and called the president's comments a polling ... we will have more on that and your phone calls next it's your morning answer on a Wednesday that morning at seven Fifteen\nInsurance morning\nUnfortunately things remain kept up trying to make

specifically or not to the public so that they can determine how to vote Mitch McConnell has said that they will vote a full Senate vote\nBy the end of the week and that brings me to or what the senators like Jeff Flake will do will they confirmed\nOn the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh on a new Harvard caps Harris Poll has said that sixty percent\nOf Americans want judge Brett Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court\nThis is different than pulling we saw just a couple of days ago which suggested just the opposite that about sixty percent of Americans did not support the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh perhaps some of this there's oxygen given to the situation have caused some Americans to feel like a it's a this has been an onslaught of allegations trying to smear Brett Kavanaugh\nWill the pole you're mentioning is identical to the one that showed that sixty percent of the of the\nOf Heidi Heitkamp constituents in North Dakota\nApprove of Brett Kavanaugh only twenty seven percent oppose Twenty one percent say the confirmation is their top issue which has added to the challenges for a Heidi Heitkamp who is following ten points behind her geo huge predator Kevin Cramer\nThis mirrors other things that are going on in Montana Jon Tester Missouri Claire McCaskill now tree trails her opponent by two percent\nJoe mansion same number sixty percent of those approve of Brett Kavanaugh or Indiana Joe Donnelly an even Bob Menendez who was the senator that just recently had some of those legal challenges he is now in tossup category his lead is falling to only two percent\nThey always talk political experts always talk about the October surprise ahead of a an election and I think maybe Brett Kavanaugh will be the October surprise just delivered a little early back in September will have all of the latest on Brett Kavanaugh plus\nAnd talking about these majorities in Congress and how the the layout of the Senate and house will look after the elections
