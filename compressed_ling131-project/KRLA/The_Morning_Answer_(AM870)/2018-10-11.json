E. well it's not a hurricane anymore hurricane Michael has been downgraded to a tropical storm\nYesterday the administrator for FEMA named Brock Long told President Trump that hurricane Michael could be the most intense storm to hit the Florida Panhandle Jennifer in well over one hundred years\nThe damage here Brian was on a believable I don't know if you had a chance to look at some of the damage along highway Ninety eight it was completely wiped out by that see well you had marine life you had all types of things blocking this road rich ... roofs were ripped off\nOf the buildings it seems that at the death toll account is that too right now but it judging by the damage that you could see there on the ground it seems like they really escaped to obviously the death toll may ride we hope that it does that\nBut it seems that they really survived the storm well and that's probably because of the preparation of not only FEMA but of course the governor and the whole state of Florida\nThe sun is up in Florida on the eastern seaboard of this great country and people are seeing what's happened to their homes to their workplaces\nOr to their churches for example to their schools I saw this morning on shoes me such a cough there I don't want you to have to hear that um I saw on CNN they had a video footage of school and it looked like it in elementary school\nThat uh that that kids go to and Jennifer just completely demolished show raises it raises the point you know the media and moves on end and we'll admittedly the morning answer we'll move on from this next week\nUh it'd be highly unlikely we'd still be talking about hurricane Michael but for months or years even sometimes we see with hurricanes whether it's Katrina or what happened in Puerto Rico\nThe people in the community are rebuilding I mean you've got probably a thousand students I'll pull that off the top of my head going to that school well where are they going to school on Monday where they're going to school tomorrow where they go to school they're not going to school today of course\nYou know so all of these um this show so the hurricanes over\nA tropical storm it's Peter running out there through the worst but there are about to begin the process\nOf almost just as bad rebuilding their lives\nI think I'm most worst I remember I Know you do we covered very extensively Hurricane Harvey\nAnd you send out last year about this time and that was one of the things that stuck out for me is it wasn't just the storm the awful storm but it was the fact that people lost their homes their schools their whole way of life and that doesn't go away when the media goes away in a week or two that's why it is so important\nTo remember these people and the you know you have no doubt there'll be someone that\nKind of come forward as a person to keep this impact on the minds of Americans like\nJ J what the football player did in ... in Houston He became a hero raising money for all of the of the people that needed it\nThat that we have to keep in our brain that this is not over when the cameras go have you're absolutely right about that that that goes far beyond the ... the damage goes far beyond what the standing water and as you mentioned the winds that were so damaging rooster flying off buildings are going to be it needs to be reconstructed\nThis morning CNN provided a very informative and brief update on the weather situation and and ah where it's been and where it is now with regard to tropical storm Michael\nMichael made landfall near Mexico Beach Florida with wins in excess of one hundred and forty miles an hour to storm just shy of a category five enough to launch rooftop across the street\nThe strongest hurricane to hit the continental us than Andrew in Nineteen Ninety two in a song that there's\nRecorded history microwaving devastation and that's wake check out this trunk of a school gym in Panama City just\nBlown apart same story with this nearby shopping mall which locals say was recently remodeled\nThis vote warehouse and Niceville, Florida a total loss\nAt CNN within early morning brief whether update filled with lots of information on now tropical storm Michael it was a category five hurricane there for awhile yesterday wasn't it\nA democratic senator US Senator from Florida Bill Nelson he's the senior senator of Florida he spoke yesterday about seeing walls of water of eight to twelve feet there along the coast of Florida\nAre everything to the east is going to see a wall of water eight to twelve feet\nNow just think about that ah that's ah for a six foot person\nThat six feet above a that height of that individual and a lot of those areas that that huge surge is going to hit a low lying areas\nAnd ah they have creeks and rivers that come down into them and flow into the Gulf of Mexico as the ... storm approaches the water in those creeks and rivers will flow out\nInto the Gulf and then when that surge comes it comes and fills back up and you can imagine how many miles inland and that kind of wall of water is suddenly going to affect life and property\nSenator Bill Nelson and the images were saying this morning Jennifer\nA proved true uh the the forecast if you will the senator made yesterday about that storm surge and the miles of of of ... miles inland then that water finds itself as a result of what twelve foot surges in some cases\nIt's ridiculous they say this morning two people have been killed already obviously as the recovery effort still on it that number could go up five hundred thousand customers don't have electricity right now throughout Alabama Georgia and Florida\nAnd uh as to experts say even though that storm has been downgraded Bryan it's sitting about thirty miles west of Augusta, Georgia and heading into the Carolinas where they're expecting seven to nine inches of rain which\nIs not with the Carolinas need right now after they're recovering from Hurricane Florence\nFemale had been a traitor Brock Long Jennifer expressed concern we hear this all the time\nThat too many people in the path of the storm hurricane Michael now tropical storm Michael did not heed the mandatory evacuation orders the death toll right now is Jennifer pointed out earlier is to uh for those who did not heat evacuation orders you are\nMaybe missing or without power are unable to make contact with people we don't know the status of those folks we don't know the welfare of those folks and win search and rescue teams or get in there I hate to use the phrase recovery teams 'cause I suggest that people have not survived\nA ... that number could go up\nA right now the death toll is at two but typically as we see when we have fires in Southern California many people who are told to evacuate just don't do it female confirming yesterday that many people in Florida the panhandle hurricane Michael did not eat evacuation orders\nYet ... one of the uh the headlines and dredge today is quote I should have left hurricane Michael terrified those who stayed than article done by Reuters that droid ... dredge has posted up this morning and you had so many I think when you're a Floridian it's not like\nIn California if someone told us that there was a hurricane coming because we never get them obviously it'd be unusual people would probably keep those winds and go running and there'd be hysteria cause that to California is\nBut when you're in Florida you get hit with these hurricanes all the time it becomes sort of a way of life for them and I think that makes people think that they can fit things out that maybe the medium is reports that stop and that they're not going to be as bad as they say ... and it clearly when you have a ... a storm like this that intensified so quickly\nAnd in such a real way people probably say well it can't be that bad and the wind absolutely what over a hundred and fifty miles per hour at some point during the storm\nBut that's the latest out of Florida and some neighboring states hurricane Michael now a tropical storm Michael Brian and Jennifer on your morning answer for practice friday that's what we call Thursday

George W.

Thursday on the morning answer with Brian and Gen AMA Seventy LA Orange County am five Ninety in the IT we are your morning answer CNN offers up this morning a brief\nBut very informative lots of information in this a\nThirty second to review of hurricane Michael making landfall and now of course been downgraded to a tropical storm and uh the aftermath look suddenly\nMichael made landfall near Mexico Beach Florida wins in excess of one hundred and forty miles an hour the storm just shot a category five enough to launch roofs off the Gulf War the strongest hurricane to hit the continental us and as you were in Nineteen Ninety two in the song that there's\nIn recorded history Michael leaving devastation and its way check out this strong push of a school gym in Panama City just\nBlown apart same story with this nearby shopping mall which logo say was recently remodeled\nThis whole warehouse and Niceville, Florida a total loss\nFrom CNN that's an accurate safely inside a studio we'll hear from John ... who was out in the elements that just a moment we'll hear from him he had a rough time I would say covering it uh then the fancy anchor sitting there with a nice hair behind the desk you know in the air conditioned climate controlled studio did you see some of these pictures I mean\nI saw school that was totally demolished I mean the roof is also a so so I you know the between the municipalities are local government in the federal government\nThat's quite a job to get in there I mean you dealing a obviously with thousands and thousands of school kids uh who's who's a who who school houses to to use an older phrase\nAre gone the buildings are gone and and and school just started so I mean that's one problem that they go right then you've got homes and then you've got family cars that floated into the water down the street\nUm it's it's just a it's just incredible they say it's the worst storm according to FEMA administrator Brock Long you told the president or in well over a hundred years\nWe talk about with Hurricane Florence which we just talked to a couple of weeks ago this happened in the Carolinas that with more of a water and rain event this was a quick moving storm and it obviously had water attached with it but by and the story you're absolutely right with the wind\nThese wins that we're touching ... not just your category for court category five that if you had them at one fifty one Seventy and some places I think President Trump on Fox and friends It's MORNING said that same area saw two hundred mile per hour winds buildings are not meant to withstand that\nAnd there were a lot of people who made the choice because the Florida and they get hurricane fairly often to ride this out and those people are the ones that are being looked for today at the death tolls at two but you'd imagine as a as the recovery effort as people are trying to rebuild and see what damage has actually done\nThat hopefully everybody made this through okay because it was a violent storm and that is the understatement of the\nYear here's John Berman from CNN on the ground in Florida yesterday dealing with the aforementioned wins that Jennifer described show correctly\nThe city of Panama City beach it's home to about twelve thousand people normally in in the thousands of tourists it does seem of all the tourists have gone out the hotels here all close the restaurants all close the tourists left\nThat's good with the residents as you've been hearing that the big concern here maybe only half\nOf them left there could be several thousand people who decided to say in their homes so many of the people we talked to me that it's as you say what it was a category ... storm because that's what it was most of the day yesterday it was a category ... storm they went to sleep they thought they could ride this out they woke up to the news it was a category for\n... or anything [noise] simply keep getting stronger and stronger fodder forty a hundred and fifty miles per hour long as this storm approaches the land and it will be that way at the food off the coast\nPassing maybe Tallahassee so this week it or not you're on the coast but also in cities like Tallahassee known gorgeous canopy with those giant reason I just can't imagine it was kind of what we're seeing here will allow for that much more than if it will be hard to stay outside\nAll right here's another clip John Berman quickly becoming CNN's go to guy to get out there and do these uh weather hits Wolf Blitzer I don't think he's been outdoors in Thirty years [laughter] I didn't know they allowed him out I think it's a Wolf Blitzer if he was out there his beard would've correct [laughter] you know but\nWe sometimes make fun of these reporters who go out there because they almost have to take it right they have to be overly dramatic when the storms that they're covering don't pan out but boy from Greg Jenkins in the morning yesterday on Fox is getting slashed around by ocean water\nHas much to the horror of generosity and the weather machine\nShe was having a panic and actually get off of that beach gr if you've got to get out of there she was not kidding that's was not a made for TV moment she was really worried for this guy's safety and then you see the CNN reporters we were watching one who almost literally blew away I was in a big red hooker\nHoward Dean was there to hear Howard Dean was almost certainly he worked for MSNBC now covering weather for MSNBC in this clip you'll hear John Berman\nHe describes the the rain I'm feeling like a blast pellets shards of glass as it hit him in the face a live hurricane Michael which is now a tropical storm or the worst of the storm has passed through but here's how it sounded yesterday\nWhen we pull into your face down like small razor blade up the power in the way for a transformer explosions of all across as far to Panama\nCity beach where we are the water is rising fond those the roadways the raiders and falling consistently is a very wide area so these rose fought very very easily yes you are if you have not evacuated\nAt this point they told you to stay in your home that I can tell you I see why because this is if we so strong\nIt'd be very hard to control a vehicle on these roads right now I'm just taking a look around because lord of the main concern is that a storm like this is the debris imagine small pieces of Woodside breaks we saw break out here a moment ago\nFlying along at a hundred miles per hour or so that is a major concern\nThis point that John Berman on CNN I saw him say this morning Jennifer Horn that um there there was a surreal moment but the whole thing sounds pretty surreal but there was a surreal moment when he said he would be standing looking in a standing upright ... looking forward and he would see large items like\nBarbecue grills from wow you don't passing horizontally in his eye line movie mhm yeah so these things are literally heavy objects\nWith with wind gusts of almost two hundred miles an hour being picked up and they're just like the scene for those laws uh uh you know the tornado where things are just floating through the air that's the impression I got from the description the reporter offered\nAnd we talked about that yesterday how it's tornadoes there's such a real threat with storms like this when they could see up to one hundred tornadoes and the next couple of days in the aftermath of the storm at right now the storm is off the ... is in South Carolina it's about forty miles west\nOf Columbia South Carolina it's headed northeast it's headed for the Carolinas these are places that do not need the rain they don't certainly need the wind\nAnd a more more I'm sure damage we're going to hear from the storm even though it's been downgraded\nMorning time in the sunshine state the sun has come up over three hundred and fifty thousand people in Florida's panhandle remain without power as we continue on practice friday you're Thursday morning answer with Brian and Jennifer\nOnly twenty six days to go\nThe mid term elections we have a morning answered mid term madness update and all

the twenty two heading he found before you play so they made it\nOf that he did and reported on it that is the problem is that there is not proof of millions of people voting illegally in that race and why then Jennifer did he offer that voter fraud argument he\nOffered it as a defense of his defeat in the popular vote total to Hillary Clinton so let's not pretend that Republicans aren't suggesting that voter fraud makes them look worse than they are when the votes are counted\nIt always boils down to go and buy it always goes back to Trump always always always these critic then and I
