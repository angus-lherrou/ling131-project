in my in my opinion\nWait a minute Brian wait a minute I Am I normal or am I crazy ... how did you how normal or am I crazy you're a little bit crazy doctors I go to city council meeting okay does not surprise me by Ani supervisor meetings\nSo guys and you see and I'm a little bit crazy so I'm not picking on you know it's all politics is local thank you Tip O'Neill but I but here's what you do too don't you record that stuff\nNo they are broadcast live OK yeah but you can't make a comment you can't talk to the city council unless you're there\nYou would understand if you would concede vis a ritual of yours to go to counseling supervisor meetings is a typical if we looked at the general population you'd agree\nUnfortunately okay yeah absolutely because here's the here's the rub the most important political office in the entire country is that a private citizen most people don't take the responsibility in the proper care and feeding of a constitutional republic seriously or don't understand it because we've purged civics yeah no I ...\nI agree with that the LA Times has a picture a in a recent addition of a woman a disrupting and LA city council meeting which is really why most of these people in my opinion not you down but I think you've done your share of disrupting at\nAt a council meetings I just don't want you I briefly 'cause it's radio take a look at this woman just yes just take a look at her you don't have cable or looking at a young female right about thirty five or forty yeah does she look normal a tree or does she look crazy\nYou know the the unfortunate thing about a picture is is it ... it can get somebody in one of the most unflattering moments of their lives let's\nTry one more time does that look normal are crazy\nLooks like she's impassioned looked like she looks like she has a point to make okay the\nLA city council voted unanimously last week to crack down on people who repeatedly disrupt their meetings at city hall because you know those Fifteen\nEinstein's on the LA city council you know those meetings are important they of work to do and these people disrupt their meetings they defy attorneys that activists to charge\nThe LA city hall councils defying attorneys an activist you charge at this new rule trampled on the first amendment and the free speech rights of the uh sometimes in my opinion crazy people who have nothing better to do but go to the city council meetings and scream without trash pickup\nSo let me ask you this part of the people who go into restaurants and scream and yell at Ted Cruz or they crazy yes yeah okay I agree and that's not the proper way to do to exercise your First Amendment you don't go into private property as a as a mob and drummed people out\nBut you see how honest I was I defend Ted Cruz from what I think it's crazy and I'm mad enough to tell you I think you're a little crazy for going all the city council meeting\nBut there's a difference I don't go there and do that but I don't see you see it oh I Do and you subject yourself to this environment but you\nCredit card companies hated when we expose their secrets in fact there are ways you can become debt free

I don't want to hurt jobs I don't want to lose in order to like that and you know there are other ways of a politician\nTo use the word that's a pretty harsh work but the truth\nIs President Trump saying they're done it sounds to me like the president's saying a country can do an evil thing like heaven forbid kidnapped or kill an American journalist and as long as they're\nBuying big orders from us as long as they're a good customer and their checks clear we won't sanction them that's basically what he just hold\nLess hostile I don't I don't think I heard that I think I heard I'm not going to tell you what I'm going to do\nThat he's he's ... informing Leslie stall and through Leslie America what hangs in the balance of a decision to ah you know to sanction so do you do you withhold this military he's given the reasons why it may not be as straightforward as just let the sanction of\nThe president was asked about Kim jung loon with whom each had a nuclear ... summit in Singapore was I Believe uh when he got together with Kim jung Hoon the north Korean dictator President Trump reiterate\nWhat you said before that he does trust Kim Jong own I don't\nTrust him yeah I trust them that doesn't mean I Can't be proven lie and trust that well first of all if I didn't trust him I wouldn't say that to you would not be foolish to tell you right here on sixty minutes\nLeslie stall now reminds the president of a a Kim jung Owens background\nI Want to read you his resume okay died over a whole kingdom of repression\nGulag starvation reports that he had his half brother assassinated slave labor public executions [noise] this is a guy and I know these things I mean I'm not a baby and I don't like why do you love that guy luck\nWith okay that said it's like I like me you know it's like an ... well let ... let it be whatever it is to get the guy look let it be whatever it is\nI get along with them really well I have a good energy with him I have a good chemistry and look at the horrible sweats or a man [noise] no more threats no more threats\nPresident Trump on sixty minutes being interviewed by Leslie stall last night on CBS being described this morning a by viewers and observers and a lot of political writers and pundits as a contentious interview\nA lot of TV viewers characterize it as such Leslie stall asked the president about turnover in his cabinet this all comes on the heels of a stunning announcement on diction for Jennifer last week that Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the UN would be resigning\nUs sad that this administration is like a smooth running machine and ... we keep hearing that the White House is in chaos wrong\nSo false is fake news\nDid at a hundreds and hundreds of people some kind of not packed I'm changing things around and I'm In title to hire people now in San by that will be phenomenal they'll come into the administration there'll be phenomenal are people going to go to other people that show\nSo many people you don't have a have a record of ... turnover Hi Tony ... or I told you this or we have a great I think I have a great cabin there are some people that I'm not happy with I have some people that I'm not thrilled with and I have other people that I'm beyond thrilled\nWith President Trump on sixty minutes are now starting to talk about uh the mad dog James Mattis secretary of defense who every Trump supporter was head over heels when he picked James Mattis it appears as if\nSecretary Mattis might be next out the door at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue listen\nWhat about General Mattis is he going to leave I don't know he hasn't told me that I Wonder what relationship with a Madeleine two of them do it as if I have a very good relationship with them it could be that he is I think it's sort of a Democrat if you want to know the truth like General Mattis has a good guy\nShould a male be able to compete in a woman's rights I think no but there's caviar would you like to hear please if the woman if the man if the biological man\nIs completely transformed like we've seen Bruce Jenner it seemed I don't know if I've never seen him with them I don't know if it's for transformation but short short looks finished okay\nI think now Caitlyn Jenner could run in a woman's rights because that is a woman I mean take a lot so um\nBut unless they are through that process\nI I don't think it should be ...

am eight Seventy Los Angeles Orange County am five Ninety in the ... we're talking about the wins in power outages and Don ... who is filling in for the vacationing Jennifer Horn did you notice\nYes has Christopher processing you ride like the wind and I started talking about the lights in the studio serve\nLiquor on and off if they did [noise]\n[noise] you know at this\nVery negative association with what has happened I'm going to tell you why\nA first got caught in a dark place no but first let me tell the ... the reason the lights flickered was because the power company is having a problem because of the Santa Ana winds thousands of people in Southern California are without power\nDealing with the first major Santa Ana wind event of the season today this morning Monday more than eleven hundred Southern California Edison customers or affected and riverside county\nIn the Dell Rosen neighborhood in San Bernardino county sixteen thousand customers are reported to be without power Ventura County has five hundred customers affected in the city of Ventura Edison says more than a thousand customers are without power in Santa Paula Southern California Edison says to people\nI'm all over LA orange Ventura in San Bernardino don't be surprised if your power is turned off today\nAnd getting into that act is is my rate but my power provider Glendale water and power uh they told us that it could all just go off poof you know no power good luck to you of these winds are very high when you leave the house this morning\nBe you know we're all I mean the basic stuff we're a little sweater I mean it's cool and be careful because these are high winds up to Seventy five mile an hour a guest I Believe in the Senate career valley we talked to a caller this morning to the morning answer and our six o'clock clubs she she got in right away and she said you know what\nI'm driving on the freeway and she painted the picture things just flying across the road\nThese are the kinds of wins that can actually knock trucks over [noise]\nSo you make sure that you know ... be safe out there and the other thing that these wins will probably tinker with is a very important baseball game it's going to be played we understand that the winds are going to be coming in from center field and may damp and the ability of some of these home runs to be hit show\nJohn and I went with Don my we're wondering a right or is it is the wind going to be at the pictures back or at the catcher's back basically sure is it you know who's going to\nBe going to lift the ball over the fence or is it going to keep it down\nThat's right so we asked the question earlier this morning and I think it's worth repeating now has a major league baseball who by the way they're a little bit prima Donna prima donnas I mean a little rain and they have to run off the field and 'cause they can't play in the rain\nSnow heaven forbid meanwhile football players can sleep inhaling the Denver Broncos crushing each other out there so the point is\nQuestion is has a major league baseball game ever been cancelled because of wins that are high today game three of the national league championship series is scheduled first pitch a Walker Mueller bealer below or anyone\nFor thirty nine at Chavez Ravine where the winds are going to be high but you found Mr Don next as we are prepared to to uh to get to the bottom of this\nTo a minor league team I think up in Stockton had to call the game offered\nYeah Lancaster in Stockton were playing in two thousand Fifteen and they had to call the game off because of gusts up to Seventy miles an hour and I don't know if that's because of the stadium that they were in maybe they didn't have as much shelter I Would imagine Dodger Stadium is going to provide quite a
