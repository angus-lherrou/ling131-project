about financial freedom that's that's really what it boils down to is being able to move to Spain if you want to move to Spain you know for for a while I spent my my winters in the Caribbean and\nI was living in Boston at the time and and I had somebody actually came up to me and say why do you go [laughter] I chuckle Everytime I think about it he said why do you why do you leave Boston and go to\nA Puerto Rico and the winter time and I looked at him and said have you ever spent a winter here in Boston and he was like well yeah and I'm like that's why when it gets really pretty cold here in the wintertime and I'm running from it\nAnd that sort of the things that that is the markets allow you to do is it doesn't matter where you it doesn't matter where you go as long as you have an Internet connection we've joked about it a few times where he where back when I used to do that I wanted to go back and forth as I was down in Puerto Rico and I'd have that big Eighteen the air card hanging out of the side of my laptop\nThat it was almost the same size as my laptop\nAnd even my satellite radio down there like it only worked for like ... it only worked for like eight AM to like noon 'cause that's when the satellite was over ... it was it was hilarious but where we are\nFrom a technology standpoint is is is light years beyond where we were you know\nTwelve years ago Fifteen Years ago when when I was just getting started and this and it's kind of a fun it's been a fund evolution to see but for everybody who is just getting started right now it's like it's like you have no idea how good you have it I feel like when I talked to a new\nTraders I'm like my grandfather and I'm like oh and I went to school I had to walk up hill both ways and the smell you know we had die off Internet to now it's just in the palm\nOf your hand but we have so much access to our money that really going in and just getting a little bit of skill and getting a little bit of a little bit of knowledge\nCan really go a long way we don't have to call up a broker and say hey you know what about this what about that it's just right at the poll of our hand identify the price and we want to pay set the order and then wait for priced really come down to you it it ends up being that kind of classic negotiating tactic\nYou say you know and my grandfather taught me that's when I was like five years old I remember going with him and he was buying my grandma new car and he said watch this he says I'm going to tell them the price I'm going to pay and and as soon as he says no we're going to get up and walk away\nAnd that's really how you approach the markets you say you know what I Want to buy this these these shares a stock but I Want to buy this price and if I can for this price that's okay there's lots of other stocks that I can go buy it a great price and you have to have that mentality and that is the mentality of the professional one of the things that can help you operate like a professional though was confidence\nConfidence can come from education confidence can come from building skill a great place to start that isn't the half the class we've got a few tickets left

examples you can share with our audience out there as far as times where where people have come in and they've they've got the ball rolling they've taken that initial first step and how it's gotten him to that point a financial freedom\nBlitz consistency Ryan most people come in and they make that commitment it's really pretty simple you know you have\nTo be willing to commit the coach of bull beat a point in your life when you're really wanted to make a change if you're somebody who's just kind of going from one thing to the next to the next you really never going to achieve what you want to do it's all about stepping back asking yourself a simple question how's that life working for you\nIf you're not happy right now that you have to get yourself out of your comfort zone start thinking there are better ways to do things but more importantly learn from people who already doing what you want to do I have heard my whole life\nYou know going up at school that copying someone was bad well that's completely false you want to copy somebody who's doing what you want to do and who are successful so you need to be able to have mentors you need to be able to have coaches you need to be able to be somebody who really is willing to make a change\nBecause people don't change in fact I'm Stein once said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expect in a different outcome\nThis is how most people live their lives they'd rather just continue to be miserable not do anything different when there's a whole opportunity right in front of them to go out there and as you said giving up a couple of hours of your life where you can be watching TV or doing something else it's more important to invest in yourself to invest in some TV show out there\nAnd I remember seeing a as you were saying copying somebody being that the way you learn it really is I I remember being in a in a class um you know ten Fifteen Years ago and I remember the instructor actually saying\nYou know if you want to be wealthy wealthy people do if you if you see somebody who is in the situation that you want to be in and if you follow them around all day long and you do the exact same things that they do eventually you will be in that same spot\nOr any brought up the the the the inverse side of that too and he said if you follow somebody around who is making terrible kind of financial decision somebody who maybe is a homeless person who's kind of lost everything and you do exactly what they do you know this is the same thing if you're copying that process you're going to end up in that situation and\nThe same thing in the financial markets and it's one of the reasons why we teach\nOur students how they could identify what the financial institutions during what are the professionals doing what are the best people in the world\nDoing inside of these financial markets how can you identify that so that you can go in and just simply do what they do so that you can get\nWhat they got now one of the way there where we start this off one of the best ways to do this has come out to a half day class invest three hours of your time she can see exactly what it takes to do that before we can do that I've only got what ten tickets left here we're at the end of the show is what that means\nAnd so one of the things is Larry can we give

to see exactly what it takes\nTo really live life on your own terms to be able to generate the income that you need to be able to do the things that you want to do\nNow in a second you're going to

prevent them from going on dialysis and died\nTrying to protect and preserve their native kidneys and let them function for as long as they can so here we are dealing with a lot of dilemma as a\nAnd today's medical world and I know that that one of the most important talks of the day and\nHere I have George George thank you so much for coming on Ga excited to finally be on this show with me\nWhile I'm not only terribly excited I'm also greatly honored with a ... a big fan of course\nI thank you so much you know in Georgia helped me at it that the ... dance music\nYou're so which I think he's a masterpiece and has everything to a human being\nAs a human being whatever that person is a sick person or is healthy needs to know in order to protect house and be independent\nOf me or some other uh dialysis providers lower than somebody who really wants to if somebody wants to feel good and uh be motivated to take their rights stopping their lives\nAh I think that that that book is going to help that person a lot sad I Want to say George thank you for\nHelping me editor ... hand finally be able to come on the radio and say you know I wrote a book that I think is going to change a life of so many people who needed so desperately\nWill I Will do so for us to say I think the book could conceivably change the world is pretty clear you make it in the book Andrew make it on your show almost weekly that one's good health is really a one's hands one can make the decision to be healthy for the most part or one considerably in British negative serves abilities\nAnd practices and really completely and and the individuals power and grow and you do have ... in the book which is massively written record and voting record all the others are important message for one at all\nYes and and uh you know if this is what I Am saying George the way I see in modern medical morals [noise] uh we have taken that choice and weigh you from our patients [laughter] you know like what I said in that book uh we always have the choice and we can make the right choice\nAnd that choice starts with us and the happiness the inner happiness that we can create within ourselves and let it expand to the rest of the world's a but sometimes you know making that choice and uh\nBeing in the seat of power in order to take that first step forward it's very difficult because of all the wrong information\nAnd everything else that is going on in session the medical world of today what do you think about it\nWill also not always the stations or they're in but also I Would say the conditions are every single fast food restaurant we passed these days\nI'm ... use the word evil too lightly but these places\nYou're not really a ... good health so we have to be very careful to guard against that you're making with regard to the food into these places that men are much image of course but you all know we are out there and it's just best to try and embrace healthy diets\nMake the decision making on your health and to Dr ... start\nSwelling thank you so much for making it easier for me to expand on this issue of\nThe aspects of uh making decisions are what are the different aspects of one of them of course is say dietary aspect and the other one is different parts of our lifestyle that has to be also a little bit dealt with in a more intelligent way\nAnd I think that uh we we always have the choice and uh when uh this is what I'm trying to get to see if\nWe are not happy and we don't feel good about ourselves chances are we won't be in that seat of power to make the right decision have you been there had you really felt that maybe if you are not able to a feel good for yourself you can really make a good decision\nOnly every day in the week treasury put much thought it was\nSeven billion people on planet\nEarth in Los Angeles viewing the trumpet lately there it is\nYes yes and that and you know with respect to my profession of course a medical doctor and a person who sees patients we see Katie chronic kidney disease and seeing\nWhat is the direction of ah their pass from a little bit of kidney disease to more severe degree of kidney disease and eventually needing dialysis\nI have seen that a lot of times it starts with a very simple choice that people can make\nAnd change that direction towards negative [noise]\nCan you make like a music of your soul to the music that I can be very very left with a big music makes me want to move a little down here but first I Want to just talk about the serious issue right now\nAnd that is that we have CDs and CD means chronic kidney disease and with that uh we have different stages from one to five and a a a lot of times people I see our ... to when when they\nJust you leave them alone for a while you see that they are left on their own and they are not educated ride and they are misinformed you see that that\nUh that isn't going to be a totally different thing when you see them in six months or a one

... my shoulders and I'm just like what\nThat is wonderful you say to Georgia do you want to talk about uh that's proposition eight or you want to talk about different types of dance to the music of yourself you choose\nOh talk a little bit about both I guess I've been watching proposition they said that dies on television and you make movies and on the air time cos seems that everyone is telling us to vote no on why because they say that more people are gonna be turned away from dialysis units in shelters are already overcrowded emergency rooms\nWell it seems like the people who are ... probably should have a lot of money behind them\nTo do so I think about um yes on proposition\n... what do you do what we don't want to say our opinion no no I'm not sure that we believe in\nThe inner beauty of this nation this nation just needs to be educated in a very unbiased\nWay shots of labor that's all I Want to say shall I say this is a I mean I in some ... what\nIs the substance of this proposition [noise]\nIt seems from what I needed to him for that money is going to be taken away from Dallas to seize large dialysis units if we vote yes for proposition and more patients who need dials care\nWill be shoved into emergency rooms that seems to be with you is\nThat is that finally and boating down to the fact that um that privately insured patients are going to be taking care of as a matter of cutting Medicare eight is that what it is\nIt's it's very possible it it just tells me that basically there's an enormous amount of money to be lost by the large facilities if proposition ... is passed which is why so many people are asking us people like you and me to vote or just a [laughter]\nWell first of all I Want to invite America to call and telephone number out the studio of chaotic LA is eight six six eight seven zero five seven five to\nEight six six five eight I'm Sorry I said again eight six six eight seven zero five seven five two so I Want you to call in and ask your specific questions\nBut to actually from what I Can't understand as by there is going to be a downgrade on the payment\nOf a dialysis treatment to dialysis unit whether they're a large or small a there is going to be a last payment for dialysis treatment for privately insured patients and it's going to be brought down to that level of of Medicare\nMedi care rate has a set fee for every dialysis treatment regardless of what the dialysis unit who's going to charge the patient or the insurance company that is they're really and you know they're the balls and they make\nAll the ruling and everything so that is Medicare right and that that off the land and they have\nTo say bright they have the final say so um this is what this proposition eight comes down to\nThat if someone has a private insurance and their insurance company he's able to pay eight ten times more than the Medicare right that has to be kept in place and continue their weight has been put all these years\nNow it doesn't matter if it's a small unit or large unit\n[noise] don't you don't you know that's\nHow I had ever been to Syria sorry can\nYes thank you so much for the um for playing music I Can't be too serious in my head\nThat [laughter] but anyway\nThat music that makes you happy no matter how serious you\nAre you still can feel that pain or happiness or happiness is that feeling of happiness that comes from you your shoes south not what they show us company tells you to know what that dialysis industry or that doctor tells you that you\nKnow who believes that should not get on dialysis if you don't need it you will believe you can prevents progression of kidney disease from stage one to five\nAnd eventually needing dialysis by controlling your blood pressure and keeping it a hundred twenty

lot more by their private insurance if they keep that same rate of payment is not about how to improve quality of life of people\nWho are diagnosed with E S R D or end stage renal disease America [noise] get smarter\nAnd for that you need to do something different something that is a little unconventional [noise] you know what that is right [laughter]\nThat's called dance to the news of

I've been deeply involved with tumor researchers in India and seeing all of that and with Reza Vera trial I've worked with scientists in Europe\nAnd also in California in ... in South Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity to investigate these things in the field meet with the top scientists than my conclusion is that green tea\nKirk human from to recruit and ... from red wine are remarkable health financing agents that everybody can benefit from the very very substantial way\nLet's talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're all found in our diet in all considered super feeds the green tea humid there was very ... why do you want to combine this read there's always a message to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect they make each other more spending you call it a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason to\nPut them all in separate product they do go very well together as you said they're all food derived so it's kind of like\nYou can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in groups of protective compounds that are both\nAntioxidant so they actually retired the aging process of the cells in our bodies\nAnd protect our organ systems so they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough I also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract Kirk human extracting ... in\nOne product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nNow let's dive into the headlines in the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing I nobody should they be using it for thousands of years for the G\n... what are you seeing recently in the press you know you told me the nutrition research journal in July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased\nPlasma anti oxygen activity and have blood get assigned you recap\nSome of these headlines and tell me why you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity\nIs really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume ... don't actually\nWind up in the body in any significant amount\nThe green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed\nThey improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is you get this great concentration of antioxidants substances\nWhich a protective compounds floating around in the body and protecting the cells of your body your organs every part of your body from premature\nDestruction due to exposure to environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to fire on when we take in\nThe right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are the right antioxidants our bodies produce more of its own super protective compound called\nGlue to ... so you're taking the green tea extract\nYou build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called glue to fire on so it is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplement ingredients do\nBut it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nRight let's switch gears and talk about this human which is number two on you by the way these three ingredients are all found in the new green tea combo formula will be offering free bought on a few minutes but talk to me about the human which is spelled C.
