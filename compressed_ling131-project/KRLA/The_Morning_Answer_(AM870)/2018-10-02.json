E. here we are on a Tuesday learning more about the expansion\nOf the FBI background check into Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh Jennifer here's what we know we know a couple of things mark judge who the a Senate Judiciary\nCommittee did not subpoena mhm uh he was interviewed a talk too by the FBI according to a lawyer we don't have any details of what mark judge remember mark judge is the only witness a\nExcuse me that was in the bedroom where Dr Christine for a ledges and alleged on Thursday before the U.S Senate that the sexual assault perpetrated upon her by Brett Kavanaugh happened right so march out just testimony under oath and answers to the FBI become terribly important\nThat's right and he's already submitted his lawyer has sent in sworn statements which are also under the penalty of perjury that that the event did not happen and he's denied it so of course he's an extremely important piece to all of this and it's important I think of anybody except for the people making the claims he's probably the most significant character in this for the FBI to talk\nTo another update as we're probably what day to day three and to the FBI investigation if they started over the\nWeekend on friday or Saturday show\nHere we go they have also spoken with Deborah Ramirez Deborah Ramirez uh was the second accuser who came forward and I'm alleged that Brett Kavanaugh during their high school years or during their first year at Yale University to be more specific exposed himself\nA an a a certain part of his anatomy made contact or the exposed himself in the direction of her face and there was some contact made so those interviews a according to reports had happened\nPresident Trump yesterday at the White House after talking about the U.S Mexico Canada trade agreement to replace NAFTA which of course we'll talk about more in a few moments president says the FBI should do what they have to do with regard to judge Brett Kavanaugh\nI think the FBI should do what they have to do to get to the answer at the same time just so we all understand I Want the FBI this is now their seventh investigation so it's not like that you know just starting a I Want them to do a very comprehensive investigation whatever\nThat means according to\nThe senators and the Republicans and the Republican majority I Want them to do that\nI Want it to be comprehensive I actually think it's a good thing for judge Kevin ... I think it's actually a good thing not a bad thing I think it's a good thing now with that being said I'd like it to go quickly and the reason I like it to go quickly very simple because it's unfair to him at this point\nPresident Trump goes on to a raise a few eyebrows and say without saying about things he seen senators Democrats up to during\nHis time pretty wild in Washington DC this is the wildest of the Trump clips for this early morning six o'clock club a meeting\nI tell you what I happen to know some of the United states senators\nWarner who is on the other side\nWho's pretty aggressive\nI've seen that person in very bad situations\nI've seen that person in very very bad\nSituation somewhat compromising\nPresident Trump does not reveal a who that person is on the lighter side or the president joked about himself and uh and and you'll hear that when he asked reporters are not to ask cabinet question\nMr President now that you've been through several questions on trade I'd like to try to I don't have it all you do have new out she has me do have a question of dread will you one or two more questions several questions Dr that that's not identify somebody is before it excuse me don't do that\nYou have a question on trade he went there are several clay you have a question on trade my question is an jacket shifts FBI sent interview whoever they believe that appropriate does that include Julie flattening the third accuser and can you promised to release the phone line to give me a question I asked her they finished their report Mr President gave me a question plus [noise]\nGet rid of my list fired up President Trump having a little difficulty with uh the enemy of the American people the so called fake news\nCycle rockets press conference yesterday because he really did engage quite a bit with the media and the media I I Know they want to get their questions answered but it's that they were really pressing pretty hard after he said limitations we're answering questions entree now we'll get together in a moment\nYeah but you got to be a bowl like uh the lake Sam Donaldson or it might still be living from ABC News I'm Sam Donaldson necessarily get in there during the Reagan Iran Contra misstep peasant and he would insist the questions we answered a President Trump took time during this a\nPress conference you're hearing the highlights two more to go here yesterday where he told the audience I he said that he was um he he was surprised to learn how much ah how much Brett Kavanaugh lights beer the president points out that he's not a drinker I'm not a drinker I'm not a drinker\nCan honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay\nSo one of my totally good traits I don't for\nWhatever they're looking for something good as I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I've just you know for whatever reason [noise] can you imagine if I had what message\nSelf deprecating humor anyone who seeks to be funny rule number one is be funny yep rule number two in my opinion tell more jokes about yourself tell a million more jokes about you where you are the punch line the butter the joke\nBecause you than you ever tell about anybody else\nThe only way you don't seem really mean right you have to go off and and make fun of yourself just like you'd make fun of anybody out and I just know me so well and I know all the material about me so I can write twenty minutes on me without even talking about power and yet every day All right that's right\nThat's right exactly [noise] All right so uh this is where we are a ... there there are there are I saw this morning Alaska\nThey sent a reporter to Alaska her that all you did okay home state of Lisa Murkowski female Republican or if she decides to vote against a president of excuse me judge Kavanaugh then it's virtually over\nShe's a swing along with Susan Collins and a Jeff Flake remains still a swing vote on the general vote on the Senate floor they had men all adults women and men and they asked uh what would you think of Lisa Murkowski if she voted to confirm a\nBrett Kavanaugh and every one of them said we would not support her in the future we would not vote for her again as women and men in the state of Alaska so if that CNN piece dissenting indicator that's the type of\nFeedback Senator Lisa Murkowski facing this decision about voting on or against judge Kavanaugh to send to the Supreme Court is dealing with she's dealing with this type of input from the people who were vote to re elect her\nAnd I just thought to polls that came out overnight and I will I'll pull them out that during the program we'll talk more about him but in Arizona and in West Virginia I Would say specifically Joe Manchin is under the same kind of stress where or he is any very close race for his Senate seat\nAnd about Seventy percent of his state in this new poll supports the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh so he's another one of these senators is happening on both sides of the aisle where this political pressure is really tough to to figure out if the senator should\nVote for or against Kavanaugh it matters more than just whether or not they think he did it now and also impact their political future so a lot of pressure for some Republicans and Democrats alike and all that learning\nMore about some wild times of a young Brett Kavanaugh Nineteen eighty five in college in a bar fight that story is circulating will bring you the details as we continue thanks for joining us on the morning answer it six Fifteen\nStuck in traffic we\nThink they're starting to feel that that you try to me that an ... kind of I Know about televised that they said something and then you get in the polling along the one in five and he went down some link traffic a downy ... coming up on the intended Wyoming ten\nAnd the Catholic according sponsored by the Orange County on us out on a shelf Anaheim conventions in October ... over ten minutes on a new contract that the the sound of selling my income high maintenance on the move all male Amie Seventy the answer\nBeing\nKevin on the Supreme Court justice has been\nSeen a nominated for any position they have in that manner accusations funny lines of denial arguments and frankly we've reached the point where it's time to the surface\nOnly comfortable moving forward\nAnd tell me I have done more investigation and they have all\nThat reality leave right out in front of our ears and I will the judge you get to the Supreme Court or not they used to use and talk and you can trust I Am a Seventy the\nAnswer there added again could hit another attempt to add more\nGovernment bureaucracy to health care law this time and proposition ... and who is behind date one labor union trying to impose new government bureaucracy on every medical dialysis clinic in California\nUh if if a if we're dealing with someone who in their youth\nDrank to blackout and never receipt and and and maybe maybe was an alcoholic or I Know a lot about alcohol as my father suffered with alcoholism I'm an addict myself a vicious um\nIf it's untreated and certainly Brett Kavanaugh doesn't it meant a problem so certainly has not admitted any treatment is is fear that his judgment could be impaired\nAs a result of adult contemporary drinking would that be a reason to ah prevent him from being just one of only nine on the U.S Supreme Court\nI think it just to answer all of your questions about alcohol because it really is kind of all pushed together for me I think anybody who\nI had a drinking problem in the past and his and recovery should not be eliminated from that position because there are some of the hardest working people that I Know in my life who have tried to overcome something because they want to better themselves that if Kavanaugh never went to portray those people\nWould be an issue for me I think it's important to whether people are running for political office or reading or wanting to be a member of the Supreme Court if you're not functional\nDuring the day because you're not going to all the time all of course that's an issue but I don't think someone who casually or socially drink a beer or a glass of wine should be not allowed on the Supreme Court because\nI think there are plenty of people who drink a glass of wine who are good qualified people who live upstanding lives and who don't get into trouble I think a judgment gets impaired when you are an alcoholic who is non functional or an addict to his non functional obviously then that\nShould be considered but we have no evidence to believe what we're well\nIn his testimony he said he drank too much too much beer well he was a young person okay and and and uh do we assume that's no longer happening that you're an alcoholic Vinge drunk I Know I Know the definition of al ... and certainly alcoholism does that mean that he doesn't do it any more as an adult I does he said he he said he still likes it still light here\nAnd I like why do you think I'm an alcoholic\nNo but you've never told me you you've you've consumed wine in excess and gotten fall overdrawn right\nI I don't I think maybe some time sensitivity especially because of our history we have alcoholism and our family maybe it rings a little ... I think somebody who says they like beer and they still like to have a beer\nIs still a sane ... great functioning contributing member of society who has a great judicial record I don't think that there's any admission that there is a problem with alcoholism that judge Kavanaugh I made when he was under oath and testifying last\nQuestion during the seven day FBI expanded background check of the background of Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh stand in Chino we'll talk to and get an answer to this one if the FBI and they are questioning determines that when characterizing his drinking according to sworn testimony of witnesses who were with him when he drank\nA during high school and college if his claim\nThat um he he uh he never blacked out he suffered\nNo memory losses if that claim is proven to be false that would be perjury because the Senate Judiciary testimony is offered under oath\nIf it is shown by the FBI investigation that the nominee committed perjury before the senators who would vote on his confirmation would that perjury be a disqualify her stand would perjury disqualified this nominee\nIn there if you have you ever heard of you\nKnow we're not we're not talking about a young we're talking about the man who testified on Thursday of Thursday he committed perjury in his testimony or at fifty three or whatever the judges ages now would that be a disqualify her\nI think so because again the advantage so\nNo but we're not talking about the event we're talking about if\nYou knowingly committing perjury ...\nIn the car might be confused by the question so I'll ask you if you knowingly at his current age lied under oath to the U.S senators about his background committing perjury felony would that be disqualified he knowingly\nUnintentionally lied under oath I think that would be an issue yeah I was an issue for me with Bill Clinton\nI and I think it to be fair and consisted of Bill Clinton and Pete that's right we need to be fair inconsistent and knowingly committing perjury is different than if he said well I don't think I remember that so ... if he really went out there and told them offers and he did it under oath of course that would make us question his character\nAs we continue morning answer Brian and Jennifer here for a Tuesday have you had your first cup of coffee at you'll be happy to do you live and the Golden

review must be finished by the end of this week Trump address the issue yesterday at the White House\nThey should interview but they should also be guided and I'm being guided by what the senators are looking for should Brett Kavanaugh be interviewed by the FBI\nThink so I think it's fine if they do\nBut the only leader Mitch McConnell also weighed in on the issue sing the Senate will be voting on

I I vaguely remember people but I'm not quite\nSure not hundred per cent she\nSays she Julie sweating it Kevin to assert accuser called by some and media the weakest a accuser yet in terms of the story being flimsy uh I I don't know if I agree with that determination but it's not my place to to make that determination\nUh she says there she contacted the Montgomery County police was ... which is what you said Jennifer women should always do absolutely and uh she did that show the FBI is conducting a seven day investigation of these three known accusations against judge Kavanaugh will then go to Montgomery County police I'm sure they've got a record\nOf that phone call that report that Julie sweating acclaim she made back when they were college students\nProblem is is that she was a college student the rest of them were in high school and her claim is a bit fuzzy well she said she went to the police which she may have I'm sure that there's probably document if she did that\nNo one was ever named even in this interview with NBC News she said well he could have been there I think he was there but I don't know exactly what he did so to come out and say and do take very seriously what is happening and the the weight of the allegations that are being thrown around\nAnd of course if there's a police report and background evidence we should see that it's my understanding that she's starting to change your story a bit by being kind of vague as to whether or not he was even there but she would assume that he was\nShe's telling a cage snowed NBC that she was a victim of right that's right but but she's not saying by Brett Kavanaugh she saying she saw Brett Kavanaugh sort of among\nThese parties with this thing would happen repeatedly in the scene\nAnd among the males who who some of who of whom did things like this a more on the memory of Julie sweat Nick here\nOh and the boys standing outside and rooms congregated together so like an outlet and I didn't know what was occurring out that I Would say them laughing alive laughing I'm\nFalling in line outside or an online but definitely huddled by doors and I didn't understand what it could possibly day and you're declaration you describe\nThat cabin on his friend mark judge standing outside seen them stand outside the door\nAnd you're suggesting that in hindsight you think he was following this behavior\nI I it's just too coincidental I cannot specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me\nThat happened to me at that party I saw that catalog there\nI saw mark judge there and they were hanging about the area where\nI started to feel disoriented\nWe're the room was where the other boys were hanging out\nLaughing I can share them laughing and laugh at\nIt very hard for me to talk about this but it's important that somebody says something because\nIf Brett Kavanaugh\nWas one of those people that did this thing there is no way in the world that he should go Scott Free on this and that he should be on the Supreme Court just I\nJust think about ... if he does\nRaise our justice for all\nAgree with my conservative friends who listen to Julie sweat next the third accuser of Brett Kavanaugh I don't mean my conservative friends because there are conservatives you don't think Brett Kavanaugh\nIs worthy of a seat on the Supreme Court so I don't want to lump ... forgive me I don't want to lump anybody into a group and assume that you think a certain way because you're a Democrat or Republican or or an independent person I I Will agree with the ...\nOh who are defending cabin off from what they feel it's like a media pile on a ... this person a missed sweating it is not claiming that Brett Kavanaugh did anything to her she's claiming she goes on to say that what happened to her was horrendous an awful\nRight up there it was if something happened to her it was around is an awful\nUnlike Dr Christine Ford who said unequivocally she's one hundred percent certain Brett Kavanaugh committed sexual assault against her miss sweating it is not at all certain and doesn't even plane that Brett Kavanaugh committed the act a said\nOpinion and that's okay because they do a good job I Want someone to be like oh well she's sitting in the room with Brian Whitman because she has something to say because she is smart because she represents her conservative values in a good way maybe she makes me smile every once in a while I don't want them to come in here and say well\nWomen needed a check to work with so they brought you in ...\nThat to me is so insulting to women and it pushes us so far back that Jerry Brown who's trying to\nAdvance that has now sort of all bitten women and California and they're here\nAnd we're talking about California and the state's plan to become the first state in America to mandate women on corporate boards I think Jennifer and I have a eloquently a explained our opposition\nBut from the other side listen to the statistic according to the board governance research which is a group I guess a a government group that monitors these types of things women held just Fifteen Percent\nOf the board seats of California based public companies in twenty Seventeen and you might say well there are fewer women in the workforce and then I I think that I don't know quite frankly anymore if that's true I Know we're coming out in twenty Eighteen I Know America is\nComing out of an era that looked like Mad Men the television show when men just were controlling everything and by the way a look at the U.S Congress it's all most exclusively\nA ... it's a heavy majority of of of white men uh to me I said that there's a problem when corporate boards are filled sometimes exclusively when a when businesses and and decision makers\nAll look the same and I mean the color of their skin and escaped and their gender white men I Do think that's a problem and I do think it's a problem that women have only Fifteen Percent aboard she sat means eighty five percent of the decision makers in California public corporate boards on the boards are men\nI think we just are doing so much this form of governing to me robs people of dreams and it robs people of the success of achievement and this is very philosophical for me you hear me talk about socialism and how I get opposed\nThe idea is put out by Bernie Sanders the young people seemed to to grip them I understand that the sponsors of the ... who are two females state senator said that they did some survey that said it'll take fifty years to achieve gender parity okay we're all ready in the process of raising strong women in fact I think we're raising strong limited the detriment\nOf men I don't think we are raising as many strong men anymore in culture I don't know if they even know where they fit anymore but we're doing that for girls we're giving women the opportunities\nLet women achieve and dream and get there and have the feeling of reward instead of just plucking them in and taking out a way it is so unfair lettuce plush let's break that feeling that everybody's talking\nAbout will take a phone call or two or as were ahead of the Donald daily download I Would say uh that men boys don't need that because all of our presidents have been have been men who were once poised a boys look on TV and they look to government and they see a lot of um men\nWho demographically look like them they're white men and these are white boys I I I think boys who are white in America is still liberal position I don't just ... I go into ... I'm not trying to run from it I think white boys in America have plenty of public role models I also think a black\nOr a young adults or or boys who are black or or girls I think they all have role models I secondary he found but my my point is this\nUm and you'll have to take the last word in and have to do it in Fifteen seconds is\nRight now it's only Fifteen Percent women if we're going to get to gender parity and if every woman in America is going to have the gender parity that you share with me on this broadcast once they totally male dominated medium or you're one of the lucky ones what about the others who don't have the blessings you have well\nI'm also one of the ones that have worked really hard I work\nSixteen to Eighteen hours a day and that has no life still to this day I work really hard so I can enjoy some of the places that I've brought myself it's not because I Believe me I Am lucky I Am black they understand all of that but it's not because I haven't worked hard I've worked hard and that's the lesson that should be shared with other women and to your point it's not about men\nNot having role models are not being advanced in society that we're not giving men\nTheir place in the new society where women are out there in the workplace where women are achieving things I don't believe I I think that we still are not training boys to be men\nAs we continue morning answer Donald daily download coming up it's seven thirty\n[noise] is your answer to morning\nMinutes a day the Rhine and why we haven't taken that in ... valley for police activity on the cutting more than ... than the three ... shut down their thing at the top it off the rack and not ... they're investigating the team now wearing on when their claws reopened that right now everything can come out\n[noise] and you're going to the ... as you had him as you can learn how to do there there's your back in that block and that's a far right lane and you're getting the jam up from receipt of the ... and then there's also a crash in the long run I went anyway than I Hope\nBack that stuck in a ...

thank you and your the lovable conservative and my ... the happy warrior when you're the lovely concern I think you are\nIn a every way I might add a let me say that uh you know some people say I just got a very nice treat from she goes over there is there you are there is our love bull liberal that's the Brian we love wherever\nYou because you were talking common sense when ah when we were talking about Jerry Brown ordering women must sit on a publicly traded board\nYeah I had a position that admittedly it was probably not the typical liberal position but uh uh I guess the cabinet thing is is what she's referring to you you know where have you been look I'm just honest and ... and I don't think\nUh I don't come to the same conclusions that people who wear the label I wear or belong to the party that I Belong to I don't come to the same conclusions that they do all the time uh I'm not saying that Republicans do that some of them do many Democrats and many Republicans are monolithic\nIn fought I Am not and I'm also a bit unpredictable which I think makes for interesting radio\nBut it's always honest people ask you if you wanted to have you on the funding and boy the funniest thing is that down hall people come up to Jennifer and they asked her about it\nThey say it does he really they look at me and then also Sarah and I know it's going to come when you look at me\nAnd we meet in person to learn to face they're nice people and oh absolute are you kidding I Love to hug everybody that comes up to me you know I Love meeting are the people that lived in Russia because I feel like we're we know them but anyway I can always tell what's going to come out of the mouth because they come up to me and they look at me and they pause and they say it's really nice to meet you and that's so sweet and then their head will cook probably a little to the right\nAnd they look up to me with these guys and they say\nIs it really true just really believe all the crazy stuff that he says\nAnd I look at him and say oh you better believe it or if\nHe does believe it I don't live on the radio a growing number of American voters believe that Brett capital should not be\nConfirmed to the Supreme Court now listening to this forty eight percent of voters shed and a Quinnipiac survey after hearing Dr pushing forward last week the Senate should give the thumbs down to judge Kavanaugh that's forty eight percent okay\nThat's up from forty one percent who said last month that he should not be confirmed so that's an increase of seven percent of Americans uh moved significantly by Christine forge testimony saying no thumbs down on Capitol know survey just came out yesterday\nIt also shows that forty two percent of Americans surveyed say that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed to the U.S Senate so alternately forty eight percent of Americans say no uh-huh don't confirmed Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court shouldn't replace Justice Kennedy\nForty two percent of Americans said do it confirmed them getting to the dry cleaners but a robot them and get them on that Supreme Court is interesting and then Jennifer I'm really interested in your feedback here\n[noise] independents people who are not Republicans are not Democrats are they decide many elections in this country certainly uh they just I think there's reasons for the results of the of the last presidential race we had uh\nIndependents who supported the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court just last month have now flipped on him forty five percent shed yeah confirming back in September\nA now the opposition to his confirmation is forty nine percent to thirty nine percent so when the people in the middle who are really not partisan have turned on someone like Kavanaugh I Wonder if the White House and I I\nThey say they're not thinking about we had that the president's not thinking about a backup plan you'd be crazy not to at this point because anything can happen Kavanaugh's family is white Mrs Cabot, Arkansas honey I Can't do this anymore\nRight well I think the I mean obviously the FBI needs to conclude the investigation that was that was ordered and I think that's where it's determined to a judge Kavanaugh just for the record has never been overwhelmingly popular as far as public opinion in fact President Trump picked him if you can believe that because he was considered to be\nThe safe one on the list because they there wouldn't be as much fodder for Democrats and critics to go after with Brett Kavanaugh\nThere are other reasons and other theories that President Trump picked\nI Know I'm just telling your mind right now and my area that he and I am not alone in this was considered to be one of the same ones on the list the one that President Trump seemed to want to go for with Amy Barrett but they thought that she would be torn apart by the left because she didn't have a long\nHistory she didn't have the judicial records that Kavanaugh dead to turn over we have a history with cabin we know what he stands for as far as his judicial decisions we know how he makes his mind up and so that was why Trump went with him\nOriginally as far as the polling goes the polling doesn't mean much to me because the president no matter who you are gets to pick the candidate and then the Senate gets taken from them or not but it is an indicator of how important is it and how impactful it will be on the midterm elections because you have a lot of Democrats in red states you are\nUp for reelection that are pressured to confirm Kavanaugh and then you have a lot of of Republicans who are also up for election in states where maybe Trump isn't as popular who are also going to have to figure out whether or not they should confirm Kavanaugh\nWhen you said the pole in your opinion doesn't mean much of this is where you and I disagree the poll shows that since the testimony which many myself included believe is a and was credible the testimony of Dr Ford her allegation of sexual assault a made\nA last Thursday before the Senate Judiciary committee again she claims that Brett Kavanaugh committed that sexual assault judge Kavanaugh vehemently denies that allegation says it never happened since that event the\nEvery morning breaking news and talk you can trust this is the center with Brian Mann Jennifer Horn thanks for joining us on your Tuesday Morning answer Brian and Jennifer here the saga continues\nTo confirmation hearing the expanded FBI background review of judge Brett Kavanaugh going on now it's supposed to be seven days long limited in scope into the uh the allegations made by three women are who are not anonymous they are named against a Brett Kavanaugh and they run the gamut\nOf the third which will hear from the accuser Julie sweating it I think is the flimsy is it has to if she doesn't really even claim\nThat Brett Kavanaugh did anything to her she claims that he was in a scene among\nPeople doing things that were bad too young women uh but she makes no direct playing against Kavanaugh here's one from the New York times this morning out of New Haven Connecticut where I actually worked on the radio for three months in New haven yeah I did\nAs an undergraduate student at Yale University Brett Kavanaugh was involved in an altercation at a local bar during which he's accused of throwing ice in the face of another patron\nIn ...\nAccording to the police report you know the FBI I'm sure they've on earth to this is part of their the incident occurred in September of Nineteen eighty five during Mr Kavanaugh's junior year\nAt Yale it resulted in Brett Kavanaugh and four other guys being questioned by the New Haven police department Kavanaugh was not arrested but the police report stated that are Twenty one year old man accused Brett Kavanaugh of throwing ice on him quote for some unknown\nReason and [noise]\nAnd uh it was Nineteen eighty five I but I I Would I'd like to believe that he threw the ice from a a solo go beyond that I but there's no\n... flashed it over in that direction so now a cabinet was questioned by the way and uh he did not want to say if he threw the ice or not according to the police report well yeah can you blame 'em he pled the fifth on that this ... this is so crazy because all the headline saying they're questioning him about a bar fight\nOkay even if it's all through the worst thing that it says about him that he threw some ice in a bar when he was a a teenager right Eighteen Nineteen years old or the second year at Yale or he was\nIn his junior year right it is ... ... when your one year away from graduating college you're about Twenty one or twenty and I think you're an adult\nSo early twenties late teens or whatever it is he drew some ice if you believe all of their stuff that within their report we don't have a confirmation from him or denial\nDoes that does qualify him from sitting on the Supreme Court because I've thrown ice that people I'm going to admit it and maybe this is going to ruin my career as a Supreme Court justice but I'm just a few cubes in my lifetime and and I think I'm Still a good person I've never I you argue like I'm functional you are\nFunctional and you're a good person I've never thrown ice at any one eye witness wants a terrible bar fight or on riverside drive I got so scared the ... I ran out of there I watched the guy\nI'm I was in the restroom ... always have to say you know I was in the gender neutral restaurant or a and then the men's room and these are these guys are playing pool I won't say the name of the bar which is not there anymore to think or maybe it is it's on riverside written\nStudio city and the guy came in and I was you know washing my hands are about to exit and Jennifer she was having conflict with a guy and now the guy who was having conflicts with was using the urine and standing facing the wall the guy came in with a pool stick\nAnd ... it's a serious piece of lumber he cracked it over the guy's head\n... crazy the guy went of course right now of course unconscious passed out and then people are getting hit with pool sticks in the edge it's really scary so that's my bar fight story I was on involved I live like\nPfizer scary like a girl I ran out of\nThere however here's why this story's important but I've seen people throw stuff like if I mean you haven't you turn to roll it somebody I\nThink he's real highlight or Kevin our producer I've done that okay so that was actually to kill it's not that you're trying to kill anybody and I didn't throw it at him I threw it at the glass to get his attention right so you know somebody who wants to take you down to come after you have that allegation here's an allegation of light or throwing Whitman\nHere's a point in a moment we'll hear President Trump saying the FBI should do what they have to do to investigate a Brett Kavanaugh I think that what we're seeing here now certainly beginning with Dr Christine Ford's letter and her testimony and two other accusers\nAnd yesterday the guy who went to school to Gail a stocky guy I forget his name came out here I think it was his college roommate saying that Brett Kavanaugh's characterization of his relationship with alcohol\nOr before the Senate Judiciary committee was false one he was being dishonest\nI think we're seeing a\nA very different Brett Kavanaugh than the\nTurn of phrase a that ... to use the phrase coined by others than the choir boy who coaches CYO basketball\nWho is a good conservative man with the beautiful family ah who was too busy in school to have any fun because he was always studying to be first Yale we're seeing but we're we're seeing a very different guy\nWho by his own admission drank excessively or more than once and by the testimony of of the at least three women who have been identified was a while drunk just makes me so sad but Jennifer ... let me finish the point\nWe're seeing a very different account of this young man we're seeing a very different character portrait we're seeing a very different profile of character of Brett Kavanaugh uh then he offered to the Senate now\nPeople are saying what they want to see people are CEO and they want to take from it we see a lot of what I see a lot of political people\nTrying to posture and trying to to weaponize these accusations and I don't see a lot of people who really actually just want to know the truth and that's that's sad because\nIt's not about whether Brett Kavanaugh drinks a beer or whether we should judge him on his behavior when he was Eighteen in fact I Would like to know how many people would like to be judged on their behavior when they were Eighteen years old how many of his editors\nIs very different than what you said a couple\nOf weeks but how many senators would want to be judged on the type of partying what I said a couple of weeks ago was that somebody who commit sexual assault someone who is a rapist commits more than one crime and alcohol sure as heck\nDoes not drive them in that direction and I believe those people are the people we should be very concerned about if judge Brett Kavanaugh drank too much if he got drunk a couple of times in high school and if he threw ice at a bar is more than that does not disqualify what was your about what we should be worried about is the truth instead we're talking about what\nWe're ... we need to know if he's a sexual predator that's what we need to know okay good that's not good and none of these allegations lead me to think that he is anything but being taken down ... left leaning media good\nQuestion uh you said you want to know the truth and you want to know if he's a sexual predator it very credible woman who the president of the United states called credible who passed the lie detector test with flying colors stated under oath\nThat she is one hundred percent certain that ... that she was sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh if you say you want the truth and if you say you want to know a\nThen focus on those allegations and if you believe her\nWhen she says she's one hundred percent true\nShe's one hundred percent on us if you say you believe her well there's your evidence people say there is no evidence a woman under oath\nSays she's a doctor professor with no history of wacky history and and no political uh you know ... she's not a ... you don't share resist movements and all that it you know she she says under oath she's one hundred percent certain that had happened on the flipside mhm you have\nThe accused who admits to drinking excessively says he didn't blackout ever a but the people who went to school with him said that's not true he's being dishonest about his relationship with alcohol a which person is more credible that's really an important\nAspect of the better way to frame it no no no the new age my doctor for\nI don't want to reframe I ... the ... I've characterized both people ... and ... and a factual way which person is more credible\nThey are both credible why does it look and this is what I've been telling you forever Dr Ford presented a credible story and judge Kavanaugh who by the way it is a judge he's not just some party frat\nBoy who just found himself he nominated for the Supreme Court he worked for the George W. Bush White house he's had a long career and we know who he is\nWe don't try to tell me that he's not credible because he is credible and he has also said one hundred percent which certainty that he did not rape the person and so your credit but what happens next is if you have to credible people who are saying diametrically opposed things then let's look at the people who are supposedly in the room and there is no corroborating evidence\nOn either side in fact everybody that was supposedly there's that it didn't happen so that's\nThat to me it's more worth more\nThan whether or not he drank beer at sixteen but\nWe don't know what mark judge has told the FBI the interview continues this week will have report I guess by the end of the week uh how about perjury if judge Kavanaugh was dishonest before the Senate Judiciary committee under oath\nOr that's felony perjury for which Bill Clinton was impeached if it's shown by the FBI investigation that all of his classmates or at least enough of them say that he was dishonest\nTo people who live there the\nDifference between covina and west covina in a word to the mall\nCool All right direction Whitman aside from that you had a theory about how this whole cabinet thing's gonna break down in the end\nOf it there but I Would I ask you let me just make my point here because this is just that one of the respect the doctor for her testimony was that very credible and I'll tell you why and all around me to quit first of all\n... couldn't remember when she if she gave her in her therapist no what happened that we should remember who took her to the party or the traumatic experience Fifteen year old girl go to all the way and the little girl doesn't remember her mom or who took or they're\nTrying to you know you're you're making your point and and and you'll have the last word warm I\nWonder if part part of it [noise] and she said that she was afraid of flying and it was proven that she flies all over the world\nOkay ah as for thank you for the phone call and ask for the flying a there are a lot of people I'm afraid of flying but when the radio station said you can broadcast from the White House guest what I did I went with Jennifer LAX or a nervous wreck got on the airplane and flu and yeah so a lot of people do that but but but but to the points\nThat are germane to the assault that she alleges totally you know or if you don't you'll learn on the morning answer as Jennifer and I have been talking about our callers have been talking about women of called the program who are sexually assaulted a\nIt's a fact that when someone suffers trauma and by the way not just a sexual assault all types of trauma some details are forgotten a for example a Juanita Broderick\nCould not tell you the date she could not tell you she was on prime time maybe she knew she couldn't save the season of the year when she was allegedly raped by Bill Clinton by\nTwenty five years ago younger and a ... dollar dumber I went on the radio and said well that's not an ... an accusation with no credibility she can't even say if it was summer winter fall forget it for that accusation out and I was deluged with women who called me who were sexual assault victims\nWho said Brian I Love you but you're wrong it's very common for us to forget some important some some details like that\nOn the flip side Jennifer as we know we've discussed they'll sexual assault victims will remember as Christine Ford said in her testimony\nThe details that brought her to the Senate Judiciary committee and she remembers very clearly\nBeing pushed onto the bed the laughing uh the Brett Kavanaugh on top of her his hand over her mouth et cetera so I think it's unfair to dismiss her claim by saying she doesn't remember how she got home after\nThat yeah I mean look the human brain does a lot of things to protect ourselves sometimes we don't remember the details\nSometimes we remember the details wrong and sometimes I can remember things that happened twenty five years ago\nAnd I can tell you what I was smelling what I was hearing what's what sounds were going on what I saw and I can't tell you what I had for breakfast yesterday so our brain works in mysterious ways but I think to Tony point the thing that is interesting and worth exploring is why in the world she would say she couldn't fly\nAnd get to the Senate and time to testify\nWhen it because she was afraid of flying that was the excuse when we know that she does have a pattern of behavior that shows that she's flying and her legal team she didn't know who played paid for her polygraph that she didn't know who was paying for certain things that were some details missing in the logistics of what is happening now not thirty five years ago that are worth a few questions secrecy and\nFor all right as we continue on the morning answer we're going to fill you in if you're a Republican person some progress really know what you mean it progress being
