frailty a class dot com that's free OTC a class dot com\n[noise] this is how retraining radio back to the show [noise]\nWelcome back if you're just tuning in us Larry Jacobs director of a structure development and top instructor at online trading really shed some light on multiple things have been a little bit about half of income we talked a little bit about active income\nThen specifically spend a lot of time on that multiple streams of income side of things in the financial freedom that that can really generated I Love the the the the conversation about the the average millionaire having five plus streams of income\nAnd you can break that down into different directions but\nBut even the whole conversation we're having a few minutes ago Larry about about building the skill first the skill comes first the income comes later and so many times we want the income\nWe want the income now without the skill right how many how many times have you talked to a ... a surgeon and they said oh well you know what I'm going to do a little bit of surgery here I'm In a practice heart surgery so that I can pay for medical school and then develop the skill it just doesn't really work that way we've got to have the skill first\nOtherwise that operating table can be a dangerous spot to be laying now unfortunately it ends up being that same\n... that same conversation when it comes to our money and I had somebody say oh well this isn't life or death but really when we're talking about our finances it is our financial life or death so we really want to take this\nJustice seriously we work too hard for this money to have it not heading in the right direction on a consistent basis and this retirement money that we want to talk about in this segment is exactly that it's in a situation where we're usually just buying every other friday right just because it's paid and we've been told every other friday we're just supposed to put some money in our retirement accounts\nAnd it will just slowly growing and well that's true in a polish marketing a bearish market which was what you were just touching on right as we are going to break that kind of detrimental side of things we can continue to buy into assets that are deteriorating\nAnd it's a lot like lighting our retirement accounts on fire or at least a little portion of our paycheck\nWhen we're throwing it into a deteriorating asset so just a few of the things that we want to want to keep in mind one of the things I really love to have you Larry shed some light on in here because we do have a lot of our students\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talked to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know our number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right and that's really that point you were getting at before he took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of giving you the floor here to take that back over voter some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nRight and the number one mistake that most people may cause they do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education so we start talking to our students about is how they can start creating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement\nRight now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week one of my friends call me and he started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous not one student emailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years\nFor another market correction why because historically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen so what's now becoming more important than ever\nIs it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now well you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything shaved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you in a lot of our students come in the door really nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade\nOther asset types like futures in lately and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts\nSo again a lot of people first and they always say is well I got the mortgage I got the kids' college up on\nTheir retirement always comes last shall we start to teachers students read out the gate\nThat they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly\nWhat you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learning how to manage that need most importantly had to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you'll have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else who's telling you what you need\nYou you're talking about the kind of the cycles that the markets go through the big us in the big dams and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that as you go back and look at him how often\nThey're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of that average uh that we can expect is about a fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you kind of measure that you've got about a fifty percent drum Becky ... about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty say the same thing\nAnd so if we come to here we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about uh we uh we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about dropping accounts and at one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account\nAnd they lost fifty dollars and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value of that fifty thousand that happened in one year\nIt ... happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take the average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires they one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we're talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and saying yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit\nAnd then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could have been one of the greatest time of your life right now a flu shot at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction yep\nAbsolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow as you get 'em out to one of the half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half the costs are we going to see exactly that how to generate more income how to keep that retirement account growing\nHow to identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could\nYou could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of a conversation won't just second you have a chance to win a set of passes or one of these half day classes to get your bones writing if you are driving right now is a great time to pull over including ... year passes is going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nTo professional insider kitten makes it so you get started\nNow goes down through twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats\nBut it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that the poor is just the state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and they're so useful and and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got and hey for completely satisfied with where we are then then great let's continue to do what made us so happy and the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to create a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedom if we have a specific goal that we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to\nWe have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather share with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers I Would have to name all of them the first one is no your business the second one is be converted and that converted one as a youngster I\nHonestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down this is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary and and and in the beginning and that was the one I always kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became\nThe most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal that were after that one of the things we can do to help a few people get started with this is we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThey have to classes where you see exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances really taken truly a retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really live that life the drafter and just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of pass was one of these have take classes to get your bones writing if you are driving now is a good time to pulled over\nIncluded with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit now this professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when you get a call now and reserve those seats\nThe number is eight seven seven four zero three eight seven to three that's eight seven seven four zero three eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can scores from passes there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always like to say and I said earlier on the show is doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach that financial freedom goal that you're after\nWhat are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have your bags in bags loads of each of these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place there now and another\nWell the first thing we always understand here is that with trading it's simply a transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing and what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck to think about just time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you were coming up to the holiday season again we're gonna start seeing all these Jim commercials again right 'cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear a students say over and over again it's\nInside wishing having it had more time was this is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation again if you're a coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came in my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great just sent me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole another piece of it\nPeople go on vacation Ryan right and they get raided the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you or your training before after golf she goes before of course it I Love that\nOf course yeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago they did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kinda fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities and that's really what we introduce you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that inside of the half the class and we are\nPretty much at the end of the show but before we end where you say we do know that give away yeah let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here oh right right now we've got to have to a class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes\nTo really reached that financial freedom generating more income in the markets like I always say if you're why is big enough you will find out how how is out at the half the class now

Street Journal no and bringing my educational message directly to you with my very own radio program to Providence financial retirement show her every Saturday\nFor pm so joining me this Saturday a poor right here on an eight Seventy to answer [noise]\nYou suffer from joint pain like nagging sports injuries back pain ... achy shoulders arthritis finally treatments available to professional athletes are now available to you with Dr Darryl from Daryl stem cell Institute you find out more on living pain free with Dr Darrow today at ten am in one PM\nThat told everybody that something was wrong and somehow she was able to monitor that there was something flying around in our cabin\nObviously that's not good and I was asking her was it a bird was it a boss what was it and the way she described it unfortunately kind of sounded like a bat so my buddy and I decided to investigate then\nWe went inside the cabin and turn on the lights and grabbed a flashlight so we can see in some of the dark corners and we did a little bit of hunting\nAnd sure enough we found it right at the highest point of a twenty foot tall stealing there it was\nAnd sure enough it was a bat and we couldn't reach it there was nothing around there beside\nNot sure that I Want to reach it but I don't want it in the cabin but what do I do\nAnd so we Googled the fact that if there's a bat in your home what you want to do is you want to turn off all the lights and then shine a light by the door from outside the door so that the bat will wind up\nHeading towards the light and flying right out so we thought that sounded great and sure enough we did that and then we try and the flashlight on the bat from outside the door and we waited\nAnd I tried to move the flashlight around and shake it a little bit trying to get the attention and we waited to more and nothing happened\nOkay that didn't work so my buddy went inside the house and grabbed\nA towel and through a towel up at the bat hoping that maybe that would fly down and head towards the light and exit the premises but no that didn't work\nAnd I don't know anything about bad so I'm just kind of doing what Google told me\nHolding a flashlight by the door hoping apply doubt but what they do is it caused about to go flying around a little bit and the land in a place that was much lower that we can now easily reach\nBut we have to go up the staircase and kind of reach over to then get the bad and the same Google article told us that we could just use gloves or have a towel and kind of come up behind the bad just grab to that and then just carry it outside and I don't know about you but\nWe're talking about a bad I mean I've seen pictures of ads on TV and you think of count Dracula right this is not fun at ten thirty at night with all the lights off in the cabin but here we are within range of the bat and my buddy and I are downstairs with a towel and he starts they had that direction\nTo go get the bat and I said no no mark I'll do it because it was my cabin after all it wasn't his responsibility he was just visiting you shouldn't have to do it\nSo he gives me that's how he holds a flashlight I head up towards the bat and I got about three feet or so from the bat with Palin hat ready his mother the bat\nAnd I got to a point where I realized I don't know what's going to happen and there I was face to face with about three feet away\nAnd decided this may not be the smartest thing\nAnd you know what this is in our cabin they've got rangers I can make a call and have someone come over here and do this because I don't know\nWhat a batch response is going to be to being covered up with a towel and I pretty embarrassed about my next move but my next move was to turn around and say I'm not doing it let's\nCall maintenance have them come and do it do which my buddy said here give me the towel and unfortunately I did and he went up and grabbed it and brought it outside and released it so it could live happily ever after\nAnd here I Am bowing down to my buddy\nIn the shame of humiliation saying thank you um are forgetting about because I was too afraid to go get the bat and my buddy how to do for me\nSo what does all this has to do with the world the finances here's what it has to do with the world of finance is it has to do with the fact that I did not know what I could not have known then what I mean is that when we talk about what you don't know can hurt you\nWere talking about what you don't know that you should know can hurt you were not really talking about what you do know that you are not able to know\nSo for instance as I was headed up toward that bad I was not able to know what the bats response was going to be with the ... gonna fly off of the mantle and jump on my neck and suck the blood out of my neck\nOf course that's the vision I had when I turned around and ran away back down the stairs but I could not possibly have known\nWhat the bats response was going to be\nAnd there are certainly different levels of risk in life that when you take 'em you don't know what the outcome is going to be anyone that's ever started a business is going to tell you that they take a chance they take a risk you don't know what the outcome is going to be because you can't know what the outcome is going to be sure you can\nTake calculated risks and you can crunch all the numbers\nAnd you could do all the research and investigation possible to get to the point where it's not blind to risk but there is always going to be risk and there's always going to be things that you can't know as you're getting into it\nAnd then of course there are things that you don't know that you can no light required\nMinimum distribution the government says that when you reached Seventy and a half years old you have to take out they required minimum distribution and if you do know that then there's going to be a fifty percent penalty and this is an example of something you can know\nBut because of lack of knowledge simply don't know and that's a different kind of not knowing than the kind of not knowing that you can't know because you don't know what a response is going to be to a certain set of stimuli and I think that's important to understand that there's different kinds\nOf not knowing and yet does that mean that if there is something that you can not know that you're off the hook no it doesn't mean that at all you're still on the hook it just means\nThat you have to plan for the worst so what do you do if there's something that you don't know that you can't possibly know but that could affect your entire\nRetirement and determine whether or not it successful or a failure [noise] what do you do I mean that's a nice car you're listening to the Providence

com\nButter flattening yield curve seems to be telling us that what we're hearing out there that the economy is doing so well\nWith unemployment down below four percent inflation and starting to creep up may not be the entire picture there's more to the story and I think the yield curve gives us some big insight as to what a more maybe because when you of a ...\nA yield curve what it means is that investors are willing to\nBurn the same rate of return for nearly the same rate of return\nFor a longer term bonds as they are for shorter term bought and when we talk about a flat yield curve we have to be talking about bonds of the same risk quality and most of the times when you hear the term flat yield curve in the media they're talking about us treasuries are bonds issued by the federal government\nBecause virtually theirs is zero risk in federal bonds whether you're talking about two year bonds or ten year bond or thirty year bought let's face it as long as the government can print money than they're never default on the debt right I mean think about it what did you ever be late or default on a credit card payment if you could print money\nThat just makes sense now I Know there's a lot of you listening to this wondering whether that's going to be true and\nWhether that's going to continue that way and at the dollar is still going to be a world currency down the road I think there's a lot of questions there but not something I'm concerned with that definitely in the media moment and that's certainly a different conversation for a different show but ultimately when
