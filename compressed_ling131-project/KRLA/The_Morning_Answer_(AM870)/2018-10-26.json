all the probably as an office at Clinton's Clapper Brennan of course we're all in New York speaking of\nThe Clintons Chelsea Clinton the daughter if you're a of of if you're forty six like I Am you remember Chelsea Clinton being a twelve year old child moving into the White House and uh we're brutal to her people were brutal including one very prominent conservative talk radio host\nWho called her terrible names and you and I won't tell you who years but but you've heard his name and you can Google that on your own\nI don't know if he's ever apologized for it either\nBut a shift here ... uh she had parents who fiercely tried to protect her from the public spotlight Chelsea foundation the Chelsea foundation Chelsea Clinton is now thirty eight years old\nAnd a quarter of a to a report\nShe is mulling a run for political office if someone steps down or retires\nShe is the daughter of a former president of former presidential candidate and secretary of state she set ahead of an appearance to promote her children's book she's the author as well that she wouldn't rule out a run for office here's the ideal situation for Chelsea\nShe says that um if someone were to step down or retire and I thought I could do a good job at a match my talents I'd have to think of it to the right choice for me Chelsea told the journal news out of Westchester County in New York to find newspaper the\nDaughter of President Clinton talked about the circumstances under which you might consider political run their mothers rumored presidential bid and her work at the Clinton Foundation where she serves as vice chair now Chelsea Clinton at thirty eight ... went to Stanford we remember that I'm nor she studied history there she got a masters at Oxford\nUh she studied public health at Columbia and she pursued a doctorate at NYU just some of those chronic students to do a lot as a very well credentialed a or out of education or it doesn't necessarily mean it makes you the best politician\nA or the best public servant but certainly her work in the Clinton Foundation I I think she's had significant experience obviously in the spotlight and she said she'd never getting experience just being born to those two people\nI'm learning the nuances of some policies and what it can mean a presuming they have dinner together at the same table a bill and Hillary and Chelsea and I don't\nWant to be mean I I don't think they spend time together I'm sure she's picked up a whole lot one thing that from the armed those conversations one you can say a lot about bill and Hillary and gosh knows I've done it I've been guilty of it but I think they both really loved her daughter and I think that you can you can at least say that about them I think they're both really love each other and then they'll K\nI don't know if I go there I think they have an understanding but you know look that's not my business that's our business isn't necessarily their relationship is what they do for the country so that doesn't necessarily concerned me so much what is interesting now and I want clarification and I'm sad that they didn't ask a follow up question to Chelsea about this\nShe said she'd wait for someone to step down and she said she considered going into office under the right circumstances right so does that mean she'd wait for someone to step down while their term was still going to let someone like governor would appoint turn\nTo a physician or which he actually consider starting and running a campaign and actually doing the work of running for elected office which is a very difficult and\nI'm not quite as easy as someone appointing you into the position and then running for reelection\nYeah just seems to be her preference no doubt if she wanted to run for reelection after being appointed the footwork the leg work that you articulate a detail would would would come into question\nBut ah for example if a senator I think she should charge in in a in a congressional seat or even the New York city council and rise very quickly or improve herself\nLike I think all public servants should do uh we have a current president who who rose from a billionaire reality TV star and real estate mogul to leader of the free world somebody might say and and I would say\nThat that ascension brought with it\nA staggering lack of the understanding of the way government works and I and I ... and I think that can be a problem so the remedy to that is I think public officials\nStarting out I Love stories of of of men and women who start on the city council and then they become the mayor and then they become a governor another kind of congressmen and the sender if I had ... or inviting career politician and then vice president and then president but they know the ins and outs of government they know the pulse of the American people at that\nPoint don't misunderstand what I'm saying about Chelsea Clinton needing to to run for multiple offices I just want to see her actually get elected by the people that's what I wanted to say it doesn't matter to me if someone has extensive political experience if they can do the job clearly President Trump can do this job is he doing it in a way that\nMakes some people happy and some people miserable yeah\nBut he's going in there and he's doing the job and he was elected by the people in this country and that I think is really important needs appointments to people that have never run for office that to me no matter if you're a Republican or Democrat can be switching equally\nImportant not to bicker with you 'cause we don't pick or will be trying to be the customs or some would say if you look at the approval ratings or you look at a book or from Bob Woodward of the New York times op ed some would say and fairness and I'm here to represent the other side so you can at least here it and decide if you agree with it or not\nSome people at least the Gallup polls indicate they don't think the president's doing an appropriate job President Trump when it comes to his approval ratings so\nThat's how my argument my arguments actually just whether or not you win an election and he wanted to let that stop you said you you said he's doing the job he's doing what I'm saying is he's doing the job whether it makes people crazy and they like it or they don't like it whatever it is but if\nHe's doing the job poorly that that that nature\nNo it doesn't actually what my point\nWas with Chelsea Clinton is I don't care if she builds up a career as a politician I don't care if she runs for office and gets elected the first time as long as she's elected by the people I take issue with\nRemotely ballot in them and\n... not being released in my\nNeighborhood\nI'm retired judge Steven Bailey\nRepealing

Jennifer Horn\nThanks for joining us finally a friday on your morning answer AM eight Seventy LA Orange County am five Ninety in the I. E.\nWell while you were sleeping the number of suspicious packages ... mailed to a critics of President Trump and or prominent Democrats increased to twelve the U.S senator representing New Jersey Cory Booker\nA had a suspicious package they're treating it as an explosive was found in a Florida post office address to senator Cory Booker and James Clapper the former director of national intelligence\nUh had a package addressed to him that was found in a New York city post office this brings with two packages being sent to Joe Biden as we talked about yesterday\nPresident Clinton former President Clinton a former secretary of State Hillary Clinton living together and ...\nOr something was sent to an explosive temper that home and also uh the the home don't quite know where the home is I Know the Obamas live in Washington D. C. but maybe they have in New York home former President Obama was also on the list we are awaiting a briefing from the New York police department um the suspicious\nSuspicious package that was found in mid town\nYeah this is that a post office both a post office in midtown Manhattan and one in South Florida are are under scrutiny right now because they rape I'd able to identify these packages wind Cory Booker founded that Florida post office one to James Clapper founded in midtown post office all of these packages look at the same Brian they've got\nSix American flag forever stamps on them the labels look all the same they all have the return address from Debbie Wasserman Schultz in sunrise Florida Florida spelled around on the label and both of them today were found by postal inspectors which means that they are obviously on the lookout\nFor any information any clues into trying to prevent the spread of these packages number one but also trying to identify where they're coming from and authorities say Florida is a a is a state where they're spending a lot of time and attention focusing in on possible suspects there\nFrom what I've seen Jennifer to my eyes and ears the penmanship is the same on or appears very similar type label yeah ... well some of the I've seen some uh Debbie shelves I saw that was written\nA okay this is a type label okay but the but ah maybe I'm referring to the stamps sick stamps to American ... American flag forever stamps I and the point is that um uh the the the this person\nHas provided us Fox News reports uh Trevor a treasure trove of evidence I mean to this person or ... or let's say person\nLick the envelope and provide DNA to the to do to the ... of the ... when they were sending\nThese packages I watched the NYPD press conference yesterday where they said there was a treasure trove of forensic evidence that was a direct quote\nFrom the investigators which tells me Bryan that typically you don't get details like that from the FBI from the NYPD they don't like to tell you what they have but this tells me that this person whoever it is\nProbably like the envelope probably ... to stamp\nMaybe wasn't careful in touching all of the materials inside it wouldn't surprise me when you look at the condition that these envelope\nAre arriving in I mean for goodness sake if you were going to be a serious person who is sending explosive materials through the mail you make sure you have enough postage on and keep in mind the one he sent Eric Holder was return to sender because he didn't have enough postage stamp just like uh that's I don't mean to make light of it but that the looney tunes cartoon where wile E. coyote send a bomb and it comes back without a stand and if it's\nSent to Eric Holder under the pseudonym Debbie Wasserman Schultz when it's return to sender does Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Chicago and in Florida\nShe got one back Eric Holder's that yet the Eric Holder ... which I guess maybe the plot like if they do get returned at least they go to another critics office perhaps maybe that's what this is all about\nI have to say we're day three of this investigation that are Debbie Wasserman Schultz is really dumb putting her name on this done these label I don't know I don't think it's her getting real her out safely what I find\nIntriguing is that we're in the third day we've entered now the third day 'cause we were talking about uh two days ago and still they don't have anyone arrested I thought the the the the capture of a suspect or or or the taking into custody of a suspect would have happened before this time\nI get their ...

investigation into suspicious packages mail to prominence folks containing explosive devices\nStreets are moving and uh [noise] want to act or needed to be regulated [noise]\nSend you to stay alert and if you do see something of all was a pretty safe [noise]\nAgain with no injuries but with any of the award this reporter partners in NYPD for\nJust a housekeeping matter for those of you who are aware of it though there was another suspicious practice operation involving a suspicious box was found blaming again the tree of federal part that's been resolved hit it's not connected to this [noise]\nOr or a similar to this\nIs also a a pain or nothing hazardous so that has also been resolved if you were following the development and I want to especially come in\nThe work of the postal inspectors would also uh the work of the six hundred thousand postal employees across the country\nWho have been working within the postal system to locate these packages for their delivered to alert authorities\nAnd this is an example on the part of on hold for her when she saw this recognize it grows it in the system and was able to resolve that before it got delivered location him at a very good work here we're not going to be able to take questions thank you very much for\nOkay that is a brief a updates from the NYPD the final voice you heard was John Miller who is a deputy in the counterterrorism department of the New York city police department who was um\nA shorter posting that press conference there so not a whole lot of information coming forward on these suspicious packages Jennifer\nThere it was a tweet from commissioner O'Neill from the NYPD he said workers at a postal facility in Manhattan this morning discovered a suspicious package and their system that closely resembled others then across the nation this week including CNN and tried backup productions in New York City units are unseen and safely removing it apparently this is another one of those packages\nThis one this time address to James Clapper and of course earlier just about an hour before that in Florida postal inspector at a facility in southern Florida found a package address Cory bookers office in New Jersey he of course the senator from New Jersey so now we have twelve packages\nFor whatever reason only addressed to ten people because Joe Biden was one of the lucky ones that got to Maxine Waters was sent to and let's\nSay the obvious because the obvious is a is a not being stated a enough I don't think uh all of the targets of the mailings of these believed to be explosive devices via the U.S postal service I don't think any of them were sent via a UPS\nWith the courier the one CNN's with a courier ... okay and they question the heck out of that guy\nAll of these all of these explosive devices that were sent by a person or persons and again the investigation is underway a man on a nationwide manhunt into finding out who this person is centering in New York City obviously uh\nThese people that receive these potentially fatal attacks or\nOr or were\nRecipients of potentially fatal attacks or people who are either prominent Democrat or people who are outspoken critics of president\n... and those type of both I mean other than Robert De Niro who's not necessarily a politician that just an outspoken critic of the of the president given out very recently what on the Academy Awards he did it was saying as it does it almost every time he gets the front of a podium he has a few choice remarks to make right\nSo so we so no doubt the investigators\nOr when they put a profile together and if you watch those shows on channel two in what was what was called the profiling was worse right when when a profile begins to come together we begin to see as we saw with the baseball shooter who who shot Steve ... and many other\nA wonderful people are back east that was someone who was a lead a list of people was obviously influenced\nBy the rhetoric of then presidential candidate Bernie Sanders\nA this is a person a who is going after certain types of people certain organization CNN being one John Brennan at CNN\nA ... who was the person he was going after at the time Warner center in midtown Manhattan so um [noise] so so should should the president says I Believe Bernie Sanders did say after that I I Believe very almost lab relieved quite clearly\nAfter the shooting on the ball yard Bernie Sanders\nA made a statement I'm saying that this is a never acceptable and and all of that a President Trump did that yesterday but then he sent out this week that you and I talked about a moment ago\nWhere the President Trump\nFully aware that the dozen or so explosive devices males were mailed by presumably someone who was a supporter of his because they were mailed to opponents of his\nRight and I mean there's ... theories out there that say maybe at someone on the left because they want to help Democrats in the mid term we don't know who it is there are two schools have thoughts about who this aspect can be certainly\nYeah there there are many schools have thoughts and they're all not equal\nOr some of them for whatever reason it's political motivation that's for sure well it's\nPolitical motivations against a certain group of people that that's a fact\nUh shoot the president's rhetoric rather than the tweet he sent out yesterday blasting the media saying the anger in the country now which certainly fueled these attacks it's anger\nHe suggests that people are angry and I would agree with him he's right he goes after the media blaming them for the anger is President Trump missing a moment to do what we call in a a a an inventory to to understand and assess\nHis restaurant a nerve I write off of the

concern for foreign conservative crusader Brian\nBe a busy friday morning answer Brian and Jennifer AM eight Seventy LA Orange County am five Ninety in the eye he beer fridge alright some breaking news here we go to the lovely Jennifer born with the latest on the YPG search\nFor suspects over the suspicious packages that were mailed to prominence people multiple\nSources are now confirming Brian at an arrest has been made in Florida in the state of Florida and talking about the scrutiny given to the state of Florida there was some indication maybe and some of the forensic evidence from as some of the packages received by\nThe police and obviously investigated led them to Florida arrest has now been made in the investigation of those bombs center prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump CBS is confirming this along with CNN\nThe a P and Fox News so again now we find out if this is indeed the right person if there is only one person was this person working with the group was it a a lone wolf style\nAttack and what are the motivations here what are the political reasons that this person is committing these terrorist acts by using what are these pipe bombs explode or not this is Jared them and it meant to maybe not bring as much destruction as we would think might come with a bomb but certainly Dr fear and panic amongst a primarily the east coast\nYeah and academically I mean if one were to define terrorism terrorism is a ...\nActs of terror or or instilling terror in the citizenry to affect political change and ah this short of a smacks of that that's why I thought a former\nDirector of national intelligence James Clapper was right on the money yesterday when he called it domestic terrorism indicating it doesn't seem to come from any foreign government um ... and then we wake up today while most were sleeping before you got up in the morning after was on the air to find that James Clapper is like the twelve guide to get an explosive mailed to him\nYeah this morning we found out Cory Booker had one cent to his New Jersey office although it was apprehended\nIn uh Florida South Florida post office and then midtown Manhattan was also shut down for a bit this morning because of this package that was sent to to James Clapper so again these packages continue and just because they have made an arrest doesn't necessarily mean that there aren't more packages out there to be found\nNo and we see a Wi Fi terrorist organizations terror cells and I don't mean foreign terrorist cells I mean domestic terrorist cells\nAre that work in the United states I I don't know this person worked with the terrorists so I Will use the phrase the that that that uh Jennifer doesn't like to use this sounds although I could be wrong sounds like a lone wolf guy reminds me of\nAnd I say ... it just because it feels like a dire ... and that's and that gender is among so with all due respect to men who were just feel like this guy I don't know I remember when the plane uh I guess we're going back ten years out do remember back east\nThe guy had a private plane and that was a man and he flew into the I think it was the IRS building for the Washington DC okay that was an act of domestic terrorism 'cause he was he was going after the government the Internal Revenue service ... making a political statement trying to effect change by instilling fear and crashing a plane into people's workplace\nYeah I just judging by what I heard from people that not only we talked to on the air Brian off the air and some officials you know a whole lot more about explosives and I knew that these were not necessarily\nA well half of them are not necessarily meant to to blow up but anytime you have a person who wants to instill fear in someone I Believe this is domestic terrorism no matter what this person's motivations and there are a billion people who have theories about why people might be doing that now if these arrests are leading to the right person hopefully will start to get some answers\nYes certainly hope so I I I think you're right on their Jennifer uh one of the interesting items being reported by Fox News is a is a quote from law enforcement or or paraphrasing of law enforcement said and I'll just read it for you law enforcement shores confirms to Fox News\nOne person has been arrested in connection with packages so they go out of their way to say one person which is a matter of fact one person has been arrested in a one wonders are they saying one person because there's more you know just ... it just begs the question just\nA point of information and it's easy for us because you want to kind of dive in a little bit and get more information we take apart every word when they are missing words purposely a this was a federal law agency so obviously we could assume it was the FBI who probably made this arrest in connection with the suspected explosive packages\nAnd they said something yesterday in their press conference FBI NYPD having\nA press conference yesterday around noon time our time and they said that there was a treasure trove of forensic evidence which to me made me think that they were on the trail of this one and they said it has led them to Florida because maybe this person was touching things are looking ... clearly a there was probably something that was able to lead them to make this arrest you know you\nLook at the graphic that's been on television I just trade it for me just get off my chair for a moment to look out your rocker off by rocker or they said well ... and you put off your rocket for seven years or so we heard of that I did get off my rock or to look closely at\nA graph an image a map if you will that one of the networks are showing on the air that uh shows\nThe the\nThe locations that these explosive devices were intended to be mailed to and Jennifer Horn I learn something when I just rolled off my rocker yeah and that is a geographically the target the target locations that they were mailed to all over the country\nYeah it's definitely not in one area of the country had\nI Do I think some people were thinking my love this is a a New York shores is\nNot a New York story actually it in fact it's far from it you had\nA Maxine Waters receive one here in Los Angeles you at the LAPD involved with this suspicious package or they were investigating something they saw maybe for Dianne Feinstein last night that didn't pan out but you have Maxine Waters and California\nAnd in Maryland you had Eric Holder end up going to Florida because it was returned to Debbie Wasserman Schultz has addressed you had the Clintons and upstate New York you had the Obamas in Washington DC you had\nClapper and uh and John Brennan in New York City that's right they're they're all over the place\nThere's a lot to talk about and the man we're going to talk about all of this too is Dr Sebastian Gorka who will be a guest of the morning answer Brian and Jennifer ... host doctors bastion Gorka at the Reagan Library that happens on Monday Night stand by Dr Gorka\nAs we continue on your Wednesday why did I should Wednesday\nI Am a I'm not going back to it that much the only thing on my mind is friday why I said when I say is just an monitoring she'll be forty five minutes from now I don't I don't know five minutes ago it was it's been Fridays and midnight as far as I'm concerned that I mean the real friday since ...\nWe've been talking about a lot of important issues going into the midterm elections less than two weeks away a lot of the focus has been on all things economic and uh I Know something I Know that there are several remodeling projects that can actually add value to your home\nUh yeah this is true ah what do you say we make a game of this I've got my ... these are for incorrect responses and we're did my buzzer go for a total wreck responses I had a ding ding ding which was fantastic\nThing getting yeah that you oh you're going to be your luggage argues Trump bing bing bing bing\nTurn Trump up louder here we go a ... okay so\nI can I can play long I'm\nGoing to guess which projects can add value to a home yeah I'm ready okay how about a pet door leading to the back yard\nYou know that is not correct okay All right ... and now let me\nThink I've owned homes have on my four different houses off the laundry chute right into the washing machine that's got to be a value in half\nYou'd love that right or wrong again I'm going to give you a clue because I'm feeling generous today since it is friday a it's a room where you cook in their room where you shower but\nNot the same time we have I think I got on fanfare [noise] the kitchen and the\nBathroom a a good boy alright kitchen and bathroom remodeled at a lot of value to your home\nBut but if it is a federal the devices that no that that made in the device for about ... and it's an explosive device\nDr Gorka we'll get to Jennifer in a moment for political reasons are you holding onto the hope that they were not really genuinely explosive devices\nI have no political expectations for regardless of\nHow the person down and we throw the book ... the whole thing how's the how's the ever the trick telling you about it but the strange Les Mis spreading a run in the study showed was like you said the packages to John ... CNN Web but he doesn't even have a contract saying it's all very it's\nVery strange after go let's find out the truth\nAnd I think that's what everybody wants or at least that's what we should all want to get to the bottom of this I think nobody wants to accept violence is part of our political culture but want to know about your book why we fight one of the biggest fight\nI think we have right now and Brian brought it up is with the mainstream media and which CNN I've never been so disgusted in my life to see what they are doing at CNN yesterday in the day before where they are trying to make it seem\nLike President Trump somehow has millions that he's authorized or set into action\nTo try to blow up his critics this is simply not true it shouldn't be tolerated by something ... and a group that's supposed to be it supposed to be a trusted source\nIn journalism and it's done by a company who has punch cards on the table against this president they sponsored play in Central Park\nFor crying out loud depicting the assassination of Trump in New York Times two days ago was fantasizing about the assassination of President Trump the media needs to soften his rhetoric and get back to doing what it's doing which is reporting the news how do we fight as how do we actually\nMade in your book how do we\nHow do we do that without going to the point that it is now where things to get violent\nThing my appendix or why we fight I spoke about over ... you get the facts\nI Do fear them I I remember as a kid I remember watching CNN during the first Gulf War back then they have no foreign correspondents in Iraq there we feel it was going to use any more\nBut it's just it's just that I was I was watching MSNBC last but the gym I've ever watched your was your photos on the low\nBut I Am a former Obama official\nActually say the following woods on the on the NBC the person who said those bombs so on the hall of pro shah the host of the program didn't challenge in fact it was a program agreed with that yes that wrong\nDr Gorka I I I agree with you that's wrong and it's irresponsible on a news even if it's a news opinion show it's irresponsible to let that go out final question for you\nDo we take our eye off the ball and the ball is twelve suspicious packages\nGoing out to prominent Democrats to former American presidents are and their families were Secret Service protection as well as a John Brennan George Soros prominent Democrats Trump critics do we take our eye off that ball do we do do do we do our level best\nAt getting to the bottom of that and and verbalize the outrage over that if we automatically instinctively and reflexively go back to\nThe Obama days or even before that can't we deal with the here and now and isn't that the most effective and efficient way of solving this crime\nLying on thing is I'm not one Republican vote one more comment played a lot of politicians use your attempt to go south relationships the release of all the Republicans on the baseball field of the political cultural we didn't do that walk to the left to it\nIt's wrong yeah OK Sebastian Gorka will be with Brian and Jennifer on Monday Night October twenty
