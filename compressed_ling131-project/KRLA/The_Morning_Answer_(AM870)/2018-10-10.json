together again\nHow\nTo use\nThe morning answer Brian but my general horn\nThanks for joining us on your Wednesday morning answer here we are half way to uh Southern California weekend enjoying whether that is a superior to the weather conditions\nIn the panhandle of Florida where moments ago Florida governor Rick Scott who's also in a hot Senate race with Bill Nelson the incumbent US Senator that represents the people of Florida it's a good opportunity politically speaking for governor Rick Scott to get up there and show that\nHe's in charge he declares this is the worst storm the panhandle in Florida has seen in a century and one hundred years uh it's taught us it is here and the time for evacuation the governor says there's not was not then\nThey over its past that's right they say now to hunker down that is the message from governor Rick Scott\nWho said we asked you to leave and you didn't end to the residents in Florida by this kind of came out of nowhere we knew it was a tropical storm on Sunday but it intensified so quickly it wasn't like the storm that we just the hurricane Florence\nAnd hit the Carolinas where people had about two weeks to evacuate because it was so slow moving this is a quick and fast storm and boy I don't know if people thought last week at the time that they be dealing with almost a category five hurricane what\nTo look for here from CNN Michael is not Michael the hurricane Michael in Florida in ah northern Florida the panhandle is so we all know where the handle of the pan is\nBecause the top of the ban ban in ... when you say panhandle uh sometimes you get a little scared that I might have to teach at a lot\nI Do get you didn't do anything wrong I just want a secretary on Saturday\nTallahassee way I Would say is a ... cities or\nAlabama Panama City in Florida and then going into Georgia and even the Carolinas where there's been so much flooding that storm will be there and a couple of days and more rain there\nSo from seven AM to eight am eastern time the last twenty four hours the storm increased five miles per hour in a single hour over the last day hurricane Michael has rapidly intensified by intensified by forty five\nMile an hour winds it could increase even more additional strengthening of the hurricane is possible it's category for last time I checked 'em the national Hurricane Center shading advisories I think they have an hourly will keep you up to speed on that\nIf the storm reaches sustained winds of one hundred fifty seven this category for monstrous hurricane or\nThat a shift Florida and I don't know that it's hit one fifty seven yet it will become a category five\nIt hasn't yet there is calling it a strong category for but as you mentioned it doesn't seem that far away from being a category five\nI'm not putting anyone on the hot seat 'cause I don't know the answer one fifty seven makes it a category five it's a strong category for so right now the winds strength is what\nIt topped at one fifty so far\nOkay so they're okay so one fifty one fifty seven that's real close it was increasing it increased uh in the last twenty four hours by virtually that number in a single our so anything can happen this is a chance\nA there's a chance this happens there is also a chance that as the hurricane hurricane Michael interacts with land the storm could weaken so authorities in Iraq in Florida governor Rick Scott are hoping\nFor that the major hurricane will likely be a catastrophic hurricane with life threatening storm surge already we see that and the winds are remarkable\nYeah the storm surge or right now they're focusing a lot of Panama City beach and they're saying obviously when conditions or add about one forty five right now in Panama City beach at the rainfall expected there is six to ten inches but the storm surge is seven to eleven feed that's enough to cover a one story homes in that area\nThe waves that they're looking at Thirteen foot waves in a in the panhandle and it makes me wonder because I Know that we've seen these horrible images\nAre there some ... to go out there with their surfboards Brian and try to write some of these waves\n[noise] well there are some ... some ... with a gentle seeing whether machine you told me was on TV and she was panicking this morning who was the reporter that they had in like a speed bowed

of there and she was almost like she was happy you could hear her breathing heavily during her the rest of her report I think she was really concerned ... welfare the reporters out there who do we forget about them they go right to where everybody else runs from in in matters like\nThat sounds like a little anxiety attack on Fox and friends\nYeah she as she had a tough time this morning but that's because she knows that this storm is so big and\nPeople are staying behind as governor Rick Scott pointed out the time for evacuation has passed\nA you should be gone by now there's a story in the newspaper of two women who have stayed behind to help their neighbors now this is an interesting one because oftentimes are critical of people who stay behind and put endanger the lives of first

for joining us on your Wednesday\nMorning answer AM eight Seventy LA Orange County am five Ninety in the eye ... believe it or not Taylor Swift has made her way into a morning answer mid term madness update\nYou know here is a morning answering mid term men\nOkay breaking her silence on politics and I think a lot of people thought the Taylor Swift I think a lot of young guys I read somewhere thought Taylor Swift was conservative\nI think a lot of people dead because she never spoke about politics and she's a country music star of course and now we know that maybe\nJohn Taylor swift just pop\nStar she was a country music star is what I thought okay that's where she started her career if you remember she was country\nNow and she's a little bit rock and a little bit hot rock and roll Taylor Swift has broken her silence on politics and announced their support for Democrats and the upcoming\nTennessee races in the midterms twenty seven days from today and one\nPerson she really says she can't support is the Senate candidate currently a congressional representative Marsha Blackburn in a lengthy Instagram post that ended with a couple of ...\nTaylor Swift and now she could not support Republican Marsha Blackburn and instead said Taylor Swift would shake off Marsha Blackburn and vote for her opponent here's the quote from\nA young Taylor Swift\nAs much as I have in the past and would like to continue I don't think she talks like on our country smarter than that actually I I'm a fan of hers actually but she says as much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office\nI cannot support Marsha Blackburn her voting record in Congress appalls terrifies me terrorists were throat she voted against oh she knows her stuff now here we go she voted against equal pay for women\nShe voted against the reauthorization of the violence against women actually got some talking points energy and somebody had to do which attempts to protect women from domestic violence talking in date rape she believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples she also believes they should not have the right to marry\nThese are not my Tennessee values Taylor Swift the pop music star who sells millions and millions of records\nAdded she'd be voting for Phil bred a bread isn't who's\nA democratic candidate for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house of representatives and uh so she's a out of the closet Taylor Swift is a Democratic president Trump likes Marsha Blackburn and apparently when he got this news decided uh he likes to tailor a little bit less than he is\nNew you know while boxer blackbird is doing a very good job and then there's the\nLeading out there playing with the men to women I'm sure that's nothing or doesn't know anything about her dad\nLet's say that I like music about forty five percent less\nSubject and that sort of ... and so I always say the thing I like most about President Trump is a sense of humor because that's a joke and and and that was funny here's the problem of the problem in our society is not the Taylor Swift is talking about\nA politics and supporting Democrats us up the problem the problem is not that Roseanne voted for Donald Trump that's not the problem the problem at eight five five Seventy five eight to five five it's us I think we're the problem all of us because we're under some odd\nIllusion that people who sings songs on the radio or people who produce and sharp in television sitcoms\nDon't have and as American citizens surrender their right to express their political beliefs now it can be a calculated career builder there are many prominent a celebrities many I Know personally or who never talk politics 'cause they think it's bad for their career and and these people on both sides of the\nUh [noise] but uh but just said as people will say you know ... nobody criticizing Taylor Swift shed to Roseanne shut up and tell jokes they were very happy with her Trump supporting\nA message and so the problem I say again is us and our hypocrisy and the double standard that we and I include myself\nEmbrace and unfortunately perpetuate when the stories come to light\nOkay so I actually ... and not to trip over any names here but I was lucky enough and really actually mean it was a blessing in my life to have ed McMahon in my life\nI was yes and I was your godfather godfather that I was I knew in later in life\nAnd he was very ... if he knew one thing he knew that you don't talk politics because you isolate fifty percent of the country and he always you never knew what he was he never knew what Johnny Carson really was the ... of the old school Hollywood star that didn't talk politics they entertained\nNow I Believe that that is the most smart way to run your career if you are an entertainer in today's landscape because if you stay out of it you're not isolating anybody\nWords you chose a in your eloquent comments they're separated you know talking part of the they didn't talk politics they chose to entertain I'll interject and say people can talk politics and entertain at the same\nTime and let me finish it because I think it's important so like ... in one ... in ... in one manner I I Believe that's the right way to go if I were an entertainer uh at the scale at the end you know the level of ed McMahon or Taylor Swift\nI Would probably choose to not talk politics because I think it's more important to entertain that's my function that that people are paying me to do\nBut I'm not going to be one of those conservatives that's going to all of a sudden love Kanye West because he's put pro Trump\nAnd hate Taylor Swift because she's now that things that are anti Republican I'm going to still listen to Taylor Swift music I'm Still probably not going to listen too much to Kanye West music because it just happens to not be my taste but\nI'm going to allow them to I mean you you let\nThem say what they want to say because everybody has a right to say it is it the smartest well that comes out in the wash but what's interesting about Taylor Swift is that I think her comments actually had more power because there's no doubt or just released a report that in the last two days and killers with made this these comments on Instagram like a hundred and fifty thousand young people have registered to vote because of it\nAnd I wonder and I asked this question you Brian is it because she's been ... in the past\nThat her words actually have more weight and meaning when she says them now\nYeah I think if you're a um if you're a a a a who who's the very famous actress who went off on President Trump at the Academy Awards Meryl Streep straight or who's ... a great actress if you're somebody if you're a celebrity who's always doing the politics\nA and there are plenty of examples of of those celebrities then uh then your political contributions become less paid less attention is paid your political ramp things and uh and I think artistically sometimes you're distracted\nA when you're consumed by politics here's Taylor Swift making hit record after his record and then one Instagram post she kind of breaks or silence and says I Can't vote for Marsha Blackburn a and I'm supporting democratic candidates et cetera\nUh it it it's it's anyone who is critical of Taylor Swift\nHas got to stop look in the mirror and ask themselves honestly was critical of Roseanne Roseanne basically rode the Trump wave to a whole lot of her own talent of course to a new series on ...\nYou see TV [noise] uh so so she she really really a mix politics with entertaining and entertainment and no talk show host\nOf the conservative rioting and most of them are my best friend's\nNot one of them said hey Roseanne shut up and tell jokes which is what people would say a which is what a lot of conservatives would say to Michelle Wolf for example they shut it after the White House Correspondents' Dinner shut up and be funny don't talk politics be funny no one ever said that to Roseanne a and I'm so much to say\nOur I can I thank you for the phone call in fairness to to Taylor Swift I actually don't expect\nA because she's an artist and that's probably a consumes Ninety nine percent of her life I don't expect Taylor Swift to be fully versed on the nuances of conservative Democrats versus moderate Democrats versus liberal Democrats versus progressive ... ah but Republicans bristled and President Trump got angry you know\nWhile Marsha Blackburn is doing a very good job in Tennessee\nHe's leading out the day with the should use it for him and I'm sure that nothing or does it or did they got better as\nMusic about forty five percent less salad\nOkay here's James in Fontana on the morning answer I don't think this is a reason to like her music any less it'd be like their music tap your toes and enjoy it life's too short James\nGood morning to you know I don't think that her ... her position and the level I'm up to such a great cause even got started by this than any negative it really doesn't matter\nBut she might influence a lot of young voters I mean you know that's worse\nYou might get them out I mean this is Instagram so Instagram provides a link to register to vote it doesn't mean that these people are going to turn out to vote it means that she has a hundred and twelve million followers on Instagram and her brand is really strong and that's really the take away from all of\nThat here's Jeff in the valley a lot of reaction here to Taylor Swift and I think the Roseanne parallel is interesting and are getting people thinking here Hi Jeff thanks for holding buddy go right ahead\nI Want to kind of agree with you on the court or know what your um your why we looked at me the problem\nAnd we put the list because ultimately what ever happened whatever the whichever one militant group of people in a way I owe it all in one hundred percent ... when did you know blue collar law\n[laughter] so like Jeff Foxworthy you're pretty fun of yourself I mean when did you officially become a whip maniac\nAnd what are things that are about becoming a ... you ... you\nLook for but if you are in school that\nBut if I'm going to look at that spoke at like a conservative true went maniac and you can take the oath by the way you can do it by mail or email or tweet tweet deal through if you want\nTo be in it it's really interesting and I want to give you and Jeff actually put a put a ... and underline underneath as for me as he put a he highlighted at and that is\nHow many times if I said do you what does it matter what politicians indoors too because I really don't know if there's a person on the planet\nAside from the people that I live in my life that could endorse a cat they could endorse somebody and actually make me go to the polls and vote for them I think it's nice to Taylor Swift trying to register people I just wish there wasn't a double standard that conservative entertainers couldn't come out and do the same thing without being afraid\nThat their whole careers going to be ruined and there'll be black less\nIn the morning answer meet the

that I have to go first right don't I Am [laughter] even though we've done nothing wrong with that one of the greatest economies in the history of our\n[noise] oh this drought okay now he gets the individual Democrats and he goes straight for Elizabeth Warren who set a couple of weeks ago you heard it on this program she's thinking about running for president\nShe's the only Democrats not playing Kuwait right now drove by just came out today that I'm not running Cory Booker said I'm not running from his stage in Iowa give me a break at least Elizabeth Warren's being on the up and up

about uh where people come from or where they were born or there are a nation or nations of origin I mean a lot of which there with uh our President Trump\nNo I don't know if it's just President Trump that done this I think the debunking of Elizabeth Warren's background has been done long before President Trump came to town\nBut but I mean he seems to be attracted to the idea of investigating people's uh\nBirds lines I think he likes to have all the way back to ... to tell a lie blatantly about who they are ... are you including Rocco bombing that list\nI Know I'm including Senator Elizabeth Warren who try to win an election that goes on you as a native Americas I'm\nClearly referring to the birther effort which this president\nI understand but I don't know if we can correlate the\nTwo I think we can and and the and that's what I'm attempting to do we have a president who before he was president traveled the globe for years not it's not even like six months he had a wild

and her backers and so that was not necessarily a creation of Donald Trump but I think at this point in politics we know that people will say whatever it takes to try to take down their opposition and we just sat with Brett Kavanaugh and we see it every single day with the opponents of President Trump\nLast night in Iowa President Trump continued now he goes after Cory Booker goes after Connecticut
