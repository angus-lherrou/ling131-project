to a comment or question from Laura in growing the host of the show about changing the rally some have said\nThat the rally should be changed in terms of tone et cetera the president had this to say in defense of his rallies during this mid term campaign season\nRallies are meant to be fun rallies are meant to be everything and I said tone it down and then you sort of the group saying no no tone it down don't tell them against the so ah we\nHad a great rally in Illinois for some great people and frankly I think that's probably the way it should be he should go about your life you can let these people disrupt any more than they already have which is disgraceful\nAs President Trump on the Ingram angle last night Fox News we have some of the highlights 'cause we know you're busy or they talked about the caravan of migrants a which is a approaching the U.S\nAt a thousand miles away from the border some big uh\nImmigration news at Trump is looking at writing an executive order to end

last night Jennifer ... we had our great panel with Dr Gorka and hundreds of morning at your listeners that the Reagan Library I asked him if ah if if Donald Trump just stumbled upon this realization that he's a nationalist or the president tries to explain\nHis comment\nProclaiming that he's a nationalist on Fox News last night very interesting take a listen I look\nAt to ... to me I don't have to clarify ms I Love the country and I'm somebody that wants to take care of our country because for many many years you know those rather than anybody it's our leaders have been more worried about the world and I have about the United states and they leave us in a mess\nWhether it's the wars whether it's uh the economy whether it's dead whether it's wall of the things that they've done including putting in the wrong Supreme Court justices or we're\nWe've really put to break ones you know I'm proud of this country that I call that nationalism Michael and being a naturalist and I

his initial reactions to what happened on Saturday mhm but you and I were in agreement you\nAnd I a botched that he should go to Pittsburgh and you seem to agree with the absolutely and he's and now she's doing that he's doing that today so I Would check that is a good thing\nOr the thing that has not happened that you and I agreed yesterday would be very helpful would be for the president to have a primetime live from the oval office no audience know rally no media you know people taking photographs\nJust just that static shot a one shot on the desk the president sitting in the oval

C. but you and I were talking about it and said wouldn't it be nice and wouldn't it be the right time for President Trump to do a prime time address that I Believe that would be a good idea I Believe you're able to cut the media\nOut of their coverage and you're able to talk directly to the American people especially one week before mid term election when there's a lot of\nA lot of tempers flaring there's a lot of emotion certainly a lot of sadness I think after the synagogue shooting and I think it will be a good chance for the president to try to feel a little bit of that without having to deal with the questions of people like Jemma costs and Jonathan Karl and also happened with their standards yesterday if you do it in front of people they're never going to let you get your word\nWhile the press secretary is job is to do it in front of the press that\nThey're not it's not worth it as that you would with a straightforward presidential address you were able to talk directly to Bryan Whitman directly to Jennifer horn directly to all of you yeah director\nOf the three hundred and twenty million Americans you said the key word presidential he would have\nPresident Trump in that in that hypothetical that address which I I think I I think there are savvy enough in the White House to at least have\nConsidered that we haven't heard the patch coming but uh to be have a an offer to behave presidential Leon offer presidential words of unity a to a divided nation I think would be critical for the head of state to do at this time\nYeah unfortunately we are in a time I believe that that might help it might help the\nPeople in the middle of the country it might help people who were affected by the violence I don't know if that peace is anybody like Jimmy Carter Jonathan Karl or the critical media of President Trump I don't know if it ...\nThe people who maybe don't treat them is fairly as you do by it I mean I I Know that you really do try to treat him fairly as possible even though some things he does drives you absolutely nuts and so I I think for those people nothing he could do would matter\nBut I think for the rest of us who are kind of in between or maybe supporters of the president would be the right\nThing to do as we continue here on your Tuesday Morning answer look at this tomorrow is Halloween the week the year is skipping by should some Halloween costumes that your kids might wear\nBe banned because they're too scary to unsettling it's happening they're banning Halloween costumes in America now it's six thirty\nThis morning\nSome type of popped up in orange a crash on the vine heading downtown to the ... the far left lane thought that the class and everything the I'm from the Ninety One\nAnd then you're looking at a thing of their time is the one in part is runs on the ... down at the Ninety One to\nThe right lane that the transition to the nineties when the weather is shut down they have a passion south [noise] you're also going to find than anyone ...\nIs shut down as well as it's not necessarily a clash per se but if you saw that on on the AC guessing not Long Beach on the qualifying hitting north than what we've got the far left lane taken away courtesy\nOf a fender bender says this has young like some ... minutes checking them a couple I met a rack and this one's on the one on one heading downtown invited four or five and this has the right lane blacktop have everything pretty solid right now from Burbank televised [noise] selling with down the beach on the phone for like a needle in a block and the ...\nHand I'm Jamie ...

listening and we really do appreciate if we are the radio show that has been all over these midterm elections and we've been all over him all year whenever there have been a development and today we are one week away from election day so it's only appropriate\nHere is a morning answer in mid term madness update update okay\nWith regard to voting here in Los Angeles county for your information and as a morning answer listener the deadline if you want to vote by mail the deadline to request to vote by mail ballot in LA county\nFor the midterm elections on November six is eleven fifty nine pm tonight Tuesday get on it that is the last day voters can request a mail in ballot on line at LA vote dot net returned the ballot application on the back of a sample ballot or make a request in person\nAt the headquarters office of the registrar and the county clerk that's a twelve thousand four hundred imperial highway\nIn Norwalk there on the third floor just for your information the registrar recorder has issued Jennifer Horn more than two point six million mail in ballots that's a lot\nAll vote by mail ballots post march by election day will be counted if received within three days no postage is required vote by mail ballots can also be dropped off in person at one hundred and fifty locations\nCountywide so LA county making it easy for people to vote and we do hear about these for example mail in ballots when when there was and I'm sure there will be more than a few a week from today or ... realistically week from tomorrow when they're counting votes into a link to that I knew early morning there's always races that are so close that they're waiting for these mail in\nBallot and they need them to count them to to make a final decision that's why sometimes we don't get results on election night what's interesting about the vote by mail or is it not just how many people participate in it I have several family members that do\nBut this year they redesigned it so it looks all new and different various spread out but that's all it is not necessarily been dazzled it's kind of it it's just a very spread out oh my gosh it looks really confused as it looks sort of confusing so give yourself some time to go through it if you are going to vote by mail because it does look different than it has a year's time\nAs we've been tracking the mid term elections with our mid term madness updates um we've learned\nThat uh lately in the last couple of days I read a from a a a column from a conservative pundit yesterday see I'm I'm a I'm a wide open guy both ears are open I read from liberal op eds and conservative op eds and we just need some of it the thinking okay\nAnd the Republicans are the Republican woman of female um that I don't recall her name but I remember a picture\nOn the on the Internet article she wrote a column a hopeful that the house she's a Republican by with and adds that some Republicans are hopeful that the house is now a toss up because the fear was the Democrats would retake control of the house\nI guarantee you whatever it is whichever direction I'm not saying that Democrats won't take control of the house I think it's likely that they do\nBut I don't think it's going to be by a large amount you need two dozen seats Democrats need two dozen seats to take control pickups to pick up right they need to pick up that many seats and that's why they've been targeting California because we actually have those seats available to Democrats stay a lot of them in orange county that's right so that's why you've seen so

I don't I I I don't know who's the good one who's the one of them no I\nThink a lot of like what am I like Katie Hitler first night I'll get Gretchen district twenty five but but just did it to finish that up I don't think there's going to be a blowout either way whatever it is going to be it's going to be a tight margin in the house and I still think Republicans will probably keep the Senate maybe pick up a couple\nOf speaking of the U.S Senate it is accurate to say that recently whispered fears that Republicans had\nOf losing the Senate to the Democrats a week from today have grown louder and there's been some serious concern or in some a corner offices on Capitol Hill from some prominent Republicans about the security\nOf the U.S Senate remaining in Republican hands Republicans holding on to control so we want to update you on a guess three here very close Senate race as we go to Florida where Senator Bill Nelson the Democrat is the incumbent he's been a senator for a long time\nBut the Republican challenger for his Senate seat is the two term just leaving the governor's office uh with both with forty six percent according to a battleground CBS News tracker vote among likely voters so this is a toss up a will Bill Nelson the longtime democratic senator\nFrom Florida hold onto a sheet or will a fairly popular outgoing term limited governor Rick Scott a Republican uh take that seat they both have forty six percent that is what we call a\nTie and this is one where I think there will be a Trump factor because Trump is going to be rallying in Florida he's doing eleven rallies and that the next seven days Brian is going to be doing two or three a day much like we can't do in twenty sixteen leading up to his election\nAnd Florida will be one of those places where Rick Scott Enron descent as he's running for governor in the state against the Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum\nWill rely on Trump to try to get the people who might stay home because they think everything's cool to actually go out to the polls and vote for these Republican candidate in\nArizona two women who are congressional representatives of the Democrat\nCure skin cinema ... is a polling at forty seven percent\nHer challenger the congressional representative Martha ... Kelly\nIs trailing at forty four percent there's a three point difference there according to the same poll these are all the same poll CBS News battleground trackers so that one has a margin of error a four point one and that three point lead the Democratic candidate in that Senate race in Arizona has Jennifer Horn is clearly within the margin of error\nWell too when you've got to play in your strategy and my friends I trust ... with all my legal questions to make sure you get a fair resolution in your matter call him at eight six six five Seventy five eighty one eleven minutes eight six six\nFive Seventy five eighty one eleven fighting for walks right ... ... ... am to shelter listen to the ... show Sunday mornings at ten am on the air make Seventy the answer [noise]\nTons of money to buy an ugly or terrifying windows ... the ... you up at night\nPleased to scare the old windows were used for the windows from civil and windows and doors I.

Orange County have the San Fernando valley ... feast LA and how about am five Ninety wall to wall morning answer country\nIn a river so Andy I [laughter] so we want to thank you for joining us say by the way thanks to everybody came out to the Reagan Library to see Dr Sebastian Gorka I talk about his book why we fight last night we are packed house at the Reagan Library to watch\nHim just crush you an eighties music trivia that did not happen\nA well we're going to ... we're going to end the show by playing back that competition so people can hear exactly how I was oddly enough it doesn't seem that it's too crazy or the when Jennifer horns making the rules and her favorite person in the world Sebastian Gorka is a is a contest and uh well the liberal is going to have the deck stacked against them\nI Will crush you and that's clearly what how to play the victim mentality really there with a set of rules that Brian just chose not to follow a cable debate that at the end of the ... this program on end without a debate on that we knew you didn't listen to a man now I have proof ...\nPresident Trump is a seemingly set here to offer a dramatic eighth legally dubious and we'll talk about the ah\nLegally dubious part in a moment he promises in her new interview to unilaterally and birthright citizenship ratcheting up his hard line immigration rhetoric with a week to go before the critical mid term elections now you'll hear this a clip of the president being interviewed on Axios ... on HBO\nThe president's vow to end the right to citizenship for the children of non citizen so so called anchor babies right we've talked about this in California for years and unauthorized immigrants born on us soil came in an interview with actually it was released on Tuesday\nWe have the right here in the valley excuse me in Los Angeles there have been some maybe in the valley there had been rage of a homes\nWhere I'm not being a I'm not generalizing here or being racially insensitive but my understanding is\nA ... in these particular ones where they were rated a lot of the women who were would come and stay there were from Asian countries\nYeah it's ... it's actually the Chinese it's called maternity tourism\nAnd they would have their babies yeah they are not citizens they would have their babies here and that that's an anchor baby so if people think oh that's Mexicans who do that well it's Asians too with\nMoney this is no joke maternity tourism ... specifically in Los Angeles in Southern California if you were in San Gabriel or at the same Gabriel valley the Pasadena Arcadia area of Southern California this is where that is it really is is breathing people will come to the Southern California\nThey'll come several months before their babies jail and there'll be put on like tour packages they'll go to Disneyland they'll go to universal see this is for people with money this is not poor people they're put up in a hotel than they have their baby here and but I mean but a boom\nHere's President Trump being interviewed on HBO about this plan to terminate a birthright immigration birthright citizenship within immigration executive order maybe as early as today here's the president on HBO being interviewed\nImmigration some legal scholars believe he can get rid of the citizenship without changing the constitution ... have you thought about this law it was always told me that you needed a constitutional a member of one and then\nYou don't need a number one number one you don't need that number did you get into well you can definitely do with it an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nHow ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to Nicholas is ridiculous and it has to end some have you talked about that with the council young\nI have to wear in the process in the process it will happen when an executive order that's what you're talking about but I was thinking about I didn't think anybody but knew that but me I thought I was only on China's a good guess okay I think\nA President Trump is on a very shaky ground here and I recall during the Obama years when he got into the habit of issuing executive orders\nA sometimes too frequently I think for his own political good my conservative friends were very very\nUh opposed and even President Trump came in and said I have to overturn a lot of the illegal executive orders issued by President Obama let's talk about natural born citizen to president wants to and anchor babies make it legal okay in\nWhich I'm not I'm not a constitutional scholar I don't pretend to be but I but I Know American history\nOr you know obviously government was politics and government may journal I Would recommend taking a look at the fourteenth amendment where are the term in the constitution is natural born citizen and we've always believed although the constitution does not specifically the fine natural born but we've always sort of understood\nA and I think it's settled law that um that it means someone born on us soil for example someone who is not a natural born citizen can't be the president of the United states for example that was Trump's whole birther thing if I can prove that Rocco bomber was born in Kenya\nAnd he's at that he's unqualified constitutionally not qualified to be to serve\nAs president which would be the case if indeed there were any facts to support the birther movement that went on for years and years are at the at the funding and a ... and doing of Donald Trump\nBut um so so you're going to see a significant legal challenge to this executive order\nOh for sure I I think that there's going to the side of the science look I I take issue with anchor babies and with the president on this I think at other countries the from Ireland to India to New Zealand have repealed their anchor baby or birthright citizenship ... at\nThat policy so I understand why we should do that but I Do believe you need an act of Congress I think the president\nI'm not a fan of executive orders because the next president who doesn't fall in line with your way of thinking can go in and repeal that you saw it with Obama he's on gun Trump's I'm done most of Obama's legacy because he did it through executive order CI agree\nWith you here because I think that um I think that executive and Trump says oh I can do it with an executive order just do it with an executive order\nA and and and you don't overturned the U.S constitution with an executive or you're right you get an act of Congress and a ... and you can read the fine uh what natural born means and you can and you can uh caught fire and law that anchor babies are not us citizens\nBut the arrogance of the president who came in belly a king about so called the illegal executive orders of his predecessor\nTo toy with the fourteenth amendment and the U.S constitution with an executive order himself\nA shows that he is a certainly not consistent and might be drunk with power it's\nNot drunk with power or not consistent what it is it's frustrating because the president has not been able to get Congress to act on immigration because Republicans and Democrats are cowards and they don't want to work together\nOn this and so the president is frustrated he knows there's an issue there people trying to invade this country walking here in a caravan across Mexico something needs to be done I Do want to clarify though because it's not about redefining natural born citizen there's a line in the fourteenth amendment that is\nPersons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nThat line it will be the line that will be debated by the Supreme Court as to what jurisdiction there are actually means when parents are either American born or not it's very possible to me if this executive order is done by Trump and if someone does challenge it and if it makes it to the Supreme Court that they'll actually rule in favor of this\nPresident as we continue here on the morning at your want you to know President Trump and the first lady Melania Trump are traveling to Pittsburgh today in the afternoon they will be there to meet with the ah families and loved ones of victims unfortunate to read that the mayor of Pittsburgh refuses to meet with President Trump\nTried to tell black people what was in their best interest and I've heard talk show I've known this a long time as you have ever plenty of white people on TALK radio try to tell black people what's in their best interest and and as we'll take calls at eight five five Seventy five eight to five five oh I'd love for a white person to tell me what black people\nAre naive about with regard to watching their best interest they live their reality they feed their families that they they go to work they know the challenges in their community how dare somebody who doesn't have their experience come all I mean that's in the journal is\nThe one game you're playing a game of make believe right now let me tell you what it what is true what is true is that you and I were blessed we are white Americans we it's a blessing well no we were blessed to be born in this country of white Americans\nThis is these are true statements and because of wherever we wear whatever our family's dead and however things played out in this country you and I had the right to grow up and decide whether or not we are going to be Republicans or Democrats with African Americans and southern present you said the number yourself\nOr Democrats which means and tells me that when it community is embracing a Democratic Party ripe for whatever reason whatever reason that started I Believe because the Democratic party was something completely different in history when they embrace that it's what you think you're supposed to do when you grow up when I grow up I register as a Democrat\nCandidate zones and and even President Trump if you want to bring up an example of a white person\nCome up and tell people look you've been doing the Democratic party for\nThis long what have they given you what would what President Trump has given them is the lowest African American unemployment in ... in our history given them a step up they've given a group a lift that the Democrats have not been able to do in fact using a huge demographic ... block kind of jumps and that will dumber\nOkay uh a few things and we'll get phone calls\nLimited on time uh I it's critical to say uh that black people are born\nAre blessed to be born African American I'm sure they have they they're not they're black okay born America and and you said you and I are born white Americans were able to decide if we want to be Republican or democratic it's split okay uh the the truth is\nI'm most white people\nUm are well certainly most older white people are Republicans are the point is that that is true that the suggestion you said that to you or or you suggested that young black people coming up growing up really don't have a choice they they just know that when they turn Eighteen they registered Democrats\nNot true they do have a choice but when eighty seven ... you said when eighty seven percent or their community will lead then if I wasn't clear let me clarify what can I say what I heard your community yeah is registering one way it's very unusual for you not to do the same thing right\nYou said you you said that you and I as white people white Americans had a choice we're blessed we had a choice\nTo fifty percent of our democratic ... Democrat fifty percent is Republican you they're using more broad\nYou said that we had a choice and the suggestion they are the implications that black people or don't have a choice when it comes to their party registration I just I just want to point out that that's a well then let me clarify you did you already get a here's a let's see uh Vincent in Inglewood on the morning answer Kanye West as part of this\nA movement called ... to get a black people to leave the Democratic party they're going to be very active\nNext year before the twenty twenty election go ahead Vincent by\nYour money guys Jennifer ... a young man speaking I write what you guys in the morning but it's hard to break that I think I like all of it I think a Donald Trump will love it I hate the one I was in grade eight anyone but the difference in the night that within the fight is\nRather your other Democrat and some of these areas that I Am tempted that's grown up in our society and they're not going to compromise carry a Jerry Brown is Republican I didn't agree with all the stuff that he did\nAll this is your job is Jerry Jerry Brown and Democrat we're going to stop you there but the last word few Jennifer because I don't want you feel like you've got the short\nLike I got the short shrift at all I just think that when you are with the demographic that goes so far in one direction okay so you eighty seven percent and I believe that to be a true number\nOf African Americans registered as Democrats it takes someone from that community light Kanye West or like Candace do and just say look I don't want you to to be forced to sweat but here's the other way and here's why we think it might benefit you and\nI think it's an important movement it's part of who we are as a country to give people choices and and better opportunity\nA little bit later toward the end of the show maybe we'll have this conversation again because of the lines are full this kind of people a lot of reaction a lot of tweets coming in and we're just hop on the break in a so apologized to people who are not going to be able to get to we have the Donald daily download happening next with the highlights of his Fox News appearance\nLast night morning answer for Tuesday Brian and Jennifer at seven thirty one\nIs your answer to morning\nThing just to have to have a partner to think of that going on in back and they tell him to finding down by the Ninety One right lane at the temptation to the ... and I sat down and I knew in my piece vilified off our clothes and all because of the people ... no I just kept that promise\nAnd then you're going to come across the classroom cutting road that twenty two hitting you found yourself on here have you back there and that one stock in the carpool lane and say you're looking at the south and going to tie them into the harbor boulevard\nAnd things out in the very end it looks like a wreck come up on the can down if\nYou're going to be that the carpool lane and blocked off and driving jammed ...
