couple of years ago when other countries built the all the immigrant stopped coming in and I think that's what we need to do here and we this Democrat play all\nThe Democrats aren't saying anything because they want these people and so they can stay in power because they're assuming these refugees are going to vote for them\nA couple years ago these Democrats while for the call\nNow all of a sudden because Trump is saying they're quiet no no no we need this wall and the American people want this wall if you let the people and put them in detention centers it'll tell you can talk about the mall\nWhat those detention centers are full of that though there's two point to point problem they're number one the detention centers are full from the last caravan and number two you saw what happened they got federal judges to say you can't separate children from from adults in terms of their detention centers\nAnd if you have them together as a family you can only keep them there for X number of days before you have to turn them loose end of the population and us you know we're turning thousands and thousands of people a\nA loose end of the population where they'll never come back for their actual asylum hearing and they become part of the eleven million twelve million twenty million illegal immigrants in this country that's the problem that's why the border wall by the way while I agree with you uh did you say your name was Debbie Donna\nDonna sorry ah so you were packed team call from your yourself and your husband\nBut um that's why a ... when we talked about the\nUm ah well not being the only solution here because the port of entry will still be a port of entry in between the giant wall and people are going to come to that and do the asylum claim that even if they do get held in a detention center there will be a temporary stay then they're going to get ... you know released into the population an added to those numbers so\nAh the wall there's a part of the solution but it is not the only solution and ah and I don't know what the answer is other than what are your home and said you're not bring our lawmakers back close the loop holes changed the wording of the fear of persecution or asylum claims that we allow in this country and really\nAnd also add that third you know third nation or element to this is well if another nation has agreed to

Ramos of Univision on S. and see the federal news channel I'm Sorry yeah Fox let's not federal near the Orion Fox News channel Jorge Ramos makes the case that the seven thousand migrants in the caravan marching toward the U.S border uh are not invading\nHow how that's going to work with the border up and everyone just out of the goodness of everyone's heart welcome in the seven million people and that's you\nKnow I I I I'm not for open borders I understand what you're saying and what not but I'm not for open borders I think that the immigration system that we have right now is simply not more can you know working for every one of Trump's immigration policies have complete failure\nYou'd have some work enforcement only it doesn't work and what we need is a legal immigration system that really works now despite the optics I Know that if you are in the United states and you are watching this that you might take all we're going to be invaded that is not true there is knowing based on here we are talking about seven thousand right\nNow maybe a few thousand more but it's trying to cross the border between Mexico and ...\nYeah but they're not going to make it to make it more now\nYeah these are the true there's only eleven million people in the United states a quarter undocumented only that I remain stable for the last ...\nLast night on Fox News' Martha macadam with a a at times heated debate with Univision Jorge Ramos continues slick\nBeing asked his for Latin America Mexico to to take their share of the burden to manage this problem perhaps to find a way to improve their own economy so that everybody doesn't want to what\nI Would do and I think uh Mexico has on his part president Pena Nieto a unfortunately for many immigrants Mexicans in Central America um the Mexican\nPolice have become that Trump's immigration police that's the truth\nWe want to live without that we watch it at France in ... and ... that go over one doesn't care that there was any attempt to really handle that\nSo many Mexican please try to prevent\nA ... to pass by and you know immigration is through it and they said I'm going through a rich they use the river and through they are so it didn't work and president putting and you don't try to be calm Trump's police and just simply didn't work\nFrom Univision that's Jorge Ramos a prominent critic of President Trump invited on Fox News channel with Martha macadam yesterday and this final highlight clip Jorge Ramos explains how this caravan got started in the first place so people\nThat are coming out of the cat that was just keeps growing and growing why why now why now how why did this all come to pass and it's growing in numbers by the day\nWell I think it has to do it started with social media I feed it what happening and the other part of the world and it's so interesting because I didn't see any conspiracy here for any collusion or Democrats or Republicans but deep end is absolutely no one else happening is that once people in Central America especially under what else months they learn\nOne ton about what's going north they decided to join for two reasons first said they are not risking being great for me and bond allies underway from Central America to the United states and then you have to do with money market simply money we believe in Honduras oh what am I allowed\nYou want to go to the United states you've got to pay for your call you up there were a smoker ... maybe six thousand dollars maybe up to seven thousand dollars but if you are part of this kind of event\nYou won't pay you anything so I think it has to do with a safety and you have to do with money and that's why we have right now about seven thousand people in Mexico ready and if you talk some more waiting at the ...\nJorge Ramos on the caravan of migrants who are immigrants President Trump Jennifer Horn blaming Guatemala Honduras El Salvador and threatening to pull aid from those countries quote we will now be getting cutting off or subsequently reducing\nThe mass of foreign aid routinely given that President Trump tweeted is the president and the administration in your view Gen over reacting to this absolutely\nNot you have a group a gaggle of people that are trying to storm our borders and President Trump has it bachelor today at the military he's got federal border authorities out on this he called this a national emergency and it absolutely as we're a country of law and order and this is not how you get into this country there are people who need political asylum\nWho could absolutely get it these people are bypassing all of the rules to come in through the backdoor\nAs we continue Tuesday Morning answer Brian and Jennifer together again thank you for joining us on a on a Saturday LA Orange County am five Ninety in the I.

Roberts who played for the red Sox in fact in two thousand and four when they won that World Series against the ... he was the reason he was one of them for sure and Alex Cora is the manager of the red Sox Alex choir played for the red Sox but also played for the Dodgers so you have managers who have played for both teams\nWho are former players who are both relatively young guys\nAnd I think this is going to make for an interesting coaching matchup\nIt's hard to draw many other comparisons because I think it was a hundred years ago that uh the Dodgers and the red Sox last met in the world series and of course the winner of that series I think it was a ...\nWill have to Google that I you know just a tiny bit before I don't know if I remember that game but the the Dodgers and this is going to be a pitching match up their starting pitching for the red Sox I think has been a little stronger the Dodgers have struggled with their starting rotation although ... Clinton crush on his left magnificent\nDuring this postseason ... has been pretty good his last outing was a little shaky but we'll see the Dodgers bullpen is strong the hitting started to come back towards the end of the Milwaukee Brewers the series so hopefully they can get all those moving parts in order\nYou were in the you were on vacation or in beautiful Hawaii I was a crazy person I was with a ... and I remind the dawn of something that you had said when the prospect of the Dodgers\nPlaying the Milwaukee Brewers for the national league championship series a was looming you as a Dodger fan true blue Dodger fan you were Jennifer Horn admittedly a bit hum you were um shifting in your chair a little bit\nBut the Dodgers are they did beat the brewers it took seven games uh but but they beat the brewers surprising a lot of prognosticators\nYeah and I think the brewers for me looked to be the toughest challenge for the Dodgers that doesn't mean I'm taking the red Sox lately they had an amazing record this year they have won so many games the Dodgers have\nIt just kind of popped over the Ninety mark but what I think will be ... what you see in the Dodgers team is you see a spirit in if you've been at Dodger fan for your life like I have you've seen a Dodger team when they would get behind and it runs scored and if they were losing a lot of times they would give up\nThis team does not give up they never count themselves out there is a confidence that they will be able to come back and win and so much of that chemistry and optimism and confidence comes into play we just have to get those bats going because they're a team\nThat that left to hit homers and they left to take bold and we've got to get that hitting on on the part that really move forward in the series\nNight Fenway Park five o nine hour time first pitch Clayton Kurt Shaw on the mountain for your Los Angeles Dodgers\nDodger he's\nGot this migrant caravan of about seven thousand people

going to be here for the weekend home so I spent time in Boston it's like a foreign country to me because the accents and everything and I did see a game of my favorite American cities like yeah I

spent a lot of time there\nAnd it was always very nice very cultural the people are very nice but when they open their mouth and started talking I guess is how people feel when they would visit my

Thirteen members among the seven thousand and there are a criminals in there which is standard Trump's rhetoric when it comes to talking about ... when I talked to a well there's been no headcount done and we haven't run records show issue people\nThat I've seen so far at least reported this morning on the news had at one got picked up because of a murder and the other was a member of the gang so to say that the stuff that the president saying is not true maybe it's not primarily true but there are people who are coming here with bad intentions who have criminal histories and by nature criminals for coming into the country illegally and\nTo paint a group of seven thousand based on those two statistics is statistically honest or dishonest\nWell I think it's true I think you have people who are by their very nature all criminals because they are looking to come into this country and not use a proper channels by the very nature if you come into the country without using a appropriate door to get in here I Believe you're a criminal okay\nBut that's not the question I asked Santa and I'll I'll ask it politely and ... and and take your answer them want to hear the ladies on the view talking about this curve and for some comic relief uh when when when the president of the United states the leader of the free world uh takes a couple of cases are two steps that you just offered\nAnd tries to paint with a very broad brush a group of seven thousand people who are mostly looking for better lives for their families and their children do\nYou think that statistically honest or statistically dishonest a statistician would say it's dishonest statistically I think\nThat this president is very well aware of who is in this group I think he is very well aware of the fact that they are illegally trying to get into this country if they were looking for asylum and if they were concerned with the safety of their children they would go into the country that is closest to them that would provide safety and shelter that is Mexico\nBecause they felt they could afford to them like they were discovered what does this mean can we make sure this sort of\nRepeated keep it right here we\nOne station talking to each other [laughter] [noise]\nBy and women's voices\nWhat else do you need to start your day\nMorning and\nThanks for joining us on your Tuesday\nMorning answer AM eight Seventy LA Orange County am five Ninety in the eye able to get to the migrant caravan of seven thousand making their way to America's borders but first beer fridge\nOkay London sky news is now reporting that parts of the body of Washington Post columnist Jamal because she'll have been found\nA Turkish government official is saying that the death was a planned operation those two pieces of breaking news this morning on the search for the missing body of the presumed murdered Washington Post op ed writer ... ...\nYeah Turkey's president or to one actually gave a much anticipated speech earlier today while we were sleeping actually Brian and he rejected Saudi Arabia's claim that the journalist was killed accidentally or as part of a fight he called on the perpetrators to be brought to justice in Istanbul and questioned whether\nTo Vienna conventions which give immunity diplomatic staff actually applied to this case\nBut definitely I think probably the the biggest piece of news from Myrtle want speeches that he believed that this wasn't just an accidental death maybe something escalated that this was actually a premeditated\nMurder President Trump was getting on the helicopter yesterday so we had the district voice which is down here and then you add them speaking very seriously about\nBrett Kavanaugh or a great guy\nAnd then when you have the ... that they're trying to compete with that I kept it it's very good but you got this caravan I mean it's totally out of control so here's dropping you hear the helicopter in the background\nAnd I'll tell you I'll tell you a big factor what's happening on the border what's happening in the\nAnybody can break the law that our\nPresident now goes on to challenge a White House reporter there to take a camera go deep into the seven thousand person long caravan and do some investigating and see what he finds a among those in the care of\nThem are going to the middle of the\nCameras\nOn camera do isn't middle sure you're going to have you got to find Middle Eastern you got to find everything I guess what we're not allowing them guys want to say\nThat some breaking news this morning the president is sending his words as many troops military troops as necessary to prevent the seven thousand migrants in this caravan from entering the U.S president is supported by some very high profile Republicans\nOr when it comes to stopping the caravan like former house speaker Republican Newt Gingrich\nOh I think it's important to stop this caravan impart to send a signal to the rest of Latin America no you're not going to be allowed to come in and in part because in the process of stopping if we're going to learn a lot about the laws of need to be changed\nAnd frankly Congress maybe in the lame duck session how do we challenge ... not to know my comprehensive reform plus eight to ten dumb things let's just fix one step at a time and begin to make it possible to manage our border\nThat's former Speaker Newt Gingrich on the migrant care of and making its way rolling rolling but no but they're not driving they're all ... gosh you see I I mean again you have\nTo and we'll hear from the other side on this show we got from been Gingrich saying stop the caravan Jorge Ramos of Univision a critic of President Trump was interviewed on Fox News channel last night by Martha macadam one must wonder\nAnd a briefly year to get a lot of audio but I Want you to have the last word one must wonder\nI saw a picture of a lot of young men and it looks like young fathers are women and children they're coming through water that is by\nA wide would want to do that to oneself one would do that to oneself for only one reason or because where they're coming from is a desperate place with no hope and they should go to a place with hope and a better life for their family\nI think they're looking for a job the Washington Post it put ... reporters in with those people that are walking and many of them say they're not seeking asylum or that their families are not in trouble and Honduras but they're looking for work they want to get they want to make money they want an American job\nAnd I appreciate all of that but that's not how this works here a lot of people that want to walk into this country we have to be a nation of law and nation of order and we have to respect the laws that are on the books and you know what they should be a wakeup call to Congress Republicans and Democrats alike that our immigration system is broken and they need to stop\nMessing around and they need to stop talking the talk and they actually need to fix the problem\nFor hey Ramos of Univision a prominent critic as I said a moment ago President Trump was invited on FM she'd be federal news channel it's Fox News ... alongside the up and see I have known and I get the F screwed up\nIf you ask yeah okay wow\nMartha ... has kind of a spicy exchange with Jorge Ramos Jorge Ramos says the caravan it's not loaded with criminals are terrorists\nThere might be in in the United states before so some of them being deported without majority not Martha and something really important is that the vast majority of these people\nAre not criminals there no terrorists and they're not even immigrants that refugees and al ... nation in the United states\nWe have to choose what kind of mission we are and treat them with respect to we we cannot pre ... we're going to say all of them are are criminals all of them I represent that is not true so what we have to do is to listen to them to the cases and they just sort of political asylum been run it to them\nThat Jorge Ramos of Univision on Fox News with mark macadam it get spicy Jorge Ramos says hold on despite the rhetoric you're hearing of this caravan does not represent an invasion\nHow how that's going to the border up and everyone just out of the goodness of everyone's heart welcome in fifty seven million people and then you\nKnow I I I I'm not for open borders I understand where they were saying and what not but I'm not for open borders I think that the immigration system that we have right now we should be no more can you know working for every one of Trump's immigration policies have complete failure\nYou have some work enforcement only it doesn't work and what we need is a legal immigration system that really works now despite the optics I Know that if you are in the United states and you are watching this fat you might take all we're going to be invaded that he's not true there is knowing based on here we are talking about seven thousand\nRight now maybe a few thousand more than ... trying to cross the border between Mexico and ...\nYeah but they're not going to make it to make a tit for tat\nSays these are the two there's only Lebanese people in the United states who are undocumented all indata remain stable for the last ...\nLast night Fox News channel Martha macadam with Univision Jorge Ramos before we get to the final clip here eight five five Seventy five eight to five five in the upcoming segment we'll try to include some of your phone calls lots of reaction to this migrant caravan Jorge Ramos tells us all how this caravan got started the\nPeople that are coming out of the cat that was just keeps growing and growing why why now why now how why did this all come to pass and it's growing and numbers by the day\nI think um it has to do it started with social media I see it happening and the other part of the world and it's so interesting because I didn't see any conspiracy here for any collusion or Democrats or Republicans but if you've been induced absolutely know what happened is that once people in Central America especially under what else moms they learn\nOne carbon what's going north they decided to join for two reasons for safety they are not risking Bob being great for me and bond allies underway from Central America to the United states and then you have to do with money mark on simply money we believe in on the world so they might not\nWant to go to the United states you gotta pay up all your ... your ... ... maybe seek sauce\nDollars maybe up to seven thousand dollars but if you are part of this caravan you won't pay you anything so I think it has to do with a safety and you have to do with money and that's why we have right now about seven thousand people in Mexico are ready and if you've had some more waiting at the ... the amount of order\nTrump critic especially on the issue of immigration Jorge Ramos invited onto the Fox news channel last night and change with Martha macadam right\nThere yeah I you know I think we're spending so much energy talking about who's in this group it doesn't matter to me who is in this group the fact is you cannot get into a group seven thousand deep and try to invade this country and try to cross the border illegally it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if there are people looking for asylum and not their proper channels to go through and they're not using\nNow this morning seven thirty six we bring you the Donald daily download you don't want to miss it this morning it ... let me tell you that thanks for joining us on your Tuesday Morning answer Brian and Jennifer back in the saddle rarely\nA ... the right intentions what do you think conservatives should do when they vote how why should they vote for you\nCan tell you this I think ... you know sent a tweet out the other day what do you do it you know his brother\nHoward is off and on his laptop so it might have got through it\nBut they did a tweet in support of my candidacy I Know I got quite a few Republican colleagues ... a Republican state senators\nAnd Republican state of suddenly members who have a while though not officially endorse my kind of does he have voted for me it would for me June ... primary reason why they know me they know regardless of what Jennifer said or what my values are of the positions I've taken the Republicans why have worked with no me they respected me\nUh they know that I've never um demagogued against them personally we've had respectful disagreement some policy issues but they know that uh\nUh what can help them I Will help them there's no question about that\nKevin daily on is our guest state senator running against Dianne Feinstein you're in a very interesting political dynamic here I Am a proud liberal I'm a pretty traditional Democrat some bar morning answer listeners would say oh you're far out progressive and liberal left us not you know but everybody's entitled to their opinion you're never rich and here they submitted I Am the only one I'm proud to be the only one out of\nThe United states should not on the rise of\nAll of our stations I think I'm the only liberal certainly in a high profile position of action is working here\nI'd like to think about that by\nBroadcast history and talents that have brought me forward but whatever the case so so a senator daily on\nA Republicans many of them conservative Republicans who are politically you're polar opposite if we looked at issues if we sat here and did a chart we would see significant opposition between their genuine positions and your genuine positions we have to believe that\nThere's some other reason that staunch conservative Republicans would be coming out of the proverbial woodwork\nTo support your candidate she against Dianne Feinstein will you acknowledge here this morning on the morning answer that much of that has to do with the very very\nEmotional visceral anger that these conservative Republicans have with Senator Feinstein over at the cabinet confirmation hullabaloo ... ... ... are you not the beneficiary of the I'm going to call it visceral hatred that many of them have for the person you happen to be running against a fellow Democrat well\nLet me say this I don't have any empirical evidence I don't have no quantitative research to verify exactly what you just said no pickled that I can tell you this as a news can to Jennifer's point\nI hadn't been camping up and down the city California uh with Republicans would Democrats would claim the states they drive up right after this I go to Fresno allowed to Fresno Bee editorial board and I got to spend a lot of time in Central Valley\nI spent a lot of time with conservatives would would Democrats conservative Democrats are for right wing ideologue you know conservatives as well as free marketeers liberal Republicans quote unquote [noise]\nAnd uh I've been campaigning with Democrats Republicans and points in between declined the states because I Believe strongly that the policies that I Move forward\nClean air clean water because we as Republicans and Democrats breed the same crap year the shake a difference just a high wage paying jobs as a clean energy space healthcare I Believe in health care for all therefore I Believe that doesn't make a difference it voted for Trump\nBernie Sanders for Hillary Clinton to me I strongly believe that you should have healthcare coverage so these are issues that I care deeply about which I Believe on non ideological and I'm a political however in this very highly partisan country we tend to part of a politicized every single thing you know every single policy\nAnd it was funny because I was in Japan last year and I had a meeting with prime minister Shinzo Abe's\nOr day after I met with the minister of health and he said the funny thing about America is an issue of healthcare you can't even have a reasonable debate\nBecause you take something that is a fundamental a right or somebody that's so important and you politicize it doesn't make a difference if you're conservative or liberal is a health care is healthcare you just want to know you have that\nAnd and your to your point and I said if you're buying all the time if I were at night in the Democratic party all across the country I Would say focused on those issues right now it seems like there's a lot of anti Trump hysteria and I know that he's not for everybody I Know that his decorum can sometimes leave a whole people are looking for somebody who's more diplomatic but when all of the\nPassion is about taking down somebody because of his Twitter habits and not on issues that's really difficult I Do want to ask you though that taxes because in fact California as you mentioned clean air and water I agree with you we want that I think we just have different paths and how to get there when you have things like that and you pop sex which is about the gas tax I Know you were involved with that\nHow can you or how do we justify in California where we pay so much to live here it's a beautiful state can you guarantee that you'll you'll rally for those middle class Americans are middle class Californians who are struggling to pay to live here\nLet me say this is that's a very good point I Want to make in a ... a repeal the the so called that a gas tax ...\nPoliticians Democrats or Republicans as well as governors for the last twenty five years and have to kick the can down the pothole either rode\nA and they've done nothing with regards to rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure retrofit our bridges which are unsafe for many Californians are you know all these potholes you've hit them before the damage that sent or cars or ... or ... we have to foot the bill personally\nCalifornians are spending tens of millions of dollars on the basis of their own personal pocket to fix or suspension as well as their tires but this was an opportunity this is an opportunity to grow this economy put Californians to work\nAnd retrofit you know our crumbling infrastructure so it's sort of kind of pay as you go which means should we tax individuals who don't use the roads should we tax individuals or should we tax individuals or a dune assessment on individual who actually physically use them as so in a way it's a progressive\nOr a revenue and has been as opposed to aggressive one because if you don't use the roads why are you paying\nFor the state senator Kevin de Leon we're up on the clock he is a progressive Democrat I think he has no problem are

U.S they just got a couple of months ago\nFor someone who is surrounded in his own family by so many immigrants uh he seems to really identify\nThe Mexico Central American countries as the countries where the bad immigrants are more likely to come from because you never hear this kind of talk from the president when we talk about immigrants from Sweden we in fact quite the opposite we ...\nWe heard him say months ago something to be effective I think it was Sweden and Norway wouldn't it be nice if we had more immigrants from Norway Sweden which had something very close to that show the bias is is just right in front of your face\nOut there to buy if you're buying these are people then\nHow do you explain the biggest the biggest myth understanding the biggest misconception the biggest thing that people on the left tried to spin\nIs that conservatives are anti immigrant that's not true talking about I don't ... and I'm Talking about Trump to Trump is not anti immigrant I'm not anti immigrant Republicans are not anti immigrant we respect the law and so all of the people that came into this country that maybe are members of Trump's family my family your family\nThey all came in the right way they came into the right channels they worked hard and they pay their taxes they didn't get together white gang and hope that saying that they want asylum which is an ally as at least if you believe the reporting of the Washington Post are looking for jobs using and they're marching their way in here sure\nJennifer do you think there are criminals there are Nordic Swedish criminals who want to immigrate to America do you think those people exist\nI think criminals exist everywhere yeah answers yet for okay\nWhy doesn't the president speak with even one percent of the passion about immigrants from every other nation in the world um he clearly has judgments about countries we heard the profanity he used about African nations calling them asshole countries so clearly he has prejudged or judged\nOr whatever he was he he he can he can pick his um his ah his qualifier\nHe has brought opinions about certain nations and Mexico seems to be a a country that is at the bottom of his mental list of where good and bad people come from\nThat's not true but it is ... they're not from Mexico and just tell me when this last group of ... walked into this country\nWhen he laments that he wishes we had more immigrants from Norway and Sweden in that area of the world he shows his cards uh when it\nCards I Am sick of the idea that he's a racist he's the capital and you know how it'll isn't there is no race and you\nJust hope that's definitely not true you you just told me that there are criminals in Norway so so where is the where is the uh the red flag where's where's the banner being waved to protect the American people from a bad people who might immigrate from uh from\nCanada their criminal or next coming here I mean I think this is what ... the argument\nHere and do disagree that there are any criminal shore Norwegian\nI think there are criminals who are Norwegian wandering around here I'm going to want to come I don't know I mean do they here's the thing that email because it is because of geography and let's just be honest here people because of geography you don't have the Swiss\nComing into this country you just don't have that happening because you don't have the marching here when they come in on a plane is a little easier to that now I have no problem with people from Honduras coming here or from Mexico coming here in fact I celebrate people who use immigration\nAnd who come here legally we are a country of immigrants however people who come in the back door are not coming through as part of the system there is no way to track them there's no way to vet them so I ask you do you have a problem with people marching into this country in gangs\nAnd you're are you have to tell me that bother you as an American patriot\n... you know you don't have to tell me what I have to tell you I'll just go ahead and freely tell you uh what I think they are not a marching into this country they will be met\nBy military forces as our president and confirmed this morning I support as a any level headed Democrat I've talked to about this issue says I support full vetting of those who show up at our borders if they're seven thousand of them will like Jorge Ramos I mean a a real proponent\nOf of immigration from Central American and and uh and other countries are under a sub Mexico for example here in the in the block of America's uh this is a a you know ... of course we need to vet these people nobody says don't let them but they're overwhelming\nOur system so we can't that's the reason they're coming in a mob there'll be better at the swimming and they're coming in there walking and I trust him doing this now I trust\nThe U.S military uh my father was a brave member of that I trust the U.S military or if the president's going to send them there to handle the vetting and make sure that nobody just marches right into America\nWe agree on that the military deployment to meet these people I think is absolutely appropriate\nSo the answer to your question as they can be better they will be vetted by the greatest military in human history and there'll be\nTurned back in many in many cases these are people who have already been turned back for the most part these are a lot of people who've been deported already because they've come into this country illegally\nBefore at your Tuesday Morning answer Brian and Jennifer here as we continue updates on the murder of the op ed opinion\nWriter for the Washington Post your mall to show the more details and some of them are grim are coming forward will bring you the very latest on this a mysterious story if nothing else it's age sixteen\nThe one of the most amazing things to me about the ... story the death the murder Jennifer is the ... if you can imagine the wife waiting in the car I mentioned this to Don ... while you were a finishing up your vacation\nHow how swift how expeditious this attack murder and dismembered mid must have been you've got somebody waiting in the car or I mean how long would you typically wait for someone in the car because she'll give is obviously going in there for what max Fifteen minutes I mean no person is going to wait I think about the times I wait for friends and cars it's usually hey\nFifteen minutes max just hang out a way to write\nAnd because he's got his family ever with them of course it seemed to unexpected and they even mentioned that there was a body devil used it to put on his clothing and his garments to to leave it at the video footage could actually show him leaving the consulate\nShow someone we thought was seemingly\nBut that's right so this is all leading up this evidence is a leading up to the claim from Myrtle won that this was a premeditated that this was something a and of course the Saudis instead this was accidental that there was some kind of fighter altercation and that this wasn't planned but now that the uh the Turks are actually saying look there's there is pre meditation clearly here not only do you have\nSomeone who was walking out that there's evidence perhaps that some of his remains were planted in the garden in the back of the consulate ...\nIt is so scary and of course uh the oddest thing is that I guess we're still the Saudis are still on the clock investigating this I I fell over when my palm pay or secretary of state said to President Trump you know we need to give them the ... a little more time to investigate what happened here to ... make no mistake folks\nThe Saudi Arabian government uh which runs their own constantly in Turkey or they are the suspects in this murder I made the point uh last week\nThis would be like Brent would Nineteen Ninety four letting OJ Simpson investigate the murders of Nicole Enron in in in in ... there are no criminal shootings that I'm aware of where the investigator is the primary suspect typically\nI mean the habits of the LAPD or happens of police officers when you're the government a government is different than an individual and clearly this is not a black and white issue when you bring in the Saudi into anything it gets very gray and very murky and you have\nTo give them the benefit of the doubt for an investigation because at ... I Believe any president would do that because most presidents either need Saudi Arabia for Middle East ability but we are Valerie they're taking money of course we have values that I mean like the Clintons to twenty five million from the ... if I'm not I'm not\nI'm not here to defend the Clintons I'm here to defend American value I\nAnd I'm not disagreeing with you what I'm saying is if Hillary Clinton had won that she would be in the same position where you have to let these people present with they with their side of the story it's going to be now I think Trump needs to act swiftly on that and all indications are that he says what they're what they're providing is obviously not satisfactory\nYeah he made that comment last week and we want to hear more of that and get to the bottom of this as we continue on your morning answer for a Tuesday [noise]\nYeah you're going to be doing fantasy\nYou want to fantasize with me so what do we\nThink you'll know in a moment our morning after
