school\nAnd they eat like it that way and then they get outside the door and house payments that it seems like such that easy for these protesters to do that and they are hurt way too much in Washington and hearing aid I mean I think that's a great point not solving by that\nBeck is so much Carrie and New Hampshire\n\nJudge Kavanaugh as qualified and he had the experience is just the person\nThat you wanted to Supreme Court but more importantly I feel like this is such that critical moment here with what you've been talking about like Madison talking that we need to stand that perfect over the ... to stand up for profit principle we're going to disagree in that country that we have to figure out a way to disagree that is respectful\nOne last call from Teresa in Missouri before I go back to the doctors balding what do you think Theresa should Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed\nAbsolutely shy and I just feel that that everything that has happened concerning hip nomination\nAnd that it it had just come from a very bad place and and it it's just all laid back and forth and you know it's I think that that type of fat and I think at some point you have to look at the tax as what you know them and and and I think he absolutely should be confirmed\nThank you so much that Spalding I've at thirty nine calls thirty nine ... we do not screening drunken crazy people they all want confirmed\nIt it it it's an amazing um outpouring but I'm also struck by how they're making very good points and in in reason points I mean that that the caller I think she was from the New Hampshire a about facts was not feelings I'm\nRight they ... they they see that but this is why we have this whole process I mean the whole movement the creation of the American constitutional system these tablets Schmidt of of this thing we call the founding\nThat we're trying to protect here was precisely to set up a process by which we disagree in front of a month we have great disagreements you still have a process a legitimate a fair a judge process so that we come to\nThe reason a deliberate conclusions and we can govern ourselves we can go forward as a nation this these days that this does come together here I Am really moved by these these calls I'm at the extent that they see they see the core thing going on here this is\nA is unjust but it's also an attack on the very system\nThat's behind that that is necessary to uphold justice on a day to day basis in a in a free country and that's a very powerful\nSo I don't know how this is close Smith Spalding I really don't because it it is so transparent and the stories this morning about witness manipulation upset or are you an optimist about this and when it's all said and done\nWell I'm an optimist about I'm not necessarily an optimist I mean a lot of messing is at our politics for some time there's there's a lot of um a aspects of this it needs to be kind of deconstruct it out of the system where I Am an optimist about these calls I think\nUnderscore that optimism I've always been an optimist about the American people and their ability to govern themselves when they're engaged in what's when something is before them I mean this goes back to the old notion about the jury system is based on what twelve of your peers\nOrdinary Americans they decide these things why because that's how we we we we do that in the ... the character is formed in a way that they're going to be fair and just um\nThat's I think the only source we can have optimism ultimately the question is whether the American people engage on this and other questions in ways that restores self government and pain rebuild that system I'm In in the near future if at all possible\nIt we can we can proceed\nYeah it is just a remarkable to me thirty nine phone calls no screening but I Do have left to smear it at all I got out of our dogs are just left the that sneer tells us so much mapped the last minute to you\nKnow it does we this is this is a confrontation between the two two ways of a rule to two regimes if you will hear the same country one wants expert rule whether it's bureaucratic rule or ruled by judges that do what or whatever the heck they want or they don't believe in popular opinion\nWas the\n[noise]\nThey can use every morning this is the more the answer would try and with my job for morning thanks for joining us finally\nFriday on your morning answer the county is on [noise]\nThe U.S Senate will vote a Jew and closure now what is closure you'll get some information right up top here morning in sort of six o'clock club listeners\nA to invoke cloture cloture closer to invoke cloture and the U.S Senate\nCheck blood chair I feel like I heard George W. Bush that club ... it's a good word for him and I know there are some words that are better for ... I'm ... I'm learning from you I just heard it and that voice ...\nSome words that are\nBetter for other characters than uh than other words to invoke cloture is to end debate over changing the Senate rules the original version of the rule\nWould then still a ... will still applies so this morning a procedure for ending a debate and taking a vote on judge Kavanaugh a cloture motion will be voted on by the full US Senate right\nThis is kind of a preliminary vote if you're looking at it to see a where everybody is ... ... with their heads space and then this is not the final vote that will most likely happened on Saturday today's vote is simply procedural and Republicans are looking for just a simple majority to end debate and\nMake no mistake about it this is a part of every procedure in the Senate is not unique to judge Brett Kavanaugh and ... I Would say if you see a senator vote yes today\nThere's probably a good likelihood that they will vote yes again tomorrow chicken from Brett Kavanaugh which would be the final confirmation about\nWhat is unique to Supreme Court nominee is to write an op ed an opinion piece in editorial piece on the opinion editorial pages of Wall Street journal\nFrom a Supreme Court nominee days away from a full Senate vote that's what Brett Kavanaugh has done judge Kavanaugh in his Wall Street journal op ed says that job he behaved in some respects inappropriately during his testimony that he said some things he wishes he hadn't said he didn't really detail what those things are and\nHe apologized for some of the content of his testimony but didn't really detailed what the what he was apologizing for but that appears in today's paper\nThat's right he released that are bad and I told you about is town actually release it last night night that's right now I think what we want to watch for today and we will be carrying all of that all of the important stuff you will hear right here on the morning answer and we are\nYour full cloture morning show\nTo make sure you have your clothes on for the closer the expectation is that\nThe senators who we've been watching right\nJeff Flake Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins Joe mansion there's really a list of for now because we know that senator Donnelly seems to be a no Heidi Heitkamp said yesterday she would be a no but these four senators who are undecided we'll have an opportunity to release a statement or even go to the floor and kind of announced what their intentions are before\nThey cast their votes so this is going to be a critical day to critical data watch because Republicans don't yet have\nThe vote for sure wrapped up all the indications are good at that Kavanaugh will get confirmed by a slim margin it seems more likely that Collins inflate will probably vote yet Murkowski here is really the one person along with Joe mansion that um they're the wild card that's what they're going to do it's\nBeing reported this morning I Believe by CNN that as a dog on the east coast time in Washington DC so close to ... city where I grew up in New York City that Republicans on this cloture vote this morning right now as of dawn don't have the votes they're not sure they\nHave the votes it's a key Senate vote to advance the confirmation of judge Brett Kavanaugh it happens this morning at about seven thirty our time uh we'll cover live of course those votes some senators have become very emotional Chuck Grassley the Senate Judiciary committee\nChairman blowing up of the Democrats about how long this process has taken\nA this is the eighty seventh day saw that's three weeks longer than the average of the last three or four nominees to the Supreme Court [noise] so don't tell me wherever spent enough time [noise]\nAlso I feel very good about where this nomination is right now no I don't say that from the standpoint of counting votes I say that from the standpoint of the qualifications as candidate and the fact that those qualifications\nTo be a Supreme Court justice based upon his twelve years on the DC circuit without anybody find any fault with his qualifications to serve their\nBut that hasn't been talked about much\nWell I mean an obvious answer to Senator Grassley I think Jennifer you and I will agree is that ah this allegation a well known anonymously during the summertime by Dianne Feinstein\nA this was not known that these allegations were not verbalize used in the previous settings that the FBI has done with regard to judge Brett Kavanaugh so that's sort of a a straw man argument\nYeah I think ... maybe maybe so maybe I'd agree I Do know that this process has taken a long time and Brian whether or not these senators want to vote yes or no I think it is pro appropriate to have this vote today\nMove on and have the final though tomorrow and then we know is judge Kavanaugh not going to be deemed a suitable for sitting on the Supreme Court ... there's been\nA bit of good news may be a silver lining for Republicans who are looking at what they got that those John Cornyn is the majority whip in the Senate Republican senators Steve Gaines who's from Montana it made an announcement that he will be in Montana\nOh to walk his daughter down the aisle which would indicate to me that Republicans are probably close to being confident she's getting married rioting Merrill okay you know the proverbial I uh you know what will go down the pier yeah no no no she's getting married and he of\nCourse wants to be there for that but as best wishes to the corner and I would imagine that if they thought they needed that vote that they would probably do everything\nThey needed to do to try to get there to be some delay or to try to get him\nIn Washington DC and then also to Montana and time for the the wedding of his daughter we heard\nFrom Senator Chuck Grassley on the other side of the aisle Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer says what the heck is going on here with this Kavanaugh drowned well it is\nThere's only one document for a hundred members to see it in the course of the day\nVery hard to do when a lot of doctors is only one copy of these documents weren't there ten copies in that room what the heck is going on here but it's just a pattern\nOf limiting access to fat limiting access to a truth limiting access\nTo what the American people ought to know\nAnd what you what Schumer doesn't say there but I think he believes is Republicans led by the White House rigged the FBI investigation background check a into Kavanaugh as well back to Grassley who is still hot adopt the Democrats saying this all started going down hill rather quickly got all\nThis started downhill very quickly on about July the town\nWhen Schumer say I'd say\nThat we're going to do everything we can to stop this nomination and you go back in eighty seven days and you just see the everything but whether he's qualified to serve has been brought up\nWell that would be the same as Mitch McConnell saying in the first days of the Obama years that his goal was to make Iraq Obama a one term president\nDifferences is that Merrick Garland never even got to vote I Would say with Democrats saying we're going to do everything we can not to get him confirmed it's hard to take seriously that if you're a conservative or an independent some of these charges like throwing ice at a bar when you're in college because it seems like a takedown effort from the left because they don't want to confirm him at any cost on the flip\nSide by love it's also everything the Republicans did during the Obama first term seems like\nA itch trumped up no pun intended if in the first days of President Obama's administration back in two thousand and nine\nThe Senate leader Mitch McConnell a Republican says his goal here is number one goal is to ensure that Obama is a one term president that means they're going after him for anything and everything to make him a one term president my point\nIs yeah I Know I get a Republican or Democrat what grass ladies explaining here is not exclusive to the Republicans or the demographic public\nAnd didn't take apart a person's life with such personal allegation that's a real Christ Air Christine Ford has made the allegations that Americans to let America crashed mishandled her as\nWell as American three American citizens ah Christine for ... and Julie sweating that cat made the allegations against a judge Kavanaugh not Dianne Feinstein a not a A N e club char\nThey weaponize them that's the difference is that they not be hurting for these are not victim especially when it ... at the hands of the Democratic party in this country the ... the ... the party that says there for the women in this country had they've completely bungled that and they've done a lot to harm Christine Ford and of course judge Brett Kavanaugh\nBriefly she says she witnessed or groups of I'm not going to use a a terms that are offensive it's six twenty seven in the morning of groups of young men uh a little lining up to uh to take advantage of young women right\nAnd so that was absent from this report that I'm\nSorry that is an offensive term I realized that's an offensive or no way to describe it as a way to describe it other than that right\nSexual pile on is how I've been trying to say it as it but there is no classy way to discuss what she is alleging they FBI did say in this report that the reason they didn't do further down the line with the claims made by Deborah Ramirez who is the second person to come out who witnessed him exposing himself allegedly at a party\nOr is that there was an attempt by anti Kavanaugh\nForces to try to impact\nThe testimony of certain witnesses that was written in by the FBI so if we want full transparency here again it's a reminder are we really looking for the truth or are we looking for things for Republicans on one side to use against Democrats and for Democrats to use against Republicans\nI don't know how concerned with the truth anybody sitting in that Senate committee really is with the exception of a handful of people\nOn US Senator who is being watched very closely because she lives in the state of North Dakota where there's a few people who voted for Donald Trump who are Republican more than a few in her state Democrat a Heidi Heitkamp is a United States senator she announced yesterday she'll be voting no on Brett Kavanaugh this morning in one hour's time\nShe will vote no in this key Senate vote to advance the confirmation of judge Brett Kavanaugh here senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota in her own words\nA lifetime appointment\nA political decision if this were a political decision for me I certainly wouldn't be deciding this the other way um but I you know there's an old saying history will judge you but most importantly you inject yourself\nAnd that's really what I'm saying I Can't get up in the morning and look at the life experience that I've had and say yes to judge Kavanaugh\nThat senator Heidi Heitkamp I think that's a genuine and I think that type of bravery\nOr I'm not calling it a profile to encourage but I'm saying that type of ah courage in politics on both sides is rare she's in a state that went for Trump\nOr they want cap and all and uh and just like when she was going to lose and she's saying that she can't look at herself in the mirror knowing that this guy will ship for thirty or forty years with her help on the U.S Supreme Court it's going to be very interesting to see what happens in one hour from now again\nIt's a vote to invoke cloture which is to end the debate over changing the Senate rules and to move on to a full Senate vote meaning tomorrow Saturday news does sometimes happen on the weekend a judge Brett Kavanaugh could become a Supreme Court\nJustice yeah and we all have to make our decisions and live with ourselves at the end of the day and we need to live a life with integrity so if Heidi Heitkamp feels like this is something that she needs to do I applaud her than uh than that's her choice and she gets that vote and she can cast it any way she wants politically this is going to be a really hard thing for her to overcome she's already down in the polls to her Republican challenger\nBy I think ten or twelve points and this is not going to help her out because sixty percent of her stage uh is is supportive of a ... a cabin out confirmation so when you are a lawmaker\nYou have to really find that fine line between what you believe in your heart and what you were hired by the people of North Dakota to do and obviously this is the decision she came she came up\nWith yeah you're not hire you're hired by the people of North Dakota to make personal decisions you're hired by the people of North Dakota to vote in a way that you think is honorable and prudent\nTo speak for that but the voters it's about speaking for the people well ju who button that it provides them as well as just a representative form of government sure\nBut it doesn't mean you look at a poll and you vote the way the majority of people in your state want you to vote that's not why we elect elected representatives\nWell then there's an answer for that and that's just what she's going to have to deal with and it's not right or wrong it just it she's going to have to deal with that fall out\nThe countdown is on [noise]\nWe're about an hour away from the a vote to invoke cloture to end debate which will pave the way for a full Senate vote\nFor judge Brett Kavanaugh which would happen tomorrow all one hundred senators will vote this morning as of dawn today friday in Washington DC CNN reported that Republicans don't have the votes they don't have fifty one votes to invoke cloture that would kill the cabin on confirmation\nAre very close to the story watching it

their soap opera this on going just feels like it never every day it's something new while you were asleep judge Brett Kavanaugh did something unprecedented\nAnd we learned about it he authored an op ed piece for the wall Street Journal that is in the paper this morning friday unavailable on line of course in the piece the Supreme Court nominee who faces a critical vote a do or die vote\nIn about two any or thirty minutes from now in the U.S Senate chamber the argues but he's an independent impartial judge\nAndy concedes cabin or does that he quote might have been too emotional closed wrote in his testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary committee last week quote\nI was very emotional last Thursday more so than I have\nEver been I might have been too emotional at times I Know that might tone was sharp I liked fear and I said a few things I should not have said\nI still like beer you know he doesn't set by the way he doesn't say what what he said that he shouldn't have said and he adds I Hope everyone can understand that I was there as a son has been and dad\nI testified with five people for most in my mind my mom my dad my wife\nAnd most all of my daughters may I take this moment\nTo politely submit to judge Kavanaugh for his consideration\nThat when you were before the U.S Senate in a confirmation hearing to be a Supreme Court justice that you should not come to that meeting as a son a husband and a dad you should come to that testimony as a jurist as someone who displays the demeanor tone intellect\nAnd emotions of a Supreme Court justice well what he said he failed to do that any acknowledges it in his own Wall Street journal reports\nYou say the same thing you and I just had a conversation about half an hour ago that Heidi Heitkamp and you said because the senator from North Dakota has said that she's going to vote no I'm Brett Kavanaugh I submitted you that I think politically that the bad decision because if people have North Dakota\nHired Heidi Heitkamp to vote and speak for them you said that she has to answer to herself and that is true maybe that's what she thinks she has to do\nBut it isn't it Heidi Heitkamp got under what you just said to show up and represent the people of North Dakota just like you're advising Brett Kavanaugh to leave behind the fact that he's just a man a husband and a father and show up as the Supreme Court justice aren't the same\nThing they're not the same thing it's Heidi Heitkamp job to act like a U.S senator and when she announces the reasons that she's voting no on Kavanaugh here she's acting like a U.S senator\nA lifetime appointment\nIsn't a political decision if this were a political decision for me I certainly wouldn't be deciding this the other way um but ah you know there's an old saying history will judge you but most importantly you inject yourself\nAnd that's really what I'm saying I Can't get up in the morning and look at the life experience that I've had and say yes to judge cabinets\nThat strikes me as the demeanor and tone appropriate called for for a U.S senator\nThat she's failing and this is why she's going to lose because the only way we live in a representative form of government we elect people to speak for us Jennifer ... North Dakota are asking her to speak for them she's not you you are and you're now she'll probably\nLose her race in the Senate so yes she can go and vote her heart but you can expect to be reelected and be the voice of the people if you're not going to do their wishes fifth or you're not going to put your perpetrate their wishes if\nYou believe what you say is I absolutely do okay then you should fully support the throngs of Democrats in Sacramento voting the way the people who elected them want to vote so you\nCan also on presenting me that's why I said those people are not they're representing we need more conservatives in California so that our boys can grow\nThey do represent you they represent everyone in their district they they should representing their voter she rather not mushy but no you fundamentally misunderstand republic a Democratic Republic\nShe she represents the people of North Dakota and all of them Democrats or Republicans liberals conservatives independents brings the whole law have and as the president of the United states should represent all Americans judge Kavanaugh uh don't take my word for it\nToo high high camp should be voting the will of the people of her home state okay\nSo if the okay it's the will I saw a poll yesterday\nIt's the will of uh a slim majority but a majority nonetheless of California voters to keep the gasoline tax write\nSo then you should not criticized any elect is just to expand your logic which I think is\nA maybe not fought through or maybe it's coming from a place it that it's about the representative form of government okay so so then the the elected officials who you rally against on this program who stood on a town hall stage\nAnd rallied against those representatives who voted for a gas tax and pledged to keep the gas tax like mayor Garcetti is coming out for the gasoline tax\nShouldn't you withhold criticism if your logic is true because they're simply make no sense Jennifer your point was made very clearly and the audience ... you said when people are elected they are elected to represent the wishes of their voters\nThat's right and that's why Eric Garcetti what I'm saying I'm going to finishing his liberal philosophy because liberals and California voted for him right\nThen you should have no problem with\nNo because I wasn't voted I I didn't run for election for anything I Am a vote on the contrary and in the state of California it's totally within my rights we live in a free country it's within my right about you're saying rally people so that we can vote Erica our study out of off\nYou're saying that an elected official has an obligation to vote the way that the majority in his or her district\nWill vote when did you say that is true no that's fundamentally untrue how I just don't see how so because no one takes an oath no senator know congressman no precedent\nTakes an oath to vote the way or support the agenda of the majority if you get in the business of supporting the majority exclusively\nHistory will show you very quickly that you can run into some real serious problem why because you wind up ignoring the minority not the ... and while you embrace the majority\nIn absolutely do what you want with it for the for the good of your people I understand but the plight of an elected official and I'm Talking right now specifically about Heidi Heitkamp the problem that Heidi Heitkamp pass and this is not me making this up this is not my opinion the problem that she had\nIs that she is from a state where sixty plus percent of the people want to see judge Brett Kavanaugh confirmed and she had seen in the last two to three weeks her poll numbers dropped ten\nPoints and she has now trailing behind her Republican opponent\nA tribe because the people at first state want her to vote for cabinet now I understand she can't look at yourself in the mirror because she thinks the judge Brett Kavanaugh was that bad it's called a you have to live with yourself it's called integrity and expect to win an election oh okay you're going to be ... you hear her emotional because she knows she's going to lose for this decision that she's making\nStarted last segment talking about judge Brett Kavanaugh and his op ed in the wall Street Journal that appears today we'll conclude our segment\nA with that op ed and an analysis of it and and the last word will not go to Jennifer and it won't go to me it'll go to former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens a lifelong Republican the performance of judge Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're the coverage live right here on your morning answer it's seven thirty\nThis is your address the morning\nSome type of thing than I Am not where we had parents cannot for that and they find hitting ... and they did manage to get some rain but they drive into the coverage that claim I stopped right now ...

she the Republican senator of Maine who has been critical of Kavanaugh at times\nKeep in mind this is a preliminary vote that advances capital to a full and final vote tomorrow which will happen on\nSaturday it is worth noting at this juncture that there had been plenty of times when senators will vote in preliminary votes such as the book we just heard\nDifferently than the way they vote in full final votes on the Senate floor that being said at three o'clock this afternoon twelve noon hour time\nRepublican Senator Susan Collins who just voted yes to advance Kavanaugh will give her

forty nine the motion is agreed to\nOh All right it is the nomination of judge Brett Kavanaugh it is a soap opera we've been friends or do I\nShow goes through a final vote Tomorrow Jennifer one\nOf the uh the storylines it's coming out of this that we listen to the whole votes and Robert I covered it very well I'm waiting for the management to focus on waiting for the phone call and say hey Whitman fine job that you know you know kind of common during that but I you know one of the moment we are listening to your hands right I've heard many\nI have to because she does your ... on or even care well respected member of this team [laughter] you were saying about the em you sound very well last hour the EMS and em the evidence\nAnd then the ones to watch tomorrow but apparently so I don't know if you remember that when we were listening to the vote and we heard Lisa Murkowski did she abstain because you couldn't hear her vote\nSome people speak more lightly of for benefit of the audience identify who the M. and m's are\nOkay the the M. and m's or Lisa Murkowski she's from Alaska and Joe Manchin who is from West Virginia one Republican that's Murkowski the Democrat is Joe mansion when Murkowski voted\nIt sounded like there was no vote and I thought wait a second issue just as she choosing to abstain is the drama going to continue could even do that and I'm listening in and then on the list we heard she went to know when they read back devote less well according to reporters in the room Murkowski stood up when her name was called\nEverybody was looking at it because no one had any indication as to what she was going to do and then she spoke so softly that all the reporters had to scramble to ask each other if she had said no or if they had even if they can even make out what she said and then she sat down very quickly I said no [laughter]\n[noise] which tells me the pressure is still very much on Murkowski because Republicans for the next twenty four hours are going to be trying to switch or to get her to bolster the vote and vote for the confirmation\nOf Kavanaugh so we'll see if it works the special interest groups in play in Alaska that are really pushing her to vote no and well you know what she all sorts of conscience issue with that making it too I mean whatever it is we haven't heard from her so we don't\nKnow I I haven't heard you mention special interest groups and because I'm\nNot good authority from one of my friends that live in Alaska that she's out on the pay are okay but but and some out casualty ... that should be paid for health and look I have teams everywhere in every state what mentioned that I can bring you accurate information whether it's quite an allegation Jamaica seems ever said no way I mean let's go no that Lisa Murkowski was given money to vote a certain way of it uh\nI play the actual interest groups that play at the ...\nThat direct uh handing over money is called bribery and that's quite an allegation we have not that we wouldn't be where we have no proof\nOf course that that happened but it's interesting that a special interest group shore pressure from Donald Trump or never offered up his reasons for people voting yes ah in boats like this it's always the nefarious motives that are that are are conjured up or\nA magic news on that mention it get pressured by his home state and by Republicans in his state to vote yes he's a Democrat he probably want to vote no\nWell then he then then he should vote no or Susan Collins by the way is a Republican from Maine one of the I think there's only two female Republicans in the U.S has\nNot true you've got Joni Ernst you have you have like I think there are six or seven\nOh okay well ... thank you for correcting me I'm focusing on Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins certainly in this drama or they're the two that are getting the most attention I guess is what I'm paying more attention\nAnd your typical you consider the moderates in the in the Republican Party\nSusan Collins voted yes today she voted yes to advance\nJudge Kavanaugh to a full Senate vote that'll happen tomorrow Susan Collins could change that though now that boat tomorrow needs to be fifty one votes or a tie in the U.S Senate would be would be broken by the vice president\nMike Pence she of course would vote to confirm judge Kavanaugh so Democrats have to do better than fifty fifty they have to take this number that we have this morning fifty one forty nine and flip it they got to get two people to flip\nSusan Collins could be flipper like Paul Manafort and uh and and like Michael Cohen the you know they called him flipper for a reason these people could change their mind Susan Collins will at noon today Southern California time three o'clock in Washington is holding a press conference\nTo announce her final decision points being made\nThat these votes here this morning in the vote and cloture are not necessarily the final votes or don't necessarily reflect the ah the final vote that will be cast by these individual senators and the\nFinal vote the real deal the ... event that'll happen tomorrow I Would\nBe I Would be pretty shocked at this point if if Collins and flake switched I mean obviously anything's possible any one of these people could have changed a change of heart massage it wasn't\nJust the judging by what we've heard from Collins inflate so far the indication is that they will probably vote yes now I think Collins has waited to tell people what she thinks because she's under enormous pressure as well from both sides of the aisle and so she's going to want to explain her decision and have a moment to do that\nHer thought process is which is why I think she's going to announce it as part of the press conference which will happen at noon time our time today\nAll right uh again it would not be I mean how many times have you heard in campaigns senators say things like well yes I voted on such
