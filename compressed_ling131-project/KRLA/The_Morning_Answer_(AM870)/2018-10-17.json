the spine because your team won there's excitement and uh it's great you know this is this today's game uh it's all in line right here\nFor the Dodgers once again the brewers and Dodgers we'll play the final game of the series for the national league championship at Dodger Stadium a today at two o five first pitch Clayton encourage Shaw on them out\n[noise]\n\nAre you a big Dodgers fan I told

you guys defined job which of course I knew what happen anyway and or the day before on Monday I talked about\nThis guy over the weekend I ran into speaking of the Dodgers and speaking of Los Angeles in sports in our relationship with professional sports as Angelenos I ran into a guy\nA I was in a busy markets in Glendale ride your neighborhood market which I Love to go to their fresh produce and they're\nNice people and I have learned Armenian it better than Rosetta Stone you shop there four days a week and you you know Armenian it's incredible it least you know how to say you're popular food groups in another language and also um if you're a dollar short get out right you learn that in Armenia how to count but uh yeah\nSo the guy walks in typical typical looking Angelino and he's wearing and LA Dodgers ball cap\nAnd at that point the series I think we started one to one but I was aware of the series and\nThings were ... you know I Know it's always a guy standing next to me on the line so I said damn I thought well let me try this because I'm always thinking his answer will probably make for something interesting on the radio or maybe not and I look at his I said hey you said Hi I looked at his cabinet shut down here a big Dodger fan huh\nYeah I should look at them you know natural you want to start a conversation you've been like in the in the playoffs the you know I'm On the way the world series or a you know we we hope\nAnd he says well no I'm not really a Dodger fan I just like the hat and I said I laughed and I said I said oh you're just like the cat the ball cap I said the I go back to where you bought that had a ... at the shore to capture or there's probably five hundred of those a\nDodger blue colored caps you can wear or maybe you like LA so much and you don't care about the teams who just want to put LA on your cat that's fine too\nIt's interesting because I think there's a to a large degree sports has become a fashion statement here you are in a in a car you\nIn fact a guy wearing an LA Dodgers cap and this is true actually from New York Yankees cats because you see a lot of people wearing them because it's almost a ... it's not because you like the Yankees because of ... used to see Derek Jeter jerseys in Duluth\nYeah you know what I mean but your point is yeah that that that that as a sports has become fashion has morphed into fashion okay I'll go with you on that and politics\nHas become sport sports we got to ... get the red team you got the blue team which Jersey do you strap on what we're ... how do you play in the stands or do you play on the field the only thing missing is the uniforms\nWhich is red and blue but they don't wear red and blue they should we should maybe ... next years Congress we should talk about that off the air Brian you and I fashion\nLevels so let let's see if we can ... let's see if we do the live on the see if we can think of a third one and you get the first word and I'll Try to do All right so we started with a a sports has become passion yup and I said well politics has become sport\nAbsolutely and it looks like based on what's happening on late night TV I Would say entertainment is really calm pilot a very good there you go there we go there we go we nailed that one hit I think I can close the loop on this Bryan we can get back to fashion because you want to mention has become entertainment\nAh yeah ... well remember which the lake Joan Rivers used to do on on E I mean that was certainly entertainment that was the fashion place right yup\nOh ... ... ... she was fantastic on that show I Love Joan Rivers I miss her she is somebody that is a myth yeah especially in this age of you know just uh I really wish that she was around for the Trump presidency because I Would love to know\nA having she'd have fantastic millennia material like that jacket that belong to a war that was discussed on friday night last before the weekend I you know I'm stuck on this little circle that we just ... you want to do more\nI think it's a theme for the show today ... from the top of a sports has become fashion right politics has become sports\nEntertainment has become politics and fashion has become entertainment ...\nBut I think there's there's something here Brian I think you've already here first live on the radio in the morning answer we've answered the new circle of life

Reed\nThat report and everybody leave me alone or I'll hang a curtain here so now what kind of like a great Jonathan brand Meyer so nobody can leave me while I'm broadcasting or you see it says that and when I did I did I saw I saw the ... the ... show good conversation that let up I research leading this I research I and I love\nTo be asked radio I used to work they are they important and very well for three years I I just read based on the research I did from CBS Sports so I thought would know something that\nShe can't fought me for that to my ... is it fake news coming from CBS fake news ... had fake news [laughter] All right as we continue to answer we will talk about the latest a controversy Mike Pompeo\nNo it was actually walking into the Turkish constantly\nConstantly constantly the airport to get a ton numbers I kind of one of the same ... why last for a moment because the story is so sad we all know we don't know where the guy is I Know are there have been rumors that he has been killed nobody has been found a the name of the journalist is a\n...\nRight and a a a Donald Trump is getting criticized for offering rhetoric that\nIn some quarters is seen as\nDefensive of the Saudi leadership\nThis the reason this story you know you don't there are a lot of people in these countries you know whether they're communist socialist or in this case you have a hobby government a and a Turkish government there is a law that\nYou know the reason the story is beginning to take on this huge life it's not just a random journalist that was killed\nThere is contacts to the story that is being revealing ... be being reveal moment by moment you're going to want to pay attention to the store because what you're going to learn a lot about Saudi Arabia and the process yeah we're going to learn a lot about the political dynamics of the region\nSaudi Arabia versus Iran you're going to let a lot about the life of this guy ... because the not as simple as just an American journalist he has a history there is also being revealed has this story builds you'll send my here's the leading here's the leading indicator\nYou don't send the secretary of state to Saudi Arabia and turkey because a random journalist was killed\nWell we did and here's a secretary of state Mike Pompeo discussing a his trip to Saudi Arabia to talk about uh what happened to the Washington Post journalist that disappeared inside the consulate brought our way through for\nThey offer the kind of a sudden quickly\nSites are lined with the kids that they understood\nThat's America's secretary of state Mike Pompeo discussing his a trip to Saudi Arabia and the conversations he had with Saudi officials about the missing American\nJournalists Jamal ... uh who worked for or still work so I think he's living up for the Washington Post to heat a secretary Pompeo is meeting right now actually with Turkish government officials [noise]\nThat's a fact and one of the things that the ... that is adding to is sort of the intrigue is ... history of being a dissident in Saudi Arabia now there is a there is a reformation if you will this happening within Saudi Arabia is being led by the crown prince Mohammed bin Osama\nAnd the the current ... knew this reformation that's happening\nIs involving American business the entertainment industry they want to build a whole city over in Saudi Arabia because of the concern about the linkage of their economy to the petrol do or say they want to move away from that they want to create industry they want to build another Silicon Valley over\nThere yeah and this uh I don't believe and I think you'd agree is not as new as it might sound to people hearing it on the radio or there were a lot of\nAmerican hedge turned\nBack in the early to thousands when we first started to see pictures of our president then George W. Bush holding hands with the Saudi prince or a and it was an M ... and we started to learn of relationships between our government and the Saudi royal family which has quite a bill enmeshed\nA history to say the very least\nYeah so this guy this guy to show you being a journalist has been ah poking holes if you will at the reforms of NBS Mohammed bin Salman he's the new crown prince that has taken

disparity between I think I have an explanation well let's hear your answer that's why they call it the morning at ... or\n... thousand in sixteen there were a lot of races also in California but where did California grassroots focus their political energy their letters their phone calls into those four states that ended up being the pathway for Donald Trump to win\nAnd they got an assist from Hillary Clinton who was who was a arrogant enough to ignore some of those states\nSoil exactly and the reason they were focused there was because they knew we were first of all they knew that their efforts in California we're going to be a ... for not\nSo again in two thousand Eighteen we're finding a very similar landscape does it make sense for if you're if you're going to give somebody you're hard earned money if you're going to give some money to someone do you want to give it to someone where\nAre you giving it to them because it's the it's it's the good thing to do the right thing to do or do you want to give it where it's going to be effective\nAnd a lot of races in California unfortunately for Republicans I'm up to say that that money is going to go to good use so the money goes outside of California in those races that are competitive where the money will do some good\nSo are you saying this could be on my hearing your analysis so eloquently stated it sounds to me Don ... infer Jennifer Horn that you're saying\nThis story of Republicans in congressional California congressional races only raising four million dollars the truth could be even worse because the four million the poultry four million compared to the Twenty one million the Democrats have raised in the same race is\nThat for a million as low AS number as it is is now going to be portions of it fractions of that ... million is going to be shipped to other states\nOr the way around the reason that slow is because money is going to other states so in other words they might we might have taught let's just say for the sake of example the the fundraising is equal\nDot com [noise] now through October thirty percent of all ... windows and doors zero down in zero percent interest for forty eight

to Fifteen as John points out a nobody has been found\nUh we we fear it's a family fears the worst as any family would fear the worst hope and pray for the very best outcome what happens\nPretty not possible now that we have some updated reports coming across the news wire a pro government Turkish newspaper\nStand by the French okay on the disappearance of the Washington Post journalist in these Saudi consulate just breaking news who's providing the Sundance\nIs coming out of and Kara turkey a Turkish newspaper has now claimed that they have damning evidence against the Saudi Arabia against Saudi Arabia in the ... case the reporting\nThat the uh uh they publish a gruesome recounting of the alleged slaying\nOf east Saudi writer ... right at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul just as America's top diplomat Mike Pompeo is you mentioned is in country for talks over ... ... or the Washington Post columnist disappearance the report by guinea\n... and I was trying to do that phonetically ...\nAdds to the ever increasing pressure on Saudi Arabia to explain what happened to his Yogi who vanished October second while visiting the consulate to pick up paperwork he needed to get married his his fiance waiting in the car is there some intrigued about that to some of the people that were in her company\nThis may have been set up that she participated in\nThere's a lot of wild stuff flying around about the yeah\nThere are some uh detached pieces of this story moving around we don't have confirmation still a point of fact we don't have confirmation or from government officials that Mr to show gave the reporter the American journalist for from for working for the Washington Post was killed\nBut we have reports from fairly credible news sources that not only was he murdered but he was a chopped up\nThere's a there's now an indication that there may have even been in there may be an audio recording of the deaths and submitted audio recording a indicating that a a ... it's really quite gruesome and so that's just that's developing\nBut I'm not you may know that secretary of state Mike Pompeo as we mentioned a few moments ago has had a busy week he went to

question but are you up so much information I'm going to jeopardize my partner on the air a fill in the blank for morning answer listeners you might be headed to work so now that will hold on here is the question is\nYou talk to the Turkish government about what happened in the Saudi consulate correct why\nThe reason why is it is is still being divided out but there is\nHas there been no reason author and the reason offered by palm pale as to why he's meeting with the Turks about something that happened in the Saudi conflict\nWell because the church of the ones that are responsible now for investigating it they have to get permission they've gotten it from the Saudi Government I'll go in and look inside the Saudi the the Saudi conflict\nThis report in the ... newspaper cited what it described as an audio recording of ... slaying what you said\nShowed ... being reported by CBS what you said showed the writer was tortured a GPS news has not been able to verify the are reporting yet

than\nIt used to speak softly carry a big thick and that's what the standard when there were some level of the pie that in our society and that the sitting president who represents a stuff like that on a regular basis at the ... no one\nRight and you were critical data ... and your your um your your discouraged that ... or am I miss characterizing European\nI I Believe that our country is changing and it's here are represented that fits in with that person who is the president was to be a role model for like ...\nNot a purveyor of coarse language yeah Michael I agree with that called on he says he articulate a an opinion that I agree with that I suspect you might\nDisagree with who do I do think he can be ... you know is one of the things that I have a trouble with is some\nOf this wildfire though which is I mean it's all a fire I mean he's been elected he's our president I understand that but isn't that up to the people\nOf course when they vote for him and it'll be up for the most ... most specifically on election day in twenty twenty uh but I ask you if it's presidential when Bill Clinton\nWas in office and had been duly elected two times\nUh he asked president in my opinion with Monica Lewinsky for example a committed behavior that was not presidential um and and and I said that it's as someone who voted for Clinton I set his behavior was not presidential\nUh why

was the main ones along with local ones now you have a proliferation of cable channels they carry\nA material that I don't I won't even watch a short but er but none of this as an excuse or is it an excuse for the president I Would never say it's an excuse I Would say it's an overall lowering of the bar of our culture and society\nHe's responsible for all ...\nOf that the sequel products of it is a little part of the ride is the president perpetuating this unfortunate situation that you described I Am you know ... you want me to to criticize him for something that is not his fault that he is a product of it is maybe leveraging\nFor his use in a\n... taking it out on his enemies I mean you know going after people I I Would rather it not happen but it does but I work force now to take it in order to get what the what we what we Republicans want which is a wrecking ball inside the Washington bureaucracy\nI see so it's a it's collateral damage to Republicans reputation to get tax cuts and things like that\nI don't know that it's a cook I Know I ... I don't I don't assume the mantle of what he does it's not that doesn't represent me as a person I just I Am\nThat's well said OK Don ... in for Jennifer Horn here morning answer for a Wednesday tell you all about a big event and broadcast live rally tomorrow to repeal California's gas tax will tell you where you should meet us\nWe'll be broadcasting live right here in ... going to be in Burbank okay it's eight thirty\n[noise] is your answer to morning\nIn Irvine how to crack and Lincoln the fighting for Jaffrey there quickly that it that way now but the dive into jammed up from Port trade and you're going to the ... the top of the pie that\nWas another back there in line and they got it out of the main part of the Senate if I ... and you're looking at it stopped guy if I can tell I can look all sound in Irvine and that was kind of like having a ... taking away the right lane and everything and go from your plan\nIf you need to have this will probably the path and was offended venturing lanes on ... and they got that on his way to get them to act like I myself am not from Devin ... and that's what I found actually have played some of it than that and if you continue wanting to try and find out that are teaching them how back there that we can lanes and think cleared\nWay now but the ... from the one of five and a passion grind on my grand avenue some block and hustling are loaded up on Sundays our I'm Jamie ...
