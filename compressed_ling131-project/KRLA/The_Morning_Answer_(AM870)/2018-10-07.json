of the country over the years raised with my grandparents for quite a bit of while they were babysitting we just watching all this on TV ... when President Kennedy was there and\nDr King and Robert if can then the whole situation where is it that we're getting off and putting so much time and energy into the division what happened to we the people\nWhat happened to in God we trust what happened to the United states if we can put some of the energy that we're using it to this division and divide that I think it would be much much better country slowed down I\nI agree with everything you said let me let me give you my analysis as to why am I my pin we're having these kinds of divisions\nAt one time one side of the other side was wrong the other side of the other side was wrong but not the range not immoral not degenerate and I feel that many people on the left field that people in the right are fundamentally corrupt fundamentally immoral out to get them\nAnd our side doesn't feel that way about those guys I don't feel that way about Democrats I think they're wrong and that's the problem if you can't look at me we have a reasonable disagreement without you assuming that I tried to hurt you\nThere's no there's no were forced to go and that's how the left field right now this is this is like combat for them as long as religion for them and this is amazing to me\nIf you don't believe that uh that uh uh Christine Blasey Ford's allegations have enough enough or ... cooperation your anti woman you don't believe any woman when she makes it a claim that she's been a victim of sexual assault\nHow you get from doing that to that what what is that all about and did you hear Susan Collins how careful in patients he was how\nReasonable she was did it change anybody's mind on the left it did not\nIt didn't and this is where we are\nI'm not just wrong moral I'm fundamentally a bad person if not evil probably get like that in my bank dont limit goes on television or a

professional grounds before the sordid accusations were leveled he could go back to his life Robert Bork did but if the Senate fails to confirm him now his life will never be the same\nBut this is no longer about who would make the best Supreme Court justice is about the most fundamental issue affair issues of fairness this country has faced since the McCarthy Era\nThe American civil liberties union stood strong against McCarthyism by demanding due process and hard evidence but the ACLU now argues that quote unresolved questions regarding credible allegations of sexual assault unquote be resolved against the accused nominee\nPut we mail living in the age that risks a new form of sexual McCarthyism\nWe must not go to that even darker place darker than McCarthyism liberal Democrat Harvard law professor\nDarker than the coffee is\nEven know if you read the report of racial Mitchell for women who seems to have asked you know very on challenging questions\nThe wall Street Journal published her entire analysis I can only provide bunny assessment of Dr Ford delegations in a legal context\nIn the legal context here as my bottom line a she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove that this case is even weaker so that\nThis is from Rachel Mitchell a prosecutor of sex crimes duck the Fort identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or fail to corroborate though\nI Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee newer nor do I believe that there's evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of the evidence then do you understand the difference folks\nThere there is the standard beyond reasonable doubt but outside of the legal world all you need is the ... I think in the ... or ... if I'm not mistaken in civil suits\nThe preponderance of evidence standard that's different from beyond reasonable doubt just ... but it doesn't even meet the preponderance of evidence\nThat the Republicans seem to show absolutely fairness of the accuser and giving deference to the wavering members in his own caucus delayed the confirmation one vote\nOne week the FBI made additional ...\nGuys with the second ranking Republican in the United States Senate and also a member of the Judiciary Committee John Cornyn also formerly a Texas Supreme Court justice\nNow if in fact we get word that the FBI is done and that should all centers will have the report it's okay to file the notion of cloture because that's just thirty hours of debate people will have plenty of time to read the report\nThat's right down to the Senate also there will be at least a an intervening day or the other words you filed today tomorrow intervening day and then the vote cultural

boyfriend has filed an affidavit saying she is familiar with polygraph inconsistent with their testimony testimony and this is a lawyer deal\nCould not contain a single verifiable assertion nor one that could be disproven that are very rare and then we have the Rachel Mitchell Report are there problems whether testimony\nWell there are some allies of well a ritual Mitchell a\nBut was retained by the committee to question Dr Ford um that I thought that a very professional job but I thought she got the basic facts out demonstrated that there are gaps I understand the victims of of trauma can have memory lapses and it's hard to reconstruct things after thirty five years but\nI just don't think and I think the American people don't believe that uncorroborated allegations should be enough to condemn or a nominee\nShow ... let's go to the last issue which is Jerry now learn the incoming chairman of the house Judiciary Committee if the Democrats take the house\nSays he will hold each month

devil's triangle people who say that don't understand what perjury is are lying is your assessment a center\nWell I think it's this has gotten a a ridiculous and I'm sure we're talking about in prison

badly injured and I'm just picking twenty thirty forty years from now people will throw this at them and judge Kavanaugh knows that and that's why he's angry what do you think Senator Cornyn\nI don't blame him for being angry and this is ridiculous allegation that the judge will somehow be a partisan or heard not display the appropriate temperament on the bench\nThis man has been slandered he's been accused of multiple crimes that and he felt it was important to defend his good name and I I thought I thought he handled it appropriately\nThere were a couple of times where I think well one time in particular where he asked a judge or sugar corporate charter question he came back and apologize for that and I think that was the right thing to do\nBut he shouldn't be expected just to take a\nBusiness slander these allegations of criminal conduct and are ruining his reputation and good name and damaging as family anybody in that position who feels like they've been falsely accused I think would be angry and be justified and I'm a showing some of that anger\nThere last question senator I I Know that some people might be obliged in good shape because of the FBI report not to vote for\nUm judge cabinet I I think it will be a huge mistake unless there is direct corroborating evidence but I also believe a Republican doesn't support him his or her career done as a Republican I've

listening to us right now and they they're thinking this is a cool idea I mean how will they know if anybody else is bringing a Bible to school and and what they might be able to do\nHowever the politicians are in charge of giving it a title and describing it and they described it adds ready for that repeals revenues dedicated for repairs and misleading and unfair it repeals the gas tax and the car tax and\nUh that's all it does but these guys are trying to claim that these monies are earmarked for roads when in fact that it's not true that if they lie is put into a fund politicians can spend any way they want and not even a single penny has to go to the reds\nAnd so you're urging people to vote yes on proposition six correct\nYes on proposition ... the gas tax appeal and we need your help because we are being outspent in this election and so we need every single voter who wants to repeal the gas tax that held their friend vote yes on prop fix it in the gas tax repeal\nBand we've got a a website where people can get information including fine\nKurdish a door hangers a caller for voters in your area that website is gas tax repeal dot org that gas hack\nCarol dot org it's very ethical but\nYeah I can tell you this Larry if we don't get people in the grass roots to be involved in this campaign or going to be stopped paying more in taxes the politicians are going to win the mob of Sacramento special interest they're going to win and so if you ever want to win one for a tax payer\nWe need your help because the polling shows as soon as people know that this is the gas tax repeal\nProposition ... is the gas tax repeal\nThey'll want to vote yes on proposition ...\nWhat is the deal with all these endorsements some you know had chambers and died transportation groups and things like why are these sucking up at the Trump to shouldn't they be defending the little guy\nYou know I never have visitors part of the problem in Sacramento politic\nGroups that have nice sounding names like the chamber of commerce or or um or the or the jobs coalition or the association of veterans and these groups\nAre actually lobbying groups that curry favor and sell access to politicians and so they're always going to line up with the politicians we are a grassroots\nMovement we got over a nine hundred and eighty thousand signatures\nTo put ... on the ballot half of those came from Democrats and independents the other half of the public and we're proud of the fact that uh our donor base to get the money that we have which is you know not a lot but it it always gets or our message out came from ... twenty five thousand donors state wide\nAverage contribution thirty seven dollars he can't get more grassroots than that\nAnd so this is really David versus Goliath\nYeah this is you know the average Joe who has to get on the four oh five were down where you are in San Diego the eight to one of these freeways and are in tough it out and has to pay the the pump every time they go to the gas station and if they drive a car that uses premium they're stuck in for ten for fourteen a gallon of this stuff\nHurts but but the use of particularly well that it actually hurts\nThe little guy even more those who can least afford fuel and have to drive fondly because of housing prices it may be coming from riverside or San Bernardino and work in orange county uh they're paying more\nSlowly and we just released a report last week but it's called the Grinch stole Christmas out of the car taxing gas tax hikes\nHer working families and what are the the California Policy Center report what they did is they looked at the average a cough and then they looked at what lower income families will likely have to pay the reason why there's a difference between the average him and lower income families\nThat low income families tend to be what we call ... commuters they can't afford to live\nNear the John centers so their commutes are much longer\nSo they're buying more gas and the study shows that for the average family the gas tax on car tax increase just increase\nIt's six hundred and fifty dollars more a year or two car to drive or family for a a low income family it can be up to eight hundred dollars more per year and you know the gas tax the carts act is regressive tax in that it\nTakes up a higher percentage of your disposable income\nOr the less you make it you know it's a fixed amount they don't get it really is it it hurts working families and for these politicians to say that they're ... you know they're they're fighting for the ... the little guy that certainly up for Lonnie and I want to use a stronger\nPull I had hoped if they were really doing is a you know where's the double decker triple decker lanes that would be nice if they put in I mean I could get it if we can get our so some huge\nFast lane you know a commuter things that we could go all the way from LA to Orange County and pick that speed up but they're not building any new lanes with this money and in fact\nThey're putting sanctions on a road die they're they're actually pulling lanes and they want to put you know parks and recreation and bike lanes and other things in their place\nRight more the more people worried about the gas tax increase the the more shocked they are a people don't know not only is it not earmarked for roads but it also prohibits the use of gas tax to expand road capacity that was something that the radical environmentalist and Sacramento demanded because they don't like the car\nUm and so we are also a proud of the fact that this week we released an alternative plan to fix\nIt actually provide two billion dollars more annually for road repairs and improvements but even the most optimistic projections under the current gas tax\nUh and it really does catch us up on all of our deferred maintenance and that is we would dedicate a hundred percent of the gas tax to roads and a hundred percent of the sales tax existing sales tax on cars would go to infrastructure and transportation which could also be more roads and so that initiative\nI filed this week in Sacramento and it is the third and final phase of his campaign or to really shakeup Sacramento not only to recall state senator Josh game in which we were victorious and ah but now we're doing the repeal measure prop sects yes on sex\nFive but then we want you to replace measure and that is the transportation accountability I should have filed earlier this week\nWell that really use the dirty little secret here and I guess it's not so much of a secret to politicians have been reading\nThe monies for years and spending and other other things and even ... bravo I was up to the rally the day before they improve this thing in Sacramento and I have a recording of brown doing yeah we took the money that we had other things the economy was bad we had to keep serve you know social services\nThey admit they raided the funds that's the dirty little secrets the other problem is currently is when you look at the ... and I just got mine in the mail for the election they love to throw all the arguments in there to see what will stick\nYou know a proposition six does not guarantee the price of gas will go down and all kinds of trying to dig up some argument here that the gas companies are going to fill up the difference in price Hi do you buy\nIt but no I don't you know there's one guarantee is that if a prop six loses you're going to pay higher more higher at the pump\nUm you're going to pay between six hundred and fifty dollars if the average family of four driving a or up to eight hundred dollars a year and by the way Larry when you take a look at the Mets\nCost of car and fuel taxes just in the state of California taking out all the federal taxes in the state of California we're now up to two thousand dollars of pre tax earnings are needed\nAh for each family\nFor the average family ah just to pay your ... your gasoline state tax and you or a state car tax two thousand dollars in pre tax earnings\nAnd so that's way too much the cost of living is getting a drawn hire a you know pushed higher and higher\nAnd working families can't afford it so yes on prop sex\nShould give working families the breathing room on the cost of living that they show a desire and and it would send a message to politicians that we're not your piggy bank or not your ATM was sick and tired of stealing our money lying to us by and and this is our little rebellion so yes on ...\nAnd we do need the help people cannot\nStay on the sidelines and expect us to ... we are out done so you got to go on line and help out at a gas tax repeal dot org gas tax repeal dot org and you have a choice\nYou know continue to have Sacramento

Larry marina\nJudge Steven Bailey wants to be the next attorney general the state of California is doing this right now to talk about his run for office is good to talk with you again\nHow are you doing\n... been a a few months there between the additional run back in June and now but I guess things heat up right\nThere they're moving along very quickly um right now it's a time of uh\nThe campaign that were out moving or if we can do it twenty four seven we do it\nYou know well let's take a little time to reintroduce you because it has been a few months since the initial campaign you are one and opportunity on the ballot in November or you will face and opponents tell us a little bit about yourself\n[noise] I Would say a judge on the superior court for a period of eight and a half years I'm retired last August\nTwo thousand Seventeen or for the express purpose of running for California attorney general prior to that I was I'm a practicing lawyer in the courts in California for the preceding Eighteen and a half years and then um\nI was appointed by George George ... mentioned in the Nineteen eighties it was a deputy director for the state department of social services\nHa ha so why would someone want to run for a gene California what what drove you\nWell you know as a superior court judge you're watching and and working with individuals on a daily basis you see a top people coming before you on the criminal calendar and over that eight and a half years when we started off when I went on the bench with a pretty robust\nA criminal justice system that was really focused on protecting victims than protecting the citizens of California for from the the criminals\nGet over that period of eight years I'm what I watched was the systematic break down of our criminal justice system\nChanges such as I'm forty seven grapes streets in schools which in fact it didn't make our streets safer and certainly didn't make our schools safer what did do was decriminalized a drug and\nIn particular decriminalized a property crimes meaning\nIt gave 'em\nA ticket to the sticker on steel up to nine hundred and fifty dollars and quite frankly by the time those eight years ended um I'm looking at the state of California and the direction that we're going and realize that someone has to go out and make a difference and\nThere aren't many someone and so I put my name into the um\nThe hopper to run for California attorney general I was fortunate enough to have the voters of California uh put me into the top two in June and we're here\nPartisan politics is actually the guys to forget about serving your district and what's so key and important to me is serving in the district itself and the people of the district want that\nBecause we're facing a massive homelessness problem mental health care issues drug abuse issues it even the concerns about illegal immigration with\nMollie ... that has just been murdered it's a big national conversation about securing our borders treating the people who want to come to America fairly properly it equitably\nWe've been talking on this program a lot about homelessness lately and asking those who come on to talk about it from their perspective um there's a lot of people who talk about the reasons why there are others who wants to talk about what can be done at this point where do you weigh in on those chunks\nSays a multitude of reasons why and since we have a short segment on the radio show is not even worth getting into the reasons why it's categorized and three basic reasons and that is a mental health care issues drug abuse issues and economic hardship [noise]\nBut I Want to talk about a program that I have on my Web site at ... for Congress dot com which is a very detailed plan they create federal intake centers which is a dirty day center where you bring people in your house them you feed them clean them out but you do a complete\nBattery of testing on them\nTo figure out exactly where they're out on the mental issues on drug abuse issues or are they somewhat of a normal individuals who is selling hardship and hard times who need some vocational training and or transitional housing\nAnd there's a lot of really good organizations out there now offering transitional housing and basic services for those who are in need and willing to get health the biggest problem that we face in the valley\nIs the fact that LAPD and the sheriff's department cannot round people up or just bring him in it has to be voluntary if you look back\nAt the lawsuits from the ACLU was Orange County Los Angeles county they were forbidden to enforce the vagaries your loss because they didn't have beds you put in so the the only place they could go in jail while they looked at data said that's not a criminal activity homelessness is a fortunate set of circumstances\nBack in Nineteen eighty six when Ronald Reagan remove the funding for short term and long ... long term mental health care institutions because the abuse and and and you're just the abuse in ... of the patients in the news of\nOf putting people into these centers they pulled the funding so we're seeing the repercussions of that are seen the repercussions of the ACLU lawsuit and as a human tragedy for a community as a whole you see people on the street because our normal compassionate feeling as faith based people is to help out how do we help out\nBut there's everybody is so disjointed because there's so many organizations out there that want to have there's so many faith based churches that want to help [noise] there's so many people that want to help but there's nobody leading the way\nThis is where my plan tape federal money that's already been allocated by the opioid epidemic by homelessness epidemic throughout the country money has been allocated so now it's going to take leadership in a strong advocate is a federal representative\nTo do a promote a program that will create these and intake centers to be able to assess people if they need short term and long term mental health care that said you need to step in along with the state along with the counties and give these people those a short term and long term mental health care\nYou talked earlier about illegal immigration Mali tempered story the suspect in the case in a legal immigrant possibly in the country up to seven years we've gotten a challenge we've immigration in this country don't we\nWe absolutely do and this and its allies in the hands of Congress Congress's sat there kick the ball back and forth for decades now and it's gotten to the point where it's actually a national security issue the securing the border\nAnd Ronald Reagan tried to do it Congress failed to secure the border we gave him his need to to quite a few hundreds of thousands of of illegal immigrants here is legal aliens here and now we're at a point where we're separating families and we're doing this for doing that it it's a major moral uproar\nCongress needs to finally sit down and create new immigration policies but as pertaining to our neighbors in the south Mexico Central America and all of South America we need to stop\nTaking asylum applications at the border we need to have real embassies in every single country down there that people who are seeking asylum in the United states can walk into the embassy be protected at the embassy\nSell out the application have it'd be processes right there in if it is a truly need for asylum they can be flow from their right to America\nBut we have so I think it's over seven hundred thousand asylum applications that are backlog within the judicial system in these people are just wandering around in America this has to be stopping congressman is the only one that can stop it\nWhat about the catch and release of policies that you come to this country you know breaking in our borders we catch you and then you get to have a deep before judge they let you go you don't show up\nFor this I have in a day before the judge what you're given by the ice and by the homeland security is a court date\nAnd they don't show up to the court date but this is what I'm Talking about the majority of these individuals that you're talking about is the asylum seekers they've been coach they've been trained to say what they need to say they fill out the asylum paper they're given their court date and they never show us that has to stop\nSo some people like to say it's All right left issue\nBut what drives people to come here and there must be fleeing something or opportunity in this country and it wouldn't surprise me if some in the business community seem to want cheap labor\nCheap labor is what drives them here is to work for you know minimum wage it is it to work for you know pain at your be abused take about it or a this is the greatest nation in the world economic opportunities here far exceed any nation on the face of the earth\nBut you can't work if you don't have the credentials taught\nAt ... I agree that this is the legalities of it but you had to question what why do they want to come here they ... they would think at the at the drop in the addiction of coming here\nIt's the greatest nation in the face of the earth where you and your God given right to buildings are recognized their fostered they're given the opportunity to grow and to profit off of it they have a great family ... now this is where Congress has finally got to pull his parents up and do its job\nYeah but there are some who police are open borders that we should be you know somebody's struggling in the world doesn't matter come to the Internet that's just insane\nOpen borders I these people that want to open borders I Want to see them open up their front door to every homeless person out there on the street and say come on and\nThey're going to be overrun you can't have open borders on a sovereign nation you have to have controlled immigration\nBut that gets into another element of economic policies with our southern neighbors we need to create economic policies that will sustain an economic infrastructure in their countries where they will will have a a quality of life worth living and they come visit here on visas and everything else\nBut this is where again Congress needs to pull it up and do its job get not doing it right now and this is what I intend on doing\nWe're talking with mark ... running for Congress and the thirtieth congressional district in one of his mailers she says I hear you your issues or my issues strengthen the middle class improve mental health\nHealth care enforce law and order solve homelessness reform drug rehabilitation support our veterans\nAbsolutely you know one of the biggest saying mental health care in in the district and we need to really bring the funds back to our district back to the state of California for mental health care in fact de Leon past I think it was two and a half billion dollars is stuck in court because all the agencies are fighting over the money\nWhen are we going to have programs that are established by somebody leadership wise that is going to give the people that need mental health care mental health care and access to it\nThe psychiatry or or ... or ... or your organization or or field has come out and said that one out of five people in America need therapy has some kind of mental health care issue and or need some of them are minor but some of them are debilitating\nWe see the ones that have a debilitating mental health care issue wandering the streets you know going to the bathroom right there on the sidewalks and a half naked I you know they need help noodles\nThey're the ones that seemed like they are talking on a cell phone having a conversation and nobody's on the phone\nOr like the ones in Ventura County where the guy walked into a restaurant and there was a father a white mother and and the two year old son and the homeless guy walked in and stop the guy in the neck with a screwdriver and kill them where the guy in West Hollywood that you know you got chopped up by ... for buying it was in college\nYou know the mental health care issues in the drug rehabilitation issues of the drug addiction issues are only been fostered and created to be worse by the fact that they're the ones being left on the streets they're not being given how\nAnd you can't you know because of the law you can't force them into help you need to be able to change that and bring him in for helm\nCapital as expected to take his place on the Supreme Court Tuesday so missing a solid five to four conservative majority\nKavanaugh's confirmation is expected to shift the balance of power on the court for a generation and it is certain to influence mid term elections that are now just thirty days away in a moment we'll speak with Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell but first what's bringing Fox News correspondent Kevin cork with the latest\nThe nomination of Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United states is confirmed\nWith the rapper the gamble history\nOf justice Brett Kavanaugh's wrote to the Supreme Court was more than the culmination of years of hard work and months of political machinations\nHates bond resistance on both ends of the political spectrum is is from this mob rule we have a thing as you say the halls of Congress to set the capital in the shadow of the high court itself protests reverberated across Washington [noise]\nIn the end it was successful the man who will replace his mentor on the court and for president sweet victory after a long bitter battle\nI Want to Republican senators for refusing to back down\n\nCommit the finality bruising contrast to victory and defeat a divided America\nAnd the promise of more battles to come\nSo to Americans to so many millions\nWere outraged by what happened here there's one answer boat\nChris Monday at seven pm here at the White House the president will welcome justice Kavanaugh for swearing in event then Tuesday Morning is off to work his first day and associate justice of the U.S Supreme Court Chris\nKevin cork reporting from the White House Kevin thanks for joining me now from Louisville, Kentucky Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nSenator you are called putting conservative justices on the corner conservative judges on all levels of the court the most consequential action\nThat you can take in your role I Want to put up what the record as under President from when he was majority leader to Supreme Court justices have been confirmed and twenty six judges\nHave been put on the circuit courts that's the fastest pace in history questions or is this your proudest moment as a senator\nI think so I think the most important thing the Senate is involved in is the personnel business houses not into personal business editor of the various twelve hundred apartment to come to us for confirmation obviously the most important but a lifetime appointment to the court said we prioritize\nBattling President Trump's outstanding nominated for the Supreme Court as well as\nUh the circuit courts that we've done twenty six so far as you indicated record and there'll be more before they under the\nSun hard right conservatives have criticized you over the year as to establishment but now they are lining up to ... through the cabinet nomination and even the likes of Steve Bannon has praised your what he called strong leadership are you happy to have his approval sir [noise]\nIt's almost without of body experience I must say ha ha ha ha ha but how do you take this criticism that it it you know that the Tea Party the far right up to the Republican Party has had a view over the years as you've been trying to do your business up on Capitol Hill [noise]\nWell it's pretty hard to beat a majority leader the Senate without getting some criticism I'd rather be judged by my record and I think what this has been an extraordinarily accomplished Congress or in fact the the most productive\nTwo year period right of center in the time I've been on a set of whether it's taxes are regulations that we've gotten the economy a booming and we're making long term ... a systemic changes in court so will serve a future generation of Americans at a very good\nWay I Know that there have been some bipartisan accomplishment says well you voted on an eBay they'll and us last week you also did a big bill a to fight the opioid crisis but there there's no question that this Kavanaugh\nConfirmation battle has come at a cause that just the relations between Republican senators in Democratic senators\nSeemed to have I have taken a downturn Here's Democratic senator senator ... a democratic leader Chuck Schumer\nOr on the floor this week talking about and criticizing you for delaying them after what he said was your ten month delay or and blocking the nomination of Merrick Garland from President Obama Harris Schumer\nNo American should accept his management's about delay he's the master of delay compared to ten months [noise]\nLeaving this ... seat open who are we kidding [noise]\nSenator how broken is the ...\nPercent of all broken and we did an attack Merrick Garland shot\nBack around and try to destroy and we didn't go on a search and destroy measure and we simply followed their tradition in America which is that if you have a party of the different\nUh different uh shut out of a different parties and the president and you don't fill a vacancy created in the presidential here that what all the way back to Eighteen eighty eight Schumer himself said Eighteen months before the end of the Bush to turn your back in the uk or they would fill it so what we did was follow tradition\nBut we did an attack of nominated we didn't go and search and destroy veteran I agree that with a truck surely there's been a low part of a sudden\nI have a different view about who calls the low point\nThough set a traditionally Democrats are licking a doctor forge\nA against apparently her desires\nAnd then trying to lower the Saturday and said that the presumption of innocence no longer applies in the United states of America and then the mob oh descended on Capitol Hill and try to intimidate are members\nAnd two opposing this good man a nomination about we stood up to the mob we established that the the presumption of innocence is still important I'm proud of my colleagues is important day for the United States Senate\nI have to pick up on something that you said because it and maybe I have this wrong but when you block Merrick Garland nomination from President Obama you basically said that we don't do this and a presidential election year\nAnd that we wait until the election and then whoever the people choose they get to pick the Supreme Court nominee but but what you just said now was a question of whether or not it's\nThe the uh the the party in control of the Senate\nIs different than the president of the question I guess I I'm getting to here is if Donald Trump or the name of somebody in the final year of his first term in twenty twenty are you saying that you would go ahead without nomination\nBarter center question and what I told you what the what the history of the set up his band you have to go back to Eighteen eighty to find the last time a vacancy created in a presidential election here\nAll the Supreme Court was confirmed by the Senate of a different party than the president sets the hero and if you can answer my question are you saying that well the answer to your question is will see whether there's a vacancy on twenty twenty\nBut you're not ruling out the possibilities here the Republican majority leader and as a Republican president that you would go for and and and the push the nomination of a Trump nominee in the election year\nWhat I'm telling you is the history is you have to go back to Eighteen eighty to find the last time a Senate controlled by a party different from the president\nFill a vacancy on the Supreme Court that was created in the middle of a presidential election here that's been the history\nOf questions or in the Alabama Senate race last year you very quickly sad after a judge Roy Moore was accused of inappropriate conduct an towards teenagers uh many years ago you immediately said that you

the last ten years and you better pack a lunch bucket your chin strap if you're going to come at Mitch McConnell when it comes to Senate battle and I think once again demonstrated his resolve and get his conference and making sure that they got to the end of it what was an incredibly ugly process\nAnd how the\nAccusations by women to what degree do you think 'cause it it seemed to be a a fairly routine tough but fairly routine confirmation until that point and and that must have been tough for everybody\nOn both sides well it's a precedent in a lot of ways right and I think the the thing that was most disturbing to Republican senators is to watch the presumption of innocence completely evaporate before our eyes in the context and the Senate Judiciary committee and\nAll of a sudden allegations however serious they might be without any kind of cooperation will begin beginning to carry the day and I think\nFrom a ... point of view and from Lindsey Graham your previous get what

I Know the Democrats are going to do their best to link\nThe events of this week in the last few weeks to the me too movement to say it's another demonstration of Republicans hostility towards women or I Want to play though a clip from the deciding vote on this issue and that was a woman the Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine here she is\nThe allegation sales to me the more likely than not standard\nThere for I Do not believe that the charges\nAnd fairly current fad\nJudge cabin up front surfing on the court\nFor re what a Republican is supposed to do when the FBI does this background check and failed to come up with a single piece of evidence to corroborate Dr ... what are they supposed to do\nWell I think what you'll hear from Democrats crafts is that it became clear over the past week particularly since the hearing right that everything since that hearing the FBI investigation who they were allowed to actually speak to the fact that they didn't ... interview Brett Kavanaugh for Christine Ford it became clear to many people that this appear to be a box checking exercise it with a fig\nLeaf designed to provide legitimacy had\nTalked to predict that everybody that Christine Blasey Ford had put\nNear that house that night and other people who word of the house that night but might be able to kind of like what I mean and yes they say well she didn't talk to people you talked to in the ... on the beach Twenty years later but in terms of anybody bought a contemporaneous like out there talking\nTo everybody didn't get her therapist notes from ... years ago ... years later that that's my Christmas was there as long as it is and what can you and I are talking about right now they didn't do rights have too many people who already believe the Republican Party has a problem with winning this exercise is a week long investigation to that and\nWe'll look like it was just designed to get legitimate teach with pre ordained outcome and if it's what's been said since then it's Donald Trump making fun of Christine Ford it's Orrin Hatch Palin survivors of sexual assault\nHe will listen to them when they grow up this is a pattern of anger has been building for two years since Donald Trump was elected and he just started a year ago on a friday this is not just about the Supreme Court they said about the broader cultural moment we are living in a lot of people feeling like the Republican Party quite frankly doesn't care about women\nAnd the argument Democrats are going to make I think\nI think this was British politics I agree with you I think the\nFBI pro Bush and I was a whitewash\nAnd I think most people understand that the ... were put in place by the White House's Lewis thoroughly political process I think is Josh I think the damage here is to so many American institutions\nWe're past the point is obviously she is confirmed they do this in a rush of today is that there's more to come and they want to make sure that he's already in place\nBut the key here is the damage we've seen damage to our intelligence institutions under this president ... right I'm going to have a sort of ... the Supreme Court there is damage Chris lasting\nWell right I mean I Know it it will go well I Wish we want to play well with with other ...\nBut this is going to intensify voters on both ends of the spectrum this has turned up the volume I was already a very intense very embittered\nMe I'm going to get to politics and the next segment what do you think of the argument that this was a sham the FBI investigation there wasn't a serious invest\nWhen you know you're in Washington when a one week and Republicans tell you that the FBI is a rotten corrupt institution that should not be listened to the Democrats say that they are the saviors of our republic and then you wait a week and they just switch lanes and the White House has turned around la via via the Democrats say they think so I don't put don't put too much\nI don't put too much stock in that because those are situational opinions of attitudes that are going to ship with an ex controversial\nI I think there's one thing that we need to clear up here because I Democrats are just sort of reprieve facts on how this FBI that fish and came to be and what happened was that afflict decided along with senator could have been in interviews that worked before the Senate Judiciary committee\nIn order to have a more full full some decisions so that when they went to leader McConnell and sat down and talked about what that FBI investigation might look like it wasn't Donald Trump who is dictating the terms of the FBI investigation in fact it where the senators who still had an open mind about the nomination so they're the ones to dictate terms on your story just\nBy chance I Would say can you admit that the fact that the two key people weren't we interview that there were numerous people who gave information and we're never contacted by the FBI that left\nLingering questions and it is a topic when someone who tried to look at this fairly I don't think it's the talk of what I heard from Republicans over the last three years why would Hillary Clinton interview so late in the FBI why wasn't she under oath they didn't even touch\nThe auto bailout ism if they want to do with a simple matter is is on the panel perjury\nWhether it's with the Senate Judiciary committee or whether the FBI and interviews in interviews an interview and we had three plus hours of judge Kavanaugh three plus our state or by senators not by FBI does matter outlook record and that is the same thing that you get in an FBI investigation and so this is weird and point\nThe idea that we don't know what each each person's take was on the situation I'm not all of us can only or any underscores I'm Glad\nWe have some that are making all the what happened in the debate happening out there right now well we're about to bring you back a little bit later to talk about this up next we'll discuss the political fallout from the capital confirmation and our will strikes a vote in the November midterm just days away like a part of Joe ...
