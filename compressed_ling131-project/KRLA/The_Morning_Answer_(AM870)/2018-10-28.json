here's some response I kind of don't you know obviously it's conspiracy theory that I don't buy into but I Know why we feel that way from the caravan to to the bombing to the\nCapitol hearing you name it\nThe other side will do anything at all to try to get rid of President Trump to defeat him right they did it from the beginning they did it before he was even elected he was never supposed to be elected\nThey'd been on this from the beginning he ever after the you know they were shocked that he won but they never let go of trying to defeat him so I understand your cynicism it doesn't sound like that's what happened\nBut I don't blame you for going there because you can't trust anything anymore don't do anything to get this guy right\nThe ... so you have the F. B. the you know lead destruction the rest of them and and pick a ... a quarter page he ... he was talking to the Russians and the Russians include a solution it's over now obstruction of justice I don't know where they're going with that it doesn't matter\nThe photo was found out\nThis photo and that if you enforce property rights the poor and let them protect their property rights from the government and from thugs and from ... drug lords\nLatin America could be prosperous within a generation but in the absence of it\nThey were fleeing to America and we have a huge welfare magnet a lot of these people even if they ... they come in and start working their kids will grow up properly I public assistance large percentage of their family members are going to be on food stamps or right away refugees get a get a whole honey pot full of benefits from the government\nSo why don't you think is going to happen when they reach the American border well\nMy hope is that we will have the U.S military lined up and choking off the entire border and I think President Trump should to ... he's already said this is a national emergency he should start using defense funds\nTo start constructing the law he ought to lay the he ought to lay the cornerstone of the wall gold plated with the big tea on it\nAnd start building the wall that Congress scream and yell what judges scream and yell at the shit for their court orders and continue to use as authorities commander in chief to seal the border and you and take money away from gardening Afghanistan's border if necessary to guard at the\nUnited States sport or that's what we elected in four we didn't like Jeb Bush we didn't like Nikki Haley we elected Donald Trump because we wanted to put America First\nBefore going to be global policemen you know charity begins at home and there's a crucial point I think because people feel a sense of moral mall in ...\nOh these people they just want to improve their lives okay first of all that's true if half the world if you are going to say that you if you pick up an outdoors and say this sucks I'm outta here I'm going to the U.S up if that if enough to get you went to the U. S. gets what most of the Islamic world would like to come to\nVirtually everyone in China would like to come I bet Bangladesh Pakistan you could see the world in the United states and our welfare system will be bankrupt within you know\nThirty six hours but hey at least we feel good about ourselves as we you know starved to death and watched a civil war overwhelm our country and turn it into what I call Akaka stand like so many other parts of the world but what about the mall argument\nI think we should see our country\nAs a larger extension of our private homes if ... if somebody bang on your door and says he's homeless and demands to live in your living room\nYou have the right to shut the door and use whatever forces required to stop someone for staying in your house and eating your food against your will the exact same thing occurs applies to us as a country is our country of comment a home\nThat we work on and we improve and we leave to our children were grateful our grandparents we lead to our children we\nJudiciously accept newcomers or something to offer more\nAre we just on a giant refugee camp like the ones we see your you know in Turkey and Jordan where anybody who shows up you have to take him in and you put them on the same girl and given the same uniform and they and they gather around the same trash you know trash cans with a fire\nIn the future of America\nTalk to me politically\nGoing to happen presumably right before the incredibly important rational electrons right and uh I I I I worry given the butter bias of the media\nThat we will just have video after video and photo after photo of some American either military person or ice personal border guard up pushing some mom with the baby and then uh it's it's it seems to me they win the propaganda war\nNo no I think that I think you know how they win the propaganda war if these people set foot on us soil and then suddenly each one of them has all these legal rights and gets into a George Soros funded attorney\nWill know that that's not to forgive me John next month the propaganda war that swimming the war I agree but the propaganda war you know I may I just don't want to ... let me let me just breaking point it seems to me that\nThey win if they get in and they win if they don't get it and I don't because if they oh good I Hope you're right there's no ties I you're right\nThink if Trump shows weakness if he tapes then Republicans across the costs\nFree we just our hearts saying we realized the game is over even Donald Trump can't stop this openly absurd obviously false attempt to claim asylum and refugee status\nIt it's even Donald Trump can't say no to something the is ludicrous and politically cooked duck then we're we're toast and I think that would depress turnout\nOnline I I agree with you I agree with you I just I agree with you I\nDo I think if shot dance harm\nUs if you have to learn that that will mean in picture in pictorial form that they will be fight between Americans and civilians from Latin America\nAnd I think that will help us [noise] because I think people see that this is an invasion they can see it the people who are going to cry because a couple of people show up at the border and a soldier pushes them back those people are already voting for the Democrats but I don't think it's going to be enough to get people to turn out\nFor it otherwise going to turn out for a national impeachment referendum the less space has already fanatical they've got their their ... ready they're ready to go to the polls they've got their dead people registered to vote ... my wife does all ready at its maximum frenzy and hysteria they've maxed out\nWhat the Kavanaugh hearings did was wake up the Republican base of wake up the patriotic American to say wait a minute this is their shredding our system of government that destroying an orange adjusted oh and now they're bringing in contested doors to transform country demographically\nBy the thousands and thousands\nAnd thousands now go to John already dot com for the rest of that interview and sign up for the pond cash to get the best the talk radio every day\nMid week a cluster of bomb scares one report into the offices in the homes of a number of Democrats among them George Soros Hillary Clinton and president bronco violence disgusted threatened with Texas Senator Ted Cruz as you hear in the interview he was forty one layer in China's which helps explain why I'm\nHere today but enough about that enjoy the same without Sen Cruz talked me a little bit about these nine a suspicious packages at least one and there was a real bomb the president's condemned the vice presidents condemned Rod Rosenstein condemned I'm sure you're going to condemn it\nBut the media is running with a narrative that it's Donald Trump's fault I'm sure you see this and I it makes me crazy\nIt's either some not in the basement where it's a hostile power messing with our election\nBut what do you make can be attempt to blame Trump\nI Love it if the media dealing with the media does which which it any any narrative that they can twist against Trump they will do so is this just terrorists I mean this is terrorism and whoever the terrorist is needs to be caught any the prosecutor needs to be put in jail for a long long time\nAnd a and stopping it that'll happen you know it's interesting you number seven months ago ah we we had the bomb or in in Austin that was setting up bombs throughout Austin and and\nI met with uh the ... the FBI or leading that effort or something and at the federal law enforcement had from industry sources to put\nA bear pitcher to track him down in terms of the components of the bomb I go there I'm sure they're analyzing all of us now where cats just got to put it behind bars but but it is long violence is always role\nOr wherever it or is on the political spectrum but yet we saw tragically a year ago a phrase gunman coming to Washington DC\nOr with the object is a shooting Republican Congress and then and ultimately go into the irrational baseball practice and\nAnd and shooting it nearly killing states elites and and this should not be part of our political discourse disagreement is fine even healthy to disagree on policy issues but but violence as no like that and and and we need to be able to disagree with each other or with civility and with respect\nDo you believe that the Democrats will modify their behavior in the next two years or has President Trump just simply driven them crazy\nEach clearly driven them crazy that that that they they are ... in the throes of Trump's arrangements and for\n... and some of it is I think they're they're ... they're ... they're far less say they're radical bay is so scary is\nThat that that's the only thing they see it hatred of Trump so there's no good news you see the lowest African American unemployment history and they don't care because they used to be the lowest a Hispanic unemployment and history and they don't care because they hate Trump I think that the ... going to have to break I think we had a good election this year\nAnd keep the house Robert Jordan's then I think that'll make a step but my guess is it's going to take two bit elections to break that lever\nBecause their base remains just just consumed with rage and I think the number of Democrats

I don't want to warn police and that was my intention but I also believe in calling out talking points and they hear handling that I had to had to say something\nAnd honestly at the end of my day like I'm ... and if I ever had to write and I got my job\nNow Eric nice the alpha talking\nPoint is if I ever left in the right I've done my job at is like the architect can many times\nYou shouldn't have how many times it showed that\nAnd you know what gets watch you know what cliches are usually true and talking points are often true and the mob talking point what is more true than the fact is that the left has descended into mobs threatening\nViolence that is so pathetic and so on American if we don't call that out shame on us that it's not the American way in fact it is the end of everything we always stood for and you know speaking of Stephen Colbert later\nThis book I'm not kidding my book Donald range the swamp I Want it to topple his nasty shower anti Trump fake children's book who's voted this vote or whatever\nThe reason I wrote this book Hugh ... is is that the left is always putting out things into the culture right here's here's a children's book that he wrote which is not a children's book it's nasty no kid would would look at it it's for adults\nTo make fun of the president and feel morally superior I wrote my book because we don't have things like that\nOn the white for conservatives who want to celebrate what America is who believe oil Reagan was a white man I think that we need stuff like that and I get\nBetter option because you just got a tweet from Jamie ... you know kind of a never Trump or and he was just on the show earlier and I thought you were coming up to talk about your book Donald brings a slump and Jamie kind of sucked out well\nAnd he was a creative stimulant subways\nBut uh so I've actually been I Would say like in some ways less creative\nSince I stopped smoking pot but everything else in my life is so much better I mean I'm just I'm more present\nFor my family and my friends I feel like my life is in order professionally in a way that at work which is not as much chaos and ... and most importantly I'm not having the emotional highs and lows\nThat it's happening when I was using marijuana so I'm not having the melt down that would characterize as sort of my my addiction cycle\n[noise] yeah one thing you mentioned you've been married for Eighteen years [noise] did your wife never share a urine says he asked him for a lead\nNo in fact you know she was she was the opposite does she she has no interest in it at all\nUm and she many many times tried to tell me that I had a problem I Would just you know I Would just ... I you know 'cause the the methods that marijuana is an addictive then in some ways\nIt's considered a health food um and so I I just you know even though I had a history of alcoholism in my family\nUm and obviously have the addiction gene I just did it it it didn't register with me um maybe it should have you know there are ducking behind the dumpster other weight walking to the gym it's like you know take a hit so it'd be high wall of working out there that's not the sons of someone who is\nNecessarily healthy but uh you know I just\nI ah I didn't see it she did and she she was so great but when I finally made the decision to quit\nYou use the figures in your in your piece and I I think they're generally accepted figures from the journal and the American Medical Association and based on studies done in a number of countries they suggest that uh some nine percent of people\nWho ever use marijuana end up getting addicted\nAnd Seventeen percent of people use marijuana as teenagers\nDid you first use ... as a teenager\nWhen I was a teenager let's just you know the Nineteen eighties I was\nI was sort of a a go getter do good or student council type sort of a modeling myself maybe not politically but like at least in terms of my lifestyle on you know Michael J.

debatable issues in the controversies over transgender policies these days but one that seems particularly troubling is the idea that biological males\nAre allowed to compete against women\nPhysically men as a rule remains stronger faster quicker which takes away a female's ability to compete on a level playing field that's closely unfair\nIs Dennis Prager explains this just another area where the leftist corrupted everyday life another as the mob mentality disrupting a politician who simply trying to enjoy a meal with his wife here is that\nShe's a video about Mitch McConnell these people come screaming into a restaurant\nWhere you're going to have to fight back folks if people come screaming into the restaurant including my ... my side when screaming into a restaurant\nWhere a leading Democrat or was having a lunch or dinner I which I Would get rid of them as readily I Would consider them as disgusting as their side there are some people who shouted Nancy Pelosi which I'm not for by the way\nThis is this is the new rules but there are no rules that the whole point they the the only rules with a less of a woman to the left one of the pets\nLike you you must allow a male who considers himself to be a female to run in the women's race this ... this last week and it's amazing that goes on commented on in the United states men or women\nFemale races it is the end of female competition if this continues it's so amazing to me the ... that the left his bread and to be American bloodstream that we are supposed to have pity for this this person not for the women who are racing\nIt is beyond belief that all the compassion goes to the man who's feels he's a woman and I have compassion for men think their women but I Do I also have compassion for all the women who want to run against women's bodies women body verses women body that's the way it should work\nBut the got less liberal\nAllows the mean spirited left is to win every time that's the way it works\nLiberals no there's something morally wrong with allowing a man body to race in a female rage they know it but they have no cuts to confront the left [noise]\nSo what the liberals are cowards and left this are mean and that's it that's a bad combination cause cowardice allows meanness to win\nTo only conservatives give a damn it for fame if a male or female race is that what you have to beat you have to be a conservative to say something is wrong here what does that say about liberals the leftist\nWhen my kids are here so I Will come back talk a lot of Southern California um but that that was a

and he said man it's great I always see which way they were in a park that uh that we like about you so you know that that's part of a deal to hear what you got to be able to look at people in Europe and there and say hey here I Am what are you going\nTo do is we mentioned Democrats have targeted your district and others to try to retake the house how important easy that voters get out to the polls and keep you in office one easy at stake in this election\nOh there's a lot at stake um yeah we talked to a friend was and and people out there that say you know when you don't want to keep you in office I say well you got to get your your folks to your friends your\nYour um Facebook friends at all that out to vote because uh you're looking at a corner me right now whether it's extorting\nThere and uh you know her Kerman forty seven year that we actually have more young people to take the jobs where the three point seven percent unemployment it's the lowest unemployment for black and Latino that it's ever been recorded\nSo these are things that we should keep going and the other thing is\nYou know a year ago you would start a conversation off for a are we going to go to war with North Korea that's not conversation right now because of foreign policy that it actually work the next how foreign policy but actually working so there's an awful lot to look at and uh and say\nBoy it so it's good out there but if you want to keep it going this is the way we're going to do it\nSteve night is with us twenty fifth congressional district\nGoing for reelection their soda article in I guess it was one of the Senate rule or the Southern California newsgroup papers that said Republicans in California have a tough go at it because\nThey want to support Donald Trump but they don't want to lose voters by being too supportive what what do you think do you support the president are you standing with him or do you have to distance himself to win\nWell I I you know I get the same thing with the president that's an ... they're doing something good than we are saying hey this is a great great is becoming minutes or something that we have a um we'll talk more than we are vocal barrier to 'em\nAnd out and we get that went with a terror cell newspaper treated though chairs of solar I I did that on to a church petitions have been in Congress so\nWe are supportive and ah and if there's something that we are not only will make it all but\nBut we're always very respectful and just like we were President Obama on the administration and this administration has been very open to working with the issues are the tearful newspapers was was turned back very quickly and I think that's part of walking with us\nSo it's not a it's not a gift and it's not a or anything like that it's just to say hey I'm represent my district and uh and these are the issues that are coming up so can we talk about them and then very very open to work with us so so that's good\nYou know congressman night defined your candidate\nYour candidacy and defined your opponent what are the differences people have to I mean they get inundated with these you know car just come in the mail and they got to sit down with their ballot and figure things out there in in your most direct way help us understand the two paths clear path between your candidacy and your opponent\nWell you know I I don't talk about my father too much about either I'll give you a good in a kind of\nA example of how it's going I I don't see my point out in the community and appear you tells me that we we never see her she ah it obviously good primary or so we think that she's doing that but being out in the community is a big part\nOf the record I sat on a city council and the assembly in the Senate and now in Congress and I understand how a lot of the workings of government works and how to get something done\nAnd then the connection to the community and getting something done through their one of the biggest items in Korea is the same next in line that's been going on for twenty four years in this last debate\nMy opponent said you know I didn't even know what that was until just recently and you make a big deal out of it is a big deal it's the biggest deal for the community and\nThey told us that over the last four years so I think the bat I'm not just the experience because that that that shows by somebody who's never been elected in an office\nBut just the I nobody can tell me what she wants to do what we've been very clear and what we ought to do\nWas stand up for the military in aerospace veteran care small business loans are our priorities and uh and we're very good at what we yet to hear something from that says hey it's just this is what I wanted to do what I did in Congress except for that particular to\nOur work with people or I Want to get things done no thank you so we've been\nBeen direct and we've been successful\nAnd that is talked about rallying the campaign getting people out to the obviously the way it works in this is you got to get more people to vote for you then for her what is your strategy how are you how are you connecting how can you choose this takes place\nAnd what will get a lot of things that are among many other campaign that we can talk about this because we're successful at it\nBut it it uh at the totality of the whole issue I mean social media has shared all male male and radio and TV I have a huge role but it's also getting out and talking to many people as you can earn just came from a group of about ... veterans\nThat I told each one of them safe you want to keep the stone you've got to get ten people and so on and so for commit to get out and vote and they're not you know it's it's a little cooler than the last couple of elections\nBecause social media and such an impact but it still we're still talking to her as many people as you can\nAnd impressing upon them home for Mrs\nSince ... when they called retail politics where you you you meet and greet you you know she can ... babies whatever it takes to meet people you're doing is you're getting out there\nAnd you're in the community and that probably has a greater value than a flyer lands in your mailbox junk mail\nSo uh we we absolutely who though because fires or you know learning about politics\nAnd people get upset at politics after after a while but they trust the person on the person who's right in front of you and they're shaking her and and they're saying you know this is this is what we've done a lot of trust and the politics of of all the nasty campaign\nOut work to some extent but they also work in the opposite and we're very hopeful that you know me being out there in the community and talking to people and they just always being in front of people that builds up trust that people will continue to vote and uh and we'll symbol Homer said\nHow can people help you and your site to retain the twenty fifth

breaks and it said that private security guards could no longer be reachable carrying their rest break even in the event of an emergency\nAnd since then trial attorneys 'em and special interests have tried to apply this ruling to private from private security guards to private ambulance companies\nSo if that decision were applying to private ambulance corps a cruise it would end the longstanding practice of paying private EMT than paramedics to be reachable\nDuring their work breaks and this is a common practice for the last fifty years it's the exact same way that police\nFire um public

S C I argue ... in it's in an attempt by using ... sort of a smokescreen of\nOf quality or to punish providers that having complied with allowing unionized 'cause\nThe people that work in the center haven't elected voluntarily to\nJoin a union which have a right to do and so their second approach is to make this very uncomfortable for these providers to basically three segments of the market there's a book called the Vita dialysis or the health care\nThere is that for seniors medical care and then there's a bunch of independents someone California the biggest independent non profit provider is is satellite dial says primarily in the area but there's some representation of alcohol as well\nSo what do we as voters need to understand it sounds like it's kind of a personal battle between labor and insurance companies and big companies where where do we feed it what what do we need to understand\nWell first it's complex but the first thing you need to understand that if it had an immediate significant negative impact patience\nUm in other words people that receipt dialysis are quite vulnerable as you can imagine they're quite sick or you don't survive if you don't have your kidney function if you go to a sector to get treatments um ... you covered that spot go to the center and get your treatment and then go home and\nTake all the medicines you need to stay alive if this proposition um which focuses on the ... area that these companies make their profit\nUm it is it is enabled it will in fact make eighty percent eighty plus protected the dialysis clinic or California\nThey they see it's harder and harder to make a living in California hotter they'll put gas in the tank how to pay for rent\nFor college to pay for your children were just do simple things as going on vacation or you know having a meal out with your family it's people are you know don't believe that governments working for them\nThat the special interest in lobbyists and the corporations are the ones who control Sacramento and we just keep on seeing higher taxes and less services and I want to go ahead and exposed to that and bring my experience as a as a businessman to the controllers office\nSo you're looking to find things that the state is buying that they shouldn't have to or they're overpaying are kind of walk us through a for instance\nSo for instance let's go ahead and pick the high speed rail\nIf I take the high speed rail and I look at that as a controller sees nothing wrong with that project and I say that because she has refused to audited when I take a look at a project that says we're going to have a hundred miles north of track and now it's five hundred and twenty\nAnd they're cutting not far cost savings when it's supposed to be a high speed rail up to two hundred and twenty miles an hour now one third of the track is going to have speed restrictions were going to the south of up to a hundred and ten miles an hour top speed on ... certain areas\nYou using union Pacific lines that even high speed lines\nFrom twenty twenty completion of twenty thirty three if we're lucky and they take twenty thirty three we can only reach that they possibly is instead of spending three point one million dollars a day we're spending twenty seven million dollars a day but the price tag has jumped up to a hundred million a hundred billion dollars\nAnd the controllers that there is nothing here to see now the biggest problem that I have besides not auditing this program\nIt's to realize that when voters approve this back in two thousand eight under pop one a mandated that one third of the funding would come from the state government one third from the federal government and one from the private sector or the federal government has stopped paying for this\n[noise] excuse me and the private sector has not even put one penny into this and if that was the authorizing age and it mandated that funding parameters why the state funding a hundred percent of this so I'm going to go ahead and hold payment on the high speed rail on day one\nAnd the fund is because it doesn't comply with the authorizing agent and the well the people so on day one I'm planning on saving taxpayers a hundred billion dollars\nShow if you do this you know that people who make a living off that those who are the labor and the material and what this is a big boondoggle that sends a well if they're not going to support you know the right\nOf course they are supporting the Kennedy and that's why\nA I'm a controller for the people and that's why I refused to take political action committee money a lobbyist money union money Oregon we get blamed as Republicans you guys are big corporate is I don't take corporate money\nIf it's not grass roots grassroots organizations I don't take the money people have to know I'm ... I'm a man of principle um even if I did take a you know fade a pack on your special interest\nIt wouldn't change where I Am but I Want to make sure that people understand I won't take it and that I'm going to do the job that needs to be done because it's not currently being done so they can go ahead and come after me all they want\nI don't mind I'm here to protect the people I'm here to be the chief taxpayer wash out the California needs\nConstantly knows who does is with us running for controller so when all this is going on with that in your right the cost overruns the the boondoggle it is how come it continues easy truly Jerry Brown's legacy these popped up\nWell I think there's just so many picks up a trough that are high you know feeding off of this from union to or there's a lot of uh you know you would say supposedly business organizations that are supposed to be business friendly that\nI Want the high speed rail so there's interest kind of on both sides unfortunately uh from some of the cloning or Republicans to you know turning a blind eye because they're you know business backers are making billions off of this and just like the unions and all the other government contractors in workers that are\nMaking money off of this and we know the trains not going to be high speed we know it it's not even getting a help with traffic congestion whatsoever our own studies say at best around one percent and I think that's being generous\nAnd it's going to be slower and it costs more money\nTo take a train from Los Angeles to San Francisco\nAnd then it would be to take a plane I mean you could literally get on that point from LAX flight to San Francisco get off fly back and you still want to make a one way trip\nUh with the suppose that high speed rail so this is just a perfect example of government waste and corruption and it needs to end and the controllers position is a perfect position to hide like this and stop the payments and finally I kill this project\nDemocrats seem to have had a lock on statewide offices over the past decade what he's going on in mixed that happened and how do you feel that can be broken\nI think one of the problems and issues that a lot of people have is they go into the voting booth and they just don't see people's them don't see Constantine Australia's they the Republican and it's hard sometimes to break through that paradigm where people say hey you know not all Republicans at the same there are some Republicans that you shouldn't vote for\n'em and I believe my my message of fiscal responsibility of protecting the taxpayers\nTo being that person who says hey you know I'm not taking that corporate money I'm not taking that union money I'm not taking special interests I'm the I'm legitimately the person that's going to represent you and your interests and I think that crosses party lines I think\nPeople are so frustrated what's going on I mean I've seen you know reports and polls\nDone I think it was in the LA Times recently that Seventy percent of people don't want to vote or feel frustrated because they don't think government works for them that it's no big business and a big special interests that control everything so why bother or they don't believe they have a boy so I wanted to make sure that people know they have a voice\nAnd I think that's what's going across party lines and you know also I think people are frustrated with how California's being one and I think people are more likely that ah election cycle allowed to cross party lines and vote for the right candidates instead of\nSimply voting for their party that they'd been for years because it's got nothing to a huge amount of back here in California\nThere is a ballot item that is going to bring attention this year the choice the voters have to repeal the gas tax that may have a lot of people to the polls have you uh chosen to weigh in on that one of used stewed away from endorsing are not liking a particular item\nOh no I'm actually a co chair of yes on sex for the gas tax rate bill um and I am fully behind it and it yes I Do believe it's going to drive people to the polls that are behind it not because of that I Would still take it if it was an unpopular position because it's the right position when we take a look at before\nThe gas tax increase only twenty percent of the gas tax was going towards road repair when I had a debate with my opponent recently\nAnd we're talking about you know the money that's being diverted and she says like jaded emitted it she said you know because of the maintenance and that's why we we need our tax increase well you don't need a tax increase\nOr you just use all the money stopped diverting it use all the money and let's start using that money especially in effectively we pay up to four hundred and Seventy percent more than three four hundred and Seventy percent more\nTo maintain a mile of highway\nAnd free way than compared to other states are ministry of costs are up to three hundred and sixty percent more\nThan other states when you combine all road maintenance is and so forth it's two hundred and fifty percent more that we pay\nWe have the amount we have the money we're wasting billions of dollars and we're diverting where you didn't for ... projects and showing up pensions and other things we have the money should stop\nTaxing stokes seven hundred and Seventy nine dollars and twenty cents for the average family of four maybe nothing to Sacramento politicians that might be the costs of brunch for them with their lobbyists friends before we'll hardworking California and\nThat's a lot of money it's time we stopped taking advantage and start representing the people and make sure they have that money in their pockets so they can provide that think that they need I mean that is literally for the average guy let people spend on Chris Smith a to B average tuition costs for a college student for one year of books\nThat's around a hundred dollars that there's a lot of money and they just think it's nothing and it's time to go ahead and take back our money that's as our prop Thirteen of our generation it's time\nTo put a check on the politicians that just tax us tax us tax that's with no accountability and the problem with the SP one especially there is that it's not at one time tax increase they don't want to have this discussion again every year the taxes will go up based on the consumer price index of two thousand and Nineteen\nThe taxes go back up two thousand twenty and so forth and so forth\nBy two thousand and twenty ths estimated we'll have about with regulatory fees and taxing feet up to two dollars per gallon and feed its time we put a stop to this and that's why I'm yes on prop fix\nMy

I had to review myself\nAll of the death threats against the great men and women at the department of homeland security because every day wake up to try to enforce the laws protect other Americans\nThere is an appropriate way to express your solution to expect your ideas I welcome them at all times he's called to violent he's called to disruption are not affected not productive and frankly they can contribute\nTo additional I because of our ability to work together\nThreat let's turn to drop your day job but he got a lot of day jobs immigration there was a report that the president is considering making a major speech this week in which he will announce that he is feeling the border even two people seeking asylum on what the legal basis would he do that\nI think that the president hadn't thing and will continue to say and and certainly what a what I had been staying in the Caribbean and I'm getting in\nThere is a week away to enter this country to choose to enter illegally will be stopped we're working with our partners in Mexico they take an unprecedented efforts are within their territory to ensure an orderly flow and that they can have no legal right to be there are removed\nWe intend to do the same that my general message to this caravan and do not come he will not be allowed in there at the right way to immigrate to the United states and this is not as\nBut checking how we do it I Would hope that the president would would take some of this to heart as well Jason\n... you know when when Congressman Chaffetz drops about the present was pitch perfect I my initial reaction was which president because it didn't seem this week 'cause if there were two presidents first of all there was teleprompter Trump let's take a look\nMuch never allow political violence to take root in America cannot whether or not I don't I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it\nBut then there was Twitter Trump\nHere he is at three fourteen am friday morning funny how lowly right at CNN and others can criticize me at will\nEven blaming me for the current state of bombs yeah when I criticize them go wild and scream it's just not presidential do you think it's fair to say that there are two very different presidential towns here\nSo absolutely crystal ... after two years of President Trump I think that's something people have come to expect um I Do want to say\nA word for it to the headlines and those are being put up if you want to know why Trump won't give up Twitter\nAnd social media that is why that headline is why\nShe does not trust the mainstream media to treat him\nFairly and he is going to continue to use social media so long as the mainstream media treat them in that fashion as supporters are going to appreciate has a social media I think that is exhibit a right there I think that we would like the country with like public officials\nTo exercise some restraint and not jump the gun when we see these tragedies happened they'd like Hillary Clinton to do it they'd like Eric Holder the door and they like President Trump to President Obama to do it\nAs well that would be nice if they didn't behave that way or the motives seemed to very when these incidents happen you mentioned the the softball practiced shooter the guy who shot up the Annapolis newspaper had a different mode of 'em they may very and ... I think we're we're trying to shoot born a\nPolitical agenda and to these actions as as wrong what we should be doing is bringing these people to justice and hopefully the touring the tracks by train them to the president's rhetoric is separate and apart from\nI'm not I'm In no way [laughter] I've gotten a in some fights on this network about this I'm now and nobody's saying the president is responsible but do think it's possible that it's useful to say that these events happen in a particular climate\nNow I I don't think that's useful at all I mean I don't I don't any more than than than Bernie Sanders us ... or ... softball practiced shooter I I don't I don't think that that's the proper way to uh to look at these situations are these events happen because these people are arranged\nBomb the person who shot Gabby Giffords for instance to arrange to people and and that is what we need to have\nA I don't I don't see attaching politics of this as helpful at all in one case we had a Trump supporter carrying them and I and the other case where the Trump opponent carrying something out so no list\nWhat we had seen though when all of these incidents in an increase in and really dangerous and ugly radicalization a disturbed individual off on line and I think that it's something that we need to look at the same exact path that that's I think it is to create people\nOverseas we're seeing that share and waited dangerous homegrown extremists and these types of events are on the right and that is something you know you can talk about the tone at\nThe top of the general political discourse that there was something really ugly going on on the Internet and that is something that I think we need to pay more attention to\nFound them into the Internet though I mean there are I mean we\nTalked about the need I mean there are hosts on cable news who are giving home to right wing conspiracy theorists in allowing them to move forward with these unchecked with\nThese bears have they don't do it\nThere's nobody out there advocating that anybody take any violence that wasn't that separated them that's their right what I'm saying that you're trying to ascribe it to some deaths and now we're talking about her though you are here to tell me about it all goes with terrorism and that trust\nNo one party has its cornered the market are crazy I I mean you can point on that\nAll the way that this exchange is is a reflection of the challenge right now I'm making a point about the challenge of our political discourse and the lack of civility and the fact that the extremes of lives were saying the extremes are are are rising and finding more homes particularly their vision\nThat is what is challenging but I don't think you can point to a specific television show that advocating ... or ... you know waited on line is on cable news it is in a variety of places and I would hope that everyone\nWhether they are a TV host whether they're elected official whether it's me and my job in academia that we all do a better job of ...\nAnd I think hoping for a politician who wants to come out like I say look I Won in the country I Want us to fulfill or not and\nAnd the climate of toxicity that link fan I mean I had a journey that package that you played that clip Haley had such channel or anything like what happened in her hand I think that if they can accept ... completely agree\nThe one thing because I was a test on board with politics nine days before an election everything has to do with politics are able to take a break here so

reason why Congress must act to keep people safe number one um and then also with the number of people who are threatened as a result of those bombs that were were being built across America\nBut look
