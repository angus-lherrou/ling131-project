West Point graduate Apache attack helicopter flying African American MBA from Detroit is gaining on Debbie Stabenow\nAnd Bob Haagen in New Jersey is a is gaining on the simply unacceptable as a moral issue Bob Menendez what do you read and that is sort of like a sweeping rejection of the Democratic argument that all these Republicans were surging\nIt does so first of all the headwind for you know the party if if the ... the Republicans control the house in the Senate and the presidency\nThe typical number of seats lost in such a campaign is twenty five twenty five would flip the house or the in in in a according to Gallup in a in a year in which the president is unpopular and see the Trump is unpopular that means he's about fifty percent\nAnd nobody gets much better than that these days right but then the average will be thirty seven percent nobody's predicting that right now\nNow the election will break one way or the other they often do but for the last two weeks as you point out\nThe Republicans have been strengthening and isn't that odd shouldn't there be that's I think that's one of the reasons why there's furious a reaction from the far left from their point of view this man was unacceptable and everybody should see it by now\nBut you know a Rick Scott's very close in Florida and the news this morning is Trump is on his way back down there again here that means Rick Scott wants him to come\nSo yeah I think that uh it is a dog fight this election I don't think we know how it's going to go and uh I think it matters very much which is a question you were asking because\nIf you since any weapon can be you know Paul Ryan pointed out that eighty percent of the bills they passed and they passed a lot of them were bipartisan fails well ... thank God for that and it's it's the same phenomenon is the fact that most Supreme Court cases\nAre decided by overwhelming majorities most of them nine to nothing I think right but but at at an all of the difficult cases and all the cases that raise questions of\nWhich what is the direction of the country we are deeply divided\nAnd the house will be used as a weapon to fight the administration if the Democrats take it\nAnd then if you want that and that's what you should vote for\nAnd I got to go back to the enclosed on this what you just said the media is deeply invested in the idea that President Trump is bad and should be rejected therefore if he isn't repudiated his party is reputed in either house but certainly if it isn't repeated in both of them\nThe media will be face to face with the fact that they are not representative of the country they think they are representative Bob and they are not leading by the population in the way they think they are entitled to lead and I think that is a source\nThat is the bottom line is that people feel toppled from their purchase a power\nYeah and that's been a problem with Trump for a long time but that's not a particular Trump problem just remember it became since the Nineteen sixties and not before by the way\nSince the birth of centralized bureaucratic administrative rule a different kind of rule from constitutional\nThe path to political prosperity has to be the candidate of change and to run against the establishment in Washington\nAnd they have become increasingly unpopular with time and they've reached the peak now right and and we we don't we don't just say the Congress is unpopular\nThe bureaucracy is unpopular and the executive branch is unpopular and the media is unpopular everything in Washington DC is unpopular\nAnd and what Trump did was he managed to Marshall that into a presidential campaign and if you look at the campaign to the Republicans who succeeded Reagan\nUh they they all ran as enemies of the establishment although the to name Bush are the only ones who won after Reagan until Trump they both made the administrative state larger and more powerful and various ways it's a very difficult trend to resist\n[noise]\n[noise]\nMorning answer with prime engine for now is the conservative crusader Brian liberal\n... thanks for\nJoining us on your Monday morning answer Brian and Jennifer Ryan Whitman Jennifer Horn AM eight Seventy LA orange\nCounty am five Ninety in the I eat a tragic weekend on Saturday the victims of the massacre at a synagogue in Pittsburgh\nEleven told all killed or the victim list includes a grandfather a husband or wife a Ninety seven year old woman Jennifer who survived the Holocaust only to be murdered so many years later in a much more evolved progressive free nation like America that is\nA heartbreaking officials and family members reveal new details about the alleged gunman behind the deadly rampage they released those on Sunday what do we know Jennifer\nAbout the gunman we know it's a male a young male or or middle age male age\nIn his fifties or he wrote in a sworn affidavit he just wanted to kill James he was tired of\nPersecution eat that directly I Want to kill all the Jews and that was in ... in a in this affidavit that he gave to law enforcement after he was\nCaught on Saturday of course you know the neighbors always come out by and with the same story he seemed like a perfectly nice guy we didn't see any hatred any violent tendencies a lot of attention has than eh put on this website called the gab\nAnd I doubt that you've heard of it I Know I didn't hear about it I learned about it over the weekend that's right and it's this website apparently at that time I received funding and there is a is a place where people can go and have their free speech and in the weeks leading up to\nThis event actually in the hours leading up to this event this person that the shooter you posted pictures of his gun collection made anti Semitic remarks on the website and die and it wasn't obviously caught in time or a flag before he was able to carry out this attack\nAll right we want to listen to or some of the newsmakers who spoke over the weekend ah regarding the crime Wendell his rich Pittsburgh public safety director had this to say about the crime scene\nThe it's a very horrific crime so\nThat's one of the worst that I sang and I've been on some plane crashes it's it's very bad he\nWent on to say that this will be prosecuted as a hate crime a ... ... there are some people uh I understand who listen and I know that who don't believe in hate crimes they they say all crimes or hate crimes\nUh it doesn't happen to be my opinion but there are people who believe that and I I like to give voice to differing opinions as kind of the beauty of this a flavor of the show morning after show show here's window his rich aforementioned he's a Pittsburgh public safety director uh commenting over the weekend after the massacre eleven Jews killed\nAt peace in a place where they pray in a synagogue on Saturday and this is the uh the largest a mass killing\nOf Jews in the history of the United states of America when do his rich in Pittsburgh\nUh this is sort of falls under a hate crime or being it's a Jewish synagogue so it will be basically a federal investigation with the assistance of the local county and state police fear among voters under\nThe shooter was taken to the hospital okay I'll leave it at that\nAge he says I'll leave it at that the shooter was taken to the hospital the mayor of Pittsburgh bill ... was speaking of what what what looked like Jennifer an interface a service and um he uh I I think is a is is saying all of the right things built to doodle Pittsburgh mayor\nWho we are a resilient city we've been knocked down and we find ways to stand back up and we've always done it in one way or working together\nTo the victim's family to the victims friends we're here as a community of one for you we will be here to help you through this horrific\nEpisode will get through this dark as day of Pittsburgh history by working together\n... in Pittsburgh goes on to say that the Jewish community there in his home town is a part of that said these fabric\nSquirrel hill is the most diverse neighborhood in all of western Pennsylvania people choose to live there because of the diversity of the community\nThe Jewish community is the backbone is part of the fabric of Pittsburgh then we will be there in all communities to support our friends in the Jewish community\nMayor ... on Sunday at an interfaith service talking about the a tragedy that happens Saturday eleven Jewish Americans killed\nAt their synagogue it's called the uh the living trees and it's a life ... life tree forgive me uh the mayor veers into a subject here that that could be construed as a as a political topic when he talks about arming\nPlaces of worship that is certainly a political issue that has been debated a lot I don't know that that's the spirit\nOf ah the intended spirit of the mayor's comments but nonetheless here's what he said yesterday\nHeard the conversation over the past year about how we should arm um\nSecurity guards in our schools [noise]\nDealing with their rational behavior there is no way that you can rationalize\nThere's a person walking into\nA synagogue during services than taking the lives of eleven people\nWe shouldn't be trying to find ways to minimize the dangers that are curve from irrational behavior\nWe should be working to eliminate the rational behavior in the empowerment of people who would seek to cause this type of carnage from continuing\nMayor ... in Pittsburgh a lot of thoughts about that will break them down later finally the mayor a got a standing ovation and rousing applause when he offered the attendees the congregants there at the interfaith service vis\nA line [noise]\nLet me tell you something about Pittsburgh ers were tough\nWe are proud of our blue collar roots that we're not the type of people react to threats are actions in a way that ever takes back from us we will drive anti Semitism in the age of any people back to the basement on their computer in a way from the open\nDiscussions dialogues around the city around been around for [noise]\nThe mayor of Pittsburgh President Trump commented on during the weekend I Believe on Saturday Night at a conference in Illinois here's what the conference here's what the president said at the conference which you'll hear people responding and applauding but it was technically a conference or he calls this an evil anti Semitic attack\nAnd um he continues you'll hear 'em over admitted up the president in his own words lots of information on\nThis a developing story which I really will will it is developing 'cause the motivations and the and the questions about the suspect a linger ...\nThis evil anti Semitic attacks\nIs an assault on all of us it's an assault on humanity [noise]\nIt will require all of us working together to extract hateful poison of anti Semitism from our world [noise]\nWas an anti\nSemitic attack had his words [noise]\nThe school board of anti Semitism cannot be ignored cannot be tolerated and it cannot be allowed to continue we can't allow it to ... and [noise]\nIt must be confronted and getting them everywhere it rears its very ugly head [noise]\nWe might said we're the Jewish brothers and sisters to defeat anti Semitism\nHorses of hey\nThat's what it is President Trump continued in Illinois over the weekend to violate\nFilled poison of anti Semitism must be\nCondemned and confronted everywhere and anywhere it appears\nThat must be no tolerance for anti Semitism and America\nOr for any form of religious or racial hatred or prejudice you know that you know that very well\nThat's President Trump over the weekend talking about the tragedy eleven Jewish Americans killed or in their synagogue on Saturday as we continue on your Monday morning answer or the latest sort of on the itinerary of the suspect here who has a court hearing scheduled\nFacing twenty nine federal charges plus\nMore in some calling for the death penalty will fill you in as we continue thanks for joining us also some bad news out of Chavez Ravine we've got an audio story for you and I'm like okay do you find your bounce back just find it six sixteen\nIs your answer to morning\nIn that twenty six seconds he says this a case for an armed guard I never once does he say it's a case to reexamine what's reasonable in terms of gun control\nIf you look at the weapons that Robert Ballard is forty six to suspect appearing in court today in Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh if you look at the weapons yet available to him a it's outrageous well if\nYou walk in with four he had an automatic rifle and he had three ... and more homeless man more at home that's fine but you can't limit how many firearms people have under under our constitution okay right to bear arms okay\nUh this this argument is a is a in my opinion I'm not ...\nIt it it it doesn't convince me and I'll tell you why are the second amendment as we know we talk about gun control we're not going to spend a lot of time talking about gun control focusing on the crime in the developing news etcetera Second Amendment was written a long time ago when people thought the government would turn against them and come to their home\nStill good guy I think a lot of people on your side of the I don't think that the government could be a fall victim to tyranny how many times have we been calling show Donald Trump Hitler I mean you know people should understand I have never called Donald Trump to a lot of people on the left have is what I've sat in a lot and you of all people would understand that\nPeople on this side of the on your side of the aisle are afraid of tyranny and if that's the case where one step away from you needing those gun\nOkay uh the your assertion that which is true or you're a factual statement that he brought for guns to the synagogue that's true and he had a number at home I heard a number like Twenty one guns total that might be wrong but there were more guns back of the house and you said no big deal we have a Second Amendment\nAnd your suggestion is that there should be no legislation passed which of course is in defiance of fact we've had gun control legislation passed we had an assault weapons ban uh and and and some weapons are not appropriate for citizens to have\nAnd I think for the president to begin to bring the country together this is a\nObama Charleston moment where say between about President Obama he was in Charleston South Carolina you said the right things and did the right things reminds me of the late great President Reagan will be at the library tonight with ship Gorka after the challenger disaster he said the right things and he did the right things uh\nThis president I'm so far in my opinion has not he may have said some right things but he has not said and done all of the right things and just to say oh an armed guard would have solved this uh is is a comes up a bit short I mean why why else\nNo doubt if you had an armed guard there it would have absolutely how\nI'm Glad you're in helping mode a gun legislation and gun control that prevents a person who's clearly crazy I mean you you saw gab page off off the Internet that prevents a person like this from having a country of weaponry\nWouldn't that health I think we absolutely need to tighten up our our ... our stance our fight against mental illness in this country yes I also think but about gun ownership let me finish because I Want to respond to some of the things that you've said it and I'll and I'll get to that\nBut President Trump has said many of the right thing I think he said all the right things I think he's also right to question the safety of surf soft targets like churches like shopping malls like movie theaters like schools for crying out loud we need to start taking our safety very seriously\nAnd so I think it's a piece of this conversation now if\nI were President Trump today one minor ... I don't even know if it's a criticism but if I were advising the president today I think it is absolutely time to have a a a speech that is not a rally maybe a speech delivered from the oval office to talk about people's ... division as it was about the reporting he can't even talk about the media\nJennings people up he likes to talk about it in his rallies he\nCould talk about it directly from his death he should talk about camping down\nAnd tolerance and I think that would be perfectly appropriate and him to\nDo and I I agree with you will leave it at this I agree with you he also needs as our leader the leader of our nation the head of state he also needs to acknowledge his own participation in this a device of climate\nI think he has I think you've heard him say I mean I've been watching the rallies you hear him say I'm softening my town I Want the media due to say now that he's doing it he's trying to hold the media accountable and I'd I'd finished with is the reason that you get this passionate reaction from people on my side of the aisle or people who believe in the second amendment is because\nOnce you start modifying the second amendment in the constitution what other amendments are going to go next I really liked the first one I liked the first amendment I don't want anybody to touch it\nUnder any circumstances and you don't want to set precedence here\nJust because you think some gun should be allowed in some sense\nAs we continue on the morning answer for a Monday President Trump ordering flags of federal locations throughout the country to be flown at half staff and respect for the victims\nToday the president issued a proclamation as we continue it's over for the LA Dodgers we have an audio story for you know you're busy people are busy with family don't have a chance to hear all the games we've got the easy to consume review of the five game world series that when the way we had hoped it wouldn't get six thirty one\nMorning\nCapital than than I could read out on fourteen heading down going down the road there's her back and not enough to carpool lanes how everything around ... canyon [noise]\nSeveral hollering him crashed in ... minutes on the one on one heading north down just before the fight [noise] tell this multi class blocking the the right lane and everything pretty much stop and go from there and I told him I said they're headed to downtown Los Angeles one handing Northampton right there and have\nTo set up and down down they're blocking the second lanes on the\nLeft to pretty much stopping though right now if I'm elected televise the trouble is trying to get the south tower somebody else having heart capital and they broke down on a Ninety One heading west down at Lakewood vilify say you're going to have\nHim in a lame taken away with that and if we think pretty solid five [noise] and then ... somebody else from town sixty hitting my family have a plan road blocking lanes how science coming at a female from Ramona and\n...

Congressman Adam Schiff a critic of President Trump responding to that comment that the president made on Sunday I Believe you know the\nProblem is not how we is handling the aftermath of although I certainly don't agree with his suggestion that this could have been avoided are mitigated if they've had a some an armed in the southern got that's not the answer um what broader issue is what kind of crime or climate are we creating in the country this country is filled with\nAmazing beautiful wonderful people who came here many of them I'm attracted by the idea this was the lead of opportunity no matter your religion your ethnic origin your color\nThat ideas being tested by those who are preaching hatred and division um and we have to overcome that uh and I think the person who has a pivotal role there no one sets the tone or the president of United States\nAnd the tone that he says one of division off and one of hatred or sometimes one of the incitement to violence against journalists are and\nThere's no escaping\nOr collective responsibility but there's a gaping the tone that he sets the\nCountry's here's a little more Congressman Adam Schiff ... front I Will tackle this from both sides the congressman says in response to the president of the United states President Trump's remarks that words are not enough in a situation like this hour we're\nPart of the solution or we part of trying to make us more perfect union and we try to accentuate what what brings us together what unites us or are we preaching hatred in division and honestly I think this president's whole modus operandi or is to divide us\nUh he gets up in the morning with a new and inventive ways to divide us and it's not enough\nThat on the day of a tragedy he says the right words if every other day of the year he's saying things to bring us a a into conflict\nAs Congressman Adam Schiff I don't know that the president said the ... the right word Jennifer I'll put a question to you and you can answer it and offer your thoughts are so we can have a back and forth so that people can hear\nSome differing opinions on a ... know differing no different opinion about the tragedy of what happened but I think we all agree about that sure uh but uh certainly politics president's comments and then the criticism of the president that becomes\nA component of the story that if you're doing a talk radio show designed to inform people sure we inform you uh you'll hear about the crime investigation et cetera\nBut we also include a the information about how the nation's reacting the president's comment that focus is on the lack of the synagogue the synagogues failure\nTo have an armed guard there seems to suggest what will in a\nWay in a way it gives 'em short of a it doesn't give cover but but it should Jess well how could they be so naive not to have an armed guard aren't they smart enough to expect something like this will happen I think the president ought to be saying things about um\nThe division of the country why do we have people who feel this way about Jews a call up people by name maybe he eats them humble pie himself and said that he said and\nDone things that have added to the division and and also it generates a a you know the n._r._a. immediately and his pals\nAre over there because he doesn't bring up gun control so so so I think his words were appropriate but incomplete

Pittsburgh we'll hear from more from President Trump hurt a lot for him in the six o'clock hour he did say one thing he said uh is that an armed guard or would have been helpful at the synagogue I don't know if that was before I think it was before mayor ... offered his\nIt wise opinion okay so are the shows that response than simply the mayor is responding to what the president said here's the mayor Pittsburgh on arming places of worship in the aftermath of eleven Jews being killed Saturday at their synagogue and Pittsburgh\nHeard the conversation over the past year about how we should arm um security guards in our schools were\nDealing with their rational behavior there is no way that you can rationalize person walking into\nA synagogue during services than taking the lives of eleven people\nWe shouldn't be trying to find ways to minimize the dangers that are curve from irrational behavior\nWe should be working to eliminate the rational behavior in the empowerment of people who would seek to cause this type of carnage from continuing\nThe last word from the mayor of Pittsburgh gets a standing ovation [noise]\nLet me tell you something about Pittsburgh ers were tough\nWe are proud of our blue collar roots that we are not the type of people react to threats are actions in a way that ever takes back from us we will drive anti Semitism and the eight of any people back to the basement on their computer in a way from the open\nDiscussions and dialogue around the city around the around [noise]\nThat's built into the mayor of Pittsburgh President Trump was in Illinois at a conference you'll hear some reaction from people 'cause we're sort of a kind of felt like a rally for among but it was a conference on a forgive me I don't know what the farmers contract foreign speaking at yeah right I heard him actually talking about the farmers\nAnd farmers are being so important the reason he came because the president said there were some who said that under these circumstances in the aftermath of the tragedy that he ought not travel and not not appear their here's President Trump\nCalling what happens Saturday an evil anti Semitic attack\nThis evil anti Semitic attacks\nIs an assault taught all of us it's an assault on humanity [noise]\nIt will require all of us working together to extract hateful poison of anti Semitism from our world [noise]\nWas an anti\nSemitic attack at its worst\nFor school board of anti Semitism cannot be ignored cannot be tolerated and it cannot be allowed to continue we can't allow it to continue [noise]\nIt must be confronted and can damned everywhere it rears its very ugly head [noise] we might said\nWith our Jewish brothers and sisters to defeat anti Semitism\nVersus of hey that's what it is certainly\nAgree with that President added this the vial hate\nFilled poison of anti Semitism must be\nCondemned and confronted everywhere and anywhere it appears\nThat must be no tolerance for anti Semitism and America\nOr for any form of religious or racial hatred or prejudice ... you know that you know that very well\nOkay that's President Trump over the weekend or naturally the way our country is divided there is criticism of the president for some of the other things that he said there are also some praise for for some of the things that he said we'll update you at seven thirty six on the Donald

boulevard and\nThe problem is is Sacramento banks are confusing California voters even though California voters love voting for attacks\nAnd they shouldn't worry so much it seems that Sacramento wants to confuse you because they don't want you to be able to understand what you're voting on I spent the last week I spent some time in Hawaii reading through my propositions and it's confusing even for someone who does this with you every single day you have to\nSit there and go through it a few times and the problem with proposition six in the no camp including the\nFolks that are elected to office in Sacramento right now are trying to tell you that without proposition sick if you vote no on that you have to do it to save this\nTo save your home in the case of a wildfire how many commercials have you seen on TV with the guy in a firefighter outfit saying we won't be able to get your house and rescue you if you repeal the gas tax\nThis is such nonsense the money for the road repairs is already there this is money that they're putting into coffers to fund pensions which is why you have cooperation from the fire department and this is a yes vote on sex don't be confused\nLA county will have can early voting locations open next weekend November third and fourth on Saturday and Sunday before election day hours are eight AM\nTo four pm so if you're somebody who missed the October twenty do voter registration deadline which we informed you're out here on the morning after you can still cast a provisional ballot they also did some early voting this weekend that just wrapped up a lot of people were doing a Halloween parties do we have any indicator of how ...\nHow are you or something like Microsoft and I felt like the break talk show host Michael Jackson oh Jennifer did an

love Michael Jordan the king of\nThe king of talk radio you got it All right uh any indication of\nWhether early voting was brisk get people turned out this weekend\nI haven't heard about local numbers but there is a report out from NBC News that came out last\nWeek that say in some key states Republicans are outpacing Democrats in early voting and uh again these are the states of the Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Nevada Tennessee in Texas so that could be good news for some of the Senate races there however\nEarly voting doesn't necessarily mean a whole lot it just means the people that are sending in those absentee ballot than or who were showing up early to the polls\nThat I mentioned a moment ago the early voting available in LA county coming up this weekend riverside county residents can also vote this Saturday and on November third from nine to four at the registrar voters office that's on gateway drive in riverside should want to include the IEEE\nIn that information it seems look we've covered it talking about mid tremendous we got a wrap up our update here\nBut there's certainly been an increase of voter registration in California presumably because people want to vote in this election a week from tomorrow\nYeah I think it nationally you have so many passionate issues going on you have the resistance movement on one side\nAnd you have the resisted the resistance on the other side with the Kavanaugh hearings ... you know driving some of that some of the attack by the media on Trump driving passion on the right so it's going to be really interesting to see who can actually take those voter registration and actually turn them out on election\nDay as we continue a we have the Donald daily download then I'll share with you or maybe a

ten thirty Southern California turned out to be one thirty Pittsburgh time on the east coast\nA so that'll be big news today the man accused in the shooting of the Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday mornings screamed anti Semitic epithets including all Jews must die as he fired at random\nTo a law enforcement official telling USA Today\nYeah they'd have breaking news by the way of suspicious package address to CNN was just intercepted at an Atlanta post office it will continue to follow that story but apparently what we know now is that Robert Bowers is forty six years old while in custody and receiving medical treatment because he was shot at by the SWAT Team in\nPittsburgh he told a swat officer he wanted all Jews to die and also that quote\nThey were committing genocide to his people and to quote no one seems to know who his people are he had referred to them many times not only to swat officers but also in his social media postings on a site called gab and uh I guess just a few hours four hours before he had perpetrated this attack\nHe went on line and said he couldn't wait any longer he didn't care about the optics anymore they were hurting our people and he went into the synagogue\nObviously opening fire and of course his neighbors that they knew nothing was going on they said he was the nicest guy he didn't seem overly political we've heard this story before and he didn't seem hateful yet here's a guy who's online persona showed him to be just the opposite it's a\nBusy busy week because we uh have to deal with this tragedy in the political aftermath and on and unfortunately does become political lot of criticism for the president for the environment of divisiveness after a week of\nMailed explosives and then this attack on Saturday shootings in Kentucky which I Know less about that I Do the other two we have a week from tomorrow election day\nNo fear is a morning answer mid term mad dash to update okay\nWe have a lot of propositions or should know about here in California and I think sometimes like surprise surprise you\nWent well maybe I didn't surprise you when I said yes on prop six to repeal the California gas tax because my opposition to the gas tax is rooted in a saving money for working families a middle class in the working poor I'm a proud liberal and so it it it it it it um mirrors my values\nHere's one where I think I change my mind over the weekend and I might not yet no okay on a proposition that you're seeing a lot about on television there's ... there's the dialysis proposition ... is a big one that we're getting a lot of attention rent stabilization\nIssue prop eleven okay if you've ever passed out and you've been rescued or if you ever hit your head you ever had a car accident heaven forbid knock wood and you've been treated by a paramedic or an ambulance has come for you\nAnd I'm not being funny this happened to you and you had immediate medical attention I did it happen I wasn't really being funny I mean the experience so that's why for an MBA\nAnd that's kind of why I I guess what made what drew me to this but but it's about all Californians I remember earlier this year I was out for a couple of weeks such because I I I fell and I hit my head and I was out and I think it was like two minutes they showed up late I did they told me they were there and a couple of minutes okay so proposition eleven\nIs about those guys and ladies and the ambulances\nAnd whether they should be on call\nHaving a paid break but if there's an emergency like yours truly passes out in Glendale or heaven forbid somebody has a heart attack watching the Dodgers game or whatever it is uh-huh [noise]\nSense of ... it's it's sensitive and and as my initial reaction is well the ... I don't care if the guys on break getting the ambulance and go see the person right okay that would be against felt that would be a yes vote if you say put down the sandwich I don't care about your break do you have to okay\nI'm entertaining a no vote because\nUh I Do believe in I Do believe the number one most important thing is to get medical professionals quickly\nBoom to that person right that's the most important things in the question is who does it do you take the guys who are having a break or should these people have what are called sacred work break so I mean this almost becomes workers right thing for example doctors\nA who take the Hippocratic Oath I mean the doctor will save choking person in a hospital but doctors go on vacation and they have other doctors cover for them\nOr maybe we should analyze this prop and how about this Jennifer\nMaybe the ambulance company you ever look at your insurance statement you know how much the riding that ambulance cause it can go one time it cost me from what from what I Do not on from there we need to work on that I wanted to stay out of the ambulance I ever got my one time from to look like you're terminal sort of like a five hundred six hundred dollar ambulance ride insurance companies\nNot cheap right it's not someone calling at\nSome point is why can't that company that's making a ton of money\nHigher for the hour a part time crew so that the workers can have sacred real breaks where they can eat their lunch and call their spouse and not have to worry about shooting up and running out every time Brian Whitman passes out I'm being funny but\nIt's not funny because their emergency situations uh you solve that problem if I'm guessing that shouldn't see ambulance operator owner\nWould just come up with a few bucks create a couple of jobs and hire people who are part time but are paid to cover for the full timers who were on their brakes the working very long shifts I might add\nSee but you're still going to have the issue of people being on their brakes and it's not about the number of people I Would just say what if there is a terror attack let's just say God Forbid somebody like they did in Pittsburgh walks into a church in Glendale and opened fire worst case scenario then all of us are off\nWhen it comes to helping people create their niche revenue model both for joining recommend income store as a can't miss when it comes to putting people in it tends to be could your household their business using additional revenue model that doesn't solely dependent on you if so you need to check out income store dot com that income store dot com\nPolicy that you buy American Tim a life insurance company Houston, Texas had available in all states but details that have a direct dot com\nIf you're young and healthy you don't need life insurance right yeah that's what I used to think too until my brother died at thirty eight\nJoe left his wife with two kids a mortgage and a stack of bills she couldn't pay\nMary had to sell the house and move everybody into this tiny two bedroom apartment just to make ends meet\nI never want to do that to my wife so I got life insurance I called A.

I just now and the courts\nHave determined that some gun restrictions and controls are legal\nWhat an ISIS you would just take it away their weapons right we've taken away their guns so what do they do they drive into things now face at people with night the best way to stop the bad guy is an arm a good\nGuy here's Congressman Adam Schiff from right here in the valley on a on the situation here and uh references or the president's comments briefly\nYou know the problem is not how we is handling the aftermath of although I certainly don't agree with his suggestion that this could have been avoided are mitigated if they've had a someone armed in the southern part that's not the answer um what broader issue is what kind of crime or climate are we creating in the country this country is filled with\nAmazing beautiful wonderful people who came here many of them I'm attracted by the idea this was a land of opportunity no matter your religion your ethnic origin your color\nThat ideas being tested or by those who are preaching hatred and division um and we have to overcome that ah and I think the person has a pivotal role there knowing sets the tone for the president and I'd say it's\nA and the tone that he says one of division off in one of hatred or sometimes one of incitement to violence against journalists are and there's no escaping\nOr collective responsibility but there's a gaping the tone that he sets of the country\nA Congressman Adam Schiff a who represents the valley here says words are not enough from a president at a time like this are we\nPart of the solution or we part of trying to make us more perfect union and we try to accentuate what what brings us together what unites us or are we preaching hatred in division and\nHonestly I think as presidents whole modus operandi a is to divide us uh he gets up in the morning with a new and inventive ways to divide us and it's not enough that on the day of a tragedy he says the right words if every other day of ear he's saying things to bring us a a into conflicts\nOf Congressman Adam Schiff irresponsible to say that he wakes up in the morning trying to divide the country unbelievable vis such his opinion that this is a and it's your opinion that Enron right up there on our program here we we do find opportunities and we love it we find opportunities to agree I think Jennifer night earlier determined stumbled into a agreement\nThat the next thing the president should do\nThe first thing the president should do is um I Would say go to Pittsburgh uh for starters and ah and have\nA televised address not in front of the press not in front of supporters at a rally\nThink of a of American presidents sitting in the oval office at about six o'clock at night are time nine o'clock on the east coast one camera on the president speaking to the country about the climate that we're living in\nYeah I think you absolutely should I think that it's it it would be overdue about camping down some of the heat and about disagreeing without trying to hurt each other and respect for people tolerance I think that'd be a great message from this president and I think there is even room for him to put the pressure on the news media with an address like that\nKept him stop with the lies about his administration started telling the truth and get back to work\nAs a news body instead of as a propaganda arm for the Democratic party\n[noise] okay I thought we had a unifying we'd you know they're the most\nPart but I think there's room for him to talk about the news media to instead of just tweeting about it I think he can explain his point got it as we can you agree with that that's\nGreat um I actually don't I I thought we were going to end on a moment agree and I thought that was the idea that some people can't help\nHe should have an address period All right as I continue\nMorning after Brian and Jennifer here a week from tomorrow we vote bitter madness update as we continue it's
