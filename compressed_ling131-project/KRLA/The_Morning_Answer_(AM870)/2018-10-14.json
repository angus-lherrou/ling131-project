been going on in Washington DC so we're keeping our fingers crossed and that one in it and I am cautiously optimistic\nAnd so yes on six repeals the gas tax puts six hundred and something seven hundred bucks back in our pockets most families if you vote no on that tax continues I understand the way they built a they indexed it for inflation they're going to take more from us right\nYeah it's

governments from being able to impose rent control we are are we are opposed\nTo proposition ten because it would dramatically expand rent control in California and you know we understand that there was a housing crisis in California\nThere are all kinds of legitimate responses to that including building more ... building more homes or removing some of the red tape but rent control is just the opposite thing to do it we will result in a lesser of a housing stock\nAnd you know there's an old joke that's been going around among economists for decades and that is\nThere are two ways to destroy a city one is carpet bombing and the other as rent control and uh we we've seen the ah we've seen the ill effects of rent control in many jurisdictions in California like Santa\nMonica San Francisco where these very politically powerful regulatory boards called a rent stabilization boards you'd be you'd be increasing you'd be increasing the number of these big bureaucracies dramatically and also many of them would regulate\nWhat you could write your own home for so this is if you're an owner of a single family residential home don't think that prompt ten blue impact you it will because it's again government intrusion into the price of real estate and the price of\nBread just doesn't work you don't address the ad they run this one and with this man with the blue shirt on just kind of looking at the camera he's a little bit older and he's kind of concerned about having a place to live what do you think back to those I mean are those\nAimed at trying to do to convince us that somehow limiting the rent is going to bring more units on line it's not\nPeople are not going to rent their place out they're going to sell it if they can't get enough to recoup their investment\nI we we we would say that he's he's correctly identified the disease but this proposed his proposed medicines exactly opposite you don't take poisons\nTo to ah to cure an ill and this would just exacerbate the housing crisis again\nUm there are other answers ... removing red tape allowing more construction of units and we began to see a little bit of that happening already 'cause I think even progressives have come around to the notion that\nCalifornia's housing policy is policies have been counterproductive and by the way many of the progressive social justice organizations\nAre actually a a opposed to prop ten because they they studied it and they understand it the day that it would hurt their interests of keeping real estate values are are within the reach of the poor and middle class\nJohn Paul well this hour German taxpayers association is the president of the Howard ... proposition Thirteen and Gavin Newsom you wanted to talk about something that was recently said\nYeah very scary in a in a debate with the Republican or a candidate John Cox uh the moderators ask them a uh ask Gavin Newsom directly and she said a is a prop Thirteen on the table\nAnd he said very ...\nVery this made me very nervous is a direct quote was everything's on the table well\nWe now have someone running for statewide office who openly admit that prop Thirteen is on the table and this is consistent with what he has said before about prop Thirteen so if if anyone is concerned about the preservation of Thirteen\nUm you've got to look at\nThis particular comment and I'll take that into consideration when choosing who you vote for\nFor the governor of California has a very very troubling very troubling or a comment and I'm\nA we hope that if he's elected he will change his mind\nOr whether he's elected or not people can understand that the average average taxpayers association or will defend who the death proposition Thirteen as we have for forty years\nYeah it's it's hard to think forty years have gone by 'cause I remember the commercials that the other side ran that said if you vote for proposition Thirteen essential services will be cut by two thirds you remember that that was kind of ... ... yes\nI Do it and my my favorite one is they hired a a they got some economists I think it was from\nUCLA is older guy who was staring at the camera and he in tone with a very serious vote if proposition Thirteen passes California will be plunged into the deepest recession never seen\nWill prop Thirteen passed in the economy and California exploded in the uh in the early eighties so everything everything that the progressives claim would be bad as a result of prop Thirteen has turned out to be just the opposite end\nAnd you know carry that forward today everything they talk about in terms of housing policy prop Thirteen transportation you know they promise to solve this stuff how good great high speed rail would be you know we've got to take\nThese promises and these representations by progressives who they are huge grain of salt but our strength is in our number so we hope people to join our organization and learn what's going on in California like going to all the resources on our website which is age ... dot org\nThe initiatives props to vote for and against take us through them\nYes on six no on ten and be very careful about the gubernatorial race uh because of and we even doors John Cox by the way because of our nervousness with Gavin Newsom\nBy thank you so much junk to Paul how are Germans taxpayers association thank

going to talk about no on proposition ten\nMichael thank you so much for taking time to be with us on the program today and good to have you on\nThe line with their voters are going to be ... with a bunch of different balance measures and sorting an all out and tell us which one number ten is\nWell positioned tan would repeal\nThe existing law to to repeal wrecked control um and then in in exchange\nFor that it would be several things that would\nBe most importantly for the first time I'm have rent control on single family homes would also establish about five hundred thirty nine different boards unelected 'em to tell us a what we can and can't charge for apartments Oregon are single family homes\nAnd you are no on this let's walk through the arguments on this issue obviously\nThe other side says it's getting very expensive to live in California it seems like you know in the landlord might raise his ranch here there and we got to do something I've seen her ad on TV that they're talking about this stuff you know I mean it is expensive here but it sounds like you're saying this isn't the answer\n[laughter] well you know there is there is there a dispute about the fact that that we have a housing crisis but proposition ten will make the housing crisis worse and the reason why we say that as several first off I'm\nIt would it would be some sort of eyes any kind of building going forward for affordable housing which we all know here in Los Angeles and across California we're in desperate need to do this was a disincentive proposition tendons a disincentive to do any any further building\nYou know and and that will make it difficult for for colonel enters the other thing it'll do is this says it will it creates a perverse incentive for folks who currently\nHave a partner will say you know we're talking about small a apartment owners show that um you know a couple of of a duplex says or maybe two or three small apartment complexes where to simply say you know what I don't want to do this anymore I Want to get out of the market you your turn those into condos or\nUm you know they are to you know to be your other kind of vacation rentals but in the end what it does is it takes away from the from the rental market\nYou know it seems pretty simple supply and demand kind of sets the price but if these folks come in and set up these boards and somehow they tell a landlord that you can't charge enough to make back the expenses you put into it and a little bit of extra\nWhy would you be in the renting business right\nWell that's correct in fact you know really that's one of the reasons why some folks and they just simply say I don't want to do this anymore convert gr apartments and condos and cell and that doesn't do any any good for anyone who is looking to try to find in an apartment and all that does reduce the overall stock of\nOf available apartments which by the way are you know kind of hard today\nYou know to fight a war we suggest to something else vote no on ... on ... and let's work with the legislature and local jurisdictions to create incentives\nYou know that you're forming sequel or providing affordable housing bonds or the like you could build a part time it'll it'll just simply do the reverse it will make the housing crisis worse now\nIn California is not doing much to make it more affordable would legislation I recently read in the future they passed about requiring solar systems on houses that's going to raise the price of houses as you mentioned sequel people don't know what that is but there's a a set of laws\nOut there that are supposed to protect the environment but they're actually been used by groups organizations to challenge any sort of building and extract things for themselves in the process right\nWell that's correct I mean the California environmental quality act was really put in place to help protect the environment goes also put in place to\nUm to allow communities to to speak up against you know projects is just frankly didn't fit into the communities um but but what it's turned into over the years is really a blunt instrument where you know folks who are who just don't want to see development that you know so called ...\nWho are really stood in the way of affordable housing you know and other kinds of developments 'em and say no no no not here somewhere else in fact there was legislation just this past year\nIn the middle of residential neighborhoods and if they wanted they could have just losing in areas like the commercial areas are or areas industrial areas of a city but not now and then somebody neighborhood and I have a piece of legislation that says\nThe states and the ... and the local government should have the right to regulate sober living homes there's what's happened because of the Democratic party and so one of the left\nThis in Washington so we have the sober living on coming here\nLocal government has been neutered they can't even a zone them out some legislation that I've been proposing\nTo actually give the power back to the local community to zone out and the license and give license and only those with licenses uh would be able to sub sober living homes and only the only their neighborhoods that are shown to force overwhelming homes\nWe heard today at an event in Newport Beach where they were saying uh under six people and there's no regulations at all of these things that's right\nWhat's happened is again with the best of motives Louisville liberal deliberate left in this country has the best uh motives I think they want to help people and they feel other people who believe in the rule of law and\nWant local government to be responsible for things rather than having the federal government around so [noise] yeah they well\nThey don't see that that way and so we end up in granting all sorts of powers to the federal government should be done to the local level\nTalk about what's at stake in this midterm election then why it's so important to get out the vote\nPaint the picture of what's going on dams want to take back control of the house there's a certain number of candidates they feel\nThey can pick them off so to speak with their people and\nThen they can go after Trump that's kind of what's up right well\nWhat's happening right now really is a something that's been going on since\nThe Hillary last the last election\nObviously from the investigation into this Russian collusion\nWhat we're finding is there were a group of high level Democrats in our law enforcement intelligence agencies they were the ones who are committed\nNot permit Trump to become president and once he did a they are committed\nTo not allowing them to assume the foreign aid has said they will now obstruct ability to become an exercise the president said this is what we are up against a they have indeed we lose this election if it would go over the Republicans lose control like for example if I lost my seat and\nAnd my opponent was in a Nancy Pelosi then would be responsible perhaps getting control of the house\nAnd they would waste being tired next two years trying to destroy Trump\nRather than trying to get some things done for our country so this is not just enjoys a philosopher but let's let's recognize that Trump won the selection of two thousand sixteen\nI must make sure that we operate and and do the Democratic process that what he has to get things approved by Congress or we shouldn't have\nAn obstructionist Congress just as regular do nothing but get him and that's what would happen if I lose Democrats get control of the house\nAnd and so that's why it's so important in this election as they say could be the most important also things like\nExtending the tax cuts and some of the things that are being done to try to help the economy down to like to take that back\nWhile there's a lot of things that that this president has done\nA if indeed a Congress decides to do with just a\nTarget the president rather than targeted thing positive things\nTarget the president to attack him and get him to fail and as a so whether it's a tax policies are regulatory policies on some great things for example you know I think what he's doing a where the China trade policy is a good thing for challenging the Chinese\nTo treat us fairly and they say well you're going to create a trade war with China the Chinese have already been at a trade war with us when we just haven't been doing fighting to protect our own people\nAnd so there's a lot of great things as president has done with an executive order that and that's one of the reasons why our economy is doing so well right now he really is taking\nAccess bureaucracy and and government controls off the backs of those people who want to create jobs and who want to get things done and make us more competitive so uh uh we need to make sure that uh that isn't fun done\nBy giving either house up to the Democratic party which is only targeting the idea of making sure Trump fails congressman\nDinner robot cruise with is running for re election in the mid term election there's a lot out there in the so called mainstream media that has jumped on the Democratic side you watch CNN MSNBC ABC CBS [noise]\nAnything that needs to be cleared up the UC out there I mean they have no problems just picking on Republicans is you know being tied to Russia or being tied to this\nWell it's a good that's a good example because here we've had a special prosecutor in place specifically because you've had the fake news creating this story that there was some collusion with Trump and the Russians that's what slowly election\nThey had met him or he wasn't a good candidate and the American people don't want to go as far left as the Democratic party is trying to take us out Trump won but now they had to blame it on collusion with us\nOver a year and a half an hour with a special prosecutor enormous powers and they have not been able to prove that yet they wasted our time and my opponent for example ... time in our time\nAttacking me for that same thing all supposedly I'm too close when the Russians that I met with there's a sort of shows that I've met with this Russian and that Russian what they leave off\nIs the fact that I Am the chairman of the committee in the United States House of representatives\nBy the chairman of that committee that has jurisdiction to oversee our relations with Russia hoops mean\nDoing their job\nIs to write leave that out of the equation then it may sound soon as that I've met with a number of Russia has the I I actually met with more anti Russian Ukrainians for example but my job is to meet with a with people of every point of view from the countries that are overseas\nAnd Russia is the area where I'm the chairman of the committee that\nHas the jurisdiction to oversee our relations\nSo anyone who sees those slate to go out in the mail and exhale that tries to tell you that is why you want to tell them well wait a second I'm doing my job\nYeah and they they they need to understand that you're up against\nPolitical party and how that is trying to base campaigns\nMember on allies and destroying people to try that and we've seen that done the forest for judge Kavanaugh and what are they feeling just us and saying the attacks on a on him and now we know that no male down that is a conservative or Republican\nKind of expect that they're not going to try to use this tactic\nWell somebody who says they were with you when you were drunk than a teenager [noise] uh I mean\nThis is just incredible\nAt one of the warnings on that is it good people\nWill say it's not worth running it's something worth going after public office if that's they're going to destroy yeah yes and this\nIn this case we had a wonderful guy with a great track record of public service and now he's being dragged through the mud like goes with no there's no collaboration of anything that's been charge against him\nAnd said they are the fake news again just spread it all out as if it's true\nAnd they love it that they did boost their ratings they you know we had a story to cover that that's the thing the dirty little secret for the media right well we're just a double standard\nWith the media and with these people who've been attacking judge Kavanaugh\nWas just overwhelming I mean these are saying people who you had women begging for help or about Bill Clinton\nAnd many of them not just water and we had ... Kennedy again was infamous in Washington for\nThe type of things he was doing it even in restaurants et cetera and but then he went out and then I went out and then actually drowned some rural\nAnd left the scene and yet he said people are touching Kavanaugh for what he getting drunk and maybe doing something which we don't know a lot they they attack him really as a result rapists and yet they have Teddy Kennedy and a\nFriend who ah you know did they give them awards hang out with them\nOn a second message to the voters out there it's going to be getting their their ballots right to know a couple of days people have to understand what direction we want to take our country\nYou are the things that the Trump is doing now trying to\nIncrease our economic activities and right and he's been very successful that should we keep going in that direction should we control our border\nAll these things are for the Democratic party we have some control over either house that's going to stop\nGoing to go on the opposite direction and we know what the liberal left is done to the economy of California now they'll do it to the entire country and we'll have open borders\nFor you and\nYour spirit on President from from supernatural was going to accomplish all the plans for this country is [noise]\nThe other big story there day folks in the southeast still trying to dig out from hurricane Michael one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the nation Phil ... and Mexico Beach Florida where the storm made landfall felt [noise]\nChris post hurricane day for just beginning at FEMA director Brock Long and Florida governor Rick Scott just landed there here and getting a look on the ground up close\nThe catastrophe that near cat five hurricane brings the search for the on accounted for all of the rubble continues total death toll now at Nineteen but that number is expected to rise today [noise]\nShell shocked residents returning to the scene summing up in one tragic word catastrophe block after block in this town of twelve hundred people looks like a bomb went off most evacuated before the hurricane but not Steve Ramsey and there's dogs and they probably shouldn't have survived\nCame in so fast\nThat I had to take the boom and bust is tough window out and dumped my dogs in your swim out he got through all the dogs and everything in the boat climbing the boat was\nNo images before and after a hammer home Michael's magnitude about\nOne million Americans from Florida to Virginia still have no power many for the fifth street day [noise]\nAnd tomorrow President Trump flies into Panama City to take a look at this historic disaster for himself Chris\nDon't getting reporting from Florida ... thanks for that [noise] there was another big story this week the dramatic drop in the stock market raising new questions about the state of the U.S economy joining us now President Trump's top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow\nLot right the Dow fell more than a thousand points snap this week that's more than four percent and the other indexes followed suit\nWhy do you think the markets took such ahead and do you see them going up or down over the course of this here [noise]\nWell I I wouldn't want to give her a couple of investment strategy forecast stress today but I Would like to say\nThat these kinds of corrections are absolutely normal or this one's self are actually a rather moderate I think it's about five percent or so six percent were still ahead here today in the major indexes\nAre by four or five percent the economy isn't terrific shape we are in an economic boom or people would be impossible the reality is we're clicking on all cylinders are Americans entrepreneurs workers are absolutely crushing topics are rising\nConfidence is up blue collars are up wages are up so I think the background is very positive for the stock market and\nI think the fact that corrections come and go and um they said the same very calm over these things are quite normal\nYou as you've just demonstrated are very bullish on the Trump economy but some analysts say warning signs on the horizon let's go through some of those\nThey know interest rates are rising solar energy prices the president's trade war with China is hurting growth and the global economy is slowing down the international Monetary Fund\nJust revised bitch protect projection for us world down to two point five percent\nFor next year twenty Nineteen question using no cause for concern on the economy\nNot too many America climate Chris I'm not the present time as I said look I'm\nThis is the story and twenty Eighteen that most folks that would be impossible we've created an economic boom president's policies have changed the whole incentive structure in the economy with lower tax rates for individuals and small businesses and other companies are we deregulated across the board\nWe spark a tremendous boom and energy which I think it's going to continue for quite some time\nWhat we're also seeing here and this is very important in terms of the president's views\nBlue collar workers are booming right now the\nFastest pace of hiring for the blue collar workers since the Nineteen eighties or what I was first there is a Cub Scout for president Ronald Reagan also another part I Want to make on wages\nNow our wages rising I had a pretty good taste\nBut the blue collar metal and service areas typically a little slower Chris ... actually raising faster than the white collar workers and I think this is the new face of the ... and they were I called blue collar workers and men and women who own their own small business is as I said\nThe incentive to change the president has ended the war on business he ended the war energy he ended the war and success is that the people just go out there and take a reputable got your back and that's exactly what's happening well\nHe may have started a war with the Federal Reserve e repeatedly called out the Federal Reserve this way for raising interest rates here's just one example of that\nI think the fed is for too stringent\nAnd they're making a mistake in the south right it's despite that we're doing very well but it's not necessary in my opinion and I think I Know about it better than they do\nBut Larry isn't that exactly what the fed is supposed to do when the economy is going strong to raise interest rates to prevent it from getting too hot and and using a spike in inflation and whatever happened to recognizing the independence or the Federal Reserve as presidents on for decades [noise]\nCouple of things I met 'em by the by there is no spiking inflation respectfully\nAnd I thought about what the fed does to try to prevent that when the economy is going strong and I don't want to see if I can look interest rates are two and a quarter percent they're not high\nWell that's true there's a normalization going I look at the president as a successful businessman\nCan investor knows a lot about these topics and he's given his opinion\nAnd his concern is that the fed might moved too quickly and might choke off the economic recovery which is now running three to four percent okay he's not impinging on that independence he didn't say I want you to change your plan he didn't say I want you to change their strategy you know the fact is that when he\nDecided he let others aren't necessarily didn't order it and you could argue we couldn't order but he did say all of those things he said I think there there are going crazy loco they're raising rates to hide did say that they're raising them to walk\nToo fast well that's an issue\nAgain but but he never sat through the fat change I Want you to change this or I Want you to change that he respects the feds independence and again what the president is raising here on the matter of interest rate timing and so for\nThose people are discussing those people on Wall street people in academia there's a whole lot of news articles summer Greece I disagree it's just way and there's nothing wrong with him weighing in I think the bigger picture is that look at\nThe White House the president the Federal Reserve everybody wants this economic boom to continue everybody wants to this building to continue everybody is cognizant\nOf ah the difficulties and the strategies that have to take part we're not giving away free money anymore but we're all ... all the similar mind on this just tip the boom going and\nI think that's what the president and saying I don't know can you speak his mind Chris\nWell presidents generally don't call out the fat or the fed chairman but let me move on to another subject a little mysterious disappearance of\nJournalists Jamal ... gay and concern is that he went into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nAnd was murdered the president said this week that he does not intend to impinge in any way on the hundred and ten billion dollar arms sales to the Saudis\nCustomary serve and touring the new ... says he's still plans to go to the economic conference in Riyadh this next week so as far as the Trump Administration is concerned it's business as usual with the Saudis\nWhile the president's son several times said look we want to prompt swift open transparent\nInvestigation I mean ... is a tragedy for ... and his family members as well as for everybody else\nTerrible thing so we don't know yet ah allegations are being made but we we withheld the uh our views the administration will be carefully carefully monitoring this week I think the president wants a very prompt resolution of what exactly happened\nAnd we'll see uh what actions are necessary I I should we find some results coming this week\nI regard insect mission I'm at the moment he is scheduled to go to a meeting and started that me by the way is about terrorists financing and how to stop it it's a very important meeting but he too I like the president will want to see\nHow things go and the Saudi investigation or the general investigation of the show the tragedy before he makes a final decision\nIn the interview we on sixty minutes tonight President Trump says if it turns out that show was murdered by the Saudis are there will be serious consequences take a look at us club [noise]\nMaybe especially show because this man was a reporter\nSomething you'll be surprised me say that there's something really\nTerrible and disgusting about that that were the case so we're gonna have to see we're going to get to the bottom of it and then we'll be severe punishment\nThe question is what kind of severe punishment if the hundred and ten billion dollar arms sales off the table and the president has made it clear he intends to go through with that with the Saudis what can you do\nWithin the Democratic party you see a couple of political figures they're trying to catch up there a couple of weeks behind the music ah corpus of Democratic Party is in a rage\nAnd they want to seem to be in a rage to they want to be make sure everybody knows they're part of the resistance to\nAh so that's where I think this is I don't think it's good politics I don't think the spectacle at the Capitol hearing in the demonstrations are surrounded it\nUm which got pretty ugly and pretty far outside your normal bounds or helpful to Democrats at all and you know this this Kavanaugh business was a very very big deal because it went on so long it was so conspicuous\nLet's remember in the middle of it to the New York times came out with a story a very long piece about Trump's pledge cheating on his taxes through the years\nIt without a without a without a sound practically so much so that a few days later the time to read it again and it still seems to have gotten no traction so that's how big a deal at the at at at is how much that the capital controls the ground things out and I think\nRepublicans will benefit from this into the midterms whether they can match the Democrats enthusiasm is entirely another matter I doubt that but then there's the Republicans in better shape because of it that\nYou can see the Republicans and the president certainly pushing this idea they're dangerous don't give a match to an arsonist their logo crazy a do it and forget the Republican talking points in your view do Republicans do Democrats take the risk of being seen as too extreme with the mob could that conceivably hurt them in the mid ...\nWell I take ... first\nSitting here as a Democrat I'm confused because prior to a few weeks ago I was the snowflake up

trying to out Trump Trump\nI think in twenty Nineteen that can be a real problem for the Democratic fail it real quick like are\nSo dumb move and I hope they keep it up and look at people who will decide why is it the the people who will decide this election are people who sort of like what Trump is doing but don't like how Trump is acting\nIn the last thing they want is for the next two years

come across that way that mob around those are the capital during Kavanaugh screaming and shouting into violence that people had been seen in our political system and there's there's protests All right let's let's go let's go throw paint\nOn the Republican headquarters in Manhattan and say that that is normal no it's not normal our politics has broken and the American people are going to decide they're gonna vote for Republicans than they should this fall because a Republican is going to say I'm going to go to Washington and try to find a way to make this thing work when you have any Democrat who says I'm going to go there and create problems\nFor the country by going after Trump people are sick of it\nAnd they want the Trump wouldn't be present well that was because you had a
