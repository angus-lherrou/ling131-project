through during this Kavanaugh's confirmation battle last night at the White House\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize\nTo Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who step forward to serve our country deserves a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception [noise]\nWhat happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness decency and

family and me to president thank you for everything more of\nJustice Kavanaugh last night in the East Room at the White House critics are saying that this began to take on the tone of a political rally\nArticle three of the constitution provides that the judicial power\nShelby vested in one Supreme Court the Supreme Court as an institution of law\nIt is not a partisan or political institution the justices do not sit on opposite sides of an idle\nWould you not caucus in separate rooms the Supreme Court as a team of nine and I will always be a team player on the team of non\nKavanaugh goes on to say that he's proud to be sitting in the seat that Justice Kennedy held\nTo me Justice Kennedy as a mentor\nOf friends and hero on the Supreme Court he was a model of civility including geology he fiercely defended the independence of the judiciary zealous ... guarded the individual liberties secured by the constitution\nJustice Kennedy established a legacy of liberty for ourselves and our posterity\nI Will always be humbled\nTo sit and Justice Kennedy's seat on the Supreme Court\n[noise] All right this is interesting the bond between clearly the bond between President Trump\nJennifer and justice capital has been strengthened um remember the controversy initially when he was selected Brett Kavanaugh the only person on that expanded list from the what the Heritage Foundation huh\nThat that had twenty five or judges well regarded or with records a arguably justice darling as a justice Brett Kavanaugh Kavanaugh the only one who has written down\nHe is a judicial position that a sitting president cannot be a indicted cannot be or the subject of a criminal investigation or is it just a coincidence that the president\nMr Trump selected\nThe one person who says the president can't be the subject of a criminal proceeding while he Trump is currently the subject of a\nOur going back to why Trump selected him in the first place left Trump and cabinet or bonded because they've been through a war to gather the left you just got think tactics to try to bring down\nThe nomination of Brett Kavanaugh and so maybe they're bonded because of that we can go through all the reasons why Trump might have chosen Kavanaugh or maybe didn't but at the bottom line is today on the Supreme Court is sitting justice Kavanaugh's who I think it's kind of interesting to note we'll be hearing his first cases today his daughter and his family will be sitting in the courtroom\nWatch and as a new member I don't know if you knew this but I thought it was kind of interesting as the newest member\nI think I Know what you're going to say they have a seat for them at the far end well the newest\nOne sit on the fire and so there'll be bookends essentially the two Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh but more even more interesting than that is that as the\nThe freshest that the freshman member of the Supreme Court if they are presenting together maybe in a private setting and someone comes to the door it's Brett Kavanaugh's job to answer the door whether someone's delivering coffee or maybe dropping off documents he's the one\nThat answers the door he's also the one it's almost like fraternity exactly what it is also the one who will take notes for the other justices sitting in a room so he definitely is the one that now has to kind of be the the page I guess the go get her to go for four altogether justices that the newest member Neil Gorsuch only had to do that for a couple of months he locked out\nLast night at the uh east through in the East Room of the White House President Trump apologize to Brett Kavanaugh and his family at a celebration of the swearing in of the newer Supreme Court justice President Trump continue to talk about\nA justice Kavanaugh's intellect and he is a description of Kevin ... is a brilliant scholar President Trump last night at the White House\nBrett Kavanaugh is a man of outstanding intellect a brilliant scholar\nAnd his credentials are an surpassed a graduate of both Yale College at Yale Law school he is taught at Harvard Yale and Georgetown\nWhen he's not working or with his family he's giving back to his community he spent twenty six years in public service and just like justice Gorsuch she clerked for Justice Kennedy\nFor the last twelve years Brett was a judge on the DC circuit court of appeals widely regarded as our nation second highest court\nDuring his tenure he authored over three hundred opinions distinguished by their masterful and impartial reasoning known as a

more as the morning continues does to justice Kavanaugh where he says the U.S Senate hearing tested him but it did not change him\nAmerica's constitution and laws protect every person\nOf every belief and every backgrounds every lead again the Supreme Court can be assured that I listen to their arguments with respect and an open mind every American can be assured\nThat I Will be an independent and impartial justice devoted to equal justice under law\nAlthough the ... Senate confirmation process tested me as it is tested others it did not change me\nMy approach to judging remains the same or good judge must be an umpire a neutral impartial decider who favors no lid again or policy a judge must be independent and must interpret the law not make the law\nA judge must interpret statute says written and the judge most interpret the constitution has written informed by history and tradition and precedence [noise] but they're in the wake of the Senate confirmation process [noise]\nSo I certainly think we represent the vast majority of California's reject John Cox

propositions that have passed where voters seven in fifty seven where\nVoters have voted a to diminish from felony status to misdemeanor sat at a certain crimes et cetera\nSo the issue of redemption for criminals are is an important one because California is a safe with a with a despite the overcrowding in the early release high number of people incarcerated in our state I Believe John Cox is the first candidate to take a crack at this issue I I Do believe\nIn redemption I I really do I think uh someone who is committed a crime that's why\nThis restored a justice project is so important because it record sales people offenders with their victims to make them understand what the effort is other victims but I think we ought to the public to make sure that we apply Pearl judiciously and

I I I don't have anything but the president of you guys conservatives would get upset when Obama would go around the world and apologized for America\nI get upset when when Trump apologizes to cabinet on behalf of me if I Want to apologize to judge Brett Kavanaugh I'll send them a week and do it\nBut you don't have the opportunity to do that so I think tried to have only will we process waiting to come so ugly of hoarding it was appropriate for the for President Trump in front of this man's family to offer an apology because of all the trauma they'd been through\nYou say I don't have no fake news of course had the opportunity to\nDo that I made him tonight or by having lunch with them you're going out for a beer\nMay well I Know he'd like that I don't drink I'm\nMaybe I'm a ... maybe I'm a little bit different but a what a root beer with them without ... but you said I said I could read 'em and you said I don't have the opportunity to do that of course I could\nNot going to go stand in front of them know you don't know Brett Kavanaugh I mean if you want to tweet in my maybe there's a way for you to do that but I think the main ... the the the point here is that this man's family has been through a lot whether you believe that he is what we'll do the accusations that were thrown out of your dumped his family's been through a lot\nAnd that's it it's hard that's hard for them to deal with and so for President Trump to say wow this process is the lowest of the low which people on both sides of the Iowa will agree this process was really hard it was hard to watch as a nation I think it's appropriate for the president to apologize is it possible\nThat a young and and when I get them re litigate the issue so we'll ask you this and we'll play the president from last night I ask you a for a brief answer is it possible that the behavior of young Brett Kavanaugh that his own behavior is what made this also ugly\nNo we have no evidence yet that's what I asked you is it possible if anything is possible Brian but you ... you and many people who still want to\nFeel the way you feel about this I understand and you have your rights you you can feel however you want well I haven't I Believe they would have no ... well okay that's fine but you know laugh at\nI Believe you I have no evidence and that's okay and like I told you I don't need you to believe me because I Know what happened but I'm also not going up on a national stage and by the way I could provide evidence because I actually told people about my incident\nAnd I could probably prove date and show you know hotel I could figure out when it was she a Ford was unable to do ...\nWell no she had a list of twenty people turned over to the FBI has to be interviewed to corroborate and not one of them was interviewing\nAnd she did they did talk just for people on our list that she specifically said read that party and no one could corroborate her story in fact one of them even said she'd never even met Brett Kavanaugh we that's that's the problem here is that there was no evidence\nWe won't debate it but the fact remains a I don't do offer any fake news not that you do twenty names were handed over a by a by a doctor or no\nFake news name she presented under oath were not able to corroborate her story and actually tells you he I in their investigation and they were offered money just wanted to change their story on Kavanaugh\nThe twenty people whose names were given we're not we're never contacted by the FBI\nLeland Kaiser is worse than that are saying you as I got to get to the audio mark judge the people that were apparently in the ... in the room or at the party have all denied that they even knew about and I said that\nTo me is it true that they gave twenty names that were ignored by the FBI\nDon't know I see I don't know I Want to know but I Know that you report names that have been discussed in in this we're talking about the FBI and we're also gave sworn testimony here president\nTrump last night at the White House in the East Room\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize\nTo Brett and the entire cover all family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who stepped forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception [noise]\nWhat happened to the cabinet or family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process [noise] our country a man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven\nGuilty [noise]\nHave you with that I must say that use are\nUnder historic scrutiny were proven innocent thank you\nThank you for joining us we do have some breaking news here on the morning after that's the president last night or in the East Room celebrating justice Brett Kavanaugh breaking news Nikki Haley has resigned as\nThe UN ambassador she's expected to speak at seven thirty in the morning our time that'll be Fifteen minutes from now or we will cover that live of course that is a surprising story that is not a rumor that I had heard\nA recently Nikki Haley resigning as UN ambassador I'll offer a little speculation here and say maybe she's resigning to take a more important post\nShe discussed resignation with Trump last week when she visited him at the White House according to sources are new shocked a number of foreign policy officials in the Trump Administration are obviously she was easily confirmed is probably one of the most popular members of Trump's cabinet\nWe interrupt this program with breaking news ass right Nikki Haley resigning\nFrom her post as US ambassador to the United nations more details and a ambassador Haley will speak for herself or coming up at about Fifteen twenty minutes live coverage here on the morning answer like going on here all of a sudden on a Tuesday it's seven Fifteen\n'cause you're in the morning\nMinutes till the tech we have a class at Downton valley and look out for this one in four or five heading downtown ...\nIt has the carpool lane and claimed votes locked and everything but it sounded like ... ... they were able to clear back on the way they came up and brand on the ... found a voluntary all highway and tell us out of the way it does point but overall you're going to be slowing on fifty seven coming out of time in my friends have pulled out\nNow they have all the way over the twenty ... film I unfortunately that together I mean that a fact that after the quake on at night and the Kennedy went down just after young now and\nThey voted tar involved as well of course to clean up are going on all things are blocked off the taking off topic off of the freeways are now and then the minds are pretty much stolen from my parents [noise] and this happened before that and I thought if I had the authorities in the parking down on\nOr being forced out in an adversarial situation because of the criticism she's offered drawn\nA publicly and maybe behind the scenes or is she\nBeing promoted within the administration and of course to be promoted you first have to resign as US ambassador Rapp which he's expected to make official a just a few short\nMinutes so this is pure speculation I my my on my part but this is what we do when we don't have a secular isn't my speculation as well because of the speculation part knowing Trump like I we tromp right we collectively know him as our president\nI don't believe that if this was something adversarial if this was something where he's forcing her out that he would invite her to the oval office to appear before cameras and allow the press pool and to make an announcement and I don't believe he would refer to her as my friend on Twitter\nHave you seen just as recently as this morning the number of the of the polling numbers that show real gender gap when it comes to men and women female support for President Trump is at a very low low right\nBut I still think that if if he was trying to push route it would just say I've accepted her resignation and we're moving on they would try to minimize the story and then the press would try to blow it up\nThe administration would try to minimize it seems to me\nMore like something that is that that is calculated and that is a move that they were expecting in that maybe they've coordinated could keep in mind Nikki Haley moved it took her kids out of high school in South Carolina to move to New York city to become UN ambassador and so I think to make that move I don't think she'd be quick to run away after committing like that\n[noise] beer fridge breaking news Nikki Haley is resigning as US ambassador to the un\nShe will explain why along with President Trump coming up in a few minutes you will hear live coverage of what they have to say on them\nAnd I answer Californians

more intense right here on the morning after\nEight Seventy feet you know I'm sure it's like [noise]\nJennifer Horn is funny mark\nBeautiful advisors Brian [noise] booze\nThe morning after thanks for joining us on your Tuesday Morning answered turning out to be a busy Tuesday Morning with some breaking news for\nNikki Haley is resigning her post and the un she is the U.S ambassador to the United nations she was appointed by President Trump shortly after his election and twenty sixteen before his election and twenty sixteen and even after\nHe was sworn in as president she has been someone not afraid to vocalizing criticism\nOf President Trump but she is so professional so well liked in fact there's a poll of the Jennifer and I talked about here on the radio maybe a month and a half ago or two months ago that identified UN ambassador now former UN ambassador Nikki Haley a as a um\nAs the most popular member of the administration\nUh we don't know we don't know where the president has made some remarks you a ... a those remarks are taped and then that tape of the president's comments is released and as soon as it is released you will hear it here on the morning after we don't know why Nikki Haley is leaving the un\nAh some think about sickness maybe a and the president's tone and the president's tweet or the president's announcement a indicates is too positive\nFor this to be a tumultuous breakup absolutely was who wants to positive for it to be an announcement of sickness that it's forcing her to resign\nThat could be too I definitely all indications are that she's like he's letting her leave for some reason whether that's to promote or somewhere else or to give her time according to again you mentioned the pool and that's right the remarks have already been made by the president were now just waiting for them to come to be released to the media once that happens\nWe'll have them for you but so far what we've heard from those comments is that that President Trump called Nikki Haley very special has said she's done an incredible job and he also mentioned that to Nikki Haley asked him about six months ago mentioned that she wanted to depart the administration at the end of the year that you need some time\nAfter after the year comes to a close ... ever that me and could she be pregnant um she's forty six so I mean there's always the I mean there's always a possibility I don't know about that I Would\nAre mounting to start a family or under another circumstance\nI wouldn't ... does she have a family for ... oh yeah no she has a husband but the kids in high school in fact that that's what I just said she moved him to\nTo New York out of high school students at forgive me ... and that she actually a very famous story about Nikki Haley taking this position at the un she said it wouldn't be fair for her to take her kid out of high school in South Carolina and moved to New York\nFor her career that her son said mom absolutely not we're doing mess and gave her the thumbs up it okay to move to New York so\nNikki Haley a prior to serving the Trump Administration and serving America as US ambassador to the un ah she Nikki Haley was the governor of South Carolina very successful I Believe she left that post with the with very high approval numbers I think they really like her in South Carolina\nA that is her home again we don't know if a her separation here here's the unknowns which will be\nWhich will be a solve these questions will be answered a very shortly here just stay tuned to the morning after with Brian and Jennifer AM eight Seventy LA Orange County and our friends in the ... on a um five Ninety here's what's on them\nUh it's unknown if Nikki Haley's departure from her post at the un\nIs under adversarial conditions are that are ... with the Trump Administration that it's possible that's on them uh it's unknown if she is leaving the un posed to take a higher position in the Trump Administration\nIt's a known if she's going into the private sector to make a ton of money to make a comeback at some point in the future to run for president herself\nIn twelve years she'll still only be fifty eight\nSo this woman has a very bright future in politics he's well liked well credentialed\nHas a great resume I like it very much personally or don't know personally but personally I have I I I I feel like I like her she's a likable character like her yet she is likeable thank you her persona her demeanor I think she's very professional I guess we're pretty close to getting the\nAnnouncement from President Trump here we're definitely going to have to uh let folks are no when this happens here on the morning after when this tape comes over from President Trump one\nThing we do know we don't know if Nikki Haley is going to be making comments alongside President Trump but we do know that she's there\nThat she's at the White House and uh that she was in the oval office with the president and said she confirmed to pull reporters that she is not running and twenty twenty two kind of squash the rumors that uh that this is Lee and that she's leaving to primary Trump and a couple of years\nRight so we're waiting remarks from President Trump following Nikki Haley's a resignation or we initially thought that the tube that might be sitting together we're not going to see the president and I don't think you'll see them actually okay a ... well on the way they are not on the radio\nBut got some pretty good powers on the radio we won't see him but uh we understood that maybe Nikki Haley would be sitting with the president or in the oval office but I'm beginning to think now that that's not the shut up\nShe's definitely there we just don't know if she's going to be speaking as well\nOkay again awaiting remarks from President Trump following the resignation of Nikki Haley who has been the U.S ambassador to the United nations uh she has resigned a there are very few secrets that are well kept in Washington DC and the age of leaks and information\nOf being shared that shouldn't be shared or word of termination or word of of exits or or promotions leaking out ahead of time of this was one where that did not happen if came across a just over thirty minutes ago that Nikki Haley had resigned that she'd issued her resignation\nThat it has been accepted by President Trump\nAnd are in this press pool announcement from President Trump in the oval office we expect because we see little bits and pieces of it because apparently it's already been taped the president will speak briefly about hurricane Michael which is ready to\nHit Florida pretty hard and then the president gets right into the issue of Nikki Haley we just don't know of the content of what he will say about her exit from her post at the un\n... is the one that broke this story behind their political website they were the first to report the resignation just a few minutes ago according to ...\nTo their website President Trump told reporters this morning that Nikki Haley\nRaised the possibility of taking a break six months ago and that she's welcome back at any time into his administration Haley for her part told reporters and confirmed that she has no twenty twenty ambitions and will be happy to campaign for President Trump again in the next elections okay\nSo uh sounds like this is not adversarial\nA you wonder if there was like I say uh you know it happens all the time it happens in business all the time if you see a press release are you saying announcement that are for example uh I'll use Jennifer Horn as an example okay you use it the announcers go something like this okay Jennifer Horn is leaving her position\nAs a co host of the morning after with a Brian ... any falls into a deep depression he falls into a deep depression\nA Jennifer's resigning to uh start her own show which will be hurt on so and so it's such and such and such such oftentimes the positive step up\nIs married to the exit announcement sure right and that's done for the benefit of the person in motion\nAnd they're right now we are not getting that to and Haley actually don't forget that just a few weeks ago in September Nikki Haley wrote an op ed for the New York times she wrote an op ed in response to that anonymous op ed about forces at work and the Trump Administration ... trying to prevent\nDestruction that would be a you know pending doom if President Trump had his way and she said something that I think is is worth saying here she said quote I don't agree with the president on everything\nWhen there is a disagreement there is a right way and a wrong way to address it I pick up the phone and call him or meet with him in person and quote she has been one of the people in the administration who has been able\nTo disagree with the president but she does it to his face she doesn't go and she doesn't really get out to the news organizations she doesn't try to slip it out\nTo the media she actually addresses are issues with the president she's been very straightforward and I believe that's why he has this respect for her that obviously will allow her to come back into the administration or maybe even be promoted at some time in the future\nYeah it really is interesting for all the flack President Obama asked for being late for his media events you know they'd say Obama's candidate seven thirty and then at eight Fifteen they'd show up this Trump but I Know that it's just a fact because as what we do for a living as we covered this breaking news uh Trump lately is always late teens\nEarly ... but he's not late now though he's already recorded the comments are already in the can they just haven't been released jet\nI Can't imagine what the delay would be for the media\nOr to get this on the air awaiting remarks from President Trump\nA remarks made to press pool inside the oval office in the White House where last night in the East Room he along with justice Brett Kavanaugh and the Kavanaugh family a celebrated the swearing in of justice Kavanaugh he is now a Supreme Court justice\nThanks for joining us on your Tuesday Morning answer AM eight Seventy LA Orange County am five Ninety in the eye he the breaking news uh breaking right now is that Nikki Haley has resigned as US ambassador\nTo the United nations are inside the oval office with President Trump\nTaped a few moments ago the tape is just coming out now a a a a press pool announcement where the president announces with very few details wind Nikki Haley is leaving the administration Nikki Haley says it has been the honor of her life\nOr to serve as US ambassador to the un and to serve her country uh she says she is most proud of the last two years and what has been accomplished she calls America strong again sing all Americans should be proud there is no announcement\nOf a future post or a future position just moments ago President Trump in the oval office I imagine sitting to his right he is Nikki Haley now the former U.S ambassador to the United nations President Trump this morning moments ago I wanted to\nDo this because politically\nOf the United nations has been very special to me she's done an incredible job [noise] she's a fantastic person very important but you also\nIs somebody that gets it and she has been\nAt the United nations from the beginning with the from the beginning\nAnd work with us so they can pay has been really along kind of very intense and she told me probably six months ago she said you know\nMaybe at the end of the year the end of a two year period but the other day you're going to take a little time off a little but she's been a very successful you know governor of South Carolina\nFor years and then she uh\nShe did this and this is possibly even more in tune with what's going on in the world is very dangerous thing a lot of things which is a fantastic job but we've done a fantastic job together we've solved a lot of problems or one of the process of selling a lot of problems at the beginning uh North Korea was a massive\nMoving along with it alone [noise]\nReally nicely I can speak for\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo is things in the world of nicotine and the and so we're all we're all happy for you and one way to lose your health for you to come back if someone\nA is it it'd be a difference of fast food and everything but uh I just want to let you know so at the end of the year Nikky will be leaving home there will be gotten in touch I Know that we're going to be out of there there is you're going to go\nAll the players and I was doing the thing I think she did this the United nations she got to know the players she got to know China Russia India she knows everybody at our very first day basis and they're like except for maybe a couple of\nLikely but they do they really like editing maybe more importantly there is a factor and so they just wanted to tell you that uh we will miss you or at least we can all the time but we'll let you know the city of do the job but I Want to say the governing\nA breaking news here on the morning answer Nikki Haley's resignation from the Trump Administration and her post as US ambassador to the un in the oval office just moments ago with President Trump\nOr the president announced that she's leaving here's the full statement made by Nikki Haley again a but we're not hearing is where she's moving to or what she's going on to a well let ah the ambassador former ambassador speak for herself and analyze this as we continue\n[noise] well I Want to say on the first of all I Want to paint\nYou know allowing us to come out and talk to\nIt has been an honor and a lifetime mate you know I said\nLeave the stage that way\nReally been a blessing and I want to thank you for that\nWith the United states on foreign policy now\nThey know that if we think we're going to do something we fall when the president for that whether it was with the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was NATO saying that other countries have to pay their share it with her but at the trade deals were given amazing they get\nTired of means that that and they followed through\nGuessing ten years at the last one\nThree billion and the un fight\nAnd we got an arms embargo which was a long time\nGreen North Korean sanctions\nWhich we're the largest and generation done in a way that we can really work for\nOn the head of the Iran deal bringing attention to the world that every country needs to understand you can't overlook all of the bad thing
