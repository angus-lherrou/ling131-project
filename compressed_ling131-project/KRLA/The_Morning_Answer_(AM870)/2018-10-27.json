K. L. A. A. uh eight Seventy the answer and Ninety nine point five gay Kayla\n[noise]\nThis is a segment we take phone calls so we've got great cause all on the midterm elections we're going to get right\nTo them but I wanted to address the too close Senate races right now or in the country eleven days after the midterms and we're going to go right to your phone calls those are in Arizona and Nevada let's start in Arizona State\nOr this is an open seat because of the the passing of Senator John McCain tell us about uh the two candidates they're both both members of Congress\nYes right Martha ... versus ... I I'm I'll be honest with you I think this is going to come down to one issue in the state of ... of Arizona that immigration and border security there is a very big divergence between the two candidates ah Martha ... closely aligned with President Trump on his efforts to secure the border and then work on an overall solution\nHere since cinema just quite frankly is not and I think that has been the driving force of of really having the numbers move Martha ... way a matter of a month ago it looked like a two three four point advantage for cure some cinema\nAnd now it looks like Martha ... ended up by about a winter to uh the early numbers there as far as registration sure do look like they're favoring her up again Jordan go back globally this is one of the two Republican seats the Democrats absolutely have to have if they were to take majority\nYeah I mean so again this is these are important races and they are down there within the margin of error\nEither candidate to win a but there's some momentum going behind the Republicans right now I take a listen this is just interesting the Democratic candidate congressman a cinema uh she said this in a radio show this is coming back to haunt are a bit by thirty three\nNow I don't buy more as an individual if I Want to go fight in the Taliban army I go over there or not you know I'm I'm fighting for the Taliban that I'm so I guess personal decision and I guarantee that\n[noise] I mean I don't know why she said something like that find it I don't care if you go fight for the Taliban but as a member of Congress and then she says this about her own state by thirty for speaking to the very liberal this year that route station just a couple of months ago\nAnd that they have a lot of stories of democracy and then my hair is on that score and in\n\nHad that line and they have out here and it's out of hand\nYou know that's not funny if you're running for\nThat to be sitting there in your state where you've got to issue serious stuff like that just to please a crowd um so I get that is coming back um and I know that those those bikes are being used\nAnd said speeches are being used to remind people that just to these people are just so many times they have the Senate candidates they tried to change who they are less finally get to the vet and then it gets these phone calls the vet a Dean Heller is Republican incumbent are facing a challenge from a Democrat Rosen or what does it look like they're\nYeah Jacky Rosen a congresswoman from Nevada again and this was one of the the states the Democrats are really focused on early on they thought they had a great job to flip the seat just under ... numbers were down a little bit\nA door and I think President Trump is actually played a big role in this state as well\nOr the turnout for Dean Heller are the numbers have turned around and it looks like he's got about a two point lead there again a lot of national dollars are going to flow into the state Jordan I think Dean Heller is in a better position than Jacky Rosen is again it's one it's a state that Democrats have to have if they have the majority so if you're in Nevada you're going to be inundated with ads over these last eleven days\nOkay we've got lots of calls [noise] try to keep your comments as short as possible so we can get to all of them let's start with Joe in North Carolina on line one Joe welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nYes um I mean it's an apartment complex in North Carolina I've been asking her as that's you know are you feeling your vote and then we found two Democrats say they're still going to vote Democrat are the ones that's told me they're Democrats or at least fifty all\nSaid after the cabinet thing they just can't vote Democrat\nEither that is an interesting point right there I think that I Want to get as many causes possible but I think we cannot forget the effect that Kavanaugh a behavior by the Democrats\nReally is what started this Republican beginning of the I I wouldn't say the red wave yet but a comeback for Republicans not just in the Senate especially in the city but also potentially in the house as well which we can get to it later show because there's a lot to talk about there as well focusing on the Senate today\nEleven days out back to the phones we go but I Do think Kavanaugh it was it was the beginning of this Republican kind of resurgence in uh the mid term elections or along with President Trump hitting the campaign trail again are doing what he does best surely and Michigan on line to surely welcome to Jay secular live\nIn a couple of minutes go for that one state that to be the soccer and I think that could be Michigan ... up against Debbie Stabenow kick it three weeks ago he was sick will point ... ... ... ... some competitive area the they're evil or when\nHe is a rock star if you have any ...\nFather once in Michigan ... website and definitely tell I I come with several people already just telling about him that are killed you vote for him so we we need to talk ... with our friends and neighbors and make them aware he had a wonderful ...\nThis was a lot of military experience right there and again was twenty points down just six weeks ago is surging right now and Michigan states that President Trump did carry I I agree with\nSurely I think there's going to be a shocker was on my list with Bob Menendez remember Donald Trump won Michigan Debbie Stabenow should be able to win that state but John James has run a terrific a campaign but I won't be surprised at all to wake up and twelve days and find out that John James ...\nA stab at all or imminent as losing for Democrats would just be historic for Republicans I Will put it that way those would be one of those two soccer's I think um maybe maybe both of the people we could have too shocking states let's keep going Billy in New Jersey on line three are really welcome to Jay secular life\nIf I Want to thank you guys for all the work ... here in my ... all the time\nUm yeah I Do I I'm a Republican in nature and yet I mean personally I was shocked when Chris Christie one um but when it came right on the ballot here in New Jersey there's not even a Republican candidate and a lot\nAnd I think you know that your hands you know when we had a ... that ran on the farm out turning New Jersey and with sanctuary gate Rachel is that he actually won okay Chris Christie is that there is a cook lay Republicans stops but it's not going to happen and I\nI I think so and I think that's right but you do have this ah to give you some hope I get you I've lived in states\nAnd cities where there are no Republican options no concern of options before a and a and it's disappointing but you've got a statewide race there that is very serious or was this a surging candidate against Bob Menendez let's mission that one more time than just quickly for people\nWill this last week has been beautiful I mean everything we've been talking about on the show together I'm Talking about this for weeks now waiting for the opportunity to see the markets correct and come back down and as a result what happens starting off at the end of last week into this week as we got everybody's wish that\nThe market started coming down it comes down three times faster than it goes up and a lot of our students were taught that once that market goes down you could actually make money shorting the market it's called shorting where you're actually selling in the market\nAs opposed to most people who buy the markets so a lot of our students shift from that fear of oh my God the market's going down I don't know what to do I'm going to lose money to well I can actually learn how to make money if the markets go down it's simply doing what the banks do\nBig banks are always out there to make money when the markets go up down sideways and with a lot of our students seeing we tell them is do you see how this would benefit you by learning how to trade in more than just one direction\nYeah and when you look at even the difference between let's even just say a mutual fund versus a hedge fund and the mutual fund is generally just investing into a long position\nAnd they called a mutual funds 'cause it's this joint effort between us and the financial institution but it only makes money as the markets are going up but it doesn't mean that strategy is never useful now that product is never useful that's not what I'm trying to get out here\nBut as it is going down those ones are generally losing money and we're paying fees to be involved there to be invested into that fund you look at the hedge fund type strategy and and that word head just pretty critical because hedge is meaning that there is a position that propped on the way up and there's also protection or even a position to make a profit on the way down\nThere so when you start looking at things as far as the market's going there's multiple directions in the market the up down on the sideways\nIt's critical to make sure that we have strategies kind of liked that hedged mentality that can make money if the markets are going up down or sideways and you're one of the things I talked about or one of my classes a long time ago was or wasn't imagine if you went to work then they said hey you know what\nWe really like yeah you're a great candidate we think you'd be a great fit for the company\nBut you can expect to be laid off one third of the time one third of the time we're not going to pay a you know and that's really what happens if we're only trading any bullish direction anytime the markets are going sideways our retirement account or income account is laid off\nHe died in the markets are going down a retirement account or income account as his laid off not to not to even bring up the fact that maybe it's it's deteriorating a little bit especially as the markets are going down but what are the things that we can do is always okay with you Larry one of the things that we can do is we have a big stack of tickets right here we are just kicking the show off we've got a bunch of tickets we can give away\nAnd we can help a few people out there get started\nBecoming more consistent in the market by by doing a quick little give away for these passes that are too are half the class is what do you say let's do it\nAll right well right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThey have to take classes while you'll see exactly what it takes to be more consistent in the market making money generate more income as the market's going up down or sideways

time\nAny financial education scenario rather than maybe on social media or watching TV sounds like a good investment\nTo me well just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of these passes or one of the half the class is a good show bones ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over included with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight seven seven four zero three eight seven to three that's eight seven seven four zero three eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nLarry's we stay on kind of this consistency track ... consistency conversation I should say\nYou know you talked a little bit of a a little bit about shorting and that is a great opportunity to make to make money as the markets are going down water some of the other ways that people can diverse into different directions you know we hear diversification as far as I Do have a little commodities have little stocks have little bonds but how 'bout diversification as far as different directional vehicles go\nWell you can always sit here and say we know that when the markets go down there's usually people pulling out of the market so the Martin money's going somewhere either go into gold it can go into bonds the cool thing that our students learn here as it doesn't matter your background your age what you've done before\nWe teach them how to read a chart so it's a stock charter bond short gold shark they're able to start learning how to trade in the beauty of learning what shorting is is that again a lot of people have been told their whole lives when the markets go down to\nThat thing will last February Goldman Sachs may two hundred million dollars in one day by simply shortening the market\nNow that day imagine that we just have a little piece of it I'm not going to be greedy\nYou know but if you start to learn how to treat like the banks do then it's amazing and all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make you money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a little bit later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the market to always go up it's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou had to go in a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you know it's a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place and he simply had all the tools to get you there faster so a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it to be coming\nTo actually ... they don't care if it goes up down or sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they could create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter where the markets go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car and there's so many so many other analogies that we could pull into this that in in I always say in real life you know outside of the are investing life\nIn our normal everyday life we there's no way we buy a car that didn't go in reverse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit you know it's it's the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education and where was your stock picking class where it was how to balance a checkbook class write them\nA check but I just dated myself victory over there but it is it\nTrue that I mean we we really didn't have that stuff and so we're left to to rely on the quote unquote professionals truly guide us through this process where unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions and I say unfortunately kind of tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that\nThat's what they do for a living your real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to it was up to the individual to make sure that they're buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it\nThe broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing but when it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world\nHasn't ... they spend more time analyzing the menu when they go out to dinner\nThan they do analyzing what investments to to select it it just puts us behind the eight ball and it's something that I think if we did a quick give away with a few more of these passes we could probably make a dent in and help people start making better investment decision I think it's a great idea let's do it All right well right now I've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThey have to classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to generate more consistent income in the market\nUnderstand how the market works I understand what the risks are involved with a lot of different investments out there and early how to capitalize capitalize on the upside down and have to classes about three hours

like in any other\nBusiness and any other walk of life the skill is something that we that we really have to at first and I always tell everybody if you're looking for a big get rich quick

[noise]\nWelcome back if you're just tuning in us Larry Jacobs and director of a structure developments half instructor it online trading I'm usually shed some light on multiple things have been a little bit about half of income we talked a little bit about active\nIncome and then specifically spent a lot of time on that multiple streams of income side of things in the financial freedom that that can really generated I Love the ... the the conversation about the the average millionaire having five plus dreams of income\nAnd you can break that down into different directions but but even the whole conversation we're having a few minutes ago Larry about about building the skill first the skill comes first the income comes later in so many times we want the income\nWe want the income now without the skill right how many how many times have you talked to a a a surgeon and they said oh you know what I'm going to do a little bit of surgery here I'm In a practice heart surgery so that I can pay for medical school and then develop the skill just doesn't really work that way we've got to have the skill first otherwise that operating table can be a dangerous spot to be laying\nNow unfortunately it ends up being that same\n... that same conversation when it comes to our money and I had somebody say oh well this isn't life or death\nBut really when we're talking about our finances it is our financial life or death so we really want to take this just as seriously you work too hard for this money\nTo have it not heading in the right direction on a consistent basis and this retirement money that we want to talk about in this segment is exactly that it's in a situation where we're usually just buying every other friday right just 'cause it's payday and we've been told every other friday we're just supposed to put the money and our retirement accounts\nAnd it will just slowly growing and well that's true in a polish marketing a bearish market which was what you were just touching on his right as we are going to break that kind of detrimental side of things we can continue to buy into assets that are deteriorating\nAnd it's a lot like lighting our retirement accounts on fire or at least a little portion of our paycheck\nWhen we're throwing it into a deteriorating asset so just a few of the things that we want to want to keep in mind and one of the things I really love to have you Larry shed some light on in here because\nWe do have a lot of our students who are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talked to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know our number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right and that's really that point you were getting at a before he took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of giving you the floor here to take that back over border some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nAnd the number one mistake that most people may cause they can do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education shall we start talking to our students about is how they can start creating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement\nRight now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week a lot of my friends call me and he started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous now one student emailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years\nFor another market correction why because historically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen so what's now becoming more important than ever\nIs it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now or you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you in a lot of our students come in the door really nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade\nOther asset types like futures in St Louis and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts\nSo again a lot of people first thing they always say is well I got the mortgage I got the kids' college up on\nTheir retirement always comes last shall we start to teachers students right out of the gate\nThat they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly\nWhat you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learning how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you'll have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else who's telling you what you need\nYou you're talking about the kind of the cycles that the markets go through the big ups and the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that as you go back and look at um how often\nThey're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of the average uh that we can expect is about fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you\nKind of measure that you got about a fifty percent drum Becky ... about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty say the same thing and so if we come to here we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about uh we uh we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about dropping accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIt somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account\nAnd they lost fifty thousand and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value of that fifty thousand and that happened in one year and that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total right that happened in pretty much just a year it went down\nWhen they take that average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we're talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nAnd number two they never do go back to do the education because they've blown up the money that they had\nSo what do good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey realized in the twenty first century that they can take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptop\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named B or and he's in San Diego and a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is being done this and has left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations and family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting as we're as we're sitting here talking about kind of the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally received a text message from a dear friend of mine\nAnd it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps you go through it very very first conversations these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake you just ski travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow ski saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... because if\nI go up to Salt Lake I usually just bum a pair of skis for him and rather than the hall in mind around but it it's just there's just so much freedom\nThat can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that that poor is just the state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and they're so useful and and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got and if we are completely satisfied with where we are then then great let's continue to do what made us so happy and the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to create a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedoms we have a specific goal\nThat we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to\nWe have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather share with me\nOh I've growing up he would hold up his five fingers and I would have to name all of them the first one is no your business the second one is be converted\nThat converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down is is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary and and and in the beginning and that was the one I was kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became\nThe most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal that were after that one of the things we can do to help a few people get started with this as we've still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now I've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThat they classes where you see exactly where it takes to really take control of the finance has really

there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always like to say and I said earlier on the show is doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you could reach that financial freedom goal that you're after\nThat what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have your bags and bags loads of these these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place that are now in another\nWell the first thing we always understand here is that with trading it's simply a transfer of money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing and what's really sad is people will get themselves stuck to think about this time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year in your come after the holiday season again we're gonna start seeing all these Jim commercials again right cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear our students say over and over again is beside wishing haven't had more time was\nThis is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation again if you're a coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came in my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica\nAnd so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great to send me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole another piece of it people go on vacation Ryan right and they decorate the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you are you trained before or after college she goes\nBefore of course and I love that of course\nYeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago they did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kinda fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great to after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection it doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities and that's really what we introduce you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that inside of the half the class and we are\nPretty much at the end of the show but before we end what do you think we do know that give away yeah let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here oh right right now we've got to have to a class coming up in your area and

story is called the ugly truth about Tom sure if you think you've done your family fiber by buying a timeshare you need my help hello I'm shocked McDowell CEO and founder of Wesley financial\nAwesome this huge this is making waves in the medical and vitamin world because it's taking natural repeat natural human growth hormone science to the next level helping increase our own HGH to a degree that no one of the supplement has ever\nTouch absolutely and that's because it's designed for each gender we finally have the science the natural ability to safely increase the women's youth hormone and the men's with two different formulations and it's helping reverse aging symptoms to a degree even doctors never thought was possible\nThat's often okay so let's talk more about this new supplement and we're going to do that in a bit but first isn't HGH bad\nI think there's a lot of confusion about it many feel HGH has just for body builders and pro athletes or it's for making cows pretty with ... which is not true it's absolutely good and vibrant for our health\nIt maintains bodily functions like our metabolism energy tissue repair muscle growth and brain function throughout life\nNow HGH has been found to be the key and feeling decades younger\nHowever the HGH injections are controversial because it's a hormone and although it has powerful benefits it can cause side effects okay but so there is no hormones in the G H ... no no hormones it's all natural\nLove that so let's talk about what the G H R platinum will do for us but first why are we aging and why are we getting old well there\nAre many factors but one major reason is due to the decline of our youth hormone known as HGH\nOkay so briefly for those that don't know what is HGH\nHGH stands for human growth hormone\nAlthough most of those older adults still have it\nIt has its highest peak when we're young then growing into adulthood mhm are young bodies absolutely why when those HGH levels were high\nBecause it enabled us to have so much energy as kids and we didn't know what to do with it all and our metabolism works so remarkably well we could eat tons of calories even junk food McDonald's whatever we wanted and we could still have a fit body\nWe build muscle easily we slept deeply we bounce back from injuries fast yeah beautiful skin\nYeah and I used to eat tons of ice cream and French fry a boy I miss that being able to eat all that stuff so what happens all that\nWell I'll tell you what happens after we've physically stopped growing usually around the age of twenty five ... our growth hormone level drops significantly and then immediately we start to age and get old\nOkay so this decline of the growth hormone is really known as the beginning of the aging process right\nNow they're dropping growth hormone sends a negative domino effect throughout the entire body and usually in our early thirties and we start feeling that ripple effect I mean we may start off with just a few wrinkles and then some excess fat right and we lose energy our hair are eyesight and\nOur quality of sleep lessons we simply slow down and this affects all of this research shows that the lower the growth hormone the Bastrop person ages inside and out\nOkay so if you're middle aged ... like me about how much of the youth hormone have we lost about eighty percent oh jeez eighty percent so if I lost nearly ... percent of my youth hormone at my age I feel like I'm thirty just an older body\nWell you're you're not alone Jody this is sure okay about one third of all adults forty five years and over not only have low growth hormone but are extremely deficient\nWhile okay you know that's scary because it seems like the deficiency of HGH it's completely out of our control so there is there anything that we can do to reverse\nThat absolutely we are now living in a time where we can naturally and safely restore our own growth hormone and start reversing aging symptoms immediately by replenishing what our body loses as we age\nAnd you've been doing this through your ultimate anti aging supplement called G H R platinum for over a decade aren't Christian radio stations across the country but now your research team just took the natural restoration of HGH to a higher level\nYes and we're very excited about this we released a new advanced formula called G H R platinum for men and G H R platinum for women which is the only natural HGH complex made for each gender for optimal result\nOkay so we're talking about two different formulas one for men and now one for when and why is this important\nWells because men and women are different and they age differently ... our body compositions and hormones are different than the aging symptoms we want to help with different as well right so the G H R platinum for men not only naturally increases HGH\nBut also has a testosterone and sexual libido enhanced her belly fat burner muscle booster and ingredients for healthy person\nThat has a lot of great stuff so this one product addresses almost every concern that males have that's incredible\nAnd now the G H R platinum for women is the only natural HGH release her in the world made specifically for the feminine body\nAnd we added a hormone balance your body fat burner wrinkle reduce your cortisone regulator to relieve stress and a beauty complex that promotes

mainstream from\nFor promoting beauty from within as the capital but here in North America people just aren't as familiar with it but but listen to that it has to fix\nThe human studies validating its advocacy and as a pharmacist there really caught my attention and this trend is not something that you can't get enough of\nAn diet it's founded fan and but you really have to eat a lot of than like five pounds\nTo get a good daily shows as much as I said I Love\nSalmon but I'm not going that far ah Jerry I didn't know that there were sixty plus human clinical studies in this specific natural

car better or use the computer more comfortably and may come on how does this happen\nIt does sound funny but after that fact may actually help in these areas to it and here's why one of the interesting things about after that then is that it's a relative of vitamin a and we know that vitamin is good for our eyes get for vision after that that is to ask than that it's actually been shown\nTo fight oxidation and I to issue a scientist at a study where they found a forty six percent\nImprovement in measurement called depth perception that that perception that third delivery to

that after that that helps reduce ice tea and you know when you're on a computer that's a big deal everyone's on computer these days for long periods of time and and it's hard on our eyes and we know
