FBI or investigation background\nCheck take what I mean I I I've been waiting to see some some good polling that hasn't really come out yet or looking at where where people banned it looked like the country is divided but Republican given how the Democrats are already energized for the midterm election\nAnd Republicans were little apathetic I think on hold a slightly benefits Republicans especially when it comes to hold the Senate\nBut I don't I I'm not talking about I think this is a seminal moment for the country they cannot allow this you know that a young journalist was attacked on Twitter yesterday for allegedly having committed a sexual assault\nOr in college and I'm not repeating who it is or what I think it's been removed but that's the new McCarthyism Josh everyone will be vulnerable to this\nI I think you make a very good point Andrew Sullivan had I had a very good at college in New York magazine\nBasically emphasizing that point that you know due process and we have to process even if it's not a legal trial like the the\nPresumption of innocence a very very important standard I think that liberals make them ... you know write them questions about cabinet testimony is credibility a comment about drinking and atomic about a year but in in the hearing but I also think that we can make it\nYour first question that leave it in Port that testimony as well we really\nDon't know I think this FBI investigation looking at the time to figure out you know the\nTalking with people who are out there so legit party a twenty five years ago that might actually maybe give a little bit of clarity and may help us trying to figure out what actually happened but ultimately I think it's more likely we kind of a week from now are just as confused and just as a I'm sure what actually\nHappened then we were my my reporting is that Mitch files for cloture tonight then that the cloture vote will be Wednesday and a final vote on Thursday because the FBI investigation is not that difficult to do not that many witnesses to speak to you have any other reporting on that\nUh you you're reporting is ahead of mine so I mean that sounds like it I mean I Know they want to get up at the one we give them back type table and there's a limited number of witnesses limited scope of this investigation so I think they want to get this done sooner rather than later but you know as you\nRemember hearing Democrats are raising questions about how many people have guidelines interview after they buy them leave out able to investigate it are they going to be obstructed him\n[laughter] and I and by the way filing for cloture doesn't mean that the FBI investigation Spanish it just means that they expected to be finished by Wednesday and that is six days after and there are I think max\nSix or seven witnesses and they've already all filed statements and so there is just they're just as much to review here and Dr forwards testimony is has been summarized by the council for the Republican than adequately distributed Josh cross our thank you my friends like all of you for listening a\nThis the answer with\nFor joining us here in the morning answer\nFor a Monday Ryan and Jennifer AMA Seventy LA Orange County am five Ninety in the I ain't well yes\nIt is a political soap opera national\nSoap opera it's been unfolding in Washington DC since uh well we're going on three weeks now that are unfolding this\nSoap opera that\nAll the very traumatic you have to wait for the prominent down but it does I mean the music for and I was feeling Brian drawn to the\nDrama does continue when we last left you on friday we were a journey the morning answer broadcast with a pretty a speculative but a pretty pretty widely speculated anticipation that check right Kavanaugh would clear the Senate Judiciary committee vote on friday will\nStep up Senator Jeff flake the Republican who was one who earlier on friday morning had been identified and reported as an on the fence senator who had decided to ... vote to confirm Kavanaugh and move them out of committee to a full Senate floor vote on whether or not he actually sits on the Supreme Court candidate aunt\nWas in a huddle with Chris Coons Chris Coons as a democratic senator from the state of Connecticut\nSaid again like you think happened I was in the huddle let's go oh you know you never know the names I'll get jumbled up that bombs or Kevin I was doing his share of hot linked to what we know he's playing with the White House spent on my end certainly and White House counsel yeah that's right because\nSenator Flake and senator Coons are huddled together outcomes Jeff Flake a I think he did a great thing I and others will think he he didn't do a great thing but Jeff Flake a said he'll vote to confirm\nA provided there is a seven day FBI investigation which of course a I immediately after this call for an FBI investigation and fairness the victim the alleged victim called for an FBI investigation or\nWhenever stipulations actually even testify what she was calling for that investigation\nRight and I had said and I still believe that it's the it's the best way to on earth the most information about the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh from Dr Christine forward that in Nineteen eighty two\nHe committed sexual assaults upon her to a Brett Kavanaugh the judge nominees for the Supreme Court denies the allegations he didn't he denies the subsequent\nTo other allegations coming to a total of three of some sort of sexual misconduct or exposing himself et cetera the FBI investigation is going to be for seven days it's going to focus I'm On the scope this is it becomes an issue here because uh\nInitially seven days the scope is the Ford allegations any kind of the FBI stays within the parameters of the investor\nInvestigate the women's claims and initially people were calling for a three day event an FBI investigation this'll be week long and the scope of the investigation is supposed to be about the sexual lights which I support if you're going to go in and do the investigation at\nThis is what you're going in to look at right and you're going to provide a report to the White House the White House is setting the parameters here that's the way it has been traditionally that's the way it is now\nA President Trump of course a speculation one of the one of the stories that speculation there are\nThere are people claiming out there that uh the White House Don McGahn chief counsel uh the guy who was sort of the uh the guy who perhaps capping off for his up big debut on the national stage is a Supreme Court nominee should not be the person\nReviewing the FBI's findings or helping set up parameters for the investigation one fear that Democrats haven't I don't think they need to be fearful\nYet a or if they will need to be fearful at all is that the White House is trying to pull the strings on this FBI investigation from within the White House but as we move forward and in a moment we'll hear from Senator flake a Republican not running for reelection not a fan of Donald Trump\nAnd senator uh Coons Chris Coons a democratic senator uh Jeff Flake is a Republican senator they were on sixty minutes just last night\nLooking ahead to the seven day FBI investigation and the\nReason that their parents out there people are wondering why it Jeff Flake and Christians are doing this media circuit together and that's because right before the ... that it kind of a change of heart by Jeff Jeff Flake came into the building we watched him actually we covered it here on this program on friday\nTo do the committee vote and he was going to vote yes for cabinet which he did but he got kind of a cockpit in an elevator by a woman who was screaming at each that she was a sexual assault victims\nShe said why don't you take me ... you know why don't you take me seriously when he validation and stuff like that that really influence the way he he thought his decisions you should\nGo and it wasn't one woman who was about three women of that and one in particular is\nVery loud and that was maybe one resident and so he went into it to the hearing room he sat down next to Christmas and he pulled him aside and he said look I'm going to vote yes here\nBut I Want you to know I'm going to ask for an FBI investigation because Collins and Murkowski the senators from Maine and Alaska were also kind of on the fence and so before this full Senate vote that's why he called for this FBI investigation so they seem to be partnered up in not in the media tour a poster big announcement friday\nYeah like I referred to a moment ago the huddle they will yeah you know as as I had said initially they they went into a huddle and uh decided together to come forward for this flakes vote was so pivotal and crucial that they were ah they had no choice but to do that here Scott Kelly\nOr with a question a Senator Flake answers first and then senator comes\nWhat are the chances that we are going to be in exactly the same place a\nWeek from now [noise]\nWith cats and we knew the Athens and some of our colleagues said that that will be back here one week from now it'll be worse so we'd rather outrageous allegations have come forward the FBI we'll talk to people who want to talk anymore or we won't be any better\nOh I'm there is a chance that that will happen I I Do think that we can make progress\nOkay Senator Flake and up next senator Coons\nI think will be in a different place because lots of survivors around the country will feel that I'm Dr Ford story was hurt and respected and further investigate it we may well be in a different place a week from now because judge cabin on his family may well have had exculpatory evidence brought forward if\nIs shown to apply to the committee\nThat was Senator Flake there at the end Senator Flake saying here there's no use in being bipartisan about any of this senator\nFlake you ... an ounce which are not running for reelection and I wonder could you have done this\nIf you were running no you know not attract a not a chance to show\nBecause politics has become too sharp\nTo Portland that there is no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nSenator Jeff flake goes on to say that he uh ... at the before friday was at a point without an FBI investigation where he felt a sort of torn he explains that that he felt like he couldn't move forward on the nomination here's more from Jeff Flake who was a the news maker of the day on friday no doubt\nI don't think anybody expected a um\nYou know what happened on friday to happen and uh I Can't say that I could either or just knew\nThat we couldn't move forward that I couldn't move forward without hitting the pause button um because of what\nI was saying experiencing elevator and watching it in committee and just thinking this is rep in our country apart\nHere Senator Jeff flake on the tone of Brett Kavanaugh the judge judge Brett Kavanaugh's voice during his testimony in the overall tone of the testimony this from sixty minutes last night on CBS Scott Kelly doing the interview senators Jeff Flake and you might hear democratic Senator Chris Coons who was there as well\nWe knew that he was eager to testify\nAnd a half to say that\nBut I heard him I heard someone who\nI Hope I Would sound like if I had been unjustly accused\nAnd to see his family behind him as Chris said and uh\nIt was it was anger ah but um but if I were unjustly accused that's how I Would feel as well\nAnd I as it went on um I think his interaction with some of the members a was a little too sharp\nBut I'm the statement at the beginning I thought was pretty raw\nBut ah but in keeping with someone who had been unjustly accused\nSenator Jeff flake on sixty minutes he and democratic Senator Chris Coons will squeeze in the last word for Chris Coons here are gearing up for what is already begun a seven day FBI investigation\nInto the claims made by three different women uh against a Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh the White House ordered this after initially saying\nThey couldn't do that they did do it to develop that added to the delay process here's Chris Coons a his claim not remembered this a democratic senator says that the Kavanaugh testimony the tone of it crossed the line\nWhere he had exchanges with Senator Feinstein was that are close our with others that uh I thought one over line [noise] um he was clearly a village rent aggressive angry and I thought there was\nThe best way to on earth to term I just like to use the\nBest way to on earth the most information possible about this\nUh is through an FBI investigation that seems and the and the and the greatest nation in human history has the ability to do that I'm Glad the president a reverse course and a ordered the FBI investigation as to George W. Bush with regard to Anita Hill's allegations back in Nineteen Ninety One so it's going to be another week of waited\nWell another week of waiting what I just don't want to see happen is that once we get this report there's enough information we down no ... I Know we don't like to talk about seven there will be seven background\nChecks on this man we have over three hundred of his judicial decisions he sat and had an incredibly embarrassing things said about him he's talked about them and he's had this this back and forth with senators now it very difficult testimony there's enough that we know about cabinet whether or not you support him or you don't\nDevote has to come and I just have a feeling from what I'm hearing from some of the talking heads and that's why I asked you will this be an up or will Democrats say well we need another week we need two more weeks we need more investigation for we know what we know and we vote because I don't believe that any Democrat who is going to be a no vote on Kavanaugh all along we'll ever in a Brazilian years ever turn their\nVote into a yes vote on him because they want\nThey don't want them there they ... that the court that abortion and other key issues could be in the balance will and they're still going nor\nWill die hard conservatives who said they support Brett Kavanaugh change their mind if there's a smoking gun shop poll over the\nWeekend that know Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Murkowski there is consideration be given I've told you before I think people's behavior matters it matters to me what we find out about this guy my point is we now know a lot well devote Vietnam and will accommodate a week's time\nI I I wrote a poll over the weekend that a majority of Republicans or I Can't recall who did the poll said that if a sexual\nMisconduct has confirmed if they knew what happened that I still wouldn't be a disqualify her a for Brett Kavanaugh so some people think that way and and and that's interesting very briefly and we'll hear from the president to who spoke over the weekend about Dr forge testimony\nUh another thing you left out is throughout the next week\nOr you can bet that more might come out there\nMight Oh absolutely be a disaster\nThere might be more women coming out with allegations and of course Republican\nOperatives have been working for weeks now to find the dirtiest of dirty things they can about Dr Christine forward that's just the reality of politics that happens on both sides and the reality that hasn't come out yet so maybe it's not there to find\nSo look for that to happen and also look for two more possibilities judge Brett Kavanaugh to say enough is enough I Can't I'm Out and step out of the process or President Trump to say enough is enough\nI have that list with plenty of other people remember I show to that list of twenty five I got twenty four additional names with one phone call like it up and down here in an hour or let's forget it it's easier to take that course and the president could decide to do that all of that remains unknowable at this hour well\nWhat I think it's going to happen is you're going to have more claims that on the left trying to use this extra week it for a time to tackle Brett Kavanaugh I don't think that Republicans are looking at a ton of dirt on Christine forward because they're afraid they're afraid to fight back you saw that's why they have the special prosecutor\nThat Rachel Mitchell who is asking her questions no one wanted to press on her story she gave a credible account\nBut no Republican senator was willing to have the optics\nOf pushing back a little and asking some of those tough\nQuestions about those gaps in her memory no one wanted to do that because they didn't want to be on record doing that because they're afraid of this identity politics game right this game of got you I really think that in a week's time we're going to be back here except it's going to be even worse it's going to be even more part is and and it's just going to be he said she said part too\nWell there are other things to chat about this morning and we will do that it is a historic day for your LA Dodgers first pitch at one oh nine today a will tell you why that time is

any position they have in that manner accusations funny lines of denial arguments and frankly we've reached the point where it's time to the surface\nOnly comfortable moving\nAnd tell me I have done more investigation and they have all\nThat reality really right out in front of our ears and I will judge you get to the Supreme Court are not used to use ... you can trust and I am a Seventy the answer\n\n\n[noise]\nWhy can't conservatives and liberals\nThe morning intern with Brian Jennifer Horn and thanks for joining us on your Monday morning ... am eight Seventy LA Orange County am five Ninety in the I eat the drama continues to unfold and Washington DC where now the FBI is becoming involved\nIn the saga that is the confirmation scandal of judge Brett Kavanaugh now facing free accusers so President Trump said on friday\nOkay I think I'll do it I think that will do it and we'll have the FBI do the investigation remember I told you a week and a half ago that I Can't do this but now I can and a show I'll do it now so that's wild\nIs that one is sort of that's what I heard a so right now we know what you heard that the FBI is investigating like Nineteen eighty to Montgomery County Maryland\nHouse parties just totally style with judge Brett Kavanaugh out there you know drinking beer I liked beer you know and do you still judge I still like beer by the way of any ... when it's\nWhen it's seen through the prism of a job interview you've been on a few of those yeah so what\nCan you imagine the content of your job interview becomes crying and telling the interviewer or interviewers but you still like beer and you drank a lot of\nBeer and that's why this is so to speak about let's just aren't as good now is a good now it's good now because we have an FBI investigation is that why it's good\nIt's what I called for from the very beginning on blood the president's hearing the morning answer\nI don't know if he's hearing that I think you heard that Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake or ensure any thought maybe he wasn't going to pick up a Democrat 'cause a lot of them Joe Donnelly and others have come out and said they'll vote no\nOn Kevin as I think it had a lot to do at the numbers but you can't tell me that that's kind of behavior was not already investigated before when he had these background checks what would you like would it it does he does he use drugs have you ever seen him drink have you seen him drive under the influence these are basic questions at the FBI ask\nEverybody going through this process so I I don't know that there's going to be this big a ha moment oldest son redundant ratings I think are are hoping for\nA it's not redundant because a visa free accusations are were never in this manner with this focus um investigated by the FBI\nSpecifically yeah there's still needs to be on the three investigate and these three claims I understand that but that's why I said the person who he was because they've asked people that well actually times before I actually\nYou they didn't know the person he was because\nWe as Americans have learned a lot more about judge Brett Kavanaugh if just for example the rally rock is high school years we didn't know that well let me point a ... with FBI investigations comes information when they investigate we thought we knew Clarence Thomas and then came along a woman who I believed\nAnd was old enough to be a a college student and watch those hearings\nA I Believe they need a hill I thought I knew Clarence Thomas before Anita Hill a you know came forward by the way al personalize it you might think you know meet somebody might meet you one day and say I get some\nAdult Seattle okay worry about it I bought it from my friends the Russians I might think either Trump I might\nThink I Know Jennifer and then I meet somebody who you did business with ... and rumors\nThat you don't know me it's I Would hope that you would pick up for me not my evil twin and you're playing the soap opera music\nBy the way it's are there other soap opera tunes we should use because children play what okay there's a vote for all my children were using primarily is days of our lives just up the rest of those young in the rest of us it's called not a huge theme from the young and the rest of ... a days of our lives some might be appropriate\nFor all my children all my children's a good one like I get to stay here but I Do want to take before we move I just it just finished my point here for the press absolutely about the FBI investigation Wendy's I\nI Know that there is new information that have come to light that just being investigated by the FBI whether we support it or not that the truth the all the uh the other part of the truth is that in these past\nSix investigations they've asked people that have known Kavanaugh from childhood on\nWhat kind of person he is and no one has said obviously that he's an extensive drinker that he's had a problem with alcohol because that kind of stuff would have been brought up before he received the promotions and his path so I'm just saying we need to limit our expectations and not expect a gigantic ahah and if we don't get one\nIf there is no ahah there let's be prepared to move on\nTo win the White House on friday move forward with ordering the FBI to investigate in seven days these accusations President Trump doesn't say the FBI or by name here but he says he'll be relying on these people\nAnd then he refers to the Senate Judiciary committee or to make the decision on judge Kavanaugh President Trump still a very firmly behind his nominee but the rhetoric tone down a bit\nI'm going to rely on [noise]\nAll of the people including Senator Grassley who's doing a very good job [noise] uh that'll be a decision that they're going to make and I suspect\nThere'll be making some decision soon whether to take a vote or to do whatever they want to do I will be totally reliant on what Senator Grassley other group decides to do [laughter] okay\nThat's President Trump he was asked what he thought of Dr Christine Ford and her testimony on Thursday of last week before the Senate Judiciary committee\nI thought her testimony was a very compelling and she looks like a very fine woman [noise] very fun woman\nOkay that's President Trump briefly on Christine for when asked a about the outcome the president seems to indicate that I'm whatever's best for the country he's happy where okay again on anti\nI'm here so I'm not out there watching because I Can't be great respect although maybe we'll go watch together will watch together but I think it will work out very well for the country I just wanted to work out well for the country if that happens I'm happy\nIn this next clip we we get a helicopter Trump which\nHas always reading shouting 'cause I'm trying to compete with the size of the world and\nHe says the investigation by the Federal Bureau of investigation could be a\nBlessing in disguise\nWhich I Would normally just a blessing in disguise but they're helicopter it's a constant struggle\nActually this could be a blessing in disguise because\nWe I fill\nA thorough investigation whether\nOr seven days I think it's good to be less\nI actually think will be a blessing in disguise it will be a good thing\nPresident seems to think that the cabinet confirmation is a done deal announcing he doesn't need a backup plan\nI don't need a backup to see what happens I think he's got to be by [noise] again for the most respected men certainly what are the most respected your is your judges in the United states\n... that is exactly right Janet child was saying I Am just very I have\nA great family I really do my body is fantastic ... ... ... and I have no larynx anymore I mean they're like get in the largest landslide\nIn American electoral history Martin that Reagan Bernard right now [noise] I lost my Larry me during his campaign\nRanting about\n... minutes [noise] they get to learn about these factors shot at it [noise] okay so\nHe had during a lot of rallies by the way we get a hearing on he's going to be in Tennessee today and he's got like three more rallies this week so\nWe'll we'll see how that boy told that but I Know\nChallenge you and me for sure and we'll learn there's a new love in President Trump's life to find out who it is on this morning's Donald daily download coming up at seven thirty six right now it's seven sixteen\n... morning\n... and you're going to be a jam up coming up on ... avenue in that department of defense and only the beginning Doherty at the time by\nAfter\nNovember I Will take a\n\nBats are lives with Warren saying that she'll be taking a hard look at running so Cory Booker ouch uh Elizabeth Warren Cory Booker out for now Elizabeth Warren committing to looking uh where are we wish someone we haven't discussed yet who I think is the number one choice for most Democrats former vice president Joe Biden\nHe says he's going to let us know in January so that timetable has not changed not change but I'll tell you what I actually support the candidacy of Elizabeth Warren because she do I well I Am a fiscal conservative can we have this on tape because I'm a fiscal conservative and so I like to save money where we can and I believe that\nWe would not have to travel is a bit worn around the country 'cause she can just use her ... she can just fly from place to place in the taxpayer does not have to sponsor that so I endorsed the candidate the of Elizabeth Warren and ah and there you go\nOkay and they get it just you know air force broom\nShow will take that clip from I endorsed Elizabeth Warren's candidates to there you go will be the out on that clip there\nDo you want to say but have pulled out because this is actually kind of infer interesting for me I Do\nWant to say or to the poll is the reason we bring the issue is going to make your Monday morning for sure uh it's a good news Monday for you because after some time so the family and the weekend and all of this cabin on nonsense interview heaven forbid sat in front of the Sunday shows for two seconds you felt like a zombie\nAre not going to be another week at least going on if you're a Republican here in the morning after and there's a few of them\nThis latest poll from Gallup is actually good news for Republicans national yeah\nGoing into the midterms because we know that these midterm races are going to be really hot a lot of money being spent between Democrats and Republicans because Democrats are looking to flip about twenty I think twenty for a Republican seats that they can take control of the house of representatives so here's where things stand national according to Gallup\nRepublican favorability is up at forty five percent Democrats favorability is that forty four percent now that seems to\nIt wouldn't be great news 'cause that's almost a dead heat right at the time\nBut what makes this a good survey for Republicans is that the favorability has gone up by nine points since September ... September it was thirty six percent favorability for Republican so they've seen and nine percentage point jump in a in a\nPretty good amount of time so that's that's good news as far as I mentioned goes into the midterms which are were less than six weeks away five weeks now\nPoll for Paul here's one that's not good news for judge Brett Kavanaugh a new poll says four in ... Americans don't believe Brett Kavanaugh's denials of this alleged attack\nThat Christine for a a spoke about on Thursday before the Judiciary Committee for out of ten saying we don't believe judge capital forty out of ten saying we do believe the judge\nOr the other three saying they don't know\nAnd that they haven't made up their mind or they don't know so uh that will be a factor certainly this uh this is going to be\nThis confirmation process is going to be primary in the minds are and the and the maneuvering of Democrats and Republicans have both sides is going to be primary or in the minds of many voters when they go out there for the midterms in less than fifty days now we're five weeks away tomorrow will be five weeks from the ...\nAnd ... and it's just such a mess the question it okay if Kavanaugh gets confirmed then do Democrats try to de legitimize the court did they say look there's two sexual predators on the Supreme Court or if\nIf the Senate were just switch hands if the house were to switch hand would there be a new Supreme Court nominee put down by Trump with that person even be confirmed or would we live for two years with a a a four and\nFour court situation which is where we said today at the Supreme Court open\nAs we continue on the morning answer for a Monday there's a new love in President Trump's life find out who it is on this morning ...

on Saturday about the new level by life\nCan jump on you got to talk about him again so that's why I'm going to the rose garden ... by the way that we have a long distance relationship shy sending messages she whenever he sees me in the rose garden he knows I'm thinking of the hour song which is the ...\nPresident that's great so but he's going to talk about trade talking about trade and just a week ago the president cancelled the meeting with Justin Trudeau because because he hates them now well he doesn't hate him he wasn't getting a good deal from there because\nThat will be another world war between Canada and America because the president won't meet with it and look at what if it got cancelled six days later\nCancellation that meeting if they could add anything to do with those absolutely comments that he made about Trump that Trump was found a deeply offense I think\nThat when it was tough all of a sudden we get deals we haven't you brought up the love of his life Kim Jong known\nThat seems to be moving forward after tough talk now we've seen Mexico who supposedly hates us there in on this agreement Canada now is on the table and now President Trump and this is

finding love with Ronnie can you imagine I mean it would that would\nBe a I've been doing this for a long time what ... what hosts need certain types of post need events like that to happen and then they can they could like ride that for a week and\nIf Obama said anything remotely like that about a Fidel Castro memory shorter complimented Castro and conservatives yeah that's all conservatives talked about for I think it was a month\nHe also said that he'd do anything you can to bend over to help the Russians and he did that off Mike look we didn't need Obama to say anything about Iran brand because we know exactly how he felt about Iran because he sent a plane filled with cash over to Iran show words were unnecessary the gift spoke sports out I Will play\nThis again before people send me the negative messages and ask you as a as a Trump supporter the first lady of ... my friend Jennifer Horn or if you find anything if you have any if you have any problem with this we are doing great\nThat was a big big problem\nAnd you know the addressing what I did it and I was really being tough and so is he he's talking about Kim Jong known of course as you I Will go back and forth\nAnd then we fell in love [noise]\nJust listen Jennifer and told me if you have any problem with any ever [noise]\nOh well I\nWhat you know what now they'll make Donald Trump\nIn love how horrible horrible his\nAnd I always tell you it's so easy to be presidential instead of having ten thousand people outside trying to get into this factory and\nAbout two hundred people standing right there okay so that's forty one or just under forty two just tend to the second\nOr under forty two seconds of the president on Saturday the leader of the free world expressing his love for Kim Jong un saying or specifically they fell in love 'em and then he and then his ADD brings him to the amount of people in the arena\nAnd then and then he criticizes the media for a report that Trump said he loves Kim Jong going well he after just saying that he blames the media before they even have a chance to print or publish any or link anything\nHe criticizes them for what he just shut\nDown and see the anticipating the dumb headlines of the news media because the brain you heard it and you're a comedian\nWhat he said was mentioned jak we fell in love he's being funny he was saying that tongue in cheek and you know what the president can say whatever you want about Kim Jong un because I'm seeing action there I'm the guy who is not blowing missiles to answer this what about the auctions wars in word no trunk and so that's just my answer in life that's just how I live is that actions mean more to me than any word you could tell me\nTo ... to give the same answer about Kim Jong noon as they give about putting a would they never address the flowery rhetoric or in in quite literally the loving rhetoric the expression of love for a for a dictator who are charges people\nSo that he might build up its military has people literally stocks he feeds them to dogs in some cases he did that to his own uncle I Believe Kim jung them so the president expresses\nThat he was hungry so they didn't have any meat light around now so I mean\nI think Jennifer ... point you make my point and and that and that look there is\nNo doubt in my mind on the horrible to what people don't love Kim Jong don't heal\nThat there's a doubt and Trump's mind about that but what I Will tell you is that the Trump rhetoric works and the people who don't understand it are the ones who are critical of him and it's Democrats who listen to every word that he says and they and they want to take it and they want to break it apart and they want to look for some deeper meaning and the people who are supportive of the president will get\nAll of the stuff that he's done like renegotiating NAFTA\nWhich is something he he actually ran on he promised that he's now delivering it now we have to see if Congress will approve it but these are promising being delivered by this president and all we're worried about it him having fun on a rally stage saying a few words\nAbout countries where he's actually making real progress it just it's flimsy and to me more and more it seems like a possibility that this Trump\nThe guy you like to call this job I Do I call I'm going to be sticking around not just for another two years that for another six years\nAgainst the news every morning\nThis is the morning answer with\nMoran thanks for joining us here on your Monday morning and answered new week\nNew month it's October first happy October Halloween season is upon them I Love it but some people don't celebrate Halloween they get very upset that some people for religious reasons or reject Halloween\nI Know that is true and I look I I support it if you don't want to celebrate it I just like everything pumpkin not just to give all sides on all sides to be heard right ah I Love very fair thank you so much I loved the movie it's my favorite movie of all time the original Nineteen Seventy or John Carpenter class are honest you'd have a movie night with me 'cause I've not seen the whole thing\nYeah well they they have a they they ... done the original with Jamie Lee Curtis and John Carpenter directing it comes out I think our children Nineteen through the Eighteenth whatever Thursday that is there so we look forward to that wish you a happy October autumn is here and the saga continues the never ending confirmation process\nOf judge Brett Kavanaugh now President Trump as of friday he said okay we can do it before ten days ago talked about delay tactics\nTen days ago when I said I couldn't do it oh I'm Sorry I can do it look I can do it over alleged to have them so\nThat he couldn't do it he said he wouldn't do it he then he realized that he was probably going to be in trouble with votes ... Collins and Murkowski inflate needed more sensitive to get him to the Senate he needed it so we have a seven day\nA FBI investigation and a Senator Jeff flake of Arizona that last name focus on that last name flake Shia\nYou call them a maverick that women are your favorite Republican today here's\nMy ... he's been he's always been one of my favorite Republicans are proving how fair and honest I Am if you look at his voting record it's incredibly conservative ... if you look at Jeff lakes how he votes and you know all the Trump people always talk about well look at the votes are the policies look at the sanctions look at what's the actions\nAnd about Ninety three percent of the time he votes along the party line votes at the present a very\nConservative in his voting and even before Donald Trump was president he's very conservative senator um\nSo he did something on friday which I thought was pretty novel\nHe was a he was accosted in an elevator well I think it said they were blocking the eggs are and I mean they were they were doing that and there was some women several women were present one of them was louder than the others are talking about shouting at Senator Flake that he has to do something about Brett Kavanaugh\nThat uh I Believe she said she was a victim already said she was victimized right and and we don't want our daughters to be victimized\nBy judge Kavanaugh but in life this woman had been victimized threat we shouldn't promote these people\nThat we saw something very unusual in politics in twenty eight teams we saw the elected official and this is not against Republicans\nOr Democrats we saw intellect it official a show empathy we saw that elected official listen to a constituent a citizen\nAnd then we actually saw the elected official take action based on among other factors but partly based on by his own uh notations of what happened friday\nWhat the voters what the citizenry said to him so Jeff Flake out up there and uh and said to the Judiciary Committee on which he said\nHe got together with Chris Coons the Democratic senator of\nConnecticut and they said okay I'll vote for Kavanaugh under the condition that we have an FBI seven day investigation into the women's claims and I say women that's plural because now we have three women of different women with names Republican faces telling stories of a\nExposing themselves for the doctor for the story of sexual assault that we all heard on Thursday of last week and the third story is sort of that uh ms sweat neck was sort of a witness to him being inappropriate or so we've got three of those they called\nThem a gang rape is I mean the the claims that have been thrown against this guy\nAre unbelievable and then he had the nerve to defend themselves and when he had the nerve to defend themselves people said that he didn't have the temperament to be a judge on the Supreme Court what I don't like to see her Brian is precedent being fat and I don't like to see that we can take people apart for positions like this after\nThey've proven an exemplary record and they've gone through and checked all the boxes and they've been through six FBI check I have no problem with the truth I\nThink character matters I Want to know the truth about these people it is not\nAbout trying to just push through my my party's agenda but what is really scary and it should be scary to everybody especially somebody like you Brian who is a white guy or or someone who oh that's right I forgot to know if you want to be on the Supreme Court but\nOh no that's right I forgot I'm a white man on the victim in America now you are thank you for reminding me that I keep reminding me\nBecause I was talking people out of the running for things that are important because there are man they must be a a rapist oh he drank beer and got drunk at a party that must make him a rape is do we hear the ridiculous ... this\nThis is not the place where I think people who have fathers and husband and son wants to live let's take down the bad people but let's also give people a chance to to have due process and to present their side of the story ... their case he he he gave us his sign it when he was credible\nHis ... and also her story was credible\nAbsolutely so what do you do that and you look at the witnesses who were allegedly involved in every single one of them said that he didn't do what she is claiming\nWe'll get to senators flaking Coons on sixty minutes last night I interviewed by Scott Kelly on CBS before we do let me respond to what you said\nHere's why or here's one reason why people wonder sometimes they say oh well people send me all the time they see Brian I Love you and I like to listen for nothing else to hear what the other side say okay well now you're going to hear what the other side things if you're a Kavanaugh supporter here's one thing that the other side things\nWe have a woman making a claim I'm Talking about Dr Ford professor Ford Christine blah see what's her name before she was married [noise]\nMaking a very credible claim a she said she drank one beer at the party she was asked specifically if she was on any medications the question obviously designed to determine if ... if she was on anything that might alter her memory alter her consciousness or alter her memory she said no to that no one has come forward\nTo say there's a history of of ah of her making up stories that no one and she said she drank beer and the president or said that he thought that she was well here's what he said I told\nHer testimony was very compelling and she looks like a very fine woman\nAnd I find woman okay I Would agree with the president's assessment on the other side you have a guy or a judge excuse mouth respectful judge Kavanaugh who denies the allegations shouting at ... and this crying it was very emotional and his the denial of it and I'm an emotional guy too I might cry if the predicament that he claims he's in if\nI was in that one but here's what we do know we know the capital by his own admission and being very serious now we know that he had quite a relationship with beer during his high school and college days this has played sure this is funny but this is from the testimony\nI drink beer with friends sometimes too many beers I liked fear I still like fear had fears some beers one beer and drink beer and drink beer drank beer and drinking beer you probably a beer sir each week Ralph club biggest contributor\nYou know I got a weak stomach whether it's with beer I liked it better for that I like beer I don't know if you don't like the senator or not um what do you watch the next one and get out and having some beers with friends which I gladly do which I fully embrace\nOkay he fully embraces beer and a ... admits are there to having at some point had too many beers a here's something that is true when when people are a drink too much or they take too much of a substance or drugs or\nMedication or which has drugs or whatever it is a they have a not all the time\nBut people have blackouts in my own life in my adult life I'd had blackouts my father who was an alcoholic\nAh and recovered and live the life and recovery\nHad blackouts ... I'm not saying I don't know enough about judge Kavanaugh to say that he's an alcoholic\nBut I Do know that he drank a lot and I do know there are people who say that his testimony that he never was had memory lapses is on true because\nThere are people this weekend out there saying what their names attached to the claims that they saw him they were in high school with them and they see him drunk all the time so the reason I'm more inclined to believe the accuser is she has none of that in her background judge Kavanaugh by his own testimony [noise]\nAt least makes it possible that there were times that he did things and was so drunk that maybe he can't remember them he denies unfairness blackouts the people around him in Nineteen eighty to say a ha that's not true we saw him\nNot heard more than once\nOkay so you just said you and your father had both suffered from blackouts suffered from black hat you blackout I have black out are you a rapist could you have rape somebody during the blackout uh no I I've never ... because you're not a rapist people are are they are not people are sexual predators are or they're not\nThis is not about somebody who's drunk and gets into a car and drive drunk or does something really bad this is about someone who is willing massive and pray and pray on somebody and so it's really different between eight and you can't say eighty ... eighty\nPercent of the country has probably been drunk during high school right Ninety percent maybe has been drunk at some point in their life\nThat doesn't make that amount of population\nWomen raping they agree with you but three women are really serious but three\nWomen are saying they saw a drunken escapades and two of them are saying they were victimized uh so so all I ask you is is it possible that judge Kavanaugh or had a moment in his life that because of the alcohol that he embraces that's his boat doesn't remember is that possible\nAnd I asked you today I said oh you're ready for that big game today and you're like yeah yeah who they plan and I said oh the rocket and you're like Arizona yeah\nOr Dodger we have\nSome other Arizona but in any case Iraqis today and then it'll either be the the brewers the cubs are the Braves later on that\nWay and I do want to say I'm Jealous of you if you're a morning answer listener who can do the following knock off for the entire day on Monday after having two days off which I don't I'm not I'm not jealous of that\nBut if you get a ... so I must say um and you can like knock it off and just go off to Chavez Ravine for one oh nine first pitch I mean anything I mean that's like you know half\nIt's only Ninety percent of sales department and the company could do that all of that move where they can just knock off put all phones to voicemail and go to Dodger Stadium for one oh nine\nThey're having an affair they're having a retreat a sales manager a treat I think over to understand there's gonna be a lot already ranch this afternoon what are you that an scheduled you could go to Dodger Stadium\nNot really I I Can't get over there oh really yeah I have a lot to do today really like a lot of\nYou have an excuse let her however the Dodgers put out a deer blank letter so please excuse blank from either work or school and you could circle one so that you can either give it to your principal or your boss if you've got to go to the Dodgers game play it\nLike you and your co worker you could write to Don ... ton am five Ninety you do the afternoon show Jenna die if you want to catch a game of Chavez Ravine beard on and the Dodger editor Don let her do your do your job and the Dodgers the Dodgers have created excuses\nYeah they say okay somebody's ...
