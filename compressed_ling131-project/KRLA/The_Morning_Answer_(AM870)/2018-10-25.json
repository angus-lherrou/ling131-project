I've got lots of military in my family and I've heard it said again and again I about civilian but I married a Marine Corps brat and which is lots of military active duty\nThat whenever a soldier sailor airman or marine Corp and go off on deployment they come back a different man or woman and their spouse is a different man or woman and they left a do you captured that in indivisible\n... absolutely in in a in a very vivid accurate way I Believe we use the chaplains actual journal that he kept while he was in Iraq so we kind of get into into what they're going through by by reading his journal and and then incorporating that into our entire script you know it's so often that\nI'm as Americans we take for granted the freedoms that we have and it's really about one percent of the population that that's connected directly to the military through a spouse who's serving or or having a child who's an active duty\nThere's this other Ninety nine percent of people that I think really are going to appreciate the story a yet yet uh entertainment value this great visual effects and and a score but it's the it's the deep rooted story about what our troops are going through the I think will really speak to people\nAnd um I'd like to also and you it's a perfect\nDate movie if there's a husband or wife out there and they're your your your listeners are looking for something to do this weekend or you know you can cast a vote for or faith based quality films like this by going to see the movie on opening weekend the perfect perfect film for for husbands and wives to go out and watch together\nAnd this is the studio that also brought out fire proven more roommate really succeeds they make wonderful movies as says of course David Evans it got very experienced directorial credits\nBut what strikes me is especially if you have a member of the military and your family whether it's a son or daughter husband and wife grandma grandpa anyone\nWho deploys I Want you to go see this movie so that you understand what you're friends with someone you go to church with someone who's got a spouse deployed understand how hard it is for that spouse as well as for the frontline soldier sailor airman marine coast guard but that is you know I think indivisible has got a lot of great stuff going forward with Sarah\nTrue it adjusted ruining in David evidence but what's really got going for it as an audience that's going to finally see their lives reflected on the screen\nYes he which we've heard that over and over again from some of the military screenings and and community screenings we'd done already is people say that was me in that scene I saw myself on the screen\nAnd you know with Veterans Day coming up just a couple of weeks away that's a great opportunity for someone after you've seen the film to say you know what I Know someone who needs to see this and go out and\nGive them a ticket and say thank you for your service and it's something that that really all of us needs experience because it's not so often that like this film can come along they sent a true story of a military couple uh especially one told you the odds are chapel and\nI Love you know the alliance offending ... great sports of our show has a separate group to vote adjusted chaplains and chaplains very rarely get the credit which they deserve their in every battlefield they're on every front line taken care of the men and women and the troops and I'm Glad someone finally made a movie about David thank you\nThank thank you so much yeah it's it's an important role in like you said one we often take for granted but in the case of chaplain Darren Turner he's in Iraq dealing with the problems facing a thousand troops\nAnd ah you know his own relationship begins to to deteriorate with his own spouse and that's what we see kind of play out in the film and how how um they're able to piece things back together and and today they go round counseling other couples that military marriage or treats around the country which is another great thing that people really are not aware of that happening\nThe hash tag or the Twitter feed is indivisible move him Ovie indivisible move it opens on friday coast to coast go find your theater near you or visit the website for independent indivisible movie to find out where it's closer to David

information on a developing story developing a moment by\nMoment here as a ninth suspicious suspicious package has been found by the police investigating a what we talked about at the end of yesterday's broadcast explosives and several days ago a one landing in the mailbox of George Soros then explosives being sent\nTo former President Clinton a former secretary of State Hillary Clinton their home and chapel Quander York also the Obamas also the time Warner center in New York where CNN operate it's New York\nAre headquartered in that one was addressed to John Brennan who is the former CIA director the latest It's MORNING is that you additional suspicious packages one address to a former vice president Joe Biden was discovered in the mail room and then another was discovered at the end of building owned by Robert De Niro in Tribeca in New York\nOkay President Trump yesterday was a having a conversation of presidential forum on fighting the opioid crisis that is epidemic in America but he starts by talking of these threats of political violence\nTo begin today's remarks by providing an update on the suspicious packages and devices mail to current and former high ranking government officials\nTo safety of the American people is my highest sand absolute priority but in these times we have to unify we have to come together\nAnd send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts more threats of political violence of any kind to have no place in the United states of America\nPresident Trump yesterday along those lines first lady Melania Trump added that the U.S cannot tolerate cowardly attacks like this I wanted\nTo take a moment to talk about today's news attempted attacks on President Clinton Betty tend to buy my family's not ... individuals and organizations we cannot do they know commonly attacks and I strongly condemn all\nViolence I'm grateful to the secret service as well as the local law enforcement all they do on a daily basis to keep us safe and encourage people across the country to kind of over hatred\nMillennia Trump our first lady yesterday talking about the uh the uh well accept\nCowardice a hair are really ... acts of terror James Clapper political terror as a former it is certainly made that definition the former director of national intelligence will chime in a moment we'll move swiftly through these um soundbites because you have a busy day maybe you didn't hear all of these newsmakers chime in on this threat against\nAgain nine suspicious packages are being found the latest to address the former vice president Joe Biden and Robert De Niro all of these people prominent Democrats should be\nWell Trump critics for sure they have that in common\nOr Hillary Clinton a thank Secret Service and a protective services for I'm saving her life\nWe are fine thanks to the men and women of the secret service or who intercepted\nAnd dress to us long before it made its way into our home\nEvery day we are grateful for their service and commitments and obviously\nI never never more than today\nBut it is a troubling time isn't it and it's a time of\nDeep divisions\nAnd we have to do everything we can to bring our country together\nThat's former secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaking yesterday on these suspicious packages mailed to some prominent democratic um leaders CNN\nBy the way are at the time Warner center in New York where they based their New York operations\nFrom a also received a suspicious package you listen here to some CNN anchor is on the air who after this exchange were forced to evacuate the studio and did the rest of their show from the street outside the building you can you were a fire alarm going off in the background\n[noise] why am I hearing the CNN anchors were just\nListening tour it we know there there\nWas a real good money anyway we'll move on to New York governor Andrew Cuomo who says ah there's a pattern of devices being sent to your now I think that's obviously true uh with nine ... being found hippie I sent\nHer there is a device on\nAbout not also\nGovernor Cuomo of New York Andrew Cuomo goes on to say the U.S is that a boiling point we\nCan have political differences\nWe've always in a political differences that's what made America America [noise]\nBut let's have our political differences with civility [noise]\nUh and let's avoid the hostility and the rhetoric and the rancor and the anger because we are at a boiling point governor of New York Andrew\nCuomo and of course he's he's right we are the boiling point I think everybody feel that everybody on every political\nSide of the aisle feels that he did have to step back his initial remarks we heard there he said that he was in ... in receipt as one of these suspicious packages as well that turned out not to be true that was felt he did not get a suspicious package that doesn't mean\nWho knows there's one on the way we do know there's a lot of these things being sent out that that just shows you when you're in a fluid in in a fluid scenario like that and everybody's getting on that sense of hysteria or panic thinking that maybe something that was innocent delivered to your office might be taking\nYeah better word might be uncertainty everyone's getting suspicious packages and your the mayor or you're the governor of the city speaking of mayors here's bill de Blasio the New York city mayor in his second term speaking out\nAgainst what was seen yesterday calling it an act of terror suspicious packages explosives sent two prominent Democrats former President Clinton\nFormer U.S secretary of State Clinton a former President Obama a to their homes\nOr what we saw here today it was a effort to terrorize clearly is an act of terror\nLeaders of this country\nThrough acts of violence\nI Want to make very clear that the people in New York City will not be intimidated\nThat we're going to go about our lives\nBecause the very concept of terrorism is to change us so we will not allow that to happen as mayor\nDe Blasio so finally now or clips from yesterday's news and comments from newsmakers you've heard it all from President Trump to the first lady Melania Trump his wife from Hillary to the governor and the mayor of New York now former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nConfirming what most people know who understand terrorism this is an act of domestic terrorism that happened yesterday with explosives being mailed to prominent democratic leaders I\nDon't think it's a laugh or because you know that's always thought that would be ... I think this is\nClearly a domestic thing uh it was there is a situation where a possibly being going because I'm a mental illness or something like that but to me this is a domestic terrorism\nFight that James Clapper the former director of national intelligence Jennifer ... is right now a manhunt underway to find the person or persons behind the mailings of these explosives\nAnd typically you don't hear the FBI tip their hands too much as to what kind of information they get to a clearly they're looking for forensic evidence but yesterday Christopher Wray said that they had loads of forensic evidence so I think that's a good indication that maybe they are at least following a few trails that might have something substantial at the end of them\nWe are twelve days away from the mid term elections on November ... this is the morning ... mid term ...

I think it was before you were here in\nThe idea that would make about the wall really it just real quick because I think it's important to note is that even if Mexico handed you a check for millions of dollars you still need congressional approval to spend at Democrats in Congress are not willing to give that to what the president because they don't want to give him any easy win\nBut twelve days before the midterm during the president's speech to blame exclusively Democrats she always leaves the house\nOr he is a he is a ... campaign promise that Mexico with no problem and no requests of funds from the American taxpayers would pay for the wall and it would make the border secure we are now twenty two months into his administration and we've got a caravan storming toward the borders I Would say this is as much as problem\nAs it is the Democrats yet Trump last night in Wisconsin that exclusively at the\nDoorstep of the Democrats pretending it's exclusively their problem plastic Trump\nTaking no criticism or no responsibility for shortcomings that he's created\nAnd I don't know if it's classic Trump or not I do know that there were two very serious attempt to come up with meaningful immigration reform in this country and Chuck Schumer refuse to come to the table we could've solved DACA\nWe forget the wall to wall off the wall as controversial maybe Trump is going to deliver on that promise maybe he is maybe the wall worked maybe a dozen but let's talk about the visa system let's talk about the lottery system much talk about vetting people coming into this country let's talk about DACA and Democrats failed not once but twice in the last year alone\nTo solve this problem with Republican and everybody could have had a wedding\nLast word for you Jennifer as we continue on the morning answer for a Thursday practice friday last night game number two of the world series the Dodgers try once again at Fenway Park to beat the Boston Red Sox who ...\nLast full details on a on a I'm Jill in recovery gonna discouraging nights at Fenway last night it's six thirty\nIs you're interacting morning\nComing back as ... found that I don't think hanging out and there's a clash they're so only temporarily stopped right now and you're driving back from African Ito came around\nAnd then as you ... to ... found out there among each other high class that within laying there over to the right sooner now but the driver means that problem with the high\nEnd in Long Beach on the Ninety One heading let down before Lanny vendor there and that taking away the middle of laying down south into the guy from out power for love I mean we have a son and I knew what it takes five another cost talking at the carpool lane thank you and your wife everybody or stock\nAnd you're also going to be delays as humid that if I'm going to be tending my found some guy they need to be seven in ... heavy to satisfy present to survive as long as you can [noise] and the baby when everybody's nice on the line and Jamie ...

four of them who have already told me that this is a a plan that they wouldn't mind they're young they're contemporaries of mine for the most part some of them are older\nAnd uh they've expressed a desire to have their ashes bread or in the happiest place on earth\nWhy not people get pretty creative smuggling in the ashes I was reading this article that they actually put smashes in like a pill bottle because that won't get checked by security they might sick I'm into like a baggy and then into something else maybe like a snack bag of suck up\nEvery morning breaking news talk you can trust this is the answer with Brian from Jennifer horn\nThanks for joining us on Thursday factors friday here on the morning after yesterday we followed a developing story still developing suspicious packages being sent two prominent Democrats in New York for example the bill and Hillary Clinton their home and ... uh they're ... they're an injured\nYou'll hear from Hillary Clinton exactly uh why they uh they were protected she credits the secret service that protection of course a former presidents and former first ladies of course uh we were led to believe George Soros couple of days you form at first also in New York so we thought this was a New York thing\nPolice are responding to to suspicious packages apparently ... here to Southern California to the offices of Maxine Waters the congresswoman is\nBecoming pretty clear and we'll hear from the newsmakers including President Trump\nThat uh whomever is sending these packages and there's a manhunt underway quite literally the media is using that term law enforcement's using that term you may not Debbie Wasserman Schultz know to find on the return address labels to find the person responsible\nUh the ... you know that this is terrorism and ah this is a you know the the the question as we lean into you know the other side would certainly look Donald Trump which if this was happening to prominent Republicans Donald Trump would certainly say this\nAnd Republicans would certainly give voice to this concern as many of them did when ... was shot on the ball field\nSo I'm going to give voice to this concern to is the rhetoric is the ... are the nasty words saying the Democrats um art for crimes are the party of crime parties nasty words again you know the Jennifer as a as an experience since so such a talented broadcaster the words of public people say are heard\nAh by people who are sometimes not all their\nWords words matter a lot I think actions matter more what I don't want to see what I've already started saying when I was watching I was watching CNN for a long time yesterday and what I'm hearing as well it's the words fault that stuff like this happens and\nWe can't go down that route as a country because one of our greatest gifted living living here in this country is our freedom of speech and we can't give the word that much power we have to remember there was a crazy person behind them which ... was shot\nI don't think that any Republican blamed Bernie Sanders even though he was a Bernie Sanders supporter of Hillary Clinton with all the ... the Taliban and this person who shot shot ceased to lease use that same line from Hillary Clinton we didn't blame her we shouldn't\nBlame was it was all over social media the attacks on Bernie Sanders after the ... shooting were all over ...\nRepublican came out and blamed Bernie Sanders because people understand that crazy people are behind these things and those are the ones who need to deal with let's get\nTo the newsmakers and we have a nice line up from you a lot of information yesterday from Governor Cuomo in New York to Hillary Clinton two millennia Trump will start with President Trump\nWho was at a conference or on the opioid crisis which is a reached epidemic proportions in our country he begins his remarks by speaking of these uh threats and the political violence um here's President Trump yesterday\nTo begin today's remarks by providing an update on the suspicious packages and devices mail to current and former high ranking government officials\nTo safety of the American people is my highest sand absolute priority that in these times we have to unify we have to come together\nAnd send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\nAs President Trump yesterday we heard from the first lady Melania Trump who says these cowardly attacks cannot be tolerated in the United states\nI Want to take a moment to talk about today's news [noise] attempted attacks that you can paint on that they tend to buy their family not because he seemed to be just an opening day since they cannot do they know scholarly attacks and I strongly condemn or\nTo violence I'm grateful to the secret service at the local law enforcement for oh they do on a daily basis to keep us safe and encourage people across the country to to kind of over hatred that's\nMillennia Trump very appropriate words eloquently stated yesterday about the suspicious packages were waking up this morning very quickly\nTwo more package is one are headed for Joe Biden actually\nTwo headed to a job I really interesting to headed to Joe Biden to went to Maxine Waters one to LA and one to Maryland where she must have an office and then of course there was the Clinton the Obamas Eric Holder CNN which was addressed to John Brennan and uh and I think that they get everybody on the line I think\nHe got them all nine packages into being reported by the networks this morning a now reaction from our former first lady former U.S senator former secretary of state and former Democratic\nCandidate nominee for the presidency who lost to Donald Trump Hillary Clinton a says ah that day she and her husband are okay crediting the secret service for essentially saving their lives\nWe are fine thanks to the men and women of the secret service or who intercepted\nAnd dress she was long before it made its way into our home every day we are grateful for their service and commitment and obviously\nNever never more than today\nBut it is a troubling time isn't it and it's a time of\nDeep divisions\nAnd we have to do everything we can to bring our country together that's\nHillary Clinton yesterday CNN which operates there in New York headquarters out of the time Warner center in New York City\nThey also had a suspicious package sent you'll hear hear live on the air to CNN anchors are the euro fire alarm go off and you can hear them kind of be thrown a bit by it live on the year they were later are sent to the street and finish their broadcast a from outside the studio outside the building\nThe FBI are saying that they were rudimentary but functional that means they were explosive devices to have projectile but [noise]\n'cause me that sounds like a fire alarm here will keep you posted on that they're ... they're heard in the background we're going to find out what the latest his alligator bag and I were to be right back\nOkay New York governor Andrew Cuomo's you bring you a ton of information on this huge story a pronounces it clearly a pattern has been established of these explosive devices being sent a to certain types of people\nOut there is a\nAnd like the number of divide\nAbout not\nPets governor Andrew Cuomo we do want to set the record straight there in a moment of uncertainty where people are suspicious of every package at some point or with the anthrax scare that we had a media the number of years ago or a turns out that was not a an explosive ...\nGotta get a little bit of criticism for that but he did why walk it back there was not or has not been yet a package tend to do with Andrew Cuomo and what's interesting to note about these bombs is that while they are considered to be explosive\nThat they are similar it can and they all are similar in construction that none of them are considered to be active said this is again leading to the mystery about why you're doing this or you setting out to just scare people what what is behind the person or the group that is doing this what's the end goal\nHere from James Clapper the former director of national intelligence who calls it an act of terrorism and and as he is right about that a New York governor Andrew Cuomo one more shot from him claiming the U.S is that a boiling point um\nAnd symbolic of that is the distribution or or the or the sending of these suspicious packages many or all of them are we understand containing explosives or something that appears to be an explosive\nWe can have political different [noise]\nWe've always been a political differences that's what made America America\nLet's have our political differences with civility [noise]\nUh and let's avoid the hostility and the rhetoric and the rank\nAnd the anger because we are at a boiling point\nVery powerful person in New York City is always the person elected Mayor Bill de Blasio in his second term\nOr what we saw here today it was a effort to terrorize clearly is an act of terror\nLeaders of this country\nThrough acts of violence\nI Want to make very clear that the people in New York City will not be intimidated\nThat we're going to go about our lives hung deterred\nBecause the very concept of terrorism is to change us so we will not allow that to happen\nBucolic San Fernando valley I suspect\nMany parents have I I've seen the movie Aladdin and I've seen the ...

President Trump says no nation can succeed that tolerates violence or the threat of violence as political intimidation there's just a few days after he rallied for Greg gene forty\nThat's an odd to me nonetheless a here's President Trump yesterday a at a a at a\nConference about the opioid crisis which of course wrote the epidemic proportions president speak out against these threats of violence and this attempt to send what is believed to be explosive devices or to some very prominent Democrats or two former American presidents\nBegin today's remarks by providing an update on the suspicious packages and devices mailed to current and former high ranking government officials\nTo safety of the American people is my highest sand absolute priority but in these times we have to unify we have to come together and send one very clear strong unmistakable message\nThat acts were threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\nWhich President Trump yesterday vice president Mike Pence a ... a a similar tone\nOr just received a briefing about the suspicious packages\nThat were sent to the Clintons the Obamas to CNN and others\nAnd let me be clear\nWe condemn these but tempted acts of violence in the strongest possible terms cowardly\nAre despicable\nNo place in American society [noise]\nI Wonder were deployed the full resources or the FBI the United states Secret Service they're working very closely with law enforcement officials will continue to monitor these investigations\nAnd those responsible will be brought to justice that's vice\nPresident Mike Pence speaking out yesterday first lady Melania Trump says the United states cannot tolerate these cowardly attacks\nI Want to take a moment to talk about today's news attempted attack on President Clinton Betty tend to buy their family ... individuals and organizations we cannot donate those caught on the attack and I strongly condemn all\nTo violence I'm grateful to the secret service at the local and federal law enforcement for oh they do\nOn a daily basis to keep us safe and encourage people across the country to just kind of over hatred\nAs first lady Melania Trump former first lady US Senator former secretary of state and former Democratic nominee for the U.S presidency Hillary Clinton whose husband of course is former President Bill Clinton living in

or sent a to them at their home hears a Hillary Clinton yesterday\nWe are fine thanks to the men and women of the secret service or who intercepted\nPackage and dressed to our long before it made its way into our home every day we are grateful for their service and commitment and obviously\nI never never more than today\nBut it is a troubling time isn't it and it's a time of\nDeep divisions\nAnd we have to do everything we can to bring our country together as former\nSecretary Hillary Clinton CNN which operates or their New York headquarters out of the time Warner center in New York City in Manhattan they also were on the list of a targeted a person's or locations for these explosive devices to be sent to they had a bomb threat ah\nThey address the John Brennan yeah right yeah and again it but it was odd wealthy well he appears they're lagging icy I'm On there so there you go there's a manhunt underway by the way of suffice to say important information here\nThere's a manhunt underway for the person or the person responsible uh for this act of terror as it's being called\nA by the former director of national intelligence for example CNN anchors on the air you can hear a fire alarm going off in the background understand they had to leave the studio and finish their show from the street outside the time Warner center\nFBI are saying that they were rudimentary but functional that means they were explosive devices to have projectile but [noise]\nI think that sounds like a fire alarm here will keep you posted on that they're ... they're in the background we're going to find out what the latest is that you know where to be right back\nOK governor Andrew Cuomo in New York a following very closely what's going on a says that there's a pattern here of these devices being center I think that's obvious\nHer there is a\nWouldn't be at all\nAbout it also\nTurns out that device a governor Andrew Cuomo in New York there that device that he speaks up was not an explosive device but in this in this moment of great uncertainty ... at at which time the governor was talking uh uh the obviously a ... we use obviously assumed\nIncorrectly so and and did a walk attack that it was a that he was a target of an attack\nThat number now is that ten devices one thank you John Brennan at CNN as we mentioned to one former vice president Joe Biden to actually so job I got to today Robert Deniro got one this morning yesterday uh of course Eric Holder to to Maxine Waters wanted the Clintons went to the Obamas and then all of this started\nEarlier on Monday at with George Soros also being in receipt of one and they all look the same mail it to Six Flags stamped on them they've got a computerized label and the return address is Debbie Wasserman Schultz who actually received the one to Eric Holder returned to her office for I think insufficient posted\nThe mayor of New York city is always a powerful person involved with investigations like this when when uh what for example Time Warner center right there in New York City bill de Blasio in his second term call this an act of terror yesterday\nWhat we saw here today it was a effort to terrorize clearly
