I was actually just in California reporting on all the rest of our rights of the Southern California and that was all I mean I was surprised to hear some sort of independent minded voters have had some evidence on how the Democrats and even the cover of the cabinet out here but\nLook I think I think people are so polarized too that you know eat it you know they don't trust that anything they hear a they really haven't gotten to the battle stations that just got to look for the partisan rhetoric out there so I don't think there's a there's a whole lot of truck\nOr of the Democratic side towards President Trump they don't believe anything he says I think a lot of Republicans will trust what they ...\n... last question my friend Mimi Walters used a very influential in rising star in a very effective congresswoman or I Can't vote for any more because I've moved to Virginia I Would vote for or otherwise is she going to pull it out it would be it would be stupid not to send Mimi Walters back to Congress she so influential\nSo I interviewed coverage for a while to get you out there that I wrote a piece that covers at that race I mean it's a it's a tough one for Republicans as one of the burden for the district suburban district that's always been a Republican but there are a lot of anti a lot of anti Trump Republicans out there are the best hope that Republicans have is that the Democrat\nIs one of the any quarter a law professor who was posed with Elizabeth Warren she's too little too old to the left where most people are that district\nAnd that that's the one hope that Republicans have I was right after you pay for it or the Democratic she didn't want to answer any questions to talk about policy and you know Republicans that they're going to win that district they really get up and down of what you stand on issues like health care issues that just adds to the left where a lot of voters that district\nThat maybe it worked hard I don't know if you cut back but she worked charter their job I mean she goes out and she does every copy quite job there did you see that\nShe she she gave an interview she talked to\nMe as a Democrat in ... or ... so I you know that that I can only go by what I heard and she certainly\nMorning cancer with Brian what message and for foreign as the conservative crusader Brian\nTo the ... thanks for\nJoining us on a Monday morning answer Brian Whitman and Jennifer Horn AM eight Seventy LA Orange County ...

a headed toward the U.S border President Trump making the case as he has before with similar caravans\nAre making their way toward our border that they're not bringing their best\nWhat are the things I think we know is that the uh illusion that this is due primarily to law lawlessness in these countries has been dispel by the numerous interviews that the media has done with participants the caravan saying they're coming here for jobs\nNow you know the the economy in these countries is not as rich as ours obviously\nBut a history of catch and release in two thousand Thirteen and fourteen has encouraged discontinued behavior so we're seeing another caravan headed towards the United states at oh guess what election\nTosh President Trump in Arizona over the weekend rallying the faithful

deal right mayor Garcetti when you're on CNN\nYeah that's what I figured so he got on a state of the union with Jake Tapper which is one of their Sunday Morning shows one of my favorite aspects of Monday morning the answer is that we get to review what happens on the Sunday shows because people have full lives after going to church maybe you're having breakfast for their family after church before church\nAnd a lot of people don't see the Sunday shows well Jake Tapper state of the union\nUh which is on nine a was actually on at six AM if you want to be up really early in the morning our time and then it's on at nine that I think it's on again at twelve\nA Jake Tapper had Eric Garcetti on there the mayor of Los Angeles listen closely to the back and forth that they have your uh first stop\nGuard said he is asked if he has any day of any advice for for Democrats\nIn this uh mid term down to the wire Fifteen days to go a lecture and\nWhy doesn't the Democratic message\nWhy does that resonate enough with Latino voters\nBut I think it's really important to do two or three things one is to speak to Latinos\nAre in the communities where they are run more Latinos and invest in long term you know political infrastructure Latino communities Latinos are not ... you know they trace their ancestry back to South America Central America to Mexico like in my family and the Caribbean um and if we're a very diverse group\nAnd we care about a lot more than just immigration though are passionate about having sensible immigration policies that don't go after our families\nI think it's really important to talk of education\nTo talk infrastructure to talk good jobs\nAnd the future work so you know people will show up when they are being talked to and we're placing a lot of investments in California and that I'm trying to get that in other states as well but it's a good message for Democrats everywhere but there's a growing population is an important part of America um but you can't ignore it either\nLA mayor Eric Garcetti on CNN yesterday goes on a evolving his theory that the Democratic party should run more Latinos so when\nYou have certain races where there are a Republican Latinos are running against a non Latino in those districts that a majority Latino that can be a tough sell and Latinos have applied to the Hispanic surname or to have somebody who they know comes from the same background and they're willing to cross over sometimes\nI think this time though it's very clear we've got such a hostile president\nTo Latinos in general to working people in America have been anti middle class anti rules\nUm a place that has really unified I Lived with a center as I said local communities there's really to Washington to sorry to America as but it's not the red and blue and the rural and urban immigrant non immigrant I think it's Washington and the rest of us\nAnd that's the message I think that resonates a lot with Latinos and all Americans\nAs mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles yesterday on Jake Tapper program state of the union on CNN Garcetti is asked the question he must always be asked about his plans to run for president in twenty twenty the rumor mill has been churning that one out for several months now\nOr first and foremost a having conversations at home but I'm mostly focused on the next sixteen days and making sure we have a Congress because\nPresident Trump is on the ballot but a Congress that enables him is that seems to be either bullies brown those those are among those folks are either kissing up to the president folks are marrying his bully willing or folks are just as effective at getting anything done\nUm but I'll make a decision probably the next couple of months and I do hope whether I Do or not the mayor's do look at this I think mayors get things done\nUm you know we know energy policy 'cause we owned utilities supportive LA is America's port together with Long Beach bringing forty percent of our international trade in by seeing what we deal with public safety issues we have to create jobs fix education\nBut I think that voice is really important and you know when President Trump got out of the Paris climate accord so we've got four hundred and twelve cities to say we'll do it instead because we're on the front line with our firefighters dealing with historic fires and floods\nSo I'll I'll have some important conversations at home talking to a lot of other folks but really I'm just pushing hard for the next couple of weeks to see if we can change this Congress and get a group of people that are more responsive to local government local communities and the average American\nOkay there he is on CNN yesterday Mayer Albert Einstein that would be mayor Garcetti\nSorry oh I'm Sorry I get them confused it right you you know it's amazing in those and I know it was a big deal ... to be on CNN\nI Know it was a big deal for you but uh did you hear what I didn't hear\nThat's ... that's a couple of things I didn't hear that he talks about why you know Hispanic values should be aligned with the ... he didn't say what they were well that's what I didn't hear okay here's what I didn't hear\nThe mayor of Los Angeles in his second term with some significant challenges on his plate I didn't hear mayor Garcetti once in these highlight flips\nSay the word homelessness I didn't want to hear him say the word traffic I didn't want to hear him say the word fires how\nCould the mayor of Los Angeles appear on a platform as large as CNN on a Sunday Morning\nThe mayor of Los Angeles who should be concerned about the problems confronting Los Angeles not about the balance of power in Washington DC is not a member of the federal government he's a locally elected elected official of the municipality known as the city of Los Angeles\nA no mention of homelessness traffic or fires question really becomes do we have a mayor who's really focusing on these important issues that you and all of us care a great deal about or seem more concerned\nWith a running for president I make\nA decision probably the next couple of months and I do hope whether I Do or not that mayor is to look at this I think mayors get things done\nYeah we'll get things done we'll get things done Eric Garcetti get things done solved the homelessness problem make as much progress as you can make on the issue of traffic\nOr deal with the fire is you get out there and clear so that brush I mean do some of these basic things before you think that anyone in their right mind would greenlight your ascension to the presidency of the United states I mean this makes me curious\n... party does Eric Garcetti belong to he happens to be a Democrat so I just want to let it be known that as much criticism of the year of Brian when I'm Out and about the Brian is just being I think honest year about\nThe performance of a politician yeah party doesn't matter it doesn't matter in this case you\nKnow it doesn't matter in this case I mean I'm proud to be a Democrat I'm proud of you called me a liberal I'm a proud liberal but we got the mayor of Los Angeles mayors jobs Rudy Giuliani when he was the mayor of New York\nUh I Lived there during that time I was on the radio I was one of his critics but he he made a quality of life a big deal\nHis big deal was to get the squeegee the guy she would come up and and spread the dirty water nuisance ... public ... public ... so called body of life issues a mayor Garcetti how you could appear on such a large platform and slap your yack\nAbout Latino and reaching out to them and the twenty twenty election no no no no no focus on Monday focus on today the twenty second in October\nWhat are you going to do to solve the homelessness problem the traffic problem the fire problem that we all live with in the city that elected Jew and pays you a hefty salary to serve as mayor and solve problems\nThere's there's there's a lot I'd like to dig into a on this topic with especially when he talks about\nAh getting more Hispanics run\nFor office I think that's true we do\nA interesting little anecdote as we wind up this segment\nThere is a book there is a billboard that is flying out in the Palm Springs area that says Hispanic values are Republican values and she spent another weekend in Palm Springs a note with your with your friends\nNo I did and unfortunately I was I was solidly locked on the west side of ocean pirates of the billboard say says Hispanic values are Republican values\nAs much as I think turnout is going to be diminished it's going to I think it'll be higher than usual for mid term because people were animated devote there's a lot of great things on the ballot important things in the ballot\nAnd Democrats are being given a reason to turn out and Republicans have reasons to turn out now\nAnd now that White House press secretary Sarah hit can be Sanders ticket would be no hook to mispronounce some odd I mispronounced a she was kicked out of the red hen restaurant right yes drawn to go after dinner there it ham and they\nAnd Ted Cruz was harassed at another restaurant and outing with his wife Heidi\nGot a new one for you on this Monday morning diners confronted\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell while he was eating at a Kentucky restaurant\nThis happened on friday over the weekend CNN reported that the senator was approached by a group of men while eating with his wife Elaine Chao who is also the transportation secretary and the Trump Administration and beautiful Louisville, Kentucky and a\nOne man I shouldn't laugh 'cause this shouldn't happen I'd like to stop happening we need more civility in our politics and there's one person I really blame for this and the a and his first name starts with the in his last name starts with tape\nA here's what one man shouted to Mitch McConnell why don't you get outta here why don't you leave the entire country another woman told TMZ the diners focused on McConnell's plans to cut Social Security and healthcare or microphones were there this is not a bit a Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell being confronted at\n... what's the name of this restaurant do they say the name of the restaurant\nOr they keep quiet where does he ... they ... they're probably well no I Would I Would say that they're probably vote ousting chow chow chows are asserting Matt ... [laughter]\n... thought it was just wait a minute yeah that's not the only time of arrest you could be I don't know the name of the restaurant it's out in this report but anyway here's what it sounded like when Mitch McConnell\nIt was sounding more and more like Don Imus a duck confronted\nOkay they threw\nTheir lead they even dumped the to go box that he was carrying\nThe restaurant Mitch McConnell was that with his wife Elaine Chao is called Havana run by that is no way to treat anyone at a restaurant on a friday night on their day off if if his greatest and\nHe is a being a U.S senator and and uh pushing forward a controversial agenda or the man should still be able to eat in peace with his wife\nAnd you should see there's still picture Mitch McConnell he looks like he'd been hit by a truck he couldn't believe what had happened this type of thing folks I had been saying for a long time\nI shut it too I said at the Trump skins I set up to Trump supporters\nI said you are eroding the civility of of the uh politics in America and I believe they've eroded it to this point\nWhere where it's it's a you know every ... every action\nUh every action breeds a reaction and the reaction now is to uh is to turn on Republicans like Mitch McConnell and confront him at Havana run the restaurant on friday night I don't think this is the way we want to practice politics in America I don't think this is the civil war the healthy way to practice politics in America\nAnd I say that if it were Mitch McConnell or if it were Amy club which are having dinner it makes no difference to me\nAnd I and I would say that the blame does not belong squarely at Donald Trump's supporters I went to a Donald Trump rally early in the campaign and coastal Mesa\nAnd I witnessed or the activities that were happening outside of that event\nPeaceful Donald Trump supporters going to a rally in ... so we're accosted by a group of roughly three hundred\nLargely young Hispanics carrying the Mexican flag spinning releasing the street harassing peaceful Donald Trump's supporters as they exhibited their event so to say that it's Donald Trump\nSupporters don't think I didn't have actually Donald Trump is responsible for a lot of the erosion of civility in politics\nYeah well this happened even before Donald Trump had the opportunity to erode this this was the reaction to

and I said what did you work there for like fourteen days and he was very funny correct me said no eleven [laughter]\nSo I I I like the ... which he briefly held the position of White House communications director on Sunday with Chuck Todd on meet the press he said the problem at the White House is um that chief of staff John Kelly\nDoes not personally like President Trump Scaramucci told Chuck Todd and we have audio here on meet the press yesterday quote he doesn't come across that he does like Trump here's a bit of meet the press Sunday Morning show recaps on your Monday morning answer Scaramucci on meet the press did you feel\nPersonally mistreated by John Kelly he seemed pretty seem pretty upset at him and his book well listen not you know he didn't need to fire me the way fired me and I had this conversation with the president you get it done it ended up from an early I mean come on I gave a tremendous amount of money to campaign raised a tremendous amount of money\nAh did countless hours of media advocacy during the campaign and the transition and even after president was inaugurated a there was a better way to fire me but he was trying to make a spectacle out of it and so he got the spectacle what he wanted and it\nSaid it was it was upsetting at the time or I write about in the book\nUm what I thought was an honest assessment of him and I'm I stand by the wars in the book should the president even have a chief of staff given the way he likes to work [noise] I think he needs the cheapest step but he needs to stay there really likes him\n[noise] [noise] yeah and Scaramucci goes on and says he needs the chief of staff that gets his personality Chuck Todd says you don't think John Kelly likes the president's Sharon ... says do you\nThink John Kelly like the president\nI mean I yeah I I I Know that all Muslim and I don't want to I don't want to call it let me say I travel around the country and I asked people that rhetorical question does it doesn't come across like into she does and and by the way the the Bob Woodward book I don't know he seems like a pretty accurate journalists to me and so\nI don't like John Kelly calling the parts of the things that just called them I think it's I think it's wrong and and so for me\nI have no problem standing up for myself or or telling you what I think about John Kelly or situation with the president\nHaving said that I applaud the guy service but it's not just me truck you know he he hurt the morale inside the place and he's he's hurt the president and so ... and he has his he ... he left last week after the\nUh the report that he had with them Vassar Holton that's personality\nOkay in Bob Woodward's book done ... a chief of staff John Kelly is quoted calling President Trump\nCalled unhinged end quote an idiot close quote ... says I don't like John Kelly calling the president the things that he calls him I think it's wrong\nAdding as we heard there he hurt the morale inside the place the White House she's referring to at least hurt the president and he has those his she fits that we heard about\nWhat I mean look at it this is just another example I mean Rex Tillerson\nA ... you've got John Kelly I mean you've got a list of people you've got Gary Cohn taking memos if you believe the Woodward account if you believe the op ed in the New York times from what now a month ago you you've got to economic advisors taking memos off the president's desk\nFearing that he may act upon them\nA ... ... is the president's surrounded by people who don't like him or beat out his competency I think the picture is coming into focus that that's the case\nI think if you're someone like Donald Trump if you're a business person and you're going to run the government\nOr like a business you're gonna you're gonna butt heads with people a business owner wants stuff done now they want stuff done a specific way that is not the way Washington DC works\nWashington DC works is a bureaucratic nightmare and that's why we sent Donald Trump there to busted up but we will rake it apart\nOkay but we didn't literally send them there to be a businessman we sent him there to do\nI'm just saying that's the way a businessman operate\nUnderstood and your point is well made and and well taking we sent him there and the elected him to be president of the United states we elected him to leave the country we elected him to um as a first timer politician\nTo be president of the United states he's had almost two years and you would think there would be a learning curve as there are many jobs because being president is not the same as running IBM it's it's it's a different skill set\nBeing president being leader the free world is the most important job in the world is in Eighteen months now we're still hearing these reports that his chief of staff things he's an idiot and doesn't like them and a former staffer is saying that because he's witnessed it\nThan President Trump\nElected as a businessman turned politician maybe has not learned the arch you hear about the art of the deal maybe as not learn the art of the presidency in the Eighteen months that he's been there\nSome that's what the story tell me and that's alarming and that's what the New York times op ed piece is and that's what Bob Woodward said in his book along a lot of people don't believe that stuff and I respect your opinion if you don't\nBut but but I'm just telling you what I'm seeing here and reading\nI don't think anyone expected smooth sailing for Donald Trump presidency I think that there is to a certain degree a revolving door\nIn this administration but it's not as\nIt's not as a for a field as other revolving doors in other administrations\nLook we heard five days before Brock Obama took you know was elected we are five days away from fundamentally transforming America\nThe reverse of that Michael Moore just said that

save Los Angeles or at least to his level best to save Los Angeles mayor Albert Einstein of course wait wait wait wait wait wait\nAlbert Einstein Eric Eric Garcetti he's our mayor he was on CNN which is a pretty a pretty big deal and uh we we focus on Monday morning answer on highlight sometimes from the Sunday shows because we know you're busy you're going to church or a\nNew and breakfast you're spending time with family you know you might not be watching the Sunday show so so we watch 'em all and and we called all of the interesting interviews and we bring you the stuff\nThat we think would be a high interest to you so it must have been a big day yesterday for for Eric Garcetti to appear on Jake Tapper state of the union internationally on CNN and we understand won't be when he got to uh I think he went to a Sunset Boulevard CNN studio that is if he's home in Los Angeles\nIt was a big gave ... he was in Minneapolis are you serious are you serious guy said he did his interview from Minneapolis but he thought it was a big deal I Know that\nWatch your mouth mayor so on CNN with Jake Tapper state of the union there Sunday they're kind of signature Sunday Morning show\nLA's mayor said the Democratic party needs to take active steps to engage with Latino voters including putting more Latino candidates on the ballot Jake Tapper putting the questions to LA mayor Eric Garcetti yesterday on CNN\nWhy doesn't the Democratic message\nWhy doesn't it resonate enough with Latino voters\nBut I think it's really important to do two or three things one is to speak to Latinos\nAre in the communities where they are run more Latinos and invest in long term you know political infrastructure Latino communities Latinos are not ... you know they trace their ancestry back to South America Central America to Mexico like in my family and the Caribbean um and if we're a very diverse group\nAnd we care about a lot more than just immigration though are passionate about having sensible immigration policies that do and go after our families I think it's really important to talk education to talk infrastructure to talk good jobs\nIn the future work so you know people will show up when they are being talked to and we're placing a lot of investments in California and that I'm trying to get that in other states as well but it's a good message for Democrats everywhere with is a growing population is an important part of America um but you can't ignore it either\nMayor Garcetti continues on he is a push for the Democratic party to run more Latinos as Canada\nSo when you have certain races where there are a Republican Latinos are running against a non Latinos in those districts that are majority Latino that can be a tough sell and Latinos are pride to see in Spanish surname or to have somebody who they know comes from the same background\nAnd they're willing to cross over sometimes I think this time though it's very clear we've got such a hostile president\nTo Latinos in general to working people in America have been anti middle class anti rules um a place that has really unified I Lived with a center assassin\nLocal communities there's really to Washington to sorry to America is but it's not the red and blue and the rural and urban immigrant non immigrant I think it's Washington and the rest of us and that's a message I think that resonates a lot with Latinos and all Americans right\nNow that's mayor Eric Garcetti on CNN talking about how the Democratic party should run national races two weeks before the midterms he continues year as Jake Tapper a Jake Tapper no stranger to the rumor mill he knows the rumor mill churned out\nA ... a year ago that Eric Garcetti would like to run for president of the United states in twenty twenty\nOr first and foremost a not important conversations at home but I'm mostly focused and the next sixteen days and making sure we have a Congress as a\nPresident Trump is on the ballot but a Congress that enables him is that seems to be either bullies brown those are bunkers folks are either kissing up to the president folks or nearing has bully bullying or folks are just ineffective it getting anything done\nUm but I'll make a decision probably the next couple of months and I do hope whether I Do or not the mayor's do look at this I think mayors get things done\nUm you know we know energy policy because we owned utilities supportive LA is America's port together with Long Beach bringing forty percent of our international trade and by seeing\nWhat we deal with public safety issues we have to create jobs fix education but I think that voice is really important and you know when President Trump got out of the Paris climate accord so we've got four hundred and twelve cities to say we'll do it instead because we're on the frontline with our firefighters dealing with historic fires and floods\nSo I'll I'll have some important conversations at home talking to a lot of other folks but really I'm just pushing hard for the next couple of weeks to see if we can change as Congress and get a group of people that are more responsive to local government local communities and the average American mayor\nEric Garcetti on CNN with will ... with a Jake Tapper yesterday [noise] may I throw a penalty flag yeah a A R penalty flag I I've thrown at you see my wife ... here's the problem for mayor Garcetti here's Trump for any mayor\nWhen you are elected ... not to a federal office you're not a congressman you're not a senator or you know the president or vice president you're not even a pointed to a cabinet you're not working on a on a on an executive branches\nA committee of any sort you are a local locally affected official by the municipality of Los Angeles millions of people
