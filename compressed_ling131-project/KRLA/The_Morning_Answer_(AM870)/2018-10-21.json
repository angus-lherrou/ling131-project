for the most part folks are trying to do right\nUm you know we heard an awful lot about the ...\nYou know a a about the corporate landlords and all the proponents of prop ... spouse but the fact of the matter is there are hundreds\nOf small apartment owners are folks who have used this for their retirement um and and it was really really make a it would really hurt them in the pocket book um which is which is a sweater\nShow the folks behind ... if you give them the benefit of the doubt they're they're just trying to rein in the cost of housing in California but you're saying yeah housing is expensive but this wouldn't do that right\n[noise] well I don't think there's any arguing about the fact that we are in a crisis wanted right now as it relates to affordable housing but opposition ten does nothing to alleviate these problems in fact it makes the housing crisis worse and here's why\nIt is a perverse incentive to create any kind of future building going forward which is exactly the opposite of what we need we need more house and we need more apartments not last and proposition ten what actually create as I said that\nPerverse incentive to do just the opposite it would make us take several steps backwards in the end it will hurt the people you know\nLatinos and African Americans and some folks who are\nUm who who you know right now are are are suffering and trying to you know going from paycheck to paycheck to make ends meet those are the kinds of folks that frankly will be hurt the most and that's why you know word of ... on proposition ...\nYeah it's really kind of a supply and demand thing if you if you sell something and you're limited in the price you can get for it to the point where you're not recouping your costs into it and making a little money\nThen you don't sell it or you don't offer that service or you don't let it eats he too simple business equation and the other sides going to say look we've got rent control already going on\nIn many places and and those people don't seem to you know mind it they seemed to manage a the the your argument doesn't hold water I mean what do you think back to them when they say there's already a form of rent control in many communities in in ... seems to be working\nFire I'm looking to see them paramedics all public safety personnel operate and they're paid to be reached vulgar and get breaks in case that they're the closest one to respond and in fact the definition of I'm a first responder and emergency response\nSo to put this in perspective of the implication of the security guard rolling and what that can do to California's health care um heightened EMT them paramedics respond to about Seventy five percent of the state not among cause that's massive show proper eleven well established\nA are long standing practice of paying ... paramedics to be reachable during their break and we'll stop which that into law and it long shared the closest ambulance can respond when a patient called nine one one\nReally that's the heart of the Niger and I think that's why we have a twenty five newspaper editorials law enforcement local government tax payers business groups all supporting a prop eleven today so responders\nYeah who's against it who stand to uh to lose under this if it passes\n[noise] um I don't think anyone does a great thing for like the paramedics\nAnd like the trial lawyers you mentioned the bank they would like to have a cottage industry you're this kind of hurts them being able to go after you make a quick\nBuck nuances\n[laughter] very good luck is literally a so but I mean this really points out problem that has been going through California businesses would wage and hour lawsuits lately I mean this is just one piece of it but it's more than I think\nI guess people can kinda see the logic on if you're a security guard you get your walkie talkie there you know you're eating a sandwich somewhere and suddenly hey we've done tutor in you know area to you know it's like oh I got to know that because I'm eating my lunch right you can\n... and not to downplay the job of security guards but Pina Auntie Anne's paramedic is entirely different\nUm and it really is a matter of life and death and studies show that for every minute that passes without the PR to February later your chances of survival decreased by second to ... percent\nWhat is the is there any economic impact on this one way or the yeah\nYeah that's a great question though the nonpartisan legislative analysts office did an analysis of proposition can and they talked about what would be the implication is the security guard rolling\nGets applied it private industry what would that look like especially because they answer Seventy five percent of the state's nine one one calls and they estimated that it would cost local government tens of millions of dollars annually because they may have to subsidize\nThe company to continue providing a service\nIn their area so it's probably a lot of impact that it would actually save local government tens of millions of dollars dollars annually um LA oh also estimated if the security guard ruling applies to the private industry in trial attorney they're successful\nPatient could potentially the longer wait times because the companies that have to negotiate um\nYou know\nAverage higher response time the counties to to a comedy that so it's a ruling by trial attorneys or the sad fact by trial attorneys would really put patient care and safety at risk\nJoel how would you get around this when you have to have the cost of having a second EMT team it's set in their schedules in the first one so that one can go with the other wage doubled the equipment double the vehicles doubled expenses\nAnd it really just can't be solved by that but the issue is\nProbably the anti them paramedics have always been paid to be reachable during their break I think that is an emergency response to the same way that they're public counterpart\nA public and keep them paramedics firefighters and police officers all operate so the security guard decision what only applied to private industry and not public\nSo daily buddy right in opposition named the booklets for this\nNow there is no opposition argument and the voter information guy that the great questions\nNobody you know they're just trying to make these EMT people work harder without getting more money I mean you know I mean I'm I'm trying to think who would say that but I you're right that's their job right it is\nIt is and they want to respond they they want to respond Larry I'm that's why they got into the profession\nIs really about protecting against the law suits would've come because of all of a court ruling\nIt's about and sharing that when a patient called nine one one that the quote that they knew it can respond justice they've always done so\nNow you haven't seen no ads on ... you know people saying shame on you know I mean this is so different than some of the other campaigns that have been so contentious you're not saying officers here\nThere are some opposition groups that have popped up in the last couple of weeks or what are they saying it\nSo they're trying to get more money for the people that\nI think that you hit the nail on the cop and\nIf you're going to make me beyond cold and you've got to come up with the whole scheme well I Know in the private sector if you miss a rest period or a lunch they're using economic\nOh you do in like an hour we pay or something that ...\nYeah and probably looking at what is it that way it would have teeth and paramedics can be reachable during their break second break and they're not able to reschedule it like you mentioned California law and make sure that they have extra pay\nAnd then of course other workplace protections Blake thing out there Neal so they can have rats and they need\n'em that way their employer can't say ... you know you're launching it clocking\nSo that that the great thing and then it also says that the players should maintain that level so that they're able to accommodate for banks so it's got a lot of great things and I think that\nI Am most anti than paramedics and support it and and the public\nSo for the regular people who have\nYou know the hourly jobs in California he just launched by the fifth hour a break halfway in between forehand another break halfway to the you know eight ... you know before the tower and that's kind of been in\nThat fits our lunch has become a very contentious litigated point by attorneys using what they call partner lawsuits is just under that same era that do the same rulings and the same Supreme to they're trying to we went into these EMT firms\nSo Larry D. tell some of the cases against some of this law mom and pop ambulance companies but I haven't heard that some it will have to talk to them yeah yeah so\nYou're issuing ... you're encouraging folks to look at proposition eleven and vote yes on it because if they do then what will happen if they don't what will happen walks through the ...\nSo if you vote yes on proposition loving it won't allow private in either can chicken there a long standing industry I think after Fifteen Years I think have to be reachable during their break why\nSo that the clerk again the on can respond when you call nine one one it's that simple a proper loving also cuts into law at that\nEvery and can paramedic shake hate hate mental health benefits and nearly training famous standard for finding natural how for finding Kayla natural disasters and active shooter incident it\nIt makes common sense and with as many wildfire than a shooting that we think we should have every ... medical training and so that when something happens I think will happen that we can all hands on deck ...\nHouse showed alas help people understand where they vote on something by figuring out who put this together who circulated the initiative who got the signatures that kinda thing can you tell us a little bit about the funding behind it where it came from\nThe American medical leave the funder of proposition a lot and it's supported by the California ambulances says eight and a twenty five papers across state tax hair grew and grew\nAnd citizens against the law is at the California in your advocate please take a chamber of commerce and it's got a widespread support local government law enforcement so we have this broader coalition that I really believe that\nProposition alive and well the good for public faith and patient care and unfair that when a patient called nine one one to call it the ambulance can respond\nWhere Kim folks find out more obviously there's the voter materials that have been sent to them is through a website set up about this what would you encourage people to want to read just a little bit more\nBut much of the world is not buying it the Saudis say 'cause she'll gay was killed in a fistfight on their consulate in Istanbul they've arrested Eighteen people involved in that case and fired five top officials somewhat close ties to the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin ... on\nPresident Trump says he finds the report credible but we'll work with Congress to find ways to punish the Saudi Government\nJoining me now from Kentucky Republican Sen Rand Paul a key member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee senator let's start with your reaction to the Saudi account that ... was killed by accident enough testified at the consulate and that the Saudi crown prince had nothing to do with it do you believe the Saudi ...\nTotally not I think it's in it's insulting to anyone who's in analyzing this with any kind of intelligent background to think that oh\nA fistfight led to a December met with a bow and saw so no but I think we should put this this brazen attack as brazen murder getting contacts with Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has basically over the decades being the largest state sponsor of radical Islam and violent jihad they sponsor\nThousands of madrassas that teach hatred of Christians and Jews and Hindus around the world so this isn't the first instant this is just another in the line of long instance of Saudi insults to the civilized world\nI'm going to get to the larger relationship and among them but I Want to stay with this case at this point what do you think was the involvement of the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin ... on the king has absolve dumb and in fact has put NBS disease known in charge of the overall up Saudi intelligence [noise]\nI think it stretches credulity to believe that the crown prince wasn't involved in this and I think that's the way they're going to write this off\nAnd people in Saudi Arabia ought to be aware of when you're told what to do you go and do it and then they'll execute you and and put all the blame on someone else there is no way Fifteen people were sent from Saudi Arabia to turkey\nTo kill a dissident without the approval of the crown prince and that's why I say we have to be stronger than just saying oh we're going to sanction a few of these people and pretend like we're doing something I think we really need to discontinue our arms sales to Saudi Arabia and have a long and serious discussion about whether or not they want to be an ally or they want to be an enemy\nWhile you're suddenly got got tougher about President Trump was asked about the arrest of Eighteen people involved in the case ... and the uh firing of five officials some of them with close ties to the crown prince is what he had to say\nI think it's a good first step but it's a big set to let people know a lot of people involved I think it's a great first step to move there I Do I Do\nDoes President Trump's know something that you don't senator or frankly do you think he's covering for the ... [noise]\nI think the Saudis are an authoritarian government they and they are directed from the top down\nAnd you don't have people just going off and doing things on their own I feel certain that the crown prince was involved and then he directed this and that's why I think we cannot continue to have relations\nWith him and so I think he's going to have to be replaced frankly but I think that sanctions don't go far enough I think we need to look at the arms sale because this is not just about this journalist being killed it's about the war in Yemen where tens of thousands of civilians are being killed it's about them spreading hatred of Christians and Jews and Hindus throughout the world\nI mean thousands and thousands of the draw says teaching radical violence against the west\nThe Saudis have not acted as our friend and they need to change their behavior\nI I understand I understand that but I'm asking you directly about the president's reaction he says he finds credible an account that you find incredible why do you think he's doing exactly [noise]\nI don't know the reasoning or cat answer for you know the president's thought process when this I can only say that I think many of us looking at the situation think that this could happen in an authoritarian government without the crown prince being involved All right let's\nLet's talk now about punishment and what to do about it the president says he's going to work with Congress to try to find a way to sanction the Saudis but he made it clear one of the things he doesn't want to do area\nThat would prefer that we don't use as retribution cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work\nWhen she was six hundred thousand just\nNot last year long before all of this you came within four votes of blocking for their arms sales to the ... first of all what do you think the chances that you can get those four votes and blocked them this year and what about the president's argument that this means hundreds of thousands of American Jobs [noise]\nI think if we were to have a vote in the next couple of weeks on whether or not to sell arms to Saudi Arabia we would win overwhelmingly [laughter] that's what I think the powers that be we'll try to prevent us from having that vote they\nHave to announce a specific case of arms being sold\nAnd my production is they'll avoid doing that as long as possible\nWith regard to jobs I don't think arm should ever be seen as a jobs program bar on our arms are military arms the sophistication arms are part of our national the passage aren't something they're just owned by private companies they're owned by the country and I think we should never sell arms to any country unless it's in our national security interests\nI think the war in Yemen actually increases our national risk it makes us less secure in the middle east it makes it more likely to be involved in another war in Yemen so I think we should not be supplying the Saudis with bombs have been indiscriminately killing civilians just in the last month fifty school children were killed in a in a in a bombing of the school to a school bus\nOr they killed a hundred and fifty people at a funeral procession do the Saudis have not been acting and adjust trash and\nOne of the poorest planets on the earth millions of people that are placed starvation over a million people at Colorado and the Saudis continue to block their pores so no I don't think that there was a national security reason for us to be involved in the war in Yemen and that's where our arms are going so I Would cut up arms sales that's the only thing the Saudis or listen to well\nAn interesting figure Russian President ...\nUh talked about this and he said that he believes that the U.S has a double standard he noted that after the alleged poisoning of that Russian spy in Britain that the U.S expelled ... Russian diplomats and impose sanctions and he looked at the the lack of action so far and says that that's a double standard one does have a point\nAnd beyond blocking arms sales and you say you don't pick up the White House has even got offered them at this point what else should the u._s. do if anything to punish the Saudis\nWell I think there are there is a double standard and I think that the Saudis need to be treated as who they are on the Kunta context of who they are I don't think they are a friendly ally they had been spreading hatred of our country for a decade after decade\nWith regard to whether we sanction them or whether we have arms sales I think the arms sales actually will go on I think they will avoid announcing the arms sales\nTo try to prevent us from blocking them so I'm not saying that the Trump Administration will stop arms sales I think they will continue the arms sales and I think this is a danger that Congress many in Congress will act tough on this and they will pretend to do something which is sanctions\nBut I'm not even calling for sanctions against Saudi Arabia in general I don't think we should quit trading was already Arabia I think we should specifically quit aiding and abetting them in an aggressive war in Yemen if\nHe would have been as we pointed out you have been a real skeptic of our relationship with Saudi Arabia for many years and you certainly given evidence of that today\nBut here's the counter argument for President Trump says that we depend on Saudi Arabia for cheap oil or cheaper royal he says we depend on the Saudi Arabia as a potential counterweight to Iran and its ambitions in the middle east and that we can\nWe hope that Saudi Arabia will help us broker a peace deal between the Palestinians and the Israelis you think he's wrong on all those French\nThere's just thousands you're older or in the middle east between Sunni and Shia and Saudi Saudi Arabia's put it up against Iran the biggest thing that destabilize the middle east and I think the president agrees with me on this was Iraq War there was much more of a balance in the middle east at that time but if you look at military spending right now the Saudis\nAnd the Gulf she dumps that are their allies spend eight times more than Iran and so there is an arms race but when we supplied arms to Saudi Arabia Iran responds so when we complain about the Iranians having ballistic missiles that they are developing they're doing that in response to the arming of the ... it's a bilateral arms race that goes on and on\nAnd so I wouldn't continue it I don't think we need the Saudis\nThe Saudis lead us much more than we need then we have incredible leverage their air force it's entirely American planes they can't last a couple of months without parts and mechanics fail them run their air force we train their pilots they're completely dependent on us we need to tell them to have and if they're not going to have and that includes cutting off funding\nTo all the schools that teach hatred of Christian Christians Jews and Ender's [noise]\nI I Want to get and we're running out of time to one final subject it appears that President Trump is about to pull out if the child the Russians that we're going to pull out of the INS medium range missiles trade a a treaty that Ronald Reagan signed with Mikhail Gorbachev back in Nineteen eighty seven here as the president yesterday after that\nWere the one in eight in the agreement and we bonded agreement here today remains are we going to terminate we're going to roll out\nI got about a minute left the president says he will stay in the ... only if Russia and China which was not a signatory to the high enough rate will abide by its turns your reaction to this er [noise]\nI think it's a big big mistake to flip in league get out of this historic agreement that Reagan and Gorbachev us on this was a big part of Reagan's legacy and we should not get rid of it it was an important step we went from sixty four thousand nuclear missiles down to Fifteen thousand it has been in a store to agreement\nI think what we should do instead of getting out of it is I've asked the president of advised him privately and in public that we should point nuclear negotiators nuclear arms control negotiators\nTo actually work with the Soviets we have complaints that they're not in compliance they also have complaints that some of our missile launchers and Europe are not in compliance let's have a rational discussion with experts on this and see if we can resolve\nA was a result of a fist fight he's acknowledged the incredulous that but I Do think as well that there's a lot that they're trying to balance here the the the Iran funding and Hamas and Hezbollah is killing westerners continue throughout\nThe middle east and Saudi Arabia is our ally that is a challenge that we need to navigate demonstration needs to step forward they need any more aggressive wells Congress will act I do\nBelieve I I I Want to bring the congresswoman in here and not because I thought what what Senator Paul so it was very interesting which is that we over\nEstimate the importance of Saudi Arabia an underestimate our leverage over them that if they if we buy oil from them they sell the oil to us and as he pointed out are their air force is completely a ... based on American planes if we held up a weapon and spare parts they'd be grounded than a month\nFollowed feckless war in Yemen which is the largest humanitarian catastrophe on a planet right now\nShows their own capacity to fighting force despite our weapons which may have paid for and so I Do think we have leverage I wanted to say though that ... however his name is pronounced\nWas about to be a journalist a scholar at the Wilson

on\nYou and send them a had a debate this week and a key moment came near the very end of the debate when you know to the back in two thousand three your opponent was on a radio\nTalk show and the host hypothetically talked about joining the Taliban and kissing sort of a sudden quote I don't care if you want to do that and that led to this exchange and the debate\nHas right now what we're going to apologize to the veterans me for saying it's truly are running out of the times found Martha has chosen to run a campaign like the one you're seeing right now where she gaining and ridiculous attacks and clearing my campaign\nCongresswoman do really think that there's been sort of low was approving for use them [noise] [noise]\nWell it's her words crafts uh it's totally out of step with American values when she clearly says in this radio interview she has no problem with that American going to join the Taliban and look Chris this this is personal for those of us who served and actually fought against the Taliban\nWas a squadron commander over there with my eight ten squadron were getting shot at by the Taliban the Taliban was killing Americans and I'll tell you the worst days we had at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nWas when an American gay there last breath fighting for freedom in fighting over there and was killed by someone from the Taliban or their affiliates\nWe would stop everything we're doing\nPretty good line up along the ramp as their flag draped casket came by and we would each then salute and silence you couldn't hear a pin drop\nAs we said goodbye to this American Hero who was killed by the Taliban so this is this is out of step with American values this is personal to those of us who went over there to fight a and and it just shows that she is qualified to be in a United States senator\nI fully understand your your feelings and emotions about what you went through in and of course we honor your service as the first female a U.S fighter pilot to to ever see combat which is historic but but to get back to the campaign ... says look\nI had two brothers in the military one of them is still serving in the military she said the structure also going off of presenting all kinds of hypothetical ideas and I was just trying to shut him down and get back to the fact she says that she opposed the Iraq War which was just about to start in two thousand three\nAt well Christie continued to make excuses as she has yet to make an apology but look this is a pattern for my opponent right after nine eleven a moment when the country was unified in our healing and our morning but also unified that we've got to go back go after the Taliban who ... who killed three thousand Americans\nKitten cinema was protesting right after nine eleven any military action against terrorists she was protesting later and I think to to\nShe was leading protests multiple protests inviting anarchist socialist other handing out flyers out her protests depicting American Soldiers\nI skeletons and saying we're the ones conducting terror in the middle east\nSo this isn't the pattern of my opponent over many years where she has been a radical left activists Ed Green party activists and very much against our military and I mean these are the facts I Need to come out in this campaign I can I to me who served twenty six years in the military three hundred and twenty five combat hours fighting for our freedoms\nAre on the other hand uh she's taking some uh attacks are making some attacks against you and I want to talk about one of them according to the latest Fox News poll the top issue for voters around the country as health care and son in law is hitting you on that she notes that you voted for repeal\nAnd replace last year which under its terms would have allowed stage to let the it would have ended up permitting states do allow a insurance to be sold for people with preexisting conditions with higher premiums here was watching them I said about you in the debate\nThe reality is the air at science are worried about losing access to this critical coverage and Martha voted to take that protection\nYou acknowledge that protection for people with preexisting conditions was significantly weaker under repeal and replace than it was under Obamacare\nChris I Am passionate about protecting people with preexisting conditions and forcing insurance companies to provide them health insurance I voted to make sure that they had that uh that coverage\nOf this is a classic editor laughed all over the country the lives that they are perpetuating uh in order to play upon fear the reality is it Obamacare right now is not covering people with preexisting conditions we can't go back to we were in the past\nAnd we all know somebody who had diabetes or cancer survivor asthma who couldn't get access to health insurance\nBut their intentions don't equal policy outcomes I met an entrepreneur last week who decided to start a small business with a preexisting condition she uncovered right now under Obamacare So we're trying to move towards a system that provides more options more choice for people or the lower the
