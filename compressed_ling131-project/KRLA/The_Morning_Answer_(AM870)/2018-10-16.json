impersonating Don decks and this is Larry Marino impersonating jet it's an amazing duo sitting in for the vacationing Jennifer Horn and the temporarily\nOut sick Brian Whitman\nLarry Marino is joining me here on the morning answer and Larry I got to believe that the reason that Brian women could not make it into days because he couldn't handle the lead news story that is sweeping the nation and upsetting the balance of power here we are Twenty one days out before the midterm election three weeks\nThe October surprise turns out to be\nElizabeth Warren and her DNA test\nI'm Mazie who would have thought that I mean what political consultant in their right mind would have looked Elizabeth Warren in the eyes and said this is a good idea and this is going to make your presidential run she is literally suck the oxygen out of the room for every single Democrat running for any office across the country\nAnd there's so many parts the story oh my God you unpack them here or whether you believe in cultural appropriation whether you believe having an emergency possibility somewhere so many generations back they can identify that makes you this or that we\nGot a lot to talk about the entire progressive orthodoxy of what is sacred within the progressive movement of the Democratic party is that it ... doing the face plant today here is a ... campaign commercial that Elizabeth Warren aired disclosing the results of her DNA test\nThe problem with the DNA tests now\nLike to call my mom a liar what is the fact that we have a Native American ancestry and you're\nNot in real time only times determine trials which I understand ... ... family history is my family history\nPocahontas this isn't just casual racism or who needed to me have faced discrimination neglected in violence from generation interim\nCan say whatever he wants to [noise]\nMocking Native Americans or any group in order to try and get me\nA lot of Larry Marino that is a ... I think she's got a new name today ...\nShe parsed words in there if you listened very carefully she tried she already knows she has a problem because the percentage what one one thousand\nIs so small it's not going to be recognized by any official status was she tries to debunk that we have the story that came out on USA Today the Cherokee Nation is already slammed Elizabeth Warren the DNA test is inappropriate and wrong I mean there's a lot here\nThere is a lot here and even the Boston Globe that originally was given the story had to do to updates because they got the math wrong originally they came out and said she somewhere between one thirty second and won five hundred and twelve\nA Native American and it doesn't even the uh unfortunately the test doesn't even narrow it down to a tried so her claim of big belonging to the Cherokee Nation is specious anyways because you go back apparently in order to get that kind of a number you were talking going back six generations great great great great great grandmother\nAnd the reality of it is as I understand that Larry any DNA test of an individual is going to come up with\nA percentage of Native American in virtually every person but uh this this this gene that's detected is actually present in most white Caucasian\nWho's lineage is from Europe it exactly right there's life here that she is trying to have us assume but\nBack away for a second this whole concept of cultural appropriation we were talking before the show about her listing of her ancestry at Harvard and and the rule it plays and there are people out there who wrap themselves\nAround something to get somewhere in the big question is did she used this to improve her status or her ranking\nIn her life's work did she take place someone else might have been\nKilled Larry if you and I to uh when we were when we were in college ... ... we never thought anything about showing up to a college Halloween party dressed as an American Indian dressed as some in some costume\nWe're today those individuals are drummed off catalyst shards of cultural appropriation so is it turns out she tried to get an advantage over other people by claiming a status\nTo what she is not entitled which may be the worst form of cultural appropriation out there this she took one of the most victimized\nA groups in America the Native Americans\nAnd she used it for her political advantage I you\nKnow I was I had to turn around yesterday who watch Fox News switch over to CNN even some of the people on the panel in CNN we're saying wrong time to do this so my God I shouldn't days away\nYou know not the percentages that she needed to really make her case here and she's shifted to the topic back to uh it's all about me why why would you take over the mid term elections that aren't supposed to be\nAbout her that her three weeks away Twenty one days and she is completely derailed at\nUm the the worst part about this she couldn't come up with a single American indian and her family tree now the Cherokee Nation has actually come out and issued a statement we're going to hear from the Cherokee spokesperson Chuck Hoskins about this claim\nThe problem with the DNA test is that it proves nothing of relevance to whether a person is a citizen of the Indian nation\nThe Cherokee Nation is is a community is slamming Senator Warren she thought she was going to walk out there and say aha I got ya I was right you are wrong and everybody would bow down to her\nHere's Donald Trump's tweet Pocahontas the bad version sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren is getting slammed she took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may have one\nOne thousand twenty fourth far less than the average American\nNow the Cherokee Nation denies or the DNA test is useless even they don't want her Sony exclamation parked our we've got Fred in corona he's got an idea about how much to pay Elizabeth Warren Fred\nI'd like to comment first one is I think that\nThey should pay a percentage for what for maybe a hundred bucks and number two I Donald Trump age if you're honest because he's taken a famous any woman and her by her name to denounce before and I I don't agree with\nThat you prefer spreading bowl\n... do you prefer spreading bowl or ...\nThose are the I prefer just to say I was born that what ... what do we stop this telling us\nThe exactly threats grownup thanks so much for your call\nDonald Trump is actually he's ... making hair there's another tweet now that her claims of being Indian heritage have turned out to be a scam and ally Elizabeth Warren should apologize for perpetrating this fraud against the American public Harvard called her a person of color and amazing con\nAnd would not have taken her otherwise that's the that's part of the big deal this Larry she used this lie in order to gain advantage over other people who are you see people of color\nThe left allows a lot of things but the one last thing that they don't like is cultural appropriation or they didn't like it member of the women who claimed she was from the end or at a number of CIA right yeah she was left out of there\nAnd Sean King who is white was also you know as an individual is claiming to be black turns out he is white\nYeah this is this this is the kiss of death it was for 'em and I and I forget the N. double ACP a individual you're talking about up in Washington but she was she was drummed out Sean King is now on the periphery\nAnybody that does this ultimately is going to pay the ultimate price\nPolitically and your rights even heart Harvard is is the place that actually law school once boasted that who was a bit Warren was the first woman of color to ever served on their faculty\nAnd of course this is this is Sonny development but Elizabeth Warren\nMisinterpreted how this would be read she was getting to get it out there and now it has backfired you've got democratic strategist saying what are you doing you're taking the narrative away this story is not going to go away\nIt's not going to go away it's not going to go away on your morning answer after the break CNN reports Saudis are preparing to admit\nThat

us that\nUsing talk your interest [laughter] right here on the actor [noise]\n\n\n\n\nAnd the conservative grocery France or level\nThe answer\nIs this your morning answer But Ryan Whitman\nNot here this morning because of the feeling of it Jennifer Horn out because ... it is done decks and Larry Marino you normally hear will be given us the news we're covering for your normal\nHosts here in the morning one of the things that happened that we were taught bright I were talking about yesterday were watching this very window as the entire Southern California was get a loan around heavily when I was heading back into the Inland Empire across the two ten yesterday\nI had to slow to thirty miles an hour at some sections of the freeway trucks literally getting blown across the road\nThose winds have subsided now doesn't seem like a it helped the Dodgers yesterday oh did not oh that was that was a brutal brutal defeat four to nothing will talk about that later but right now let's give you get an update on\nWhat the what the impact these winds were across the Southern California Larry well\nDone thousands of people still have no power this morning following that day of strong Santa Ana winds across the south planned and officials say\nMore than four thousand customers in LA county still electricity this morning\nAnd they're also nearly five hundred customers with no power in orange county and it's unclear when services will be restored yesterday the wind gusts we're up to Seventy five miles an hour some areas costs to master blackouts affecting more than fifty thousand customers at one point red flag warning remains though in effect for most of LA in orange county is\nTo eat tonight so there could be some more wins today maybe not as much and then the other stories\nDetails being released about that woman did you see the story about him and\nI did I did and I saw the size the eucalyptus trees toppled on her car as tragic\nTrees reliability unfortunately I mean when it comes to wind a tree comes down and you can look to trees don't have that\nMuch of a root system compared to how told it yet and so the street came down in orange county sheriff department as a dental ... the woman is thirty four year old the net Burma ... an autopsy is pending or for the official costs here\nBut they said that she was in her car yesterday one strong winds took down a large eucalyptus tree on ... avenue I Know that area uh she was trying to get on the scene they said that they had just spoken to her before the accident happened\nYou have family members says she is and was a nurse at an assisted living facility she was on her way to work when this happens who she was literally pulling out of her or driveway when these wins toppled a huge eucalyptus tree and I'll tell you what\nAs I was driving out to the Inland Empire you could see easily how how this could happen um you know normally the brush that uh is out there these wins the Santa Ana winds that Diablo winds that come down from the high desert a accelerating down the hill pushed by that high pressure system up there\nUm you know in those trees out there the small ones just completely bent over so you can see how the force now wins and you've got to think very unfortunate you've\nGot to think that in various city council chambers and you know city leader officers right now they're kind of thinking about this where do we have rows of trees that could come down\nAnd again the dirty little secret there is there's this effort to green Southern California and you know make it look less desert like and so there are these projects where they're putting in more and more trees in in the media is to try to do road separation and those things could come down\nPower was out in a number of places and uh they're they're having trouble getting restoring it in some of the northern communities because uh they're inspecting the winds uh\nThe electric companies don't want to turn these that the power back on because they're afraid that there's debris line cross lines this causing a real hardship for the businesses up there particularly the wineries the restaurants that uh you know they're losing food the hotels can't accommodate the guests\nAnd that's something new we saw the story yesterday about how utilities after these wildfires where they're being blamed for causing them are saying hey we're gonna shut off\nThe grid in certain locations when the wind kicks up because we don't want to be responsible for sparking a fire and as you mentioned in northern California they've done this and some of the businesses are saying hey not fair\n[laughter] that's right now we open up the morning answer with the story this literally sucking the oxygen out of the midterms this story about Elizabeth Warren releasing her DNA here is what it sounded like in the commercial that she ran talking about her Native American heritage\nNow president like to call my mom a liar\nWhat are the facts and that's what we have a Native American ancestry and you're better\nOff not him Rosen and try and only times determined tribal citizenship I understand in that family history is my family history\nPocahontas this isn't just about casual racism or who needed to have faced discrimination neglect them in violence for generations and\nCan say whatever he wants to know

the parents of taking enjoy morning answer so if you're hearing a little common sense a little bit of the things that you uh had been dying to hear it because mom and dad are in\nThe house well who's the mom and I don't fight it out and we\nWill deal with that later but Larry we've been talking about a big story right now the U.S this morning that has been sucking up the news flow has to do with a Elizabeth Warren in her DNA test\nBut it brings up another story that you brought to our attention having to do with the way that universities admit people to uh attack\nRight they have to make decisions on who's going to fit in there are only so many slots right at these top school so they they have procedures you know people have the SAT exams you write an essay or you do an interview\nFor a DNA test right I mean in a has a lot to do with whether you get into a university or ... as far as I understand it right\nAccusations that the Harvard University admissions process is rigged against Asian Americans were lobbed Monday the trial opens in the case that could become another landmark in a long debate over affirmative action these are students for fair admissions\nA group representing Asian American applicants alleged in federal court the Harvard violated their civil rights by penalize them for the race at key stages of deliberations\nWe have what too many is it is the problem we have too many Asian Americans attending or what's the deal why ... why did this case come up\nIt's interesting Asian Americans uh have outperformed other groups and they may have six percent of the population Asian Americans\nMuch respect much respect Asian American heart including hard working there the rage students they they're over achievers they're diligent parents take\nThem to class on the weekends I mean to play music so anyway they're represented about twenty two percent at Harvard so technically they're at a grill over represented represented in what's being alleged here\nIs that Harvard gives Asian Americans significantly lower ratings for subjective personal qualities including leadership and compassion and applicants from other racial groups so that there are alleging that Harvard has found a way to\nTo to knock down the Asian score so that there aren't so many of them even though they perform in the whole issue of\nRace probably shouldn't be included but academia has bought the idea\nThat schools should reflect the diversity of the regular popper population that they have an obligation to to balance is what they're trying to do\nNow is this a little like that Tom Cruise movie called Minority Report where they would determine through I guess some kind of a they had this person locked up in a room that would essentially connect with people and be able to determine that they were on the verge of bleeding or crime or that they had free ...\nAnd you'd see Tom Cruise run and go capture someone before they did a ...\nRight and and I and I've just recently heard that and I can't remember who it was but I was a senator that was critical of federal judges because they were as a part of their findings\nOn a variety of different issues they were impunity motive and and and thought processes to Donald Trump and I think this had to do in part\nTo the uh the the ban on Donald Trump's a\nYou know what they would they referred to as the Muslim ban there was the ban on against seven countries and they were impunity motive and they were they were going through what what is his thought process that caused him to do this oh it's a racist thought process therefore as a judge we have to fight against this case not on the merits of the case\nBut on the underlying uh motives and thought processes of the individuals involved in the case so what\nThey're suggesting here is that if you're African American you have a greater chance with great test scores of getting into Harvard than if you're an Asian American with a higher test score\nBecause the school is coming up with ways to balance things to create this diverse backgrounds are in their classroom whether you think it's right or wrong I mean it comes to a fundamental question of\nWhat should schools consider shouldn't it be just about\nHow well how hard you worked well no schools think it should be about making it an opportunity for all we have an opportunity to balance things\nNow now keep part of this a of a part of the ... and why we brought it up and why this story is part of the morning answered this morning is that an array of Harvard officials\nAre going to be put on the witness stand in what promises to shine a rare public white on the details of the admission process\nThat are normally shrouded in mystery a college bound students and parents around the world\nEffectively have no real understanding of how this works you fill out the application you try to do it in a way that gives you a student your kid or you know the best opportunity the best chance of working its way through the admissions process you're trying to define divine almost\nAn algorithm that exists in these university yeah so you don't know the algorithm and the\nPlaintiffs are alleging that Harvard engineers every year a precise racial balance of admission offers that gives an unfair edge to less qualified applicants\nFrom other groups the plane is also charge that Harvard gives too much weight to race and fails to fully comply with the Supreme Court mandate to consider race neutral alternatives for assembling a diverse now\nHere's another very important aspect of this story because ultimately a no matter who wins or loses this case it's going to be appealed it for sure if Harvard loses his case they're going to appeal it if the plaintiffs lose this case they're going to appeal it ultimately this case will end up\nWell the rose zero day uh made some of these the answer is everywhere on the year and so I Am a chimney on your AM eight Seventy smartphone

answer Brian the love of liberal Jennifer the conservative crusader are out today Brian feel a little under the weather Jennifer ... taken him so much time on\nYour radio activists in the voice of the news Larry Marino joins us this morning to help us unpack is give you the answer is you need to know part of the answers this morning to doubt up three sixteen\nThe NASDAQ of a hundred and ten the S. and P. up thirty four in a large part reacting to some great economic news us job openings rose to a new record high in August an indication that the U.S economy has continued to expand rapidly as the trade war with China escalated Hurricane Florence South Carolina's\nAh the monthly job openings and labor turnover survey otherwise known as Joel ... that's what we need in the morning ...\nBy the way this is a story you're not going to hear very much on the mainstream media\nThat sure that's actually part of the theme of this a segment on the morning answer is news you won't hear in the mainstream media we've got we've got a number of stories does here where there are more narrative doesn't know it doesn't you know the last thing that they want to do is acknowledged that Donald Trump is actually been good for something good for anything the economy\nWhich is really what drives voters ... was what drives boats\nWere three weeks away from the election Twenty one days ah from what is regarded as the most important in a midterm election in modern times\nThe the balance of power in the house ... you know sits in about will the Senate and it's looking a lot like the Democrats are going to have a really tough time taking back the Senate especially with the news breaking today of Senator Warren releasing this ill timed report on the on her DNA test\nYeah he even the left wing strategist who are trying to help the Democrats win these important reasons said nah a good time shouldn't have put this out it's all about Elizabeth Warren and not about the mid term\nThen it's all about the progressive orthodoxy of victim groups which Elizabeth Warren took advantage of in order to gain status or at her with her relationship with Harvard and they don't like it and she'd go down and neither do the Cherokee tribe the Cherokee Indian tribes is through a spokesman have what's a\nWhat's here right now from the spokes person\nOf the Cherokee Indian tribe telling us a little bit about their view of Elizabeth Warren and\nHer DNA testing jak like are\nThe problem with a DNA test is that it proves nothing of relevance to whether a person is a citizen of the Indian nation and member of an Indian nation\nDNA and best can give you some indicators of some markers that to indicate that you're related to somebody who live long ago that may have lived in North and South America and they had been a native peoples of those continents\nUm it's irrelevant to what it means to be a Native Americans in this country that that's the base that's based on a legal definition certainly ever tried to have that in common than we have some legal basis for citizenship that\nWe determine consistent with federal trainees just holy unhelpful for any national later to cling to DNA to determine a or to establish that their Native American in this country holy unhelpful Larry Marino and\nIn what is Elizabeth Warren do but she uses a is is to use it to suggest that she's been vindicated and it's not working because what what was the percentage of the lineage so far back that it's one one\nOne one thousand roughly one thousand twenty four one one thousand of her DNA takes her back to like great great great great great grandmother status and to a place where if each and every one of us did a DNA test\nIn fact I Would have been an interesting thing to have people who have done DNA tests callers to tell us did you find any Native American ancestry that you didn't know about and this is what we're learning from this test is that for a lot of Europeans for a lot of Caucasians\nNative American uh you know markers are prevalent in DNA\nAnd that's a great question to put out there we have morning answers your listeners who are out there having to work many of you may have done these DNA tests we'd like to hear from you\nIf you've done a DNA test and it actually came back shocker to you that you are part Native American\nOr given morning answer a call at eight

were you teach\nAs having this background a this is not doing well for her because it doesn't fit Decatur of President Trump or he has treated about it talked about it we have those of this morning and the clips from yesterday when he was interviewed\nWe can get into that but it it's a story that the left thought was going to silence it but it's not\nCall us at eight five five Seventy five eighty five five if you have DNA that shows that you are Native American another story that is coming up that they're not touching really in the mainstream media they're letting this one die federal judges dismissed Stormy Daniels defamation lawsuit against Donald Trump federal judge\nHas set aside this defamation lawsuit for a variety of reasons dead now remember Daniels had sued Trump after he said in a tweet that her story of a man threatening her not to come forward with her story of her alleged affair with Trump was a total ... job yet\nBut you're not hearing the story of the case being dropped in the mainstream media they're not spending time because it doesn't fit their narrative I watch last night I was watching CNN\nThey ended up covering this warns story and they had on some people don't even have the winds trying to defend her saying well yeah she has this show she's indicated he owes the money\nBut this Stormy Daniels store ... has dropped off the map\nAnd the bad the bad news here is is that the creepy ... now it's actually referred to is going to have to actually come up with attorneys' fees did\nYou see the story that said that he's on the list flight number eleven to run against Trump\nOh my God like next to say oh I say all I say is bringing along mark from two local lake has done a DNA test and he said he had a little surprised apparently mark from ...

seven percent that out that that same percentage that might be noted I might haired compared to what Elizabeth Warren's what was her percentage\nOf like light so lonely that might be enough to get him

nightly news tonight for more than twenty seconds\nWe'll let me ask you this is this favorable or unfavorable to Donald Trump let's favorable to Trump favorable to the Trump Administration than odds I Would handicap that not at all\nNot at all or this kind of news barely see the light of day we've talked about the kinds of stories that are the media likes to do we talked about the NBC story where they took\nA Trump ... a comment that Donald Trump made him out Ohio rally cowardly way out of context you know had to retract it ah and we're seeing the retractions becoming the order of the day for the mainstream media but you\nPut out the story wrong and you make your point and then you bury retraction later on\nIt is a it it seems to be standard fare for them and then of course the other story that we're probably not going to hear too much about is the story about a federal judge dismissing Stormy Daniels defamation lost on against Trump yeah evaporates\nThen and and Stormy Daniels along with you know Dr Christie and forward she was she was the darling of the of the left during Kavanaugh's hiring\nBut now they don't fit the narrative of what they're trying to do so they don't talk to them they don't follow up\nWondering how long the story about a a Senator Elizabeth Warren's DNA results is going to last in the media what do you think well this is one that actually should last a
