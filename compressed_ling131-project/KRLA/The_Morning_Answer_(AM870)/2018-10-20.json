Christian I still have that kind of ties how I react\nAnd Elena airs all fall at ... for the call April ... to get ready get ready for that time for all the strength and courage our Andrew\nYes I I think that's a very important question and a\nSide note is one thing one when we my wife and I were held together for Thirteen Days were arrested at the same time and I have a seminary degrees I ever tasted New Testament and I've taught for many years and\nPreached and yet I saw that my wife was stronger than I was during the Thirteen days\nAnd it came from\nA deep devotion and she has that I should say a consistent time with the lord every day for years she set time aside and she read the Bible and she just spent time in God's presence and prayed\nAnd I was more sporadic I'd run fast and then I'd slowed down but she was very consistent and uh it's not that she had incredible revelations every day but it was the but over time the consistency and just feeding herself so that when the crisis came and wear\nNFL together there are people and from ISIS and the cells around us and we thought what's happening what's going to happen we had no idea so we're Thirteen Days cut off a together and and that are holding fatter than she was doing better than I was ...\nFan so I thought this is a message says she carries and that I found uh that uh I Want to practice as well as emphasize just a consistent time spent with God it's strengthened says uh for the difficulties or will you be able to handle it when it comes\nA well\nYou get the grace at that time before and uh sometimes it doesn't feel like enough to be honest with you sometimes it doesn't feel like enough and I'm working through that but the fact is that it did it it was enough\nTo remind people pastor Bronx you kind of set of passing because I think his experience in Turkey for so long but because of the refugee flow out of Syria\nAnd that he was even in that original a holding the daddy poor taste facility\nOut there with his wife was a cruisers from ISIS\nYeah this is these were a difficult situation right from the beginning uh and then these are just a minute you got to remember that yeah the ... the ice is part of this because turkey was dealing with this overflowed people out of Syria some who were ISIS fighters so again I Want people to to miss that it it passed readers' comments were real right back\nTo the phones that David in Washington state on line five David you're talking to pass the Bronx I David hello\nPastor Brunson money does David ... on the Jewish American the airports were about ... by a more radical Islamic ... when I was stationed at ride my ... during the ... um especially considering my circumstances ended with you and how ... acts that was true\nThen although I can only imagine that enjoy them too many others that I Know one of the parliament on social media including those with Jewish ... create a single day\nSince all of that they still get another school as much as possible\nYou\nKnow pastor I was thinking about that too I mean we we you know you don't even we don't even know the ... we know the numbers of the reach that we have many millions or listening each day and all that but\nI think that the fact is is what David just said that you literally had the world praying for you know you felt lonely at times and we do we talked about that I hear on air but the world praying for you um ... made a huge difference in your life and and you release I Believe\nThat they they did and I as I said and I keep thinking again and again\nHow does that make any sense on a human level that so many people were praying for me and I think that God was doing this\nPutting us on people's hearts and it's because there's a much greater purpose behind this than he is going to use these barriers to bring harvest not only in Turkey but in the countries around it so it it's a very much a God thing we don't feel worthy of all of this prayer or many I feel very humbled by it\nAnd are not at all but incredibly grateful for it\nLet me go right to the phones John Mark in North Carolina on line three John Mark welcome you're talking to pastor Brunson\nThank you for having me on a and to tell me a sense of elation you fail and feeling of freedom you it is when you were released and also was there a Bible verse looking back in hindsight that has come to mind about your release and\nLet me and I just want to make a ... that's a great question let me I'm trying to get to some more questions you're ... and that's a great question so you're at the trial that ... on that the ... really the night of the release of the day the release and you finally find out when the judge says time served what went through your head\nWell I can tell you the ten minutes before that we did not know that that was going to happen we didn't know if I had a bag packed to go back to prison and we didn't know if they were going to get me Fifteen Years or twenty or what\nAnd uh we thought maybe this will just the lead to another escalation political escalation and who knows when all come out or it's all come out so when I heard time served\nA it was almost unbelievable and Noreen came up to me or near the front of the court and we just got down on the floor together we know together and we thank God uh NFL\nReaction inside the courtroom\nI think most people are ran out to file their stories they kept actually that day they kept most of the believers out who it comes to support is a they weren't allowed in the courtroom so it was primarily a media\nYeah I I couldn't imagine what it was like we had that was it was a lot of\nThe whole process I remember that night because I was talking to see see I mean all throughout the literally we say throughout the evening I mean it was the morning to in the morning three in the morning for in the morning and and that process of your release them and getting into the airport you know as long as you're walking through every phase of that\nHow would you like to make that much money in one week right because that's really what's happened over the last little bit of the markets have gone down we have erased three months worth of growth in the markets in one week's time well imagine if you could get to the point where you looked at it down market like Larry was saying it as an opportunity to generate income\nLiterally taking that opportunity and being able to make money as the markets are going down\nNow in one week ... the thing I Would like to point out to everybody is the difference between ten and twenty is the same whether you're counting up to twenty\nOr whether you're counting down to ten right if you're going twenty down to ten is the same as ten up to twenty right so when you're making money on the way down that's one of the reasons why we talk about how it's like getting a raise as the markets are going down as long as you understand how to generate that income and you have that skill to generate that income\nIt's like getting a raise in this case if you take that kind of apples to apples comparison it's like making as much in a week\nAs it was it making it in three months so imagine you're your employer coming to you and saying hey how would you like to make as much as you made in the last three months in one week\nWhat would your answer be you know I Would imagine that everybody's answer would be yes\nYou know and then it would be well what do I have to do to be able to generate that income well what do I have to do to be able to make as much money in a in a week as they did in the last three months\nWe just need to have one more skill you just need to have the skill of being able to time it bearish market and it's just like ... market it's just the other direction it's very simple process and it's something that\nLike I say we're talking about earlier is can be very very very lucrative and a lot of times a week and come back on to this because we want to do a little a little give away to help a few people get started but a lot of people look at it as and there's more risk and the thing is is there's not more risk and in some cases there's actually less risk\nAnd embarrassed market than in a Boston Market but one of the things that we can do to help people get started Larry's we get a big stack of tickets here for our show today we say we give away some passes to one of these have take classes definitely especially if there's somebody out there that now believes they hit a point in their lives when they realize they deserve more we gotta we gotta help them Ryan absolutely right now we've got to have to a class in your area\nThat have take classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to really generate that income more than the markets are going up down or whether the markets are going sideways\nAnd just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes going to be our professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like how do we Hansi retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now\nBecause you're twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight seven seven four zero three eight seven to three\nThat's eight seven seven four zero three eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his free O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nThat's one of the things I think people kind of miss on in a down market as it is we think oh it must be more risky and in some cases it's actually you can prove it out to be far less risky in a down market with how margin and different things work but at the same time\nAnything that we don't understand where usually afraid of it isn't it just mainly fear that holds people back from accomplishing their goals so absolutely you know and in fact\nI'll share a story I share with my students Jim the other day it was funny we were talking about this whole concept the fear of leaving a job\nAnd the worst thing that ever happened to any of us especially if you're listening is it all of a sudden you start working for someone else and then your net worth is tied up and to what other people defined it to be when they explain what I'm Talking about Ryan so yeah I remember the old story of the frog and the frog can jump as high as it possibly wants to\nBut if you want a frog in a box and you put a lid on top of that box and all of a sudden the frog tries a couple of times to jump\nBut hits the lead even when you take the little way the frog still will not jump higher than it could be for and that's kind of most of us out there we start getting into these routes we're relying on a pay check for somebody else we start to believe we can't make any more money and what's great what Jim is ... and a lot of other students\nAnd we've been doing this for over Twenty years right now is that feeling of when you first start making more money than you do at work because not all the sunnier this frog again you can jump very very high and all of a sudden that cap\nThat you've been believing your whole life has gone away and that's the sad part right now because most people out there are stressed out that they have to stand the job they have no other outcome or vehicle\nWhen reality you can go ahead and you can short the markets so great analogy like when I use is each week and I like using it as well I've said this over and over again when you're learning how to short the market meaning you're able to trade when the market goes down\nVery legal coach ... and the great part about it is I think of yourself in a car right\nOut and you know you want to go somewhere but if the car only one and drive and never went in reverse\nYou can eventually get there it's not going to be cost efficient for gas or time\nBut you'll eventually get there where why would you want to do that people do that everyday Ryan with their trading they're only looking in the markets to go higher and as you said when the markets go lower it could be an opportunity to buy at a discounted doesn't always mean there's a problem with the stock\nYeah absolutely right there there's opportunities all over the place and and I love what you're talking about what the frog because\n'cause it it you know I was teaching a class last night and I have another session with with the same group tonight and you know I was talking about how a lot of the the the obstacles that we have to overcome our mental right and and what you're talking about the frog hitting it's had on the boxing you move the box and all of a sudden they can jump up\nIs that it it is that ceiling that we're putting on ourselves right and we we have the whole ... I Can't do that type of a conversation I have a five year old son who who over and over the the word I Can't or or just not even really allowed in our house because we do start to put\nThose uh would you start to put those binders on us and and make it so that we realize oh if I jump high it's gonna it's gonna hurt my head as we stop even trying\nYou know a while ago they are you know ... years and years ago they they said it was physically impossible to run a four minute mile\nA ... ... about a week ago there was a world championships for Iron Man and Kona\nAnd the the winter and about a six minute mile for twenty six miles after doing a hundred mile bike ride laugh if you can't run a four minute mile you're you're not even on Olympic gold on Olympic track and field team anymore at least one for a minute mile not not to mention back to back to backs right\nSo so so these these these these restraints that we've put on ourselves we also put on our finances and we ended up kind of\nPainting that our own picture that we end up residing in it and if you're if you're willing to kind of challenge the norm and you're willing to put in a little more effort\nOr a lot can be granted to you and it really just does come from getting started and putting a little bit more effort in but we could have a few more people get started\nWe've got a stack tickets here the show is just

instructor it online trading ketamine really shed some light on different income streams of side of the market where talking a little bit about passive income\nWe're talking about active income we are talking about making money out of money not time is money money is money right and having our money working harder for us the average millionaire and we we ... and I both flip through this article a little while ago and there there was a report on how the average millionaire has\nFive or more streams of income out there and those multiple streams of income\nOr really would create that financial freedom that everybody's after right not just that one source and that one source of income when you have that sole source that is why\nJobs stance J. O. B. right stands for just over broke because if we're just relying on it we are just over broke because if it goes away we're in a world of hurt well in this segment here we want to spend a little bit of time on retirement accounts\nThe markets have been super volatile right we've had up big us we've had big down and so what can we do to protect those retirement accounts and whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time was there maybe been with us for the whole show get excited\nThe best is yet to come and Larry whenever I'm Talking with a lot of our listeners sometimes has to be a social media and a lot of them when it comes to retirement accounts are saying number one they're\nSaying they don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire or just not quite sure really what they should be doing with it and so what kind of the consolidated message that you can or individual messages whichever direction you'd like to take it\nThat that you and your instructor team early giving to those people who are concerned about their retirement accounts especially with the with a big drop we had in the market the other day well the simple thing I Would share with our audiences\nThe cavalry ain't come and there's nobody who's going to protect your capital better than you can right now and the way to do that with education\nI mean right now statistically about every ten years the market has corrected we saw fifty percent correction in two thousand uh fifty eight percent correction in two thousand eight\nWho's to say we might not see a sixty four sixty seven percent correction in the market imagine your four O. one K. becoming a one oh one K. and the reason for this this this is the first generation right now that it's been subjected to market fluctuations in your retirement accounts\nTo about a prior you had pensions that was completely outside of the market you're basically boss put aside their profits or payroll to make sure you had a retirement account and right now that's gone away you're completely dependent upon your four O. one K. and here's a scary\nThought right and you know I've talked about this all the time\nRight now people have been told and have been doing this pretty pretty habitually of putting money into their retirement account every two weeks when they get paid but here's the big problem and I wondered when to listen to this 'cause it's kind of scary right now is that you've been putting money into this market the last three years at an all time highs\nNot when the market was low swim imagine when there's another correction the first money that's going to come out is the most expensive amount of money that you've been saving towards retirement\nA lot of our students come in they want to learn the right way to be able to preserve capital how to make sure they're in the right funds when they're putting on their traits to be able to maximize\nFor their retirement and well a lot of things that we hear right now is can you see or do you see how this can really help you pretty much preserve capital over the long term\nIt's always buy low so high it has been for a thousand years it will be for another thousand years that that has never changed and that was one of the topics were ahead of my class last night as is the markets don't change the marks don't change we look at it on a phone\nInstead of looking at it on a on a on a ticker tape\nBut getting printed off right but the markets still don't change it's all about by low and it's all about so high\nAnd somewhere along the lines we kind of got distracted from that and I think the average investor is out there investing their money on payday and they plan to sell when they're sixty five and none of that has anything to do with price and so if we're not buying it a low price and we're not selling at a high price\nIt's pretty much impossible for us to make any money now one of the fun things about the markets whether it's your retirement account or whether it's your income account it's it's the same right it's it's all about just identifying a low price and buying and identify a high price and selling\nNow we get kind of caught up in this\nWhole emotional back and forth of maybe stocks that we love her or or or things that we want to be invested in rather than being invested in the right things and and now there's this guy Dan that ah when it first started trading I I I did a lot of work with Dan he was a a great friend ... you know acted as a mentor and many different kinds of aspects\nAnd Dan used to always say you can't live your stocks they're never going to have you back and he would talk about and he had a a little story to help you remember it I won't share though there but it was just kind of funny you say you can't live your stocks they're not going to have you back\nAnd think about it if you're invested into a company right now it doesn't matter what it is if you called them up they wouldn't even know who you are right but for some reason we fall in love with potentially investigating of this company who number one doesn't know who we are number two doesn't care about us they don't care about it on ... honestly why would they write\nAnd Larry you're talking about you know taking care of our retirement accounts on how nobody's going to take better care of it than we are and and it's it is true and the reason that I firmly believe that is because nobody has to live off of our accounts except for us right nobody has to live off of your account except for you\nNobody has to live off of Mike accept for me and so in the end\nAs kind of courses that can sound nobody cares\nRight there's there's not an institution out there that they that they stay up at night going men I Hope I Hope John and Mary have enough money in their retirement account\nYou know what they say that because they want to make sure they have enough fees being paid to them as long as their monies in a retirement account but every day there's a new twenty two year old that opens a retirement account replaces somebody who is closing their retirement feathers perpetual\nKind of ... income stream that comes from that anyway so at the same time though we stay up at night right the average person has many sleepless nights over money\nBut how much time as the average person spent getting educated on how to make sure their money is growing right I I find the financial markets very interesting because we go to a a car dealership and there's a car salesman there and we really don't take his advice on what we should buy but yet we go to a car dealership\nThat has the uh financial institutions name on the front of it where they're selling mutual funds and we take the cells persons advice to heart we go well he's the professional in the situation\nNow with a lack of education that's kind of where we end up ah falling behind the eight ball and the financial world one of the things that we can do is we can help a few more people out with that because we still got some tickets we can give away let's do it\nRight now we've got to have to class coming up in your area that the costs of ... exactly what it takes to really take control those retirement accounts and have them growing generating more income whether the markets are going up down or sideways\nNow included with your half the class include with your past is going to be a professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors the professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right now\nBecause tender twenty when he did a call now and reserved\nThose seats the number is eight seven seven four zero three eight seven to three that's eight seven seven four zero three eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there now Larry still kind of on this retirement check I Know there are a lot of people concerned about growing their retirement how can somebody number one protect against this potential downside\nBut also inside of their retirement account is there a way for them to continue growth as the markets are going down\nAbsolutely alone a lot of our students have figured out they can use other types of leverage assets to actually start accumulating wealth well our stock market isn't a downturn so this great ways that students can protect their wealth they can hedge against it they're learning about options\nAnd that's why they can do this three hour session to understand what's possible in the marketplace I can tell you firsthand talking to our students students like myself and you too we've been waiting ten years for this correction think about that most people are dreading a correction we are frantically waiting for it\nAs we're losing somebody else who made the right decision is actually out there making\nYeah and they're also living their lives for most of us right now with jobs are stressed out we're worried about losing our job especially for the correction comes again\nMost people are just one paycheck away from poverty and so a lot of our students are figuring this out how do I go from being emotional to becoming strategic and the way they do that as you get the proper education learning how a three hour session can completely change are alive and you know why and you know I've talked about this over and over again\nHolidays are coming up it's that time of year again everyone's going to make their resolutions yeah right well that's kind of silly because the resolution is basically your intention to do something and the two biggest ones we hear what I'm going to lose weight this year make rama an amount of ... you know out of out of debt and made our money\nBut the difference here right now is don't just make it a resolution make it a promise to yourself that you're going to figure out a way to get more financially secure\nYeah I remember my grandpa used to say this and I remember hearing it somewhere else too but I'm going to give him credit for it but he used to always say\nUh the goal without a plan and executed all plan is this is a dream you know go without a plan is a dream and and that's one of the things that we spend a lot of time on an online training academy is that step by step plan\nThat step by step process on how to accomplish the goal because\nAny and we are we're going to come up to the holidays here pretty quick and all of a sudden everybody is going to plan out their New Year's resolutions I don't remember all the statistics we went through it back in January on the show but it ended up being something like within four weeks eighty percent of the people have completely given up and I'm not even thought about their New Year's resolution and part of that is there wasn't an executed all plan\nThey didn't know exactly what to do tomorrow ...\nTo plan right now is the gyms do and they're going to start running their commercials in there and you know\nAbsolutely and they're going to make a killing thirty bucks a month but at the gym memberships skyrocket but at the same time\nThat you're putting our our best foot forward and giving us an opportunity to reach that financial goal is critical out there as well and and we have to do\nWhat we have to do what it takes to accomplish the goal we want to lose a little weight we gotta spend a little more time on the treadmill\nAnd we want to make a little more money we've got to get those skills and one of the places where we can really start bringing the knowledge that we can work our way up into that skill set is that at one of the half the classes

I Know you've used Korea Team right but for those that don't know about Korea teen it's mainly use in the Olympic circles professional athletes body builders\nCollege high school athletes because it does something extraordinary and what I'm about to tell you is proven by hundreds and hundreds of human studies so here's where Korea Team does for us\nIt helps us to get stronger\nMore powerful helps put muscle mass on the body and it helped protect us from losing muscle tissue as we get older we know that's a big part of aging not only that pat great for the brain great for memory and it helps promote bone strength as well so an amazing molecule that everybody needs to know about\nCan you share some of the science and tell us why you're calling Korea teen one of the best kept secrets to healthy aging\nSure pat what we need to understand with Korea Team is that it's a natural molecule to the body it's in every single cell tissue Oregon in your system and its job in the body is to generate and maintain strength and\nPower it's an every single cylinder body Ninety five percent of it however is in your muscle tissue because that's where we tend to use it the most it powers up the muscles it's good for strong muscle contraction and it's important help maintain\nStrength and muscle contractions when you're using them over and over again for instance if you're working at the gym if you're playing sports golf tennis anything like that it keeps your muscles powered up\nIn their higher energy state so they're strong and ready for action packed\nHere's the key is is so important for those of us say in our fifties sixties seventies you see we had lots and lots of Korea Team when we were young we had ... stuff it was coming out of areas we had lots of creating our bodies made a lot of it but as we get older like everything else we don't\nDo that is well we have less Korea Team in our muscles you know the good news is that hundreds and hundreds of human studies show that when you supplement with Korea Team\nHe goes to work or go straight to your muscles it's absorbed easily it pumps up the Korea thing in your muscle tissue and you get stronger you get more powerful not only that it helps support memory and brain health\nAnd help support the strength of your bones\nYou know we were talking before the show and you were talking about how it lipic athletes have been using Korea Team for years to enhance their strength and performance and tell me more\nWell this ... is the premier sports nutrition supplement there's no question about that pat you used the body builders know about it athletes know about\nKorea Team is the premier sports nutrient so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic athletes and their coach is of course they knew about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural to the body it was supposed to be there but there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid\nIt might be considered cheating let it might be considered too much of an edge\nBut back in Nineteen eighty eight the international Olympic Committee they came out the officially confirmed that I'm quoting here Korea Team can be used by athletes\nTo enhance their performance and now that it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing that for adults for people in their fifties sixties seventies this stuff it was amazing and purity\nHas this incredible new formulation we call it ever strong because that's exactly what it does it helps you get stronger in states stronger with hundreds of human studies and it's the purest form of ... money can buy stuff from Europe this stuff is fantastic\nAnd we should point out that naturally occurring in red meat problem is in order to get the amounts that are going to benefit you you'd have to eat large amounts of red meat and it was like four\nPounds of red meat a day most people are going to do\nThat right and what about vegetarian say can be creating deficient\nExactly when I have a vegetarian that comes in here and their energy efficient and I put 'em on average strong you noticed the benefits almost right away because they've been so low on it you know if you're a person out there that staying away from red meat if you're staying away from me in general this is for you you definitely want to add that ...\nJust five days of eight grams of Korea teen supported mental test subjects that we're getting rapid fire question scientists were asking um math questions in science questions over and over and over and they found the folks on Korea Team didn't fatigues quickly\nMentally so this is amazing stuff it re chargers all your cellular battery so all of your cells tissues and organs have more readily available energy\nOr dark I loved that ever strong appeals to athletes and people want to get more reps in the gym maybe get some extra power and their workouts because you're also saying there's a big push a nutritional community to encourage people in the forties fifties sixties seventies and even eighties to leverage the power of Korea teen to stay fit strong and healthy like you say\n... going mainstream you know I share the story with you before my mom who's in her late seventies now she's taking creating she works out a couple of days a week she does the free weights because she's got osteoporosis she wants to maintain her muscle mass and she wants to make her bones stronger and as you\nPointed out creating helps to do that and then the other three days during the week she'll go and she'll swim now she's not trying to get bigger stronger or anything like that but even at\nHer age Korea teen has benefits\nOh yeah and what blows me away about that story 'cause you told me before is that her medical doctor recommended routine for and that just goes to show how much more mainstream that says it's called every strong\nAnd it supports the muscles that supports your power your strengths your speed if you're an athlete you're certainly going to love it but even if you're not an athlete you notice the difference let's go to another study one more review study this out of the journal current aging science December two thousand thirty and\nThe researchers looked at the body of research out there on Korea tenants seniors without exercise they want to see what happens when seniors take Korea teen and they don't\nHave an exercise so I'm quoting here\n... supplementation without associated resistance training seems to enhance muscular string power and insurance increase lean body mass for those that don't know what that is they're talking about muscle and improve the functional capacity of the elderly they go on to talk about how it supports bone health\nAs well and then they finish with this creating supplementation without training in the elderly\nPotentially delay atrophy of muscle and unproven difference and strength so here again we see bottom line ... is very very effective pat when you think about it this almost sounds too good to be true right right but it is true\nHundreds and hundreds of human studies back up what we're talking about you're going to love the benefits you get with this every strong formula\nNow listeners can only get every strong this clinically tested Korea teen blend from surety products right Oh absolutely\nI Know it combines decree a teen with vitamin D the coffee buried the fruit ... be more on there's also a great value to I Know we have a free bottled today but if you wanted to buy all of these things separately it would cost a small fortune wouldn't it\nOh absolutely I mean if you went out and bought the creative pure creed and that's it purists finest Korea Team from Europe and then you went out and bought a separate antioxidant formula and separate joined formula and the vitamin D\nAnd it's going to cost you eighty Ninety a hundred bucks a month but you're not going to spend that today that with purity products because today it's for your job is to be one of the first thousand callers he could you be twelve and is your milk and your average strong you're just pay six Ninety five for shipping we want to get it right out you we want you to be the judge for yourself don't take my word for it\nTry it look in the mirror go to the gym lift some weights do whatever you do see if you don't feel better\nAll right let's talk about how you take this you have these easy to swallow tablets also comes in a very refreshing cherry Barry powder so how do you like to take you to give people just choose the tablets are the powder when they're calling for the free bottled today\nYeah you can choose tablets are powder I personally use both you know I'm I work at days are days are making a protein shake on days I'm juicing let's face it juicing has become a very big these days so if you're doing something like that to ... very powders fantastic could just take a scoop dump it right into your juice protein shake and that's a great way to take it but\nIf you don't do that stuff I mean the tablets are super convenient they're small they're coated they're easy to swallow it's wonderful stuff\nNow I Know you're shopping at the bit to tell us a little more about the study the purity did on the ever strong powder they tested golfers already found out that not only were these golfers getting stronger and more explosive but they were driving the golf ball get this for teen yards further that's amazing\nI have such a big smile on my faith right now I'm remembering when the researchers came back and gave us information we were bouncing off the walls this is so exciting\nThe researchers call this a seminal study in sports nutrition and this is on our ever strong formula the product we are talking about right now to double blind placebo controlled studies thirty golfers took our every strong powder for one month no exercise nothing different in one month they were banging the golf ball\nFor teen yards further pat not only that six percent more power on the bench press more explosive they could lift\nThe weights faster ... people shouldn't just how how about this this is amazing because this was a golf study but more explosive missed more speed more power this should help all sports so if you're a tennis player if you're a jogger if you're any kind of an athlete this has ramifications across the board\nI Would just had a few minutes left here I Want you to recap this amazing story today about Korea Team you like to call the molecule of strength who needs it and what about this double free bottle offer today with the ever strong plus the B. twelve energy melts\nKnow what at my one concern with this show is it literally it sounds too good to be true right when I tell folks about every strong right I'm afraid they're going to think I'm making this up you know I Know how you feel because six seven eight years ago when I started to read\nAbout Korea teen I almost couldn't believe it I said to myself if it's really this good with an excellent safety profile how everybody's not using it but I started to use it and I noticed some incredible benefits it's as simple as this year we're going to get on the strong you're going to try it you're going to get stronger you're going to get more powerful you can look in the mirror and\nSee the difference there's hundreds and hundreds of human studies backing us up and of course we didn't just a a decree a pure Korea teen we're to the fruit XP remember that joined health weight of the coffee very extract that nominal antioxidant they're more potent than blueberries and strawberries are powerful at the opposite of protection\nI added the vitamin D because it's so important across the board free for bone health but also for seniors vitamin D so important for muscles especially as we get older for strength and coordination so this is a very comprehensive formula again this would easily cost you eighty Ninety a hundred bucks to replicate on your own but today it's free\nAnd not only that let's not forget about the beat twelve energy males because we're talking about energy here today and when you think energy you think be twelve ... twelve is critical for making red blood cells to carry oxygen to the two shoes to buy it and then there is great for the hairs and then also just make sure you're one of the first call or\nGet your free bottle of every strong your freebie twelve energy melting six Ninety five ... just paying for the shipping and if you don't notice the benefits that we've discussed today purity happy to give you back your six Ninety five\nBut that's not going to happen it never happens people loved this formula you to tell your friends relatives loved ones you're going to fall in love\nWith the average strong and to be twelve hundred she melts\nFascinating information as always thank you for your time thanks so much for having me
