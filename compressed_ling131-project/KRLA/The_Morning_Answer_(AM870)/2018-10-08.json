a network I'm joined by Josh crush hour hotline Josh on Twitter Josh we only had two poles of Senate races that really even begin to absorb the impact of the sun we saw Marsha Blackburn establishing\nEight point lead over Phil Bredesen we saw Martha Mick Sally surge into a statistical tie with Christmas cinema [noise] what else do you hear from\nThe campaigns about what they're seeing\nIn the aftermath of the knock down nasty attempt to take out of Brett Kavanaugh\nWell I think one of the biggest races where I came back from a last week a Claire McCaskill was an early no on the on the truck and a ...\nAs a whole lot of budget or ... any litigated issue on the air with Missouri went up without the act\nSo I think that's a raise your capital first documented ... at ... at the moment so Missouri the really really close race to watch it looked like it was that the tide but now all he has the momentum\nIn the in Fox News last week this again before that the decision it was a Thursday poll they had Donnelly at forty three Braun at forty one and Brent in at six he must be a libertarian pet cannot be good news predominantly\nClaim that libertarian vote usually ... and that's usually a Republican but in a state like Indiana so again Donnelly with the late ... on on judge Kavanaugh I think that's going to ... we haven't seen\nRon use that issue yet so we have to be looking at the TV ad which which candidate are going to run on camera which ones are I don't think we've seen abroad and going to have it all so I think that the rate I think not only you know a little more moderate I tried to build a bipartisan image back home but you're right you know and have it on a private issue for Republicans\nNow we go to the one where I think it's over North Dakota uh NBC valley news did a poll last Tuesday before high camping out that senator Heidi Heitkamp is the sitting Democrat North Dakota senator she voted against a judge cabinet and Kramer got a ten point lead Kevin Cramer the\nCongressman from ... is the same as high caffeine is a statewide congressman like she's a statewide senator I think he's going to win by double digits\nYou I I think you have a look at high camps vote in terms of politics in terms of looking at the poll or to a new poll\nBefore showed her down double digits but I think she felt what she wanted to go to her principal and if that means you're going to lose a Senate race was already trailing in Soviet um this is a very uh\nVery poisonous or even a North Dakota a Kramer at the very first ... first at his support for ... the one thing what pretty tough ah so I mean this is a race that is moving away from the Democrats I think it's got to be a lean Republican see that as\nI got I got a cover to more with you in Montana Matt Rosendale is they find candidates statewide office author he's not an original Montana Jon Tester but tester voted against cabinet in a state that was a ... point\nTrump state I spend a lot of time in Montana not a lot I got up there and fish to a few times with my friend Jenn genera and he almost represented himself into decided not to let Matt Rosendale do this put up with is not that I think he's quote the statistical tie and I do not think Jon Tester survive just about what do you think Charles crush are\nFor race for Republicans I you know I've had some skepticism about Roosevelt strength as a candidate as you mentioned about Montana originally uh but but then just go to get a cat and I voted against Gorsuch also and and he also was the lead\nAnd that's like to remind Montana plays out there was one of the lead dog against a lot of Jackson failed domination prefer Viet so um you know testers looks a little more like an artist and if\nIf Republicans at Montana vote Republican and and as a tribal got the election I wasn't they'll have a real shot eyes I still think that's rather a slight advantage but this isn't it a race that that's posing in the ...\nI Hope the president spends a lot of time there and it's early voting gets underway this week I think finally Arizona now Martha McSally my friend and very invested in having combat veterans in the Senate she's running against a hard left progressive Christian sentiment is trying to run as a moderate I mean being shameless about it I think the cabinet vote\nReally helps in Scottsdale really helps in Tucson really brings a uh a lot of Republicans who don't like Trump back to Martha McSally and she's already got the Trump voter what do you think Josh crush are\nCinema had a slight advantage throughout the

of course a justice Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in on Saturday\nAs predicted what happened when he\nJumped the hurdle and got enough votes to be to end the cloture kind of a\nFormality that happened on friday morning you heard it live on the morning answer and the protesting has continued over the weekend a judge I took the high road on Twitter congratulated judge Kavanaugh I think that's what again gentlemen their heads and called for what I Hope learn as you said if you think last week well\nI uh certainly give all sides and uh and my side is is a is a side that a lot of Americans out I Want\nTo tell you thank you for saying it it just a congratulatory no I think the hysteria that I witnessed on social media over the weekend was unbelievable I ... the stuff that I thought from someone saying that it's the Republican Party coming to take her daughter's body out of her bedroom I mean there's so many crazy things going on in all of that\nIt's not the end of the world we have a Supreme Court justice maybe it's not the person that you wanted to be in there but we're all still waking up and we're moving forward into an eight week\nWe're moving forward a it is a lifetime appointment and on Saturday just a several hours after the votes were cast in favor of judge Kavanaugh very close vote by the way this was a close margin worry age\nOf fifty and Lisa Murkowski did something to kind of interesting even though she was a no vote the Republican who has a no vote on Kavanaugh she's voted present because of the senator from Canada was there and senator gains wanted to go to his daughter's wedding to his though was asked and so she kind of canceled him out which is why we have at forty eight fifty a margin of confirmation for Kavanaugh\nPresident Trump speaking on the newest justice on the U.S Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh this from Saturday the president was headed for a rally\nJust\nThat for years that extraordinary first Senate race and\nHe's going to make us over by all feel very strongly that and then maybe the process it was really on attractive but there was something that I think was really good I thought it was really good I think a lot of [noise]\nA lot of very positive things happened in the last week\nIt looked that way but it is that what happened\nMany different he's looking very good\nLater as President Trump Saturday on the newest justice to the U.S Supreme Court ah Brett Kavanaugh I usually say from across the aisle but to show you how controversial the cabin on confirmation has been\nFrom the same side of the aisle Republican Lisa Murkowski or who of course on a friday voted no against the confirmation and then that interesting maneuver to vote president on Saturday she explains the no vote\nIn these situations is entering his little judge must act at all times\nIn a manner that promotes public confidence in independence integrity impartiality ...

Alaska\nAnd what I've done for them with Anwar which is one of the biggest ham drilling sites in the world Ronald Reagan tried to get it a brutal Bush tried to get it a bra everybody tried to get it approved for close to fifty years I got it approve it means for and against the dollar\nThat I'm not equating one thing with the other at all but I've done so much for Alaska I was shocked to see her vote ... yacht and frankly if there were other Republicans there was a very sad day I think for her\nAnd I think it will go down as a sad day for our because you've got to be a great Supreme Court just\nPresident Trump on Fox News talking about Lisa Murkowski the senator Republican senators vote against justice Kavanaugh ambient sound provided by the host of the show judge Janine bureau theater\nI Would just lie it's a weird\nYeah [laughter] it's like it's you know it's like yeah and then it'll be talking and you'll hear [noise] it's just not it's not the best I think\nHe was saying really good things that I think I agree with but I was just listening for next\nAnd this by the way [noise]\nLike the slight whispers to crew members and everything Janine poet or Fox News and Janine ... president United States anyway the conversation turned to she's mad because she's not the Supreme Court justice thing right maybe that's what the ... maybe that's for sure yeah\n[noise] yeah trying [noise]\nTo Janine I'm Sorry did you say something to say anything because I'm hearing like background sound do do you have to send your side is [laughter]\nOkay so you remember ah the president was coming from a rally in Kansas who was a week ago I guess he was in Mississippi and he got four or five this week he's traveling all over the place and he was on the on the topic before an adoring crowd of Dr Christine Ford's allegation against justice Kavanaugh you remember in the aftermath on that Thursday the president called her a fine woman a\nVery compelling a but at the at the rally president got a lot of criticism I think well deserved for it to the ears of many mine included he mocked Christine Ford\nThirty six years ago this\nI had one beer [noise] right I Want to be\nWell do you think it was I was wondering how did you get home I don't remember how'd you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago\nThat I don't know [noise] I don't [noise] I don't know what\nWas it and I don't know where's the\nThere's downstairs where was I don't know what I add one that's the only thing I remember\nPresident Trump seemingly a channeling Christine forward the accuser of a of of judge Brett Kavanaugh during the confirmation now the Supreme Court justice who was confirmed on Saturday through her attorneys Dr Ford professor Ford has said that she was deeply\nHurt by the president's ah what what she perceives as as him mocking earn making fun of her the issue of\nThat speech that rally came up on Fox News here's what the president had to say to judge Janine bureau\nThere were a lot of things happening or correct they weren't true there were a lot of things that were left unsaid and I thought I hadn't even the playing field because it was very unfair to judge now I can you know very nicely if they just this cabinet are right where it was a very unfair situation though I\nEven the playing field but once I did that started this bell\nTrue it was very very very unfairly\nOkay that's President Trump on the Fox news channel with judge ... Janine bureau our number is eight five five Seventy five eight to five five\nOn Saturday we came to the stunning conclusion of this human political soap opera out of Washington DC justice Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed by the U.S Senate we will take your calls on the morning answer Jennifer and asked the question\nDid the capital confirmation battle train any of your personal relationship maybe that's why we have the dramatic music ... maybe ... maybe works divorce it's seven sixteen [noise]\nThis is her address morning\nWhat I Am encouraged by\nIs what I compute\nAs in a Rhodesian of political correctness I think political correctness would dictate that at work you never would talk about Kavanaugh and the allegations and Dr Christine for political correctness would dictate no one talks about that in the break room at work but I Am actually as a as a\nA crusader against political correctness I Am actually encouraged that the survey shows more than half\nOf us at our workplace went for it yeah me and had these conversations it shows that were around the issue yeah I mean I Hope people were respectful and I'm sure most war but it shows Jennifer at least my interpretation is that maybe we're not on the edge shows we think we are well\nYou know what it is and you might go crazy when I say this is your daughter she has chopping it up again but this is the Trump effect where what people were once afraid to talk about no longer either they're driven nuts emotionally and they have to get it out or if they like what's going on they're not quite as afraid anymore they have that backbone reinstalled where they're able to talk about these issues\nAnd not be afraid that someone's going to call them in name so I think it it\nIt's the most interesting time to be in politics right now and I don't mean working in politics but to be a witness to what's going on politically in this country this is a culture change\nThis is going to be the new normal moving down the road I think there's a new path\nAnd I don't think it's all that at least people are paying attention and as you said they're willing to talk about that\nAs we continue on your Monday morning answered the Donald daily download that happens every morning at seven thirty six right here with Brian and Jennifer let me tell you my love that all over the weekend learned yet another thing about ... the we talked about in Iraq but the it's a medical condition I actually have done some reading about the way\nYou're going to get Dr shilling around for his money no no no I don't think I'm a ...\n... but

numbness seriously there's a learning is in the bottom of your feet\nAnd you feel like you're kind of walking on little pillow such with some of my patients have told me and then there's a chain link

political argument with you and then after all of the symptoms comes to pain and very seriously the difficulty in walking mobility becomes compromise\nAnd their apathy is a serious medical condition but we know from story after story that nerve empty doctors Julian can treat and even reverse the effects of neuropathy\nSo now we talk to you our morning answer listeners if you're experiencing any

Janine bureau right after his rally in Kansas yeah Janine bureau is a friend of the morning after and she's been on this program um many times since she's been on a ... show on a um five Ninety\nShow you do with Don ticks in the afternoon trick comfortable with us and uh also you'll hear in this in an interview she's very comfortable just in life in talking to the president because you'll hear Janine\nMaking a lot which you know typically interviewers don't make a lot of ... they don't whisper to producers and you hear it on the air judge Janine has her own sort of way of rolling I guess on the air\nFor her sound guy was on vacation you off but you know one of the other somebody didn't hit that microphone button for her President Trump\nTold Janine that he was very excited about the confirmation of justice Kavanaugh\nWell I Am very excited and did other protesters reverse ... group a tiny group of people I just left tens of thousands of people in cancers then you know it's amazing what's going in the country and we have a great new Supreme Court justice Janine there's you know\nVery well during the cabinet confirmation battle there was pressure on the president to drop Kavanaugh as a nominee to the Supreme Court precedent explains that he's stuck by judge Kavanaugh\nSay highly respected man what the Democrats did was disgraceful a these are things happen that just came out that the when that was ... here and there was no anything Janine this is a high quality brilliant man there'll be a phenomenal Supreme Court justice\nAnd it was by honor to stick and I know that a lot of people do believe that they said well what else what you'll never get anybody like this this is a very very outstanding person an individual with an incredible family and it would have been very unfair and what they did was disgraceful\nOkay that's the president being interviewed by a judge Janine and you only hear a little of Janine she's obviously not the focal point the president what he's saying about Kavanaugh's important but it sounds\nLike she's using and daddy pot like it's like I don't know what that is one of those little pictures and you pour water through one of your nose all to get it\nCannot be up to date you're so you can clean out your sinuses what I'm hearing it maybe she was you were getting you make sure that you're getting her nostril\nI think it's not a terrible theory I mean you know there are some sounds and no doubt\nOr I don't know what she was doing while that interview what's happening but uh who want to try to focus on the president without the distraction of judge Janine ... sinus ... whatever she has going on president was asked about Lisa Murkowski the U.S senator from Alaska a Republican\nWho voted against the confirmation of now justice cabin on a Lisa Murkowski a it's been criticized of course by Republicans across the board for that vote the president talks about that political fallout\nI don't know what's going to happen to her I thought it was very very sad vote I thought it was very frankly disgraceful\nAnd I appreciate that a Democrat Joe Manchin game and he voted in favor of a justice ... and that was a good thing but that was very disappointing\n[laughter] Janine please what is she doing here they don't you think you'd get a caller I Do think you can eat what if he was thinking well no he's on a cell phone and\nGet Justinian show replays multiple times on Fox News over the weekend so it's not out of the realm of possibility that Trump listen to this interview after he had done it ... not only is it not out of the realm of possibility absolutely happen no it's a certainty so do you think that phone of judge Janine rings and he's like why are you messing up my interview\n... am listening Bakr a job you do a great job but they were like challenge whether I was talking about Lisa Murkowski I mean do and making ... and you are responding you sound a little disconnected but\nWere you doing a Nettie on you and your ... your era getting your sinuses because I heard a lot of challenge anyway I just wanted to let you know if this is I Hope this message gets you have a good weekend I Love you and what you do get Bush got shut troops or something like that the\nPeople of Alaska I meant the success that Alaska and what I've done for them\nNow she's now she's he's talking about war\nAnd she ... she fit [laughter] she's got some important legal briefs\nAlready do I not have your attention I mean I'm leaving the free world are you very busy are\nWhich is one of the biggest him a drilling sites in the ...\nYeah [laughter] because she doesn't know what I Am\nOr you know if you have your parents that are out now [laughter] yeah right I mean it was great and I'm doing great things ... ... if you don't like I'm sort of\nWorld Ronald Reagan together a brutal or strike together to bribe everybody together to\nRoot for ... years by the proof\nIt means for and against the dollar that I'm not equating one thing with the other at all but I've done so much for Alaska I was shocked to see her vote for yachts\nAnd Bradley felt were involved with because there was a very sad\nDay I think for her but and I think it will go down as they said they are because you've got to become a great Supreme Court\nJust okay that's the president talked about justice cabinet with Janine barrel\nYeah [laughter] we'd done yet\n[laughter] [noise] how are they are fulfilling and paid sick leave much\nPressure on Iran\nWas great and I'm working on and we're\nRight down the ... they know what they know

issues do to people in the world will ever agree on any two issues I'm a hundred percent of the time\nA relationship incredible I got quite frankly if it wasn't I wouldn't have done what I did\nThat for Eighteen months pretty much living in Thirteen battleground states fighting day in and day out I'm half running the campaign with you know Don you up and Jared Laura\nI'm fighting as hard as we did it work by my father's side there's no one the new and better in the war than I Do for\nWhat twelve years and in in this company my company um the man's brilliant he knows how to win um he's incredibly effective he cuts through nonsense\nUm he's very direct he's very very very sharp and again you see with the results of this country you know we're finally going in the right direction like free metric and um it's driving the other side you know crazy I mean it's striking the other side\nSyria this weekend Eric I it took me by surprise at just how much emotion is just over it's overwhelming fact and truth in this country right now but I think it is so important that you you said fighting and your family's thoughts to win this election and the fight that President Trump has brought to the Republican Party was so needed\nAt this moment in history because for so long Republicans would back away when the other side would say you were racist or sexist and the other we would back away and now because of President Trump\nWere standing up and we're fighting I've never seen Mitch McConnell looked stronger in my life the Republican Party is coalescing behind your dad how important was that site in the confirmation of justice Brett Kavanaugh this was a huge win for his administration\nWas a math when we had another wouldn't last week with ah with with with Canada renegotiating the entire planet of the week before that we had a massive wind renegotiating the trade deal with with with Mexico I mean our country is when you get them in our country look look at\nWhat not hired at where we're not tired of winning at just yet [laughter]\nI don't ever get hurt and we don't ever died last year I like the I like to do you have a good sense of humor Trump is with us or the second son of president Donald Trump in a moment we can talk about St Jude and it's the ... foundation isn't that what it's called the ... foundation a\n... at night I got a lot my whole life with uh with with St Jude they're the best one of the cancer hospital\nWant to ask you a few more details about that and then I'm going to ask you\nA a question that is that is uh with with with the greatest respect a I ask you in a fortune ... if anyone on the station is ever going to ask you a question like this is going to be me\nRight or wrong with that one Brian ... okay\nMy friend or your father is really in our president is a brilliant man I agree with that\nI'm actually I've said many times and you know this Eric ... you know I didn't vote for him and then they're all working on me here but I grew up in New York I'm In Staten Island kid so I feel like I I grew up with your dad he was always in the news very president figure uh in New York no doubt I think is one of his greatest traits to me is a public consumer\nOf of of our president is a sense of humor I think I'd enjoy his company\nUm he is brilliant I I wouldn't dispute or his success in business shows that his political victories show his brilliance you articulated his brilliance a moment ago what'd you say that your father I've been called this would you say your dad's an eccentric guy\nMaybe it maybe I I I think you need to be a little bit eccentric proudly run through the process um you know I I think you you you need to be um\nIn in a certain way um I think there's probably a lot of qualities do you need to be but I think everything should be done in you know it'll level of balance right I mean it can be a positive and certain people could have viewed as\nNegative to write and then I I Would say that you know it's a large reason quite frankly\nHe won I mean I think America and and and and and we've spoken about this before but I think America was got sick and tired of teach politicians who her soundbites who never spoke off the cuff a who are perfectly PC and every regard you didn't sound like normal human beings right they sounded like cage politicians and that's why there was never\nAny excitement in in ... in politics that's why you know you never had rallied for thirty thousand people were attending them uh you know you just\nYou know it it was run by consultants who was won by kind of political leap they weren't ... to you know average everyday\nAmericans who are hard working people and just wanted their country to be successful um and I think you know being a little bit eccentric actually change that notion people or what ... and again and he kinda he he kind of change a bar so\nAbsolutely and I wish to serve in the most positive way people\nPaying attention again which is another thing whether they love your dad or they don't whatever it is they're paying attention which I think it's absolutely important and we are running out of time but I got to know what's next because the economy is humming as you mentioned you articulated so wealthy achievements of this administration so far I think\nThe most effective presidents see in my lifetime what's next in the in the coming weeks going into the midterms to prevent what Democrats are calling this this blue wave what is the president going to be focusing on over the next five weeks\nWell let's say seems to be focusing on on I'm wanting to feed people to get out and vote jak right here all the time but people will my guy my guys talk and like I thought about it so I'm not going to go out and vote I mean by not voting you are effectively voting against that you have to get out there ... we have to vote and that way California is one of those ... states voting because\nYou have a large number of house races that are absolutely critical and very very well known but people\nPeople have to get out there and vote they should be focused on that but he's very very focused on trade right now because this country is getting ripped off by everybody around the world who are getting ripped off that should have a hundred billion dollars a year\nAnd he's very focused on that America calmly it's about it's ever been Chinese economy right now is down by twenty or twenty percent of people lost one fifth of the value of their economy don't want to watch even talked about that so\nIt'd be focused on that he's going to be focused on obviously the military very focused on border security because it's something that's critical for you certainly at the state but for the country you know he's\nHe's working very hard to battle the opioid crisis again no one ever wants to talk about that but it's it's something that's destroyed so many families and it's a top\nOn his radar a writer for his work on yeah we're we're got there's a lot he's been a great job\nOkay uh we're up on the clock so I Want you to take ten seconds I Know that but the ... because I Want you to tell us the good news about St Jude children's hospital in ten seconds here\n[laughter] the bet pediatric hospital in the world dedicated to children the cats are and I've been involved with them for very long time and they are just incredible they're they're the best that we are co workers and um they're winning they're winning that fight we're winning this fight their way that\nPeople should support change
