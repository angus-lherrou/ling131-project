what we have in fact the coverage there\nCould you ever have imagined when you started preaching on this however many years ago that was and then you started to come by the book a year ago it would be as apropos has it is right now based on our political climate in America [noise]\nWell I I go back to what I said I think no matter what the climate was if it was different there'd be some other aspects of the book but I Know what you're referring to is the fact that if one of the ways you can read the book is the first two chapters are shown up refuses to go to tell the truth he\nWas called to go to Syria and tell them the truth we warned them talk about just what he refuses to talk of the truth is second half of it goes to tell the truth but he definitely do it in la mhm heat and that's the reason why God says\nYou went to the city but you didn't love the city and at the very end God is saying why don't you have to pass on the city so in our current cultural moment to be told that even if the other side seems to to be horrible you must always speak the truth and ... you must always do it\nIt was always say that you are a recipient of mercy\nJust like they need to pass mercy and yet there shouldn't be any superiority that people have a different race of a different religion or people have different ... you have to always be the truth and not know\nThat just that just screams at us out of the book right now because of our cultural moment I'm just here to tell you the word of God is alive and living that if you were in some other situations other time but what would be screaming something else that trip but right now it's amazingly well\nYeah and I feel like that's what we need to hear it and because of my job I have to be an social media quite a bit and it it can it's a it's a cesspool tell ya I mean the reason it just ... isn't it success and it takes me and\nUm it's not that I'm pointing at everybody and Twitter and saying oh my gosh you know the debauchery and they're saying that it makes me absolutely as susceptible as anyone else to the kind of\nDo the kind of electrical machinations it just and then you you you spend your your hour or two hours or whatever it is you spend on it and by the end you are not the person that God Bless you to be I'm convinced that it\nActually you know two or three years ago a woman named uh Sherry Turkle who works at a she teaches at MIT but a book called click reclaiming conversation and apart from the politics of it she says studies show\nThat the more you're on social media the less empathetic you become that has a hard it is for you to put yourself in the shoes of other people because what social media does is they're very brief a state that we make and they everything is over simplify everything's flat we're just we just reduce people\nAh we reduced people to the basics that we don't think of them is for people and we do is they have they have strengths and weaknesses\nSo the political situation right now on social media is toxic and the book of Jonah says\nYou have to have compassion on the people that you're telling the truth to or you're just not reflecting God\nOkay tends he's not a lot of time with Jonah so to speak over the last decade or so or tell us what John is like\nFirst of all these kind of sympathetic as it is as soon as you get into the ticket if you start to come on and you have to remember he's being asked to go to a contract a city that will probably kill him at least they have a good\nYeah they're violent people to go out there and actually preach right in the city was taking his wife and his hands secondly these were people who were almost like ISIS they were kind of like a terrorist a country and they were threatening Israel and as soon as you realize\nThat he's being asked to go show\nStretch out the prospect of more seats were very evil group of people you can start say oh yeah no wonder he whether he is happening so it was run them and you begin to say hey often got says things or does things that I don't understand too\nThat on the other side uh Charlotte is you you have to fall he's the opposite of the good somewhere he's the very opposite 'cause when Jesus as tall as fast you know how do I love my neighbor Jesus does the ... and then he's planning to a man\nWho loves someone\nOf a different race and religion and that's very significant that when\nJesus was asked show me how to let my neighbor he gives us an example of someone who loves someone practically at risk as a joke so to somewhat of a different race or religion and here's Jonah looking at somewhat of a different race or religion saying I don't want to risk my life I don't want to do anything for them I\nWant them to be judged by what the destroyed

because we have an absolutely fantastic show lined up for you but before we go one step further let me introduce myself I Am ... writes the host money matters with Ken ...\n[noise]\nJak I've been in the financial services business now for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting you\n\nAnd I do and all the idea that we talk about on the show these are the same ideas that we talk about with our love it and most valued clients\nAnd uh as at the end of last month we not work with over eight thousand families in forty three states we are honored we are privileged\nAnd recently parents named more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred financial advisors in the United states and this is actually the sixth year in a row and without our clients that would be nowhere so thank you thank you thank you I Hope you guys will see the show right now are having an absolutely fantastic\nWeekend I Hope everything is coming up roses for you and we have a great show so let me go over with you\nWhat we're talking about on this our weekly excursion into the land of personal finances show we absolutely do add so as money matters are from his grown and I'm just mentioned that we have we will not work with over eight thousand families what I've also come to realize is that we have\nGreat responsibility to those clients and you know when I first started this business back when I was a a you know I said I've been as business now for twenty nine years so I was actually four years old when we started and when I was four years old [laughter]\nYou know I didn't quite you know I I never didn't think that we would be where we are today but I actually also didn't really think about that we are going to be where we are today I just kind of went with it and you know as things progressed to just kept on going so now as it's as as we come to where we are [noise]\nI've come to the point where I realized that we have a responsibility to all these families that we work with\nAnd so one of the things that I thought about was you know you don't want your financial advisory firm to die before you do that that would be a bad thing right so one of the things that we decided to do was that we would have what we call vision one hundred\nAnd vision one hundred is that a hundred years from now we want our for our money matters to be as strong if not stronger as it is today\nSo how do you do that how do you build a company that's going to be here a hundred years from now serving our current clients their families down the line and all those kinds of things and so to do that\nI studied a variety of companies that have been in business for a hundred years to see how they did it\nBecause if you think about it the last hundred years have been you know ... with all kinds of things you had world wars we've had a you know bad economic times we've had boom times technology's changed I mean everything it's like all kinds of stuff that happened but yet these companies endured and so what was it that enabled them to endure\nAnd so I Want to take you this or this week on on this show on that journey but I'll apply it to you because I think the the life lessons that you can learn\nIn terms of having a business is going to endure for a hundred years or longer or the same life lessons that you can apply in your personal life and in your financial life and and you're investing life 'cause we're financial advisory firm\nSo it'll it it it it sounds kind of a you know philosophical this week but I think we're going to I'll bring it home to where you can use it in your life but I think also the lessons that we can learn from it will be will be good All right so the first thing then is I Want to tell you as a as as uh from\nWhat we've decided is that we have two goals so I think in life for you to be able to progress in a way that helps you to be happy that helps you to achieve what you want I think you have to set goals you have to say what are the things that I Want to accomplish\nSo in a financial advisory firm that would be you know what our what's our mission statement what our two goals and for us the two goals are that we want our clients to have financial peace of mind\nThat's number one we want him to relax we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision okay so we want to make sure that a ... you have financial peace of mind but then secondly we want your money to last as long as you do\nOkay so our financial goal there is that an philosophically how that would apply to you\nIs that\nWhen you retire we specialize to work with people who are retired or retiring soon so when you retire it it's it's easy to be in the same mode that you've been for the last Thirty years as you've been accumulating which is growth mode\nAnd while growing is important\nKeeping the growth that you have accumulated is now even more important okay because if you suddenly take a huge loss like in a beer market or something like that or you make a bad beer or a financial decision you make a mistake you do something you invest badly\nThen what could happen is that you will not achieve the goals that we have right one is\nPeace of mind financially [laughter] if you just lots of your money you're you're you're not financially or they have peace of mind and then secondly that your money last as long as you do it can be hard to do that if you take large losses\nSo that ties directly into our whole philosophy of managing money for clients and I think it should be yours so if you're retired or retiring suits you should be thinking in that mode so how do you build a company that's going to last a hundred years how you build something that indoors and and and in your life it could be how do you build a legacy that indoors\nWill the important thing is that you need to have what ... what what I've called core values what are the things that you stand for\nYou know what are the things that you say these are ... and they stand the test of time in other words a hundred years from now they will be as true then as they are today\nAnd in your family what I Would say is these are your morals these are what you your your values you know what what what makes what what what are your beliefs what are the things that you teach your kids your grandchildren that are important if they're going to have a successful life\nOkay so in our for our we have ten core values and I just want to tell you about core value number one first and then a core value number six of core value number one is\nThe right thing to do is always the right thing to do this one was taught to me by my mom\nAnd every time I talk to my mom and I had a moral dilemma or I had a question like that her answer was Kenny the right thing to do is always the right thing to do and I hated her for doing that because\nI wanted her to give me the answer and she would say if if you have to ask you already know what the answer is you already know what the right thing to do is just do that and you'll always be okay so that's the first thing always do the right thing to do is always the right thing to do\nThis the core value number six is never sacrificed honesty for growth\nAnd what I mean by that is you know everybody wants to grow everybody wants to succeed everybody wants to you know have more money or have more prestige or you know I have a successful family or whatever it may be but never ever ever since the sacrifice honesty in the pursuit of that\nNow in our world is a financial advisory firm you know I think it's all about your ethics it's about ... never putting somebody else in front of you it's about what helps somebody else eventually will help you in the in the process and not disclosing everything\nOffice skating the truth promising returns that you can't deliver all those kinds of things are not telling somebody about the downside of what their their investment strategy is all those kinds of things are sacrificing honesty for growth and if you do that will happen is eventually it'll come back to get you\nYou know so in in your life when you're looking at\nHow how do I get from one place to another you want to you want to improve your career you want to do something you know ... if you if you sacrifice honesty and the pursuit of whatever that is it will eventually catch up with you and you and you know if for example just if you lied on your resume to get a job\nAnd you did get the job eventually they'll figure out that you lied on the resume and they'll fire you for it so sacrificing honesty to get the growth that you want\nNever works in the long run I mean it it just doesn't and it doesn't in our world either so we have a very strict policy that you will never sacrificed honesty\nTo to get a new client or to keep a client or whatever we disclose everything warts and all we want you to know everything about us we want to know all the fees involved we want to know what's wrong with what we do what's right with what we do so you make a fully informed decision and we never have to apologize for anything [noise]\nNow one of the things that uh I Am not going to apologize for is that we would like to have you if you are the person that we specialize in working with as a client son to do some selling here or if you are over fifty if you are retired are retiring soon unlikely to go to our website is money matters dot net\nMoney matters dot net and or what you'll find

jak I have been in the financial services business now for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years at every single one of them has had a character of its own and they've all been different and they've all been that\nAnd this year is no exception and uh so we currently work with over eight thousand families\nSo [laughter]\nYeah yes and in forty three states which is a insane and also a you know recently a barren named mark your paypal host one of the top one hundred\nFinancial advisors in the United states actually for the six year in a row and uh I Know for a fact that if it wasn't for our clients they wouldn't even know who I Am barons\nAnd so therefore all your clients are listening right now thank you and those of you who are not clients I appreciate you listening also now on this program where we are talking about\nOur philosophy of the of of business and I think that are the philosophy of of running a business\nIs the same philosophy that you can apply in your own life and so I think that uh this week that this week's show it was a little bit different than what I normally do but I thought it would be beneficial for those of you listening to kind of get some some some of my thoughts of of uh of how you do that and and to kind of frame it\nAs I mentioned we we work with a thousand families and if you think about how many people that is\nYou don't you think of a family of grandparents do you have children and grandchildren and great grandchildren I mean ... and and spouses of all those people and and all of a sudden you're talking about a lot of people that we are responsible for helping with their finances and helping guide them and all those kinds of things [noise]\nAnd so it it dawned on me a few years ago that a ... grows we had the responsibility to make sure that our firm stays around you know the whole thing is you don't want your financial adviser for him to die before you do so [laughter]\nSo therefore we create it will be called vision one hundred which is we want our firm to be as strong or stronger than it is today a hundred years from now and if that's the case then uh you know our clients that we're currently serving will be taken care of and so well they're down line family members et cetera et cetera so how do you do that well you have\nTo build a company that has enduring core values this is the result of my studying of lots of companies that have succeeded to last over a hundred years and I think family so to apply this to you personally\nFamilies that have succeeded that have been healthy and have endured as well over the years are ones that have very strong morals and values that they all it here too\nAnd those are taught from one generation to the next parent teachers child child teaches a grant or their child et cetera et cetera\nAnd so I Want to share with you core value number nine okay so core value number nine is to make a client every day that is our noble obligation\n[noise] so what does that mean well that sounds kind of like okay we'll go out and sell something and and it is I Do believe that we do need to have new clients are obviously and and the reason why I Do that is because I think what we do is noble if we help people to be financially secure I think that's very noble what we do but in the broader context then how would you would apply to in your life\nYou know I I my wife and I are about to celebrate our thirty third year of marriage\nAnd I believe in making my wife\nMy wife all over again\nEvery time I every time with her okay I make her a client every day my goal is to make her my wife again every day I never take for granted that because we're married you know the old song that you know ... I don't need to keep telling you I Love you all the time I told you that back then if it changes I'll tell you okay\nSo now you got to keep keep doing that making a client every day so we visit with a client when they come in to visit with us we want them to leave feeling like you know what I made the right decision in choosing money matters we want anybody that comes to ah talk to us that does not inclined to say you know what I Want to be a client\nSo in your life with your family with your friends your business associates make them a client every time it's your noble obligation what you do is noble and therefore you should take the time to have that person understand that every single time\nDon't ever take anybody for granted anything for granted because the moment you do as in a marriage you take a marriage for granted guess what that marriage will go way you take your children for granted your children will go away\nYou take your health for granted it'll go away All right so don't take anything for granted make yourself healthy everyday strengthen your relationships everyday everything and that's why we believe it is our noble obligation to make a client every day so that's our core value number not\nNow one of the things I'd like to invite you to do is to become a client of money matters if you are not\nAnd what you can do is you can go to our website is money matters dot net is our website money matters dot net\nAnd you have three things that you can do they're All right what one is you can get my market alert email and it's three goes out at least weekly and or you can subscribe to that also you can click on meat with an advisor and you can sit down with one of our financial advisors I think you'll find them to be professional friendly knowledgeable\nAnd they will help you to build your financial plan and uh we'll do all that at no charge or obligation and if it helps you fantastic and if it doesn't you know what that's fine too we will part friends\nAnd then finally you if you don't want to do any of those things that you can also do a third thing which is you can go to one of our seminars\nAnd over the years we've had thousands of people attend our seminars and uh I think they enjoyed them and you can learn about your retirement planning your a diversification Social Security all those kinds of things\nAnd uh and and and lots of information at our center so money matters dot net is our website for all of the above money matters dot net All right we're going to take a break and what are we going to come back we're going to talk about how to grow your money with confidence and not worry so much about losing it all so stay tuned this is money matters than I Am ...\nWith volatility in the market you may be asking yourself how will this affect my retirement savings will I Need to postpone retiring\nIs there anything I can do to avoid a bear market if these questions are on your mind it's time to get some answers to show you how to protect and maximize your retirement savings learn how the by hold and sell strategy can help you minimizing bear market declines and find out how money matters can help give you financial\nPeace of mind if you're over fifty\nAnd have more than one hundred thousand dollars in the best of all assets attend the next money matters seminar to learn how you can protect your retirement savings please visit money matters dot net to register for a seminar or call us at eight hundred nine nine four oh three oh two\nPolice register for an upcoming retirement seminar on Tuesday October twenty third courtyard Mary Pasadena old town and on Tuesday October thirtieth and the woodland hills country club by going online to money matters dot net\nOr was a um [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nMoney\nAnd we are back this is money matters of Kenmore rape and of course I Am your host can rewrite\n[noise] thank you\nJack I've been in the financial services business now for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years\nAnd all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas we talk about what our love it and most valued clients we not work with over a thousand families in forty three states\nAnd Forbes named our financial advisory from one of the top one hundred financial advisory firms in the United states [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "McIntyre In the Morning", "city": "Glendale", "day": "21"}
