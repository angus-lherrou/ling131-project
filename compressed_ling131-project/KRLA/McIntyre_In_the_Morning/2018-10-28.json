{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "And uh you can see how he contributed to his own demise in many ways and yet what the story unfolds is that although he was entirely responsible for his decisions as where the rest of the characters in the in the story high nevertheless Scott was at work in and threw it all\nI Love what you wrote in the very opening pages about that word Providence you said the province of God is that continued exercise of the divine energy whereby the creator preserves all those creatures is awkward even all that comes to pass in the world\nAnd directs all things to their appointed in in reading that against the backdrop of where we are for example in our nation today\nAnd a lot of Christians are struggling with his God lost control of his world and all of our own nation how do you react to that\nWhile I think that um at without being unkind to any of them\nHow they would do better to or read the Bible is a little more and watch TV a little less ... because that way that frame work and a point of reference would then be constrained far more by a conviction\nAbout the fact that a Jesus as an ascended king\nThat nothing is out of control or even if it seems like it's got to control that the lord God I'm an epidemic brands and um you know it's understandable that when all around our soul gives way or that we would be casting about it but\nIt said those points that we actually then discover that kind of ideological underpinnings that we have or that we don't have\n[noise] how ... was it for Joseph to experience all the suffering the betrayal the injustice that you know are describing that we know scripture oh what a useful purpose is could that have served for him and if so is any of that applicable to us in our struggles\nWell you know one of the things about the doctrine of Providence is that we have to remember that you know God is always working together in in a variety of circumstances\nYou know so if for example Joseph says why is this happening or you know when he finds himself in the pet well the answer to that question is not into this\nFor and to focus on that this is understandable but it's not it's not the answer\nA similarly if he says you know why is this going on in my life or why is this happening to me in actual fact what is happening to Joseph is not ultimately about what God is doing with Joseph but rather about what good is doing in the lives of other people who are around Joseph\nAnd so it it it actually is it's a helpful reminder to as that God is much bigger than our circumstances and that he's at work in a variety of of not only circumstances but in a variety of consequences you\nKnow for example in the story of a actually a bar so swear at the Holy Spirit is set to forbid them from a going out onto the next part of their plan journey and the response to that is frustration\nBut in actual fact the result of that is that the gospel then comes to Europe and moved from Asia to Europe\nFor the latter part of the book Alister you make the point of forgiveness how important was it not just for his brothers but even for Joseph maybe especially for Joseph that he could find it hard to forgive them\nYeah I mean absolutely crucial because without without that reconciliation then the story would be would just be hanging by by a thread wouldn't that um but in actual fact ah the reconciliation\nThat took place that took place at through all these various circumstances and that uh the alienation between him and his brothers and all of the jealousy that was represented in it\nMakes that great a conclusion of it just absolutely remarkable and particularly that Joseph is the one who takes the initiative and that Joseph has all of the power\nTo to respond to his brothers in kind he could have had them in prison he could have dealt with them to speak up there and said you know this is what you did to me and this is what I Will do to you and in that you see it's one of the great pictures of Joseph is one of the pictures in the Bible that\nPoint it has forward to the Lord Jesus Christ himself\nWho uh was humiliated before he was exalted and ah who through their sacrifice provides you know salvation who was brought down in order that he might be brought back up again\nAnd what the father is doing with Joseph is what he actually does with Jesus\nOr you know at the justice says to his brother she says you intend to do this for evil that God intended it for good which is exactly what ... is the case when you think about the death of Jesus that the religious authorities intended it for evil but\nIn that great moment of intended evil God was working the salvation of men and women it said it really is truly remarkable picture and into a reminder to us that God is much bigger than us\nAnd is it not true also pastors that the higher God may want to live any one of us up you've got to understand that he's going to first have to take us down in much similar way my right\nWell it's often a patch on this and that that uh that he breaks has before he makes us and uh he reduces I say and and of course the encouragement of scripture is that you know the heat how most himself will be exalted but he ... himself will be a based\nAnd um so yes I think many of us have learned a more of God's Providence and God's care through um disappointment and peers rather than through you know success and laughter\nComing up a sign that says I was pushed\nBuying and falling\nBut the lord how many more\nWith Alice

retirement planning Social Security estate planning income taxes\nYou name it we talk about it and we try to have more fun than a human being should be allowed to have when talking about all of this boring financial stopped\nAnd this week we have a lot of boring financial stuff to talk about because man has it been eventful on the markets and we have so much to talk about with you [noise] um but before we go one step further let me introduce myself I have been a sort of I Am can write the host of money matters with Ken ...\n[noise] that you had\nBeen a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd I do feel good and all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the very same ideas that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients and as a farm are for money matters we specialize in retirement planning so we work primarily with people that are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon\nAnd that we currently work with over for eight thousand four hundred beautiful wonderful families we are so blessed\nAnd all the ideas that we talk about this show these are the same ideas that we talk about with them every day of the week when we visit\nSunny over with you uh what what we're gonna talk about on this our weekly excursion into the land a personal finances so first of all\nIf you haven't noticed the stock market the Dow the S. and P. have been on a decidedly downward path shall I say I'm over the last what six weeks now\nAnd uh so many of you who have been listening to show for many many years now may be wondering if it is time to get out of the ah stock market of the S. and P. and other things\nAnd so I've been getting a question a lot and it reminds me right now of two thousand seven and so as you guys may remember for those of you who've listened to the show for low those many years or who have been getting my weekly a market alert email\nYou know the two thousand seven in November we uh we said it was time to sell it to get out of the stock market and and to stay out until June of two thousand nine when our by came\nAnd so those of you follow the advice route of the stock market during the credit crisis during the stock market crash of overweight\nAnd that there are some similarities right now to two thousand seven that I Want to share with you because it is looking like there's a there's a possibility that it may be time to sell so I Want to talk about that with you\nKnow also um this week we're going to continue or in our a journey down the Eighteen important risk that you face during your retirement and uh we are a number eight this week and of course number eight is very timely since it's called market risk [laughter]\nI didn't plan that ahead but boy is it tightly right I'm I'm kind of going in order\nAnd a number eight is market risk so that means is that when you are a retired person or you are about to retire um that is\nOne of the biggest risks that you face in terms of your investment is that you get hit by a big downdraft in your investments and now you don't have as much as you add ones hatch so uh we're gonna talk about number eight market risk now also\nSince we are a a firm that specializes in retirement planning a one of the big topics that we talk about with clients are pretty much I Would say every time we visited seems like\nUm is Social Security so we're going to have some ... we had to have some questions or that or I Want to share with you and of course the answers to those questions about Social Security that I think might be on your mind so we're going to have the Social Security does security to NA now also\nIn view of our philosophy so because we work with people who are mostly retired are retiring soon our philosophy of how to manage your money is preservation of principle comes first okay we want to grow your money certainly we want to give you the income all those things are important\nBut first and foremost we want to make sure that we protect your principal because for you to be able to go out and enjoy the all the things that you want in your retirement\nIf you get hit by a big bad bear and it takes down twenty thirty or fifty percent of your money you know that's going to change a lot for you so I'm going to ask you the question the average bear market and this is according to net Davis research going back\nTo the great depression the average bear market\nIs a loss of thirty seven percent okay so it's an average now two thousand and eight the U.S and he went down to fifty seven percent in in Y. two K. it went down forty nine percent so those were bigger than average so but let's just go with the average thirty seven percent\nSo I'm gonna ask you a question which I'll answer later on in the show but I'll kind of leave it with you a and the question is if you if you had to of course you don't want to but if you had to\nWould you prefer to lose thirty seven percent of your money at age sixty\nFour at age Seventy five\nWhich one do you think would be better age sixty or eight Seventy five and a if you answer like most people do you got it wrong [laughter]\nSo so we'll talk about that now you know what jak most shows would actually stopped there that's a ... the show that is chock full of great in the right and so most shows would just stop there but on the show do we only go where people expect us to of course we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before\nAnd therefore at about ten till we're going to have our state tip of the week\nAnd normally that's you know that's the part of the shall we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor\nBut this week we're going to talk about how to educate your greedy and washed undeserving heirs and so we're gonna talk about paying for college and not having to pay a gift tax okay because the IRS [laughter] [noise]\nYeah those guys they want the tax\nGift and college in most cases has more is is is expensive\nAnd you don't want to have to pay a gift tax so I Want to dive into everything but I Want to have a quick thing that I Want to share with you um money matters and and my family we are a we think the boys and girls clubs as one as a charity that uh you know really helps young people to it to become\nSolid citizens go to college all those kinds of things contribute to society in a positive way have a better life and so we are a benefactors of that and over the last\nSix years are the boys and girls clubs we've we've the sponsored a program that's called the ... sponsor a child [laughter] and uh so we want to raise money for that and last\nWeekend we had the gala at a ... in in Plano in North Dallas and uh we raised over a three hundred thousand dollars in the sponsor a child which was really phenomenal and now six years of doing that we've raised over two and a half million dollars for the boys and girls clubs\n[noise] and uh it is it is\nIt is really really something it's amazing how\nYou know if you put some energy into something good things can happen well let's talk about two thousand seven um you know are we we have as I mentioned they fell strategy but we don't believe that by and hold is enough that you should also have to sell strategy and this because the people that we work with primarily are you know wanting that they work their entire life\nYou've you've saved and everything and now you're retired and you're living on that money and you can't you know you got to preserve it and so our philosophy is is mostly defensive okay we want to preserve will be have to be able to grow it in the future\nAnd so you know with our by holding cells of philosophy we have certain criteria that says it's time to get out of the stock market and as our record this we haven't reached that yet so don't don't don't panic yet uh but this is very reminiscent to me of two thousand seven\nAnd what I mean by that is that you know one of the things that that kind of happens is that ah I guess I'm I'm human and I want to be a hundred percent accurate whenever we do something\nAnd so what happens is that you know when you get close to your cell signal where you're about to pull the trigger and say okay we're going to get out of the stock market you want to be right\nTo an arrow and he guided missile\nSo an arrow a bow and arrow or is it all the intelligence that this arrows going to have is that the point of release ride you're aiming you were taken into account when you're taking account all the stuff that's going on and you aim at you release\nAnd that era that's all the information is ever going to have and if the wind picks up the target moves you know something happens it's going to mess\nNow a heat guided missile on the other hand it's constantly adjusting and its tracking the heat of its target and it's following it wherever it goes\nSo that's what financial planning in my opinion is it's a heat guided missile that you are searching you you're constantly keeping your eye on making sure that your client never runs out of money that's the goal that the target and you adjust accordingly as you go\nA and I'm going to talk about later on in the show if if you had a preference of when you would have to lose money would it be earlier later and we'll talk about I'll give you some more specifics on that so if you're retired or retiring soon\nThen one of the things you should be thinking about uh with some anxiety\nAh is what's been going on over the last few weeks you know this market is a shaping itself up and it looks like we may be on the verge of the other bear market despite the good news and you know the thing about their markets as they come when nobody expects them I mean if if if you think about every very market this happened\nThe vast majority of people did not expect it you know everybody expected it probably wouldn't happen right\nSo therefore it's important that you prepare for it\nSo what I Want you to do is go to our website at his money matters dot net money matters dot

last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on the show these are the same ideas that we talk about with our love it and most valued clients [noise]\n... do and uh you know we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning and uh so we we primarily worked with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon and we currently work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states we are blessed we are honored\nAnd in two thousand Fifteen Forbes named our financial advisor refer money matters one

go their mind about Social Security estate planning all that kind of stuff\nWell this is the second to the show where I normally talk about Social Security so let's do that so here's a question uh can you enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nRefrain from claiming Social Security until Seventy and still receive delayed credits meaning you know if you wait till you're Seventy\nWhat happens is is that the amount of your benefit goes up each year that you wait by about eight percent\nSo if you're sixty six you wait till Seventy the benefit you're going to receive from Social Security uh journals for years goes up about thirty two percent which is a pretty good increase so the question is if I enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nBut I don't collect so screwed I wait till I'm Seventy well I still get those eight percent delayed credits the answer is yes okay so you can take Medicare without Social Security but not the other way around okay if you file for Social Security you must enroll in Medicare part a All right\nSo a second question\n[noise] um this one is a a a a person who has never applied for Social Security and his eighty years old\nAnd he applied for retroactive benefits okay so you never applied you waited Fifteen escape twenty Fifteen Years okay so if the applies now well his benefit including adjustment to make up for the last benefits\nAnd the answer is that uh the you can get\nSix months of retroactive benefits but that's all okay so he's not going to be able to go back and get fourteen years' worth but he can get six six six months' worth and it might come to it could be ten thousand dollars or more you know if you think about six months at age eighty ah with all the delay credits that went to late Seventy\nUm one more question we have time for it yeah okay so ... it's kind of person born in Nineteen fifty two\nThe pay his Social Security benefits to ... or received to date and then re file to obtain a higher current pay out okay so it's my understanding that uh I can do so but ah I went to the local Social Security office and they said they didn't even understand my question [laughter]\nSo here's the answer if it's been lasted twelve months since you filed you can withdraw your application repay your benefits and re filed okay so there's no need to go down and asked the local Social Security administration worker okay you just file essay form five Twenty one\nSo so if you're if you're if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can get you can repay what they've paid you and then re file later All right\nSo uh that's funny I I asked them and they didn't even understand the question\nWe have this talk with Tom I Am too so um as I mentioned uh we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning so all the things that ah that requires we want to help you with so uh we have seminars that I'd like for you to go to because\nAt the seminar we talk about do you have enough money to retire on we call that a magic number we
