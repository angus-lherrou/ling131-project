you mentioned the Holocaust actually because I often say to people that you know with the abortion story you know sixty million plus children that have died in America it's very hard for people to kind of get their heads around us\nAnd in some ways I think of our film in some way we do a little bit of what Steven Spielberg dates in Schindler's List\nYou know you're a member of that they had to

chance to get it how how anyone could listen to test many like ... that was given under oath and by someone standing who had watched his child live and try to breathe and try to you know try to

[noise]\nWell you know what are those of you are old enough to remember Matt Dillon from gun smoke there was an episode that I'll never forget and the famous line or but at least for me\nThat he said he said man who's not afraid\nHe's a fool [laughter] okay so you don't want to be a full so we'll talk about that and I also um as I said you know we specialize in working with people who are retired retiring soon uh most of our clients are over fifty\nAnd so we talked about the risks that you face one of the things as a financial planner you know we want you to enjoy the best retirement that you can we want you to have your second childhood without parental supervision we want you to go play enjoy whatever it is that you want your retirement looked like\nAt the same time do to make that happen I Believe we have to protect you from the risk that could take it away from you okay so this week I Want to talk about where we were on a series of the Eighteen risks faced in retirement\nAnd I want to talk about number six which is called frailty risk which is essentially the risk that your cognitive skills deteriorate as you get older and how do you plan to head for that and unfortunately it is something you need to plan for now speaking of planning for stuff\nOne of the most foundational basic question that you have to think about if you haven't started collecting Social Security already is when do you apply\nAnd so uh we're going to talk about that or this week we're going to have a a segment on went to apply for Social Security\nAnd uh we may not be able to get through all the questions that have lined up that I think you might be interested in so if we don't we'll continue it next week as well now one of the things I mentioned at the top of this show was that the you know we work as I said with people who are retired are retiring soon for the most part\nAnd so we believe that maintaining what you've spent your life building your investments your your net worth\nIs job number one if we're going to be able to generate the income to give you the the lifestyle that you want okay so therefore we believe that by hold which is you buy a bunch of investments high quality stuff and you create a great portfolio you re balance it and your job is done our view of that is that it's it's an incomplete strategy\nYou need to have a third part to that which is you need to have a cell strategy and that's why you know as I said we told our clients to sell the November of ... and they just stay out for all of two thousand and eight and then even half of all night we didn't say to buy until June of old nine\nSo we're we're we're by holding cell [noise]\nSo this week I Want to talk given to drop that we saw last week and how dramatically it happened and how quickly I Want to address the hey you don't have to worry about it because you're a long term investor everything takes care of itself over time time heals all wounds and all that good stuff your long term investor by whole too thick and thin [noise]\nWell I Want to talk about that one with you because I think that is one of the most dangerous things that people tell you if you are the aforementioned retired retiring so now most shows jak would stop right there most of those who say you know what if we did just that we have done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial show\nSomebody oh don't you dare stopped me because on this show do we stop there no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before and therefore at about ten till we all have our state tip of the week this is the part of the show leaves Jim on where we talked about how to pass\nOnto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and this week we're going to talk about my favorite trust is called a dynasty trust\nAnd this is where you can protect what you leave your heirs from lawsuits divorce and the state taxes for potentially one hundred years it's a terrific thing and we'll talk about that at about ten ...\nSo we've got a ton of get to but I Want to just quickly give a shout out\nTo a ... a listener Laura if you're listening and talking about you [noise] um I mentioned last\nWeek that we have a a puppy and the puppy uh she had this submissive being thing that she does like the mom and she sees me you know when I first come home from work or in the morning or whatever it is first time she sees me bam a gallon a ... right there she just squat and peace and it's like oh my gosh\nAnd so the lord I heard this and she sent me an email to ... we had the best\nI can tell you it's it's awesome thank you Laura [noise] she said it's a retired veterinarian so if anybody knows it's her right [noise]\nWell I don't know I have to call her she gave me a phone numbers you said call me and Laura I'm going to call you okay I just haven't had time to sweet but I'll tell you this weekend if if that's okay [laughter] anyway let's talk about in this house and ate all over again okay so\nYou know I Want to go back to a you know two thousand and Seventy end of two thousand seven October issue and all that\nAnd at that time\nYou know there were some clout there were some dark clouds or the unemployment numbers were starting to get weaker a there was a inflation was picking up\nThe economy was slowing down a little bit I mean there was no signs of what was to calm but there were signs there were some dark cloud let's say that it wasn't raining but there were dark clouds\nAnd uh and there was a lot of volatility the market was dropping dramatically and then a rising dramatically than dropping dramatically and at that time people were saying this is a buying opportunity you know when the market fell\nAnd by the way that's almost exactly what happened in Y. two K. in October of two thousand August through October same thing the market was going up and down the same way before it finally a sell off a cliff\nSo is this like that [noise]\nUm no in my view okay first of all the economy right now is not showing signs of weakening in fact it's the opposite is showing signs of strength unemployment is showing signs of strength inflation is is is in good shape so we got a lot of signs that no this is not two thousand and eight all over again so what is it\nWill basically it's a re calibration okay so in other words the Federal Reserve raise interest rates the market finally has come to terms with that and said oh my gosh interest rates are going up if interest rates go up people buy fewer houses pure cars\nYou know if you have stuff spread out over Seventeen different custodians and you've got to\nCounsel over the place that's fine for you because you're smart and you've got your spreadsheet and your little list and all that\nBut can others recreate what you've done probably not and so you know do them a favor consolidated all that stuff simplify it and make it easy for somebody else to step in and take over the responsibilities\nAnyway now that's a risk number six and I hope that helps you know again we have all the risks are the first five us a risk to end this one up posted on our website single find them

I've been a certified financial planner professional now for the last\nTwenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years\nAnd all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients and we're not work with over a thousand\nFour hundred families are in in forty three states oh and you know what it never ceases to our and

financial advisory for money matters one of the top three hundred\nRegistered investment advisors for the second time this year okay so that's\nAnd that's quite an honor and we're very proud of that but you know what without our clients we would be nowhere so I'd give that to them and we are affirmed that specializes in working with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired or retiring soon so we we look at retirement planning as our primary focus and us so that's\nYou we love to help you if he could and you can go to our website to find out all about us and we have tons of stuff on there for you we have podcasts and videos and articles all about the topics of a retirement planning\nAnd ah the website is money matters dot net okay so you can find it there so let's talk about Social Security and one of the uh areas are probably the most important a decision that you make when it comes to Social Security is\nWhen do you apply for benefits okay and if not sixty five anymore full retirement age for baby boomers now is sixty six sixty seven but Social Security benefits can be claimed any time between the ages of sixty two in Seventy\nSo it's crucial for you baby boomers out there to understand how claiming early benefits will reduce your benefits for life\nAnd how delaying benefits will increase it and how to coordinate spousal benefits as well and that's an area all by itself that requires a lot of studying knowledge and all that and so let me answer some questions that are that are the\nThat was looking at here so first of all why would you delay claiming your benefits if the average person will get the same amount from Social Security regardless of when they claim\nSo the way Social Security is designed just so you know is that they're going to pay out the same dollar amount to you regardless of when you start okay so if you start at sixty two they're going to pay you a lower amount for a longer period of time\nIf you start when you're sixty six they'll pay you a higher amount of money but for a shorter period of time to wait you're Seventy they'll do that even again so what happens is they actually end up paying you the same total amount okay it's just depending on the time zone so therefore why would you want to take a ... why would you want to delay it why would you take your sixty to\nThe problem is that most people will not outlive the will not live out an average life okay so uh you have to look at your life expectancy\nSo an average life means you live to be eighty six currently I think is the uh is is is the life expectancy\nSo you know I was talking to a client just the other day who whose mother is Ninety eight years old and she still drives her own car I mean she's healthy and his his brother is a eighty you know and he's healthy and fine so so in his case you know we got to look at longevity and how long it's going to be\nSo the first thing you want to look is is a is longevity\nAnd by delaying you lock up\nPermanently increased benefits for the remainder of your life and your spouse's life the second reason is if you're married as I said because then your spouse will get\nHigher benefit because they have the choice of whether to take their own or yours whichever is higher okay so if you delay does a higher amount that will be paid to you're surviving spouse\nSo there are reasons why you might want to delay even though the amount that you'll get in total dollars if you live to life expectancy is the same okay so something for you to consider now as I mentioned uh we do specialize in in in working with people who are retired are retiring soon and we look at ah we we primarily do work in the area of retirement planning\nSo if you are over fifty if you are retired or you are retiring soon [laughter]\nAnd then we're here\nFor you and our goal is to help more people in retirement than anybody else that's what we want to do [laughter]\nSo uh if you go to our website is money matters dot

enemies that you are will deal with during your retirement which is a inflation and taxes or income taxes and of course bear markets we also talked about ah do you have what we call your magic number will help you to calculate\nYou have enough money to retire on\nOkay that's a big question we'll also talk about five strategies that you can use to reduce drinking taxes when you retire we'll talk about how to maximize your cash flow okay so when you are retired is in my opinion it's all about cash flow you gotta make sure you have the cash coming in to cover the lifestyle that you want\nAnd you know we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision\nOkay that means you got to go play and have fun and you got to have the money to pay for all that stuff so we want
