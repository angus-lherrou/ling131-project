that the church will just become more and more beautiful than the eyes of God and the eyes of the church itself in in the eyes of the unbelievers\nOne of the things you did after you left cornerstone you took Lisa and your family and you started traveling throughout the world and I remember you sharing your story about I think it was in India\nWhere you were talking to some of the church the underground church and they were asking about the American church and they began to laugh at some of the things you were saying we get hung up on here in America\nThat was actually in China and and the idea was as a family we thought we were going to move to China or India or somewhere in Asia so we just sold everything\nLet's just stop wherever the lord calls us but when we were with the underground church in China my uh oldest daughter and I went to meeting\nAnd I was blown away as these people were telling stories about persecution I I just want to hear more and more and they're like why are you still want to treat I go because this is not quite sure where I come from you know like we actually go to a building that we call church\nAnd you know we listen to a message and everything some songs and we go home and we liked the church down the street a new path through speaks better then we'll switch you know or the child care over there are a little bit better\nAnd and they just started laughing because and I wasn't funny like when I left my daughter's like\nThat that was weird they were laughing hysterically and you weren't trying to be funny I go I Know isn't that crazy that they they they found like what we did as a ... foot ball\nUm how how could you read this book and come up with all the more I just sat with them and thought about it from their perspective the more I thought you know I think they're right\nThere are some things we do that we just started going down certain path I didn't really think it through and uh I could see why they would look at scripture and see a a a departure from scripture and our methodology\nPrint is how do we look at church in America do we look at it through sacred ice in the hearts I mean many people listening right now the same church well that's one hour a week\nYeah so sad to me I mean oh let me say like we're part of a church body you read if he didn't even know crisis your members of my body\nLike the literal like like you know racist and cherishes us because we're a member of his body it got do you guys wasn't mean do you understand what a miracle that like me human being dependent upon God for life\nThat quite which they can actually\nSent me the holy moly only God who's ... a whole lot light thing into existence I give you a body\nLike that is the greatest meal so on earth that I could be attached to him that's what it means to be a part of the body of Christ\nAnd so so the idea of how\nWe live with one another\nShould expresses amazing miracle to be joined with Christ is the cornerstone puff of the foundation me being that block in that temple ... living stone all creating one temple for God's will and\nThat is so powerful and so when we reduce it to\nWhat church do you go to who know or if we'd done what we've done with this amazing\nLike breathtaking mystery heavily reduced it\nTo going to a service have people like myself lost the understanding of just how sacred that says\n... ... it's we live in a culture where everything is self centered ness we're so busy we're so distracted it's almost like when you talk about the sacredness of being a part of the church it's like we don't have\nTime to have reference or even have a relationship or an experience of God\nYeah I mean it just seems like it's a place we rushed to in barely get there on time always show up late\nRather than this group of people that we cannot wait to get around with him do that on a regular basis seeking the presence of God and the thing is I\nI I just I don't want people to miss out we're only here for a few years on the earth\nAnd just this past Sunday you know just getting up early getting on my face and you think I Want to be a lasting not want to be a lasting\nEveryone I see you know this morning that comes over I Want to I just want to be a blessing to them give me a spiritual gift so I can bless them and serve them let them know that I Love\nYou know is there any way that we could get six Yuri into your God like could you should you know like I see in the book of crises some sort of power all on a ... ... they're just ... and we just\nHave to in some way like that's what I think about what I think about gathering gathering a gift\nAnd I just feel like people miss out because they show up they want to be fed they want something to be done to them rather than really thank God do something for me manifest through may use my gifts to bless these people that I Love ... so much\nAnd coming up someone decided to start bringing your Bible to school day

[noise]\nBecky jak I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the very same ideas that we talked about with our ... and most valued clients\nAnd we're not work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states it is an honor it is a privilege\nAnd we are a retirement planning specialist so we work primarily with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon and so if you would like to learn more about us you can find us on the Web we are at money matters dot net\nAnd one final thought is not to brag at all but uh recently actually for the sixth year in a row I was named one of the top one hundred a financial independent financial advisors or by parents\nAnd we love you baby well\nThank you and without our clients we would be nowhere so therefore I put that one I gave it to them now let me go over with you what we're going to talk about on this our weekly excursion into the land of personal finances so first of all I'm the economy is strong\nOkay by all measures we got a uh uh the employment data looked a little softer than people thought but that's okay it's still pretty strong about two hundred thousand jobs a month now which is an economy our size that's pretty darn good\nAnd so the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates and we saw that the ah the ten year went which is the most watched interest rates that are a traitor look at has gone up and now it's looking like it's going to hover around three and a quarter if it stays there that's a big thing so I Want to talk\nWith you about have you review your bond portfolio lately\nOkay because if you have and you knew or should I think so we'll talk about that also\n[noise] since we are a retirement planning specialist we talk with our clients about a planning around all of the things that we can think of that have to do with achieving their goals having them we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision okay we want you to go play and have fun and just relax and enjoy\nAnd so to do that we believe you need to have a a a plan in place that addresses all the things that could harm you\nAnd believe it or not when you are retired there are actually Eighteen risks that you face the Eighteen of him\nAnd up properly designed plan in my opinion is one that addresses all Eighteen of those so we're going to talk about risk number seven this week which is financial elder abuse okay so if you have an older family member or someone in their seventies eighties\nUh or or older I Want to talk with you about that it's a big big deal uh unfortunately also going to talk about Social Security this week so uh we're going to answer the question when should you wait until you're Seventy to start collecting Social Security\nOkay so there are reasons why you may want to do that and so we want to help you understand that uh that strategy\nNow also from it from an investment standpoint you know we want as I said we want you to enjoy your second childhood so whatever that means to you if you if it means playing a lot of golf if it means traveling if that means spending time with your grandchildren whatever that means to you\nThat's great we want to help you achieve that but if you lose a large amount of your money in the next market downturn then I Would argue that being able to do those second childhood activities will be very difficult if you don't have the money for it\nSo therefore when we manage money for our clients we have an overarching strategy that\nIs called by hold and sell okay meaning that we don't believe that by hold is enough you also have to have a strategy to sell and so this week I Want to talk with you about a by whole myth that is a I heard or I've called because I've heard it and that is that if you sell\nYou know and we advocate if you sell you go into cash to protect your money while you're in cash you're not going to make any money and if you don't make any money that's a bad thing\nAnd that's the silliest thing I've ever heard but I ... well maybe not ever but I put it up there and I want to go with you why I think that one is just really dumb okay so we'll we'll talk about that now most shows would stop right there I mean most of us would say you know if we did all that we've done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial show\nTo infinity and buses right do we stop right there on the show no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has\nGone before and therefore at about ten till we will have our state tip of the week and this week the estate tip is called a Q tip\nOkay so this is normally we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but this week we're going to talk about how to pass it on to your uh not too you're very uh what's the opposite of greedy I'm giving [laughter]\nWashed and very deserving spouse okay and that's called a Q tip trust it's a special kind of trust designed to protect your spouse so we'll talk about that at about ten to ... to dive in before we do I just got to have a quick update you know it's interesting jak jak as my producer extraordinary [noise] um\nYou know I I I've kind of talked about we have this uh now seven month old puppy ... now ways fifty pounds I mean this is this is when you look at her she'd like a big dog and you forget but she's just a baby um and so you know but ah her name is noodle and she's a noodle so it's noodle dishes noodle\nAnd uh so the the update 'cause people apparently are interested in this I don't know why is that a noodle house training has progressed okay we had a moment there where it wasn't going well so now she she doesn't ever poop in the house anymore okay so that's a big plus I Would say right\nHowever and she doesn't pee however what she does do is this the mission P. thing it's awful it's like the first time she sees me she slots and ... a gallon of pee on the floor and I'm like what the heck you know\nAnd I can't stop it it's like I've tried like he's being outside and opening the door so she comes out to me but then she pays right on the patio and golly I don't know how to stop this people tell me they they outgrow it eventually but I Hope so [laughter]\nAnyway so let's talk about interest rates the economy uh the jobs numbers that we saw this week uh looked pretty strong not as strong as some forecasts were expecting but still two hundred thousand jobs you know a month is what the economy is producing right now\nThere's some talk that the unemployment rate has rates so low that it can go lower than\nYou know the problem with that is that we always look at what we called the ... what's called the participants labor participation rate which is the number of people of working age that are actually working\nAnd that number is still very very low relative to history so therefore there are a lot of people that are now coming into the workforce that weren't in it and if you're not in the workforce you're not counted in the unemployment numbers\nSo that unemployment rate number the headline number is actually one that we don't really look at we look at the labor participation rate and it's still low so there's a lot of room for people to come in and start working still so the economy is strong\nAnd so the fed most likely it's going to continue to raise interest rates and we've seen interest rates spike here in the last few days with that realization that we've been telling you that this is something you should be thinking about for several months now\nNow the the question I Would ask you is have you review your bond portfolio if you have bonds and your portfolio and and we do we believe that bonds are part of a diversified portfolio um you need to look at what's called the duration of your bond portfolio\nYou know first of all no where everything you've got is and what it's doing so when you get a call that says you know your your investment or whatever is a ... something's happening there you know that it's not true uh open and send your own male\nOkay don't have somebody else reads your e mails for you open your mail for you or anything like that because they'll get communications that will have your account numbers and all those kinds of things on it and then they can take advantage of that\nSame thing with signing of checks and and credit cards and all that kind of thing to do it yourself don't have somebody else to do that for you\nSet up a direct deposits for all checks that you get you know for example Social Security other things to make sure that any regular checks that you get a direct deposit it to your back because if they are sent to your house somebody gets it and guess what okay\nUse use your voice mail if you get a call from somebody from a a a a number that you don't recognize don't answer that let it go into voicemail listened to the voice mail and then decide if you want to go after that\nAnd then finally make sure that uh you're wills\nYour advanced directives powers of attorney or executed to ensure that only trusted individuals' can step in to make decisions for you okay and and if you are a child of an older person than those same things would apply for you okay\nSo just something for you to think about now as I mentioned we are a retirement planning specialist we work with people primarily who are over fifty who are retired or retiring soon so that you\nThen or if you go to our website at his money matters dot net money matters dot net\nUm you can sign up for one of our seminars we had seminars that talk about uh your four one K. and diversification are we talking about where to get income from when you are retired we talk about how to make the decision on went to take your Social Security benefits we talk about\nHow to determine how much risk is appropriate for you you know you want you want to do you want to take only as much risk as is necessary to accomplish your financial goals that's one of our our basic philosophy is we don't want to take any more risk than is necessary so you've got to figure out what that risk level is and we will help you with that\nWe'll also talk about your magic number okay so the magic number is how much money do we it will help you to calculate what we think is the amount of money you should have to be able to retire on\nAnd so that'll help you to know if you have it

a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talk about on the show these are the very same ideas we talk about with our ... and most valued clients\nAnd uh we are so thankful we not work with over a thousand four hundred families and forty three states\nAnd we are a retirement planning specialist so we work primarily with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon and so that's you we would love to meet you and become your friend have you become a member of our family and help you to get through your retirement we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision\nSo we want you to go play good to have fun and not worry about all of this boring financial stop\nNow Financial Times named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top three hundred registered investment advisors for the second time this year so we're very proud of that\nBut again without our clients we would be nowhere so thank you thank you thank you so we're going to talk now about a topic that comes up I Would say just about every conversation we have with our clients\nEven with people who are in our clients who are considering it and that is Social Security okay and so one of the big questions that if you haven't started collecting Social Security that you probably have is when should I start\nAnd then there's another which is how should I collect it\nAnd it's very interesting but if you look at all of the different permutations of that decision whether you're widowed whether you're married difference in ages difference in income different in health all those kinds of things there are actually eight thousand combinations of\nThat the answer to that question how how and when I take my Social Security and what's crazy is that one of those is yours [laughter]\nOkay so how do you figure that oh well I mean I'm thinking right it could be just one maybe there's more than one but it seems to me there's only one that's right for you so you gotta figure that one out and it's not easy and I mean it's complicated\nYou know our advisors in our firm we put we we have in fact a starting next week we're putting them through intensive training I mean it's it's someone who spend their time learning about Social Security still has to stay up on it the laws changed\nI mean it's it's it's complicated\nAnd so for you and I'm Talking about you ladies and gentlemen listen to the show as a lay person that doesn't do this for a living you know I Would say that the odds are stacked against you that you're going to make the right decision so be that as it may\nI Want to help you to have some of the criteria you should be thinking about so one of the questions would be you know should I wait till I'm Seventy\nAnd start collect Social Security then now just to set the stage Social Security you can actually start when you're sixty two assuming you qualify so you can take\nYeah start taking Social Security at age sixty two but if you wait for every year that you wait the benefit that you're going to receive increases and from sixty six through Seventy eight increases by eight percent per year\nThe benefit that you received us okay so\nIt there's an incentive to wake because the benefit is larger however you're giving up the money while you're waiting so there's a disincentive to so there's some math involved in that\nBut let me give you generally what we believe to be the reasons why you may want to weigh two you're Seventy okay one big reason is that when you die your spouse has a choice of getting your Social Security or there's whichever is the higher okay\nSo if you are in bad health or or something where you have a low life expectancy\nThan it may make sense for you to wait till you're Seventy because then the benefit that you'll receive will be the highest and then upon your death your spouse will take over that benefit and get that highest amount and so that's one big reason why you may want to another reason that you may want to is that you know you don't need the money\nBut as I always tell clients when they say that as well if you don't need the money then started taking it a sixty six and just give it to me [laughter]\nIf you don't want it I'll take it [laughter]\nBut uh anyway yeah so if if you feel that uh you know you don't need the money you may want to wait because also one of the things that can happen is that your spouse can collect half of yours and if you both weight than the benefit that you get at Seventy could be a lot higher as well\nSo there are some reasons to wait until you're Seventy generally speaking though they are few there there's very few reasons why sixty six is normally the best time to take but ah there are reasons to take it at Seventy now if you are over fifty if you are retired or retiring soon\nIf you are within five years of retirement or five years after retirement that ten year period than we want to talk with you OK we want to help you to build your plan we want to help you to look at your cash flow we want to help you to make important decisions that you need to make with your retirement\nSo here you got two options won it and they are they all start with going to our website which has money matters dot net okay so the website is money matters dot net now while you're there\nYou can either decide you want to visit directly with an adviser and if you click on meat with an advisor we'll call you will schedule time to
