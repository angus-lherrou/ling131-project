was doing it left wing as opposed to a civil libertarian agenda Bette Midler caused an uproar unhappy about\nThe Brett Kavanaugh hearings feeling that Dr Christine Ford was not given enough time

should be believed all men should not be believed\nFor those of you who felt that it's perfectly OK to accuse somebody who's had up until now impeccable reputation\nOf a sexual assault without any cooperating witnesses corroborating evidence\nThat's not to say and I never have said and I defy you to find when I have said that Dr Christine Blasey Ford is a liar I've never said that I Do think something happened to her is not my job to determine what happened to her though if my job to determine whether or not\nWe we are fairness here and as Susan Collins pointed out this is not a jury trial so it's not a standard beyond a reasonable doubt but certainly got to be more likely than not which which he said\n\nAnd given his reputation given the number of women that voucher his reputation given that nobody's ever made a kind of allegation before given that he's now undergone seven background checks given that the for people to talk of Ford say where they're all say they have no recollection of it that does not meet the standard of more likely than not\nFor those of you who were\nYelling and screaming berating people like breathing Senator Flake look at me look at me look at me\nFor those of you who believe that just because I'm applying this more likely than not standard therefore I Believe that Dr Ford is lying that believe a sexual abuse harassment and assault or not serious problems in America have been listening\nFor those of you who took up on this issue [noise] not really so much because you're concerned about the issue because you want to stick it to Trump\nBecause as I told you the primary reason that people are afraid about Kavanaugh is because they believe to overturn roe v Wade\nNot listen to me very carefully\nSomehow some way this country function until Nineteen Seventy three with every individual state determining laws on abortion\nIn states like New York California in fact in states where Seventy percent of the population resides had abortion pretty much on demand\nAnd there's no reason to believe that even when Ravi weight or to be overturned in a matter of goes back to the states\nThe landscape would shift any sort of dramatic way right now in conservative states you will not be able to find an abortion doctor they'd been shamed out of business\nAnd individual states for all the way we're overturn what makes you think the state legislatures would suddenly enact anti abortion laws given their own popularity in those states so in the real world\nNot a whole lot with change now how and why Ravi way became known as a quote right to an abortion case it's beyond me\n\nAnd if you look at the LA Times article not Fox that Breitbart National Review came out a few years ago about the opening of the papers of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI watched it on Fox Fox had a little box in the lower right hand corner of a of people will appear to be in the hallways of maybe Congress holding up signs anti Kevin outside we believe for we believe her and as\nCarl is with speaking she spoke almost half hour she started out very slowly and you didn't know where she was going to go kind of built up to it [noise]\nYou could see the screen and the bottom right the there were two women that were in the forefront and you could just tell they weren't happy the way the same as going and they put their hands over their head when she began to wrap up when you can tell she was going to vote to confirm Kevin on they just looked distraught\nAnd then I'm watching them and listening to comment I said did you hear anything she said\nWas what she said unreasonable none of it made any sense to you don't you care about how she ... got to her position\nShe said she spent more time on this one over hundreds of cases a was a brief to she said I think once a week by some a group of legal experts such you understand what this was all about\nAnd she very carefully went over Christine force testimony and very sensitive Lee said as I said before that uh that she believed her she believes something happens before we can assign what happened to her to Kavanaugh has got to be fairness\nAnd while this is not a criminal trial and therefore you don't apply to standard of beyond a reasonable doubt into a moral certainty certainly it's got to be at least more like even the nod and she went over the evidence in such a name for people\nWho she claims were were there and the four people either have no recollection of it or say they weren't there now now what do you do with that\nAnd ... also said that the person who who took her to the party or or or brought her back a has never shown up she got home somehow she didn't fly shouldn't say that about didn't fly I had at that but um she got home somehow and whoever it is we've got our home never came forward and told us about who he or she was\nAnd so given the background of having all the reputation of Kevin ... all the women that are supported him all the women he's worked with with no allegation\nAnd we're going to deny him the seat on the Supreme Court because a woman who cannot cooperate or claim doesn't really know the year doesn't really know where does know how she got that isn't how she got back didn't tell anybody she said that just doesn't fast past the fundamental fairness test and everything she said she's a moderate\nBut the women in the bottom right hand corner apparently weren't listening for had turned it off or felt that\nUh somehow it didn't make any sense I mean did you hear what you had to say\nDoes not matter that you wanted people to think it through I bet you wanted to be an FBI investigations that you have more confidence that Dr Ford delegation heaven thoroughly bet if
