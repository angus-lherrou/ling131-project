nine seven on said Mark Davis in\nFort Larry Elder let me hit the reset\nHa tell you where exactly we are and what are my thoughts on some things and then the idea is that you share your thoughts\nAbout some things and we hope that uh that you will do so eight eight eight nine seven on stage eight eight eight nine seven on stage real quick as we begin or would you be the first on the movie everybody's talking about before the elections destination new national issues is masterpiece\nIs on DVD at about five days\nOctober thirtieth really states or your copy today at ... dot com death of a nation movie dot com directed it so you know is compelling so go get that\nDestination movie dot com\nOkay the mystery packages the story seconds the finger pointing continues and let's make a list what we don't know and what we know this is how you stay sane throughout this entire thing right now my list of what we don't know\nAnd what we know may differ from yours you may think you know some things that I don't you may think some things that I think I Know are in dispute and that's why we have telephone lines are so um do dress [noise]\nHere's what we do not know we don't know who sent these packages okay can we start at the most basic we have no idea who sent these packages for why\nI and that's where you stop your toe for the first time it's like wait a minute don't we know that this is some expression of hate for for liberal uh iconic figures clearly sent by some nut bag on on the right [laughter] oh we don't know any such thing\nYou know is that probably the greatest possibility yeah because we have are not bags to\nKnow the left as guys who shoot up baseball fields and and the left has tons of people who uh we'll shout you ought to a restaurant and claw like zombies doors to the Supreme Court and do all kinds of other who feels off nonsensical thing we've um we've we've got our crazy used to\nBe the thing that [noise] that started to wrap itself around me when the story first began and the and the and the tally of mysterious packages started to grow\nAnd you know doesn't tend to be something we do and I and why\nIn the world would exactly being that's earth logic why would you do it sometimes you send somebody a pipe bomb 'cause you want to kill them but you know ... nothing exploded yet you know what I mean\nAnd I think that was the one and sources mailbox where the where the the white powder was nothing it was in art now and then by the way that doesn't make it okay if you send somebody something just to scare the or the ... out of them that's that's a terrorist act as well\nSo you don't have to blow up for you to have done something very very illegal\nBut is it okay for you if you keep that uh that hopes antenna primed and dialed in you bet it's okay mine is\nDoes it mean I'm declaring it a hoax I'm telling you I Know it's a hoax I Know that the left doing this to the left sort of we can you know spread out and have some myth of equivalency like yeah we're ... we got a lot of restaurants were chasing Ted Cruz out of restaurants we at Maxine Waters advocating hooliganism but\nYou have your crazies do you're trying to kill the Clintons and the Obamas and Joe Biden and Robert Deniro you\nPeople are just like us yet no we're not okay because even if even if we do find that this is one conservative lunatic you know what that is one conservative a lunatic\nWe have more to be sure but um it it's not our rank and file really hopped up activists who are out doing things that countless thousands of leftist are doing\nAll the time there is no comparison so the thing that we don't know is who did this and why we do not know\nHere's what we do know a media culture that takes Trump's God's will do anything to tag him with this bad story\nAnd that is why you actually get I mean I I heard Wolf Blitzer I was kinda funny I was getting out of the car dollar rent on serious actually I'm In the car [noise] Wolf Blitzer talking to some congressman or something we know we have CNN just if you ever have the president's ear tell them that we we really tried to get things right and we're not involved\nIn fake news like will shut up dude it's pathetic it's sad\nI mean they've got a great idea of you and Don Lemon you know want to go you know build a tree house in the backyard never a club meeting punchy decided to start covering things fairly covering things honestly lose the corruption fire drill a cost to get your act together\nYou don't lose the Trump during ... syndrome and become a real news organization because of the cries of fake news are real and deserved and valid an\nAccurate and I'll just try a ball around mess and then I'm going to your calls eight eight eight nine seven on stage eight eight eight nine seven ... as the question hangs from the rafters\nShould the president dial back his rhetoric in view of the there's this package story or blah blah blah blah blah\nShort answer is no\nThere is nothing nothing in President Trump's rhetoric that somehow necessarily lead to somebody doing something like that even if it is a nut job conservative there is zero connection to be made there none by thinking people\nBut by people who have had a bug up there but about Trump since the day he won there's plenty of material and they're going to use it and they're going to hammer it and they're going to bludgeon it and you know what it's going to backfire to\nJust like Kevin are just like the caravan desk is going to backfire too you don't see voters are paying attention today say wait a minute what now vis\nFirst we have a media apologist planted it embedded with the caravan trying to uh uh uh characterize it as as some noble pursuit\nWe have what the media instead of Democrats did in the cabinet debacle and now they're taking this very admittedly unfortunate and scary story of devices showing up at a at some Democrat male\nIt's just and then try to blame Trump for it are you kidding me this will make people crawl on broken glass to vote Republican\nSo please keep it up guys please keep it up [noise] we're in San Diego hey Sean Mark Davis in for Larry how you

um on Tuesday of next week I'm let's let's hit the reset top of the hour we sat on what we're doing the mystery packages I Am hearing a lot of skepticism about the preferred narrative of we have a conservative terrorists\nI'll believe we have a conservative terrorists when we have a conservative terrorists in handcuffs being arrested and fingerprinted till then I Am open to absolutely anything up even shots Todd but it's kind of interesting\nEven Chuck Todd said today apparently uh\nHow about the Russians some some and and you know why I don't know conservative terrorists Russians Democrat prankster or any of the amount of ... absolutely no idea no idea\nHow the misspellings and ineptitude it if it is the Russians and the Russian government that some you know idiot Russian guy in his basement and you know Michigan or something I don't do so again the speculation games lovely part of the game to play with your friends\nI have no idea and neither do you so it makes it a very bad idea\nDidn't jumpy unlikely kind of know and that's that that's the third level of obnoxious best to all this presumption then there's this gall to a modern media culture has to lecture President Trump about his rhetoric when they call him a Hitler every day for lunch\nCome on man I'll take no lectures from CNN about civility than they are\nAt the end and decency in a discourse party number is eight eight eight nine seven one stage so we we have no idea what's going on the package story let us lift up of prayer and every good wish for law enforcement and for the people who are working on this so we can get the bottom of it maybe sci fi and find out what the emcee and find out what is what I'm going to say one thing\nYou can join me on this or not it free country if they don't find a suspect like in in weeks and I mean 'cause if it was just some moron terrorist who happens to vote Republican\nUh they're gonna find them probably by the weekend so if they don't find anybody for a few days year my skepticism is only going to grow but again I Will reach no conclusion I Will jump to a to know bottom line\nTrouble at the game come to me\nHere's something I'm not going to let come to me it was a caravan\nPresident Trump apparently in the same mood deploying the military secretary of defense James Mattis signing deployment orders [noise]\nAs we speak sense and military down there I said for weeks that if if if this caravan gets the feeling they're about to get ... by the United states military and I don't mean they're going to get you know rolled over by tanks or anything but um they may turn around and and think better of this let me let me do this I've been sitting on this ... this new column [noise]\nNews written an opinion piece in um on Fox News today migrant caravan on the large what we must do it for women caravan arrives at\nOur border ready here we got the caravan of an estimated seven thousand Central American invaders trekking through Mexico toward the United states is roughly one thousand miles from the nearest point of entry a second group of roughly one thousand is also seeking to join them\nThey may still be weeks away from our border but there's leaves a little time for President Trump\nCongress and all Americans who care about our national sovereignty and the rule of law to solve three incredibly pressing challenges first we must determine and do what we can right now to end this invasion before it reaches our doorstep\nSecond we must develop and execute a cohesive efficient effective plan for preventing these invaders from illegally crossing our border and force swiftly deporting those who are successful\nAnd finally we must fix the debilitating lease stupid amalgam of immigration laws policies and court rulings that enable and encourage migrants to band together and stage these types of illegal invasions\nShould we fail to solve any of these problems are already dysfunctional immigration system will be further crippled our relationship with Mexico and Central American neighbors can be severely damaged our border will be overwhelmed by droves of new migrants and America will become significantly less safe\nIf this caravan is allowed to get through the end of the U.S the next caravan will be even bigger the one following that will be enormous according to the gallon world both twenty nine percent of people who watch to migrate from Latin America the Caribbean want to make the United states they're permanent home that is thirty seven\nMillion people who want to come here we must demand and ensure that they do so legally\nDeclares dancer do alleviating decision while the Caribbean is still in Mexico is for Mexico to stop it President Trump is already made clear that securing the border is more important than our recent trade agreements with our southern neighbor Mexico should take him seriously\nAnd many of the members of this caravan forced their way through the Guatemala Mexico border they're already in violation of Mexican law Mexican law enforcement should take action\nFurthermore we should not underestimate the degree to which human traffickers and trains national criminal gangs such as that as Thirteen and other cartels are involved with this invasion force\nMexican authorities should also be seeking to weed these elements out of the caravan and dealing with those who may have legitimate asylum claims through the Mexicans system\nMexican neighbors must understand that while they did not assertively deal with this problem at their southern border they will own the problem if it gets to their northern border this relates to what we must do it for when the Caribbean is allowed to arrive at the U.S border\nPresident Trump should instructive journey general Jeff Sessions to issue a clarification to define the qualifications for asylum asylum is meant to provide protection for people who are fleeing real persecution and human rights abuses such as genocide simply being from a poor country that lacks opportunities does not\nQualify someone for asylum\nWe already have approximately seven hundred and fifty thousand backlogs asylum cases\nThese
