{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "Okay why emailer here it's either a higher ha ha there are only soft you hear that might show anyway I have to develop my neighbor to my good hand friendship or good hands out while a\nThat is what we've been talking about and that is the the issue um are are they interested in bottom line profit or are they interested in doing what in fact is it important to their um consumers the reality is is that\nThe uh article you are the ad you referred to\nThat sounds to me like a a trial lawyer before dark and every year we should be able to put out a trial lawyer report card and say what have we done this year to make a good place this a better place for you to live\nThat make the better product safer see that you get your ... your bills and medical bills paid see that you get your insurance benefits the problem is\nThat takes a great deal of money and are advertising budget it pales in comparison to the advertising budget that all these major multi million billion dollar insurance companies have the spin\nAnd so that rather than a recognize with the advances their interest that of course the only in their corporate image only\nThe problem is and I I really wonder who run these companies who are these people it's kinda like the movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid who are those people because\nWhen you have a safer product and when you point out to all the things that have happened to these vehicles that means less death lasts injury less insurance claims is we're out there making money for these people so rather than attack as you think they might even\nA little short thank you every now and I was a real bad but so I Would wonder why haven't these titans of industry figured out\nThat there is profit and there is money and doing the right thing\nAnd that looked at work together as a team now that does sound ... but the reality is I just can't figure it out because I think ... dollars bottom line basis\nWhat we try to accomplish is to put ourselves out of business and make cars safer have people not get injured in the first instance not suffer serious injury or death\nAnd in the process of doing so we get all this incredible resistance it's a\nIt's it's enough to I guess to make your passion it's enough to make you angry at them enough to make you a engage in like we had this great dinner the other night called rage for justice\nOr does I we're all full of rage as long as we keep our ad job\nAnd it isn't just the trial or is it the group like the foundation for taxpayers and consumer rights is the Harvey Rosenfeld than the Jamie according to the world who are doing this and sacrificing to try to make things better for consumer working with the nurses working with lawyers anyone who will listen to them\nAnd they do this dinner and and they and they remind us that it's not just that we need to do ... says we have to have a rage for justice to keep us driving and to keep us moving\nYou know I'm all these toys the get recalled\nBecause of lead paint in the toys somebody just because the heads pop off and the children suffocate forty five percent of those toys that have been recalled the sheer for manufactured in China\nSo now than a manufacture here ... obviously there are less expensive sending out into the marketplace subjecting now\nChildren to some very serious risk of harm and when a mom or dad goes to the store to buy toys [noise] they don't go test it from land they don't go tests the if the head's gonna pop off they don't and choke the child they don't do any of that [noise] so the\nThe real a source here of product quality has to be with the person selling the product\nAnd unless there's a severe penalty in serving up a bad product I think it's a lot cheaper to sell the one from China when they hit box offered the lead results or whatever [noise] so [noise]\nI think the trial lawyers do pretty good but widely\nTheir budget cases out there that are total baloney the lawyers should never bring better bright and insurance companies have to defend that case corporations have to defend the case and the cases baloney\nTrue with me or not I I'm with you on that and I totally agree and we've seen it in our practice a for a long time but the problem is is that number one those are a those are a few of the case that they are they're very much lower percentage of cases as a whole\nWe are all in perfect human beings and an imperfect world that means that are going to be bad trial lawyers who bring bad cases\nBut you don't fill out the baby with the bath water and the reality is yes there are some abuses and we're alert to that I Know that Amy will be working on that in our leadership with the trial lawyers here to help eliminate those types of cases\nWe've uh I've ... you know our biggest problem in terms of getting rid of bad cases are it's not us as the bar association or the trial lawyers police in ourselves\nWe do that not as well as maybe we could but we do that\nI've had many conversations with insurance adjuster his insurance claims people the people who had up the claims department and I say why do you pay those claims why aren't you engaging in ... the discovery and the fraud why aren't you saying no and not paying these claims\nAnd they said why Ali we figured out it's cheaper to pay them than it is to fight them\nSo we just go ahead and pay them I said but by paying them you're you're part of the culture and part of the problem\nAnd they made an economic decision not at the what's right\nJust eliminate some of these bad claims eliminate some of these lawsuits but to allow them to continue because it's in their economic best interests to do so\nYeah why they but guess what you can't blame the people who were brought into a case that don't belong in the case you can't blame them for that that's all there is\nNo no I'm not blaming them I'm saying that there are claims that are the person who had the claim brought against them and the Kerry who knows it have decided it's easier to make a payment than it is to force those cases the trial because again it's short term thinking when they stand up to those cases those cases will start to go away\nThe short term solution for them is to make a simple payment and move on yes all yes there are people who get broaden the law suits that don't belong there and they shouldn't be either I mean I Know it's difficult sometimes to say yes that I might have to pay ten thousand dollars\nTo the Vita five thousand dollar claims that I just pay five thousand dollars I've saved myself five thousand dollars but that short term thinking\nAnd I saw him what are you going to do about it\nI think we continue to police are around I think it's a really small minority and I think it's really easy to say that a lot less until it here on\nTo your own and that is going to bring us to the end of our time together today and I got to tell you it with our guests today we could probably do a month's worth of programs and still not scratched the surface\nChampions of justice with Tom ... and joining us in Studio today Amy fish Solomon are just attorney

people to help Franco CSI a project manager in Nigeria and I were there to bring aid to assess the situation um to come back to the United states so surely stories with people that that can offer

eight children\nUm\nYou're talking about pastor John to me just a bit ago he had a really ... what we had to he had to have this whole church burned down is that we're telling Davis\nIs one of the things that is just an outrage when the flooding comes through their specifically finding the churches are they're burning the churches down raising the churches out desecration churches\nAnd they take over the terror they take over the lab and they'll rebuild the from the foundations of the church that will tend to rebuild a mosque\nThat's why we can't let this happen they have to stand up for our brothers and sisters so John pastor John also from the Anglican Church was one of these passers who was threatened he did a CNN interview some months ago and when the fall and he found out that he was speaking out against us\nThe ... and they targeted him specifically he told his family his wife has kids when you go to the marketplace don't use your last name because when they find out that we are in the area they're gonna they're gonna find where we are going to kill us so he was living under that type of fear\nAnd they came they destroyed his church and you know a pastor John he's got a great sense of ... spirit and are they lost their church but they found a a mess tent their media inside that ten now as we're not going to let the full any stop us from eating together\nAnd that churches continuing to this day and John continues to speak out a threat of his own life\nOkay threat of his own life threatening his own family's life their church burned down yeah for any of us at any one of those things would have to stop us in our track say we're not going to do this we're ... we're not do the same more as his church is now they're meeting in a tent\nThe meeting the tent and John is one of our partners helping deliver the eight in the region so he's not just like\nHis ground he's ... he's helping others\nAs a phenomenal don't you know I mean you know this speak to this this is this is we're feeling the tank for for Christians to be able to have the boldness to say\nThis is our ground this is our territory we love going to forgive but we're also going to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ regardless of what happened and we're\nKeeping that Kendall of that whole nests there are we not\nExactly like in the book of acts believers in prey take away the ... persecution there's a lot in the midst of a threat let your serve and speak to your word with great boldness and that's what's happening on church leaders there that there are those that are standing up and say we will not give up we will not give it we will stand in the kingdom establish\nYour sharing with me too and I know we we told the stories I'm\nPast broadcast to in the campaign we had that the missile Loni some Muslims Islamic members are seeing the boldness and they're converting\nThere have been yeah there have been stories there's but I met people that were boldly witnessing to philosophy\nMuslims and imagine the youth if you're if you're growing up about ... the Muslim community and you see your four or five you see this type of these acts of violence taking place but then on the ... on the other side you see acts of love forgiveness\nUm people that are completely vulnerable that are only are responding with acts of kindness back to the philosophy what would you choose as a young person you the way of love of the way the hatred that's why this Dave in this campaign that we're we have right now is a way of showing\nThat Christian love is so much more powerful than the hatred of Islamists and this is not just happening I jury this is this is the ideological global warfare that we're participating in on one level or another\nThat we are standing up with their brothers and sisters and say love will defeat this form of evil\nPhone number is triple eight to five thirty thirty five to two we're inviting you to invest in this restored hope\nI'm Christian solidarity international in the plight of the persecuted Christian Nigerian families\nThe safe refuge and what that means there's a roof over their head after these fellow brothers sisters of ours have had their village their churches their their their\nHot burn down completely destroyed their land taken so that refuge means not only to have a roof over their head but dignity to be able to have a a a toilet to you\nThis I mean that guys this is what we're talking about ladies and gentleman that safe\nRefuge is that the food of course water yes medical treatment so much of a Joel if you're talking about the the children that were in the hospital and continue to be in the hospital recovering from their midst Shadi injuries are\nBeing shot so that medical treatment the counseling their crime why are they shot why are they machetes why or their ... their moms and dads are being decapitated by machines because they love Jesus and they are not giving up the Christ\nThis is our investment providing the store at home so what's your best guess now two hundred and twenty five dollar gift provides a full package of eight eight eight eight to five three three five to two triple

we talk to our our our brothers sisters they're on the ground I'm\nA partner Franco what what would show what what do the if if if our KTLA family could stand in the same room or look either one of our fellow brothers or sisters who have had the whole world up ended my loved ones killed what would\nThe Nigerian Christian family what have they said that you would say to our K Kelley family\nA day but when I was there I was so impressed by the attitude of these uh brothers sisters of ours they weren't coming they weren't bagging they weren't I'm dreaming of going to America and starting to live there they love their lives they love their families and the communities that the established they just want their they want their lives back again\nThey want the dignity reestablished and I think they would say thank you for praying for us thank you for standing with us thank you for giving so that we can and that that we can get back up on our feet during this difficult time third dignified

or the church in his mirror turkey call is near resurrection church he actually was applying for residency in Turkey before his arrest and he was arrested\nTwo years ago October seven twenty sixteen he has actually been charged eventually this year in April a with membership in an armed terrorist organization they issued an a diet and that that was sixty two pages\nBut it only had unknown and discredited so called secret witnesses he could've spent thirty five years in prison in April of this year for sixteen\nYears when there was a trial that began it was the first day of his trial it was actually attended by North Carolina Senator Tom tell us and the U.S ambassador at large for international religious freedom Sam Brownback\nAnd of course pastor Brunson is a U.S citizen he lived in uh North Carolina he went to a church in ...\nNorth Carolina and have been passed as I sat there for twenty three years in Turkey wanting to have permanent status and that's where he was applying for it and then out of the blue came this allegation that he was part of a\nMembership of an armed terrorist organization which is absolutely dog is\nHe has been in prison for two years and from April sixteen and tell last friday the hearing had been kicked down the road four times the last most are scheduled hearing believe it or not amazingly was last\nFriday October twelve so that was when the fourth\nA rescheduled hearing was and it was on that day October twelve that it was announced that he was going to be released instead of going to trial so he is now back in the United states and uh we rejoiced with them but I think you know certainly for for this pastor\nIt's great news that he's free no question he lost a lot of weight\nHe had been transferred from a very bad president to arrest because of his declining health he lost about fifty plus pounds or so in prison [noise]\nUm and we rejoiced with him being able to be released but you also have to understand why was he there for twenty three years why did he want to alternately have permanent status as a U.S citizen and turkey just because he loved the Turkish people and he was a pastor is a pastor\nAnd while he has been released and he's back home and movie Joyce with him understand that has ministry\nIs now no longer going to be able to take him back to turkey if he goes back to turkey he would be arrested again so his ministry that he has dedicated his life and his family for for twenty three years\nHas come to an end in Turkey we just pray that God will open up some additional new doors that maybe he doesn't even\nThe even really understand at this point in time because he and his family have been so faithful to share the gospel to people in Turkey\nFor reasonable people would say why would turn to go after this man after twenty three years other than because uh I'm going to assume some industry was effective Turkish people were being led to Christ why else would they go after him ... what other uh issue might there be for the government and\nThey would go after him and because you know obviously a there would be no doubt there may have been some he moms that ultimately wanted to come after him because of Islam and they didn't want people being converted from Islam to Christianity\nAnd so they concocted these false charges that he was a member of an armed a terrorist organization you imagine there's a pastor twenty three years he wants to be permanent there you can imagine that he's going to be a member of an armed terrorist organization to bring violence to turkey wants to bring the

conversation so let's do that quickly\nYou cannot be several with a political party that wants to destroy what can stand for what to ... that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house band or that\nThat ... he can start down\nBut until then the only thing that the Republicans seemed to\nRecognize and respect strength\nAnd you heard how the Republican members led by Mitch McConnell\nReally demeaned the confirmation process\nOkay how do you respond to that kind of thinking well I thought\n... son also Eric Holder's for months as the former attorney general but at some of the credit but irresponsible and his reading was because of the tragedy is that when words breakdown violence is never far away\nAnd that's the trouble of where we are my book is about the present crisis\nAnd I think a lot of people get wrong some people are just absolutely hung up on Trump never\nAll pro Trump and I think Trump is not the ... he's the consequences of the crisis is not the cause ... and people need to get down to analyzing what the causes because you've got to very different views of the American public\nAnd the American freedom and that's the deepest they were able to do things like ... and ... and those old national ... and so on and when you get down to that you see the one side is actually\nGoing back to the ideas of the American revolution which was largely although not totally difficult for the reformation and the other unwittingly in many cases going back to the mountains and the French Revolution and thoroughly empty vocal\nAnd when you look at things like those mountain as multiculturalism political correctness the sexual revolution the needing ... for the sake and much of the tactics of the Democrats in the cabinet earrings pay a ... he was Seventeen and you know and it says like each other\nAnd almost nothing to the local level and I know the American way after I get both sides have a lot of problem but I don't think people are analyzing problems keep and how ...\nHow does this latest work of yours compared to some of your your early books like renaissance so the power of the gospel or however dark the times me because that certainly where we are as well and and also a like a free people suicide\nAround the songs and impossible people were written for Christians this one like a free peoples says I've written for American citizens in\nFree people set aside I was raised in the problem of sustainable freedom as you keep freedom Tony but in the debate of followed that I realized Americans don't ask what reading them actually is and you've got two very different views of freedom and justice can make you sick is\nAmerica ... ... free house divided will not stand your views of freedom\nThat go back somewhat inconsistent ton to the American revolution and so I sent them on the Bible\nCamp views of freedom that go back the other way and the other but it's absolutely disastrous so the book is a checklist ten questions citizens new to us about whether they want America to go out of the freedom\nTo positive that we're seeing the greatest crisis since the civil war in our country what led us to this crisis\nWill you remember Lincoln addressed the evils and Eighteen fifty six states\nIn the light of what he called the better angels of American nature and the American republic no one does that now Martin Luther king was the last say to address racism but believing in the decoration which you call the promissory notes none of what they want some cash in\nA sort of slaves and so on but with a shift from him to step become like an old ... so come since you see somewhere around Nineteen sixty eight of the political left\nAnd then America became chronically racist touch your mom make sexist and other ... and all sorts of other things that you can see that now\nIn the attacks on white privilege and selling them all those ideas following Nineteen sixty eight in that title lunch left come essentially from the as the French Revolution they will be a disaster for the country so America's ... will she was still on the phone and you could say she\nTend to address the problems as Lincoln tried to do his time although she replaced it and go another way which will mean the client enters obstacle for America issues being\nAs you looked at the to a different visions of what liberty is all about where does this take us in terms of world view when they're played out we come to two very different world views that we not\nAbsolutely I mean you take them basic division of freedom is freedom a matter of the commission to do what you like all the power to do what you wrote\nA book called the Christian Jewish view freedom cries truth character\nAnd way of life as a load says you know the truth and the truth will set you free put it in the post ... low there is no truth\nConservative only listen to conservative outlets and honestly we start seeing people as enemies and\nAnd we hear rhetoric from politicians saying if so and so gets elected that will be the end of the Republican they'll say things like this is the most important election the history of America they say that every single election and it's never true these elections are important but they're not they're not going to you know get Corinne us into a ditch weren't going to be fine we survive much worse than this\nHow do you see the current a line of the protests are demonstrating a no pun intended up these kinds of divisions and and and how do we repair that or is that just good freedom of speech well\nYou know Americans actually don't protest that much at all compared to our European neighbors what we do see protests you know the women's march after Trump got\nGot inaugurated and there was a a few select marches last weekend where there's violence attached to it but by and large if you go to a major European city especially in places like Germany or France workers' strike basically every single day is just part of their culture there we don't protests as much we go on social media and yell which seems to have even less impact\nOkay so there's some disagreement over whether or not the term mob should be used like if you get together a group of people and for somebody who was elected to public office to leave a restaurant is that a good definition of the term mob or is that being abused\nI think we use that term when we talk about the other side I mean if you ... Fox sees a bunch of liberal they call them a mob MSNBC things a lot of conservatives called them up\nI think the bigger issue here civility right I mean what's the point of a protest to be peace of all we know that I mean you can't\nAdvocate violence you can't be committing violent acts you can't be trying to encourage other people to commit violent acts and\nThe thing that I worry about what the thing that you just talk to them or is this whole thing of of politicians being shouted down and restaurants you know Ted Cruz had to leave a restaurant because he he was made to be uncomfortable Sarah Huckabee Sanders the same thing happened to her Virginia just a few months ago I think that's a mob mentality it's when we see the other side as the enemy\nIs when we get in trouble that moment I always think about especially with John McCain's passing at that moment in two thousand and seven on the campaign trail when a woman gets a microphone at an open Mike and she said I'm worried that Obama's Muslim and he's bad for America you remember this moment yeah\nMcCain I mean he was caught off guard you could tell but he said the thing that I think about a lot he goes ma'am no he's not a Muslim he's a good man he's a Christian man we did have some differences on on public policy I mean that's essentially what is what is the answer was we've lost that kind of civility\nAnd now we're hearing politician saying I'm gonna stop on my opponents face or our current president when he was running for president I become president I'm going to make sure I locked my opponent up\nI mean that's not the kind of language that America should be trying to advocate for on either side of the aisle because it breaks down civility and it makes it harder to partner with the other side to come to a compromise\nComing up and he put things into Google Search England and kill your own spouse or your\nGoogle hills all this out that shift the Christian returns minimum\n[noise] secretary of state

users Brian engine Sebastian Gorka live at the Reagan Library Monday to twenty nine logo\nFor tickets for the cello some rock you by Gregory works of Orange County\nAnd epoch times news\nLeno joined us for a special edition of politics and issues this Sunday Morning soccer young Kim running for Congress and the district representative Mimi Walters wanting to re election to forty Smith we'll hear from the no on proposition and yes on prop eleven camps\nMorning at seven right here on AM eight Seventy answer\nBack to the Christian ... the amount of information we loaded into Facebook and Google is staggering\nIt's done from the privacy of our home on the computer regard would password those two entities take our information out of our computer and out of our homes and spread the word\nAccording to the streams ritual Alexander\n... she wrote an article titled we creepy law how Google and Facebook manipulate society the details there actually Alexander sat in with georgine rice on do you do in Portland, Oregon [noise] well I have\nTo tell you the uh the creek wind is certainly the right thing to call it I I have to admit that after researching for this documentary I'm more creep out by it than ever before I explained to our listeners what the creepy line a is about and what we need to be creamed out about\nWell it name from local CEO Eric Schmidt said that when it comes to things like privacy and you know the into you users information\nGoogle goes way up to the creepy lie but does not cross it and this documentary basically tell you that's not true Google does closet and shows you how cool tracks you everywhere you go on the Internet it fills your information to advertisers then comments to target ads to you and\nGoogle does things like a biased search results so if you're searching for political candidate you're going to get you know and then this is a Hillary Clinton supporter says it in the documentary it you're gonna get more favorable results toward Hillary than you are Trump and that does influence help people do\nNow the film as you point out is not part is and in fact the foundational research in the film was conducted by Dr Robert F sign who is a behavioral psychologist he was a Hillary Clinton for president supporter so this really goes beyond partisan politics it explains that both Google and Facebook started out with a great\nIdeals but it has morphed into something we need to be concerned about\nYeah and you know they said that they started out we just want to connect people to information and you know they really did seem to do that but what they discovered was you know when you're doing things like search result you have to pick\nWhat is relevant what is more relevant than something else and that is not objective subjective that school saying you know we're going to make this relevant and you know one of the\nExample that I went and did a screen shot in my article was where if you type in\nTop leases Republicans because you're trying to find out what the top public and races are\nGo get a correction and said did you mean talk to Republicans\n[noise] now this is a part of the show we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and normally we do that but this week we're going to talk about a very deserving and very washed and clean or Arab yours and that would be your spouse [laughter]\nThere you go and so this week I Want to talk with you about a special kind of trust it's called a Q tip trust like the thing is sticking your ear\nAnd out you tip Stanford qualified terminal interest property but we call it a Q tip for short and it's basically a trusted is designed to benefit your spouse so if you're married yet a spouse or we'll have a spouse soon then you want to listen up okay but before we do that ... can you play it\nI Know I\n\nWould always say you\nKnow my log in may be um\n\n[noise]\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and we use that because the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite design to take from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to you so every week at this time we have our state tip of the week\nNow this week we're going to talk about trust for your spouse now the theme of our show this week um has been our vision one hundred as a firm for money matters\nAnd as I mentioned a little bit ago ... we ... we not work with a thousand families and the responsibility that comes with that is one that we did not take lightly it's not just taking care of them that is important in guiding them and helping them to have the national security but it's also their families\nAnd one of the things that you know I've often said as you don't want your financial advisory prompted die before you do so we created in our from what we called vision one hundred million one hundred means that a hundred years from now we want money matters to be as strong or stronger than it is today\nNot only fascinating Mr Spock but also very logical and so that's kind of ties in with this segment of the show which is on his state planning and passing on to the next generation and we have a a core value that we live by which is a core value number eight which is that everyone deserves love\nAnd what I mean by that is that no matter who you come into contact with including that person to cut you off on the freeway and then flipped you off as they were going by they deserved love you give love always okay\nIf not you don't get love because you think you're going to get it back you give love because it's the right thing to do you give love unconditionally with no expectations coming back at you\nIf you do that I think you live a very happy life\nBecause then your happiness is not dependent on other people coming back to you and saying I Love you back or doing stuff for you or whatever it doesn't matter you don't need that if you're if you're the giver of love\nThen somehow and you know in in different religions are different names for it but it comes back to you the more love you put out into the universe the more love will come back to you\nAnd you don't have to force it you don't have to expect it it will come to our core value number eight is everyone deserves love everyone that comes into contact with us as a burn as a person in our family everywhere we want to make sure that we give them all the love that we have to get and if we do that they'll be better for it and in in in some magical way so we'll wait\nAnd so stay planning which is the topic of this segment is that so let's talk about someone that I Hope you love a lot which is your spouse okay so the Q tip trust that is a kind of trust that upon your death\nYou leave the money for your spouse in a trust\nNow people tend to freak out about the word ... they don't like that word but you know what trust are are are not black boxes that you put money in cannot come out no in fact it's the opposite ... therefore your spouse to be able to have\nAccess to the night for whatever they need it for pretty much I mean there are some limitations but not many and but what it does do is to protect them\nFrom if they get divorced they remarried and get divorced which maybe you don't care much about at this point but could happen or if they get into a lawsuit or if they have a a you know if they if they go bankrupt than all the money that's in the Q tip into trust for them is is protected from all of that\nAnd then you may have a spouse that isn't so good with managing money and you want to have a trustee that helps them with that so that again is the value of a Q tip trust okay so think about your spouse protecting the money that you want to have them have for the rest of their lives in the event that you died first and if you want to put it in trust a Q tip will do that for you okay something for you to think about\nSo this show we've talked a lot about all of our core values I Hope that uh you got some ah some of it if you didn't hear the entire show\nOur website is money matters dot net money matters dot net and you can podcast didn't listen to the whole thing and uh you know I I feel sort of like maybe I surmise today somewhat but I Believe in these things and I think if you live your life that way you have
