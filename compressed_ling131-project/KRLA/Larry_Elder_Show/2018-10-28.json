{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "Lawyers are easy targets politicians love to target lawyers trial lawyers particularly but lawyers\nWhy with ... with the law and with lawyers being such an important part of our whole judicial system are American way of life why are they not thought of more highly\nWell I I think uh [noise] from my perspective I think your rights as an empirical matter that lawyers are not thought of\nA terribly highly usually when they do\nA you know sort of public surveys is to uh uh trustworthiness or who would you trust to a professional as like a pilots and pharmacists surprisingly\nA and a very high on the list\nA and lawyers are tend to a and a half\nA much lower on the list that you know down with the actors and and I think maybe that's one problem for lawyers that day or you know in on television and\nMovies that these are actors portraying lawyers well there you have to have a leaf highly thought of a professions a mixed together maybe that's something to do with it\nYou're listening to champions of justice with dumped journey and amend McClintock our guest today is professor Paul Bergman he is a professor of law at UCLA also the co author of real justice the courtroom goes to the movies\nTom trial lawyers to a very important job\nYou know if you are a company and you're putting out a product and you're not\nTesting it properly you're not warning properly and so forth [noise]\nIs very hard for a good company to compete with you you're cutting these corners\nAnd the only thing that's going to keep the balance is the trial lawyer says hey listen you put out this drug and caused all these problems of Andy cause heart attack and stroke you knew about it you have a memo that says this will never see the light of day\nAnd unless the trial lawyers bring that to the surface [noise] um this other companies is doing the right thing has no ability to compete [noise]\nAnd I think that you know the justice system although it you know it has a few flaws here and there but by and large I think it's a pretty good idea and I think the jury system I think jurors get it right I think jurors understand if a company out there is\nCutting corners and not doing the right thing that they want to make things right so I I have a great respect in regard for how it works\nYou know a few years ago I was doing some law teaching in France at a French a legal University in English luckily\nAnd uh we're actually talking about this said now in in France say the civil country civilized countries generally\nUh the uh portrayal of the lawyer that you were just talking about time someone who's\nA service that social purpose by holding companies and the government accountable uh for a mistakes for not doing things the right way that's not really the role of the lawyer and France and uh in the course of by a teaching their I happened to go to Barcelona for the weekend\nPulled up at a hotel and was guided\nOr to park around the side of the hotel on little deserted street even though the front entrance of the history of the hotel was on a busy main road\nA park there uh and was held up\nBecause of the street people know where uh people are gonna go park on this little quiet street while they go to register that's where they hang out and they hold up the people who stopped there\nUh well when I came back and resume that teaching in a in front of the French law students I said well who might be held accountable for this horrible thing that happened to me and it took them a long time to me to uh [noise]\nThey they were aghast really at the notion I think an American lawyer would see the hotel as partly responsible for that because\nThey themselves were guiding people to go around to this quiet street where they provided no security and on the other hand in the front of the hotel in this busy road there's a dorm and there's the kind of security you would expect to find\nAnd I think they appreciated the sense of a lawyer as kind of the protector of the little guy or in the American system in a way they never would have appreciated without that story\nYou know what um\nIt's a great job being a lawyer\nThat's all there is to it I'm a little surprised that you with this artistic ability with you know looking at all these films and the effect of the films and lawyers are portrayed and the law and so forth [noise] I don't know why you're not a joining or for him and try and these cases I mean\nWell I'd be why the euro older lawyers that but I appreciate the offer down thank you\nSo am I have a question for you because we've been talking about the movies we been talking about how lawyers are are portrayed in the movies and of course in all almost all legal uh movies we wait for that one big climactic moment\nIn the courtroom what was your most exciting moment in a courtroom [noise]\nWell Dave dino the jury is told when you have a verdict buzz three times in state court [noise] and\nYou're standing around maybe for a day or two and then pretty soon those three buses to take place and they do you know I don't care if the cases over twenty five grand or twenty five billion okay this is exciting stuff you're about to get your report card baby and incomes that jury\nAnd the judge says the court attended may pick up the verdict so every court attended knows how to take a quick look at it [noise] it can be handed to the clerk\nClerk then looks at it the thing is about three sentences okay now the clerk looks at it like she's reading war and peace and then she hands it to the judge the judge now\nNot knowing he was going to need his glasses finds his glasses are sitting there deep and your heart man I don't care [noise] your heart is who is moving he finally finds his classes she looks at it then he hands it to the clerk to do may read the bird [laughter] Cirque title of court or call\nUs angel superior case number such as we've been there for three weeks we owe the case then but we do the case there we find in favor of holy Toledo Dave dino well very exciting stuff\nWell I Want to end a today because we've talked about lawyers and we talked about them in a lot of different ways [noise]\nFun to talk about what a lawyer is from one more movie and it's a very moving scene from the movie Philadelphia\nBefore we listen

big dialysis units or any data so she wanted because currently there are paying five or ten times more than to Medicare rate\nIf you say no to that proposition that means you are agreeing that there has to be the same amount of pain and continued by the private insurance companies to the dialysis units either way there is nothing said about the fact that this business is\nGrowing exponentially unnecessarily and people who are not supposed to be on dialysis are put on dialysis prematurely and unnecessarily so this is my take on this proposition eight sometimes between bad in war so you have

day I Will be here homeless precious radio\nMicrophones and just say that I'm married to I Love you and you can be better because I experience how when you have that dream of becoming better can become a reality of your life but within the context of that dream and that desire that you have\nYou have to always include the goodness of other people as well you have to want it to be something good for the rest of us as well I never could become\nThis America's healing dancing dumped her or less a incorporated this method of stopping dialysis helping people who didn't know there was another way [noise] um\n[noise] that is not going to lead them to dialysis nobody knew when I came up with this thing that\nYou know you don't need to go on dialysis you don't need to to really let that blood pressure to be so much out of control and your negative thoughts driving you towards dialysis teach you that in that direction nobody knew about it so that\nWe really was such a burning fire\nAnd me and I let that dream to expand and become a reality to the point that I changed the name of my dialysis facility to angel kidney care dialysis prevention unit you know why because out of\nAlmost I Would say about half of people half of patients who come to that the al ... and they are\nAbout to be subjected to become a chronic dialysis patient and be sentenced to dialysis dependency for the rest of their lives I have taken almost half of them this is not really an overstatement almost half of them\nAlso dialysis [noise] you know why because I Try to exclude acute causes of kidney failure because there are causes that let our kidneys down\nAnd a very acute basis how for instance if someone is the hydrated if someone had an infection whatever that's a urinary tract infection or a common cold or some kind of pneumonia or if they got some kind of medication\nMaybe even the over the counter medications that they have access to right and left [laughter]\nIf someone had some kind of toxic exposure\nThat you just allow that kidney to heal and recovered maybe they don't need to be on dialysis so this is how I have kept that vision alive because you just exclude the causes of accused kidney injury and on\nYou make sure that you allow that kidney to retire [laughter] how do you do that by watching their blood pressure by watching their blood sugar and all these people and making sure that they are thinking positively so this is how\nI don't let people\nBe sentenced to a life sentence of dialysis dependency [laughter] this is what we do that and this all started with a dream at heart which was a\nFull of love and that is how I ended up from Iran to here and now I I Want to tell you there is a proposed a measure that I Would like to put on the ballot and I want to see how America feels about it you know I Know we're talking about proposition eight\nBut I Want to ask your opinion America what do you think about something that would\nNot let people go on dialysis when they don't really need it\nAnd I would let them a me further away from it but when they do the right things and the right things are shown to them\nUh making sure they eat healthy and if their kidneys are not functioning right maybe they are educated on\nFoods that contain a lot of potassium for instance\nA bananas oranges potatoes tomatoes they have a lot of potassium and if you don't tell these patients that this is really about time for you to cut down on consumption of these foods then they're going to eat it\nOut before they know their ... off they go to the emergency room and here we are doctors ready to put them on dialysis and send them to the chronic dialysis units so here is a vision I have and this is a a ... I'm calling that I feel\nI have to manifest and I think that ah I'm Eric how are you ready for something like this it's about time to you know how much is our health care death do you know how much how many trillions of dollars we all\nBecause we don't prevent because we use medical world and all the things that we have available to us in a wrong wage\nWe need to bring holding us back to our south as human beings and also to our health care models because before we can reach prosperity\nWe have to make sure that is not going to happen unless people are homes and that whole ... starts with just the music the music on yourself I didn't mind such that makes you believe in you and the creator of this universe\nAnd the rest of it is up to you how much you want to move those love handles those hits to the right into the last and you can see all the movements for yourself on the third off November\nAt one o'clock at my dialysis prevention unit angel kidney care dialysis prevention unit know hated in Englewood how we can create we can generate and not feel good hormones form of indoor things do come in federal Tony\nThese are the chemical substance says these are the physical sub senses that our body can generate and God enabled us to do it we can do that with movement and\nIt kind of music that reminds of\nReminds us of everything good and within that concept of content mindset and to try to get a mindset which for us is to stop dialysis to stop diabetes low self esteem\nAnd kidney disease a lot of emotional energy positive emotional energy is going to be generated in the form of and our happiness and when you get to face too which is you for each for each\nUnconditional love you can dream abundant tea and see yourself\nAs to me I Am not that he's actually in this clip chairs and if you see yourself the way you want to see ourselves\nBe sure that your life is also moving in that direction if you don't believe in yourself and you just see yourself as a person who's gonna end up on dialysis trust me sooner or later\nYou would be experiencing that harsh not set if you see yourself turning around and being committed to what you're supposed to do as a patient and trust your health care provider\nThings are going to be in that way\nAs well [noise]\n\nSo [laughter] time today I had the very last few minutes we have to the end of our show tonight yes William thank you so much I just want to make ... an ounce and one more time\nNext Saturday please and Erika ... is very important\nAnd I'm not just saying I think she's very very important [noise] it doesn't matter if you have any kidney disease or you have diabetes if you are a human being who live in this war that experiences all their tragedy is negative things that we all experience on a daily basis\nYou need to be there because I Am going to end makes you aware of your true self\nAnd that comes when you feel hopeless and that whole\nNotion that includes you ain't got together after you have incorporated all of your mind body and sold and made the best of them then\nHis dance that anything else [laughter]\nBut that tension and the nerves of the nation were heightened this week as news broke that suspicious packages apparently pipe bombs or ride that address is associated with key figures on the political left\nHillary Clinton Joe Biden George Soros Eric Holder and they'll just went on with additional names being at it as the week went on\nAs with other key incidents of domestic terror the desire to reach conclusions came prior to our understanding of the facts my colleague in New York Kevin become a turn to former NYPD police commissioner Bernie Carrick he oversaw the police response to nine eleven they spoke on AM five Seventy the mission\nYour reaction to a where these pipe bombs may be coming from and what is this the psychology behind the guy that she's doing it and how are we on the on the trail of finding them\n[noise] um so let me say this you know we're we're only speculate here you know nobody knows for sure now based on what the FBI and like PV has seen\nDay believe that the guy could you could have been shamed by the same person or persons ... or is that\nYour child and she used some of them doing screening ah usually U.S Postal service ... which tells me that just says she was working\nKeep in mind nothing has detonated so far right which means ... it will be much much easier to do it as a chance you know as far as who's son get a you know I I was really the every day for one person to achieve a look ... was speculated nobody knows for sure\nYou know the people on the left to say to people on the light the people on the right\nTo an end to people on the left up to see one day the entire country should light we should be legally binding the percentage is possible period\nAnd let me just ask because I've got to think that with the if they're able to retrieve all the devices in kind of take them apart bit by bit um there's gotta be some Easter eggs in there there's gotta be some fingerprints there's gotta be some DNA the follicle of hair so\nI could damage that had the basic idea ... from ... um they have all the elementary tack that they can look at um ... baggage for them to pull out a ...\nAnd I can't ... you know ... I Would I backed\nSit there in handcuffs rates the greatest missions one day\nBut I urge everyone unite behind law enforcement now he and his country his sort of ... of the ... edition television issues terrorism at the heart of television and people have to realize that\nThis latest bomb Fred comes in the run up to a midterm election that his way here than the average mid term the key word for Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer\nImpeachment of president has been such strict blind Michael good one of the New York post the lake including the rally with Ted Cruz once again with Kevin McCarthy\nTwenty six team was a long time ago in politics I remember being at the convention when crews on endorsed Trump and his speech and he was essentially booed off the stage and I thought boy somebody just blow up this political career\nBut here we are two years later and they're ... and a fall as well and and you know when you need each other you're able to overlook a lot of sin but now and that's politics as usual\nYeah pretty much a listen the president and he's working this campaign cycle from my immature eyes Michael as hard as he would be if he was running for office himself\nFirst of all is that a fair assessment secondly music going to make a difference are we going to see some momentum growing in the Republican grassroots a congressional races that he's hoping he will be able to turn up the heat on\nWealthier your first point about him running as hard as if he were on the ballot um I think he's actually running as as as as life depends on it and and it does in a certain sense because if the Democrats\nTake the house or take both Congress says he's going to have his hands full now to have to adapt if they have the house we know what a Adam Schiff and Jerry ... Adler and Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi have in store so it's going to be a very difficult to ride\nIt they take the Senate as well then it would be extremely difficult for the president so I think that he clearly recognizes that danger he's been out there three four days a week or putting enormous energy and time\nAnd yet I think that the\nSignificance or or the the question of whether he helping some in some states more than others in some districts more than others but he has a unique ability\nBeyond what any president does I think to focus\nThe mind on issues right and just as he did with that Brett Kavanaugh confirmation process and the political character assassination to Democrats carried out on Kavanaugh and now with the caravan of migrants caravan Trump is doing something similar\nI he has a unique ability to spotlight an issue with language and emotion\nThat really get to the juices flowing and I believe in both cases accurately show I think he said some things about the caravan that\nMay not stand up in terms of how many middle Easterners and that sort of thing nonetheless if they are able to reach the border in significant numbers that that says we don't have a border\nAnd I think that is a significant political issue in the mid term since I have Kavanaugh and ... and I think these two issues the president has highlighted are very significant issue is which is why you're seeing less go crazy attacking him over his comment\nAs weird as this is it's like this kitten to care man has brought back Trump's number one political issue from twenty sixteen and put it on the front page for him to run on again and twenty\nI mean when you eat that day one when he announced his campaign in twenty Fifteen I mean that's the day when he talked about\nThe Mexican not sending their best some of them are rapists that was the one yeah and that proved to be a very important issue for him and you know Kevin me the immigration issue that cuts across a lot of things I mean certainly impacts American Jobs\nThe economic uh situation the sanctuary cities that are also impacts public safety national security and so it it is an issue that's potent and a lot of different ways\nThan this caravan I think is actually helping the president now now I I caution you must have we don't know how this story and right at the or to send the military if there were to be violence if the military or to accidentally or even intentionally\nKill people maybe children that would be a pretty horrible situation all around that I think would work against the president but for now the ... the threat of the caravan the pictures the\nThe the imagery of the oven crashing through the borders into Mexico and saying nobody's gonna stop us we're going to the United states that rightfully alarm\nIs I think a lot of Americans that we really have lost control of our borders\nThis caravan working its way up to our southern border has absolutely highlighted a campaign theme from the twenty sixteen lecture bought it has also raised a whole host of question mark strand from am eleven sixty hope for your life in Chicago turn to Glenn door of cedar bill university\nBut talk about President Trump in this\nYeah let's just say this is a little difficult problem you've got what this caravan moving this direction so what does he decided to do well on Monday he declared that the United states would begin cutting aid to three Central American countries that he says has failed to stop these migrants from ... to the U.S border\nIs that a good policy or are we a partly to blame for the problem what where do we do\nSo it's a it's a very complex is for the\nCaravan the candidates really are you in your eye\nOn that and it's been formulated in Central America to to send my current I'm going to be home to the United states as a means of a better safety security getting rid of human trafficking the rest of the the likelihood of that as stop it in some type of similar\nIn Europe which is the main city in the middle of the country\nA very very high murder rate all kinds of gang problems for example high unemployment and so ... ... or other she doesn't like funding to trying to United States\nFor that their lives are at to that similar problems and Guatemala El Salvador\nNicaragua as a socialist president uh or take care of it has come down on protests recently\nAnd so from for those four countries in particular people are moving across on tourists to Guatemala now from Mexico and the U.S house and miles from the border with Texas President Trump is respond within sets a you know you think about the two thousand and six being campaign\nNevertheless given the political context L G be and tea have been put together a long as we've noted with a succession of other letters to follow precisely because identifying as sexual minorities they are they able to leverage their power together\nBut this is where we also need to understand the tea transgender represents a particular challenge to anyone who has to run anything\nIt's a particular challenge to legislators it's a challenge to school administrators it's a challenge to anyone who has to do something as simple as label a bathroom male or female for men or women when you're looking at this kind of confusion it filters down to every dimension of society\nThat is why it was big news on Sunday when the New York times broke the story about proposed guidelines dealing with the definition of these issues\nThat would come from within the Trump Administration Monday's edition of the New York times included a front page article by Eric el green Katie dinner and Robert pair the headline was taught may limit how government defines one sex\nThen into some heads gender lifted it burned so I've had to threat to the protections of those who identify as transgender the reporters begin the story with these words quote the Trump Administration is considering narrowly defining gender or the biological immutable condition determined by Jenna Haley at birth\nThe most drastic mood said the reporters yet in a government wide effort to roll back recognition and protection of transgender people under federal civil rights law in quote now that's elite paragraph from the New York times but let's work backwards just a little bit\nFor one thing we are told that the proposed guidelines again obtained by the New York times indicate according to the reporters\nThe most drastic move yet and what's described as a government wide effort to roll back recognition and protections of transgender people under federal civil rights law now wait just a minute when federal civil rights legislation had anything to do with transgender people the answer would be nothing\nBut what is implied in this is the fact that the gangs for the transgender community by administrative action under the Obama administration\nThey are threatened to be rolled back by the definition of these issues under the draft guidelines obtained by the New York times so what's really going on here well the beginning of the paragraph tells us what's going on\nThe Trump Administration we're told is considering narrowly defining gender as a biological immutable condition determined by ... at birth\nNow before going any further in the article let's just state what we should all understand\nThat is exactly that is fundamentally that is virtually universally throughout time and throughout space how human beings have defined what it means to be male and female and to be to use the modern language a gender and human being from the beginning of the human experience\nThis is why as we've often pointed out when a baby is born simply looking at the baby there is the almost immediate celebration and it did a vacation it's a boy or it's a girl\nThe trumpet minister ration according to the New York times is considering a definition that will be totally consistent with that\nMost basic human affirmation but you'll notice that that lead paragraph has written as if the administration has been caught trying to do something that is innovative but of course the Trump Administration if these guidelines are exactly as the New York times reports\nNot doing anything innovative at all it is simply declaring what a rational person throughout virtually any age of human experience until very very recently in human history would have taken for\nGranted [noise] how many opt VA job I've re what I'm trying to call for awhile blessed yell at a lot more or less Christian returns in a moment\nPresident Trump\nDamn the Pittsburgh synagogue attack has an evil anti Semitic attacks and he says the reports he's getting about they're shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue are bad\nResults are coming in and they're far more devastating that anybody originally thought in the morning in the morning they\nWas the shooter but they had the shooter or they would but\nThe results are very devastating you're seeing the numbers\nForty six year old suspected Robert Bowers of Pittsburgh was taken into custody for killing eleven people including six others at the synagogue earlier today\nPresident Trump has ordered slang that federal

[noise] that\nCould jak I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talk about on the show these are the very same ideas that we talk about with our beloved\nAnd most valued clients and we're not work with over eight thousand four hundred families in forty three states vary\nOn beyond you and you know what buses right we want to help more people\nDo their retirement planning than anyone else that is our goal\nAnd uh so um because of that and we primarily work with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired or who are retiring soon and if that is you then we would love to meet you and work with you\nAnd a ... a recently named the more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors now for the seven year in a row\nAnd without our clients I Would be no aware and so I put that one on that might give it to my client well this is a part of the show where we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor now this week we're actually going to talk about paying for college\nAnd the gift tax laws so if you were not aware a gift taxes come do if you give anybody more than Fifteen thousand dollars in one year\nOkay and so that's the gift tax and college in many cases more than fifty thousand dollars a year I Know I have one in college right now and so you could end up having to do a gift tax if you don't do it properly so we're going to talk about that now but first jak and you know I\n\nWould always say you you\nKnow my dog and may be\n\n\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes in probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite it's designed to take you from riches to rags\nAnd we do not want that to happen to use every week at this time we have our state tip of the week so this week we're going to talk about a college education up paying for that okay so as I mentioned the gift tax exemption a\nIs a Fifteen thousand dollars this year so let me give you some history on that one okay so that when when the IRS [noise]\n[laughter] ah almost cut you off guard on that one when the IRS came up with the notion of estate taxes this is a tax upon your death and it goes to whoever\nUm and they wanted attacks so they created the estate tax but the IRS is a lot of things but it's not stupid and they figured out that if you have a tax that happens upon death than what people are going to do is if they know they're going to die they're going to get it all away first and then when they died as no tax so we can't have\nThat that would be downright on American not to have some taxes paid so they came up with the gift tax which means that if you try to give it all the way we're going to tax it anyway so you can't get away with that but they also realize that if you tax every single gift you know if I take you out if I pay for dinner with with friends or something that the gift\nAnd so do I have to file a tax return for that so we get kind of onerous and they'd probably be thrown out of office for it so they made a gift tax exemption and to give tax exemption is Fifteen thousand dollars per person that you can get to\nAnd as a married couple you can get thirty thousand dollars to as many people as us so the gift tax exempt amount that Fifteen thousand as you can get that as many people as you wish um and and that's how that works so college is part of that\nSo one of the things that you want to do so there are additional exemptions too that get tax\nAnd by the way if you exceed that fifty thousand a gift tax is the same as your state tax and it can get all the way up to almost fifty percent okay so you give a big gift and you may oh half of that in taxes think about that one [noise] so\nHow do you not to pay gift taxes on college uh on on a college education costs the answer is you don't give the money to the child or to the student\nAnd then have them pay it you pay the institution directly so if you buy all the books you pay for the the tuition and all that kind of stuff if you do all of that directly\nAnd you don't have it goes through the child then that is an exemption to the gift tax so therefore it doesn't count so my advice to you is don't give the child the money now I'll give you that I'll give you that advice because when I was in college\nI'm In my fraternity there was this guy called Scott\nAnd his parents were giving him the money to sensibly pay for the tuition guess what Scott was doing he wasn't paying the tuition [laughter]\nHe was keeping the money and he used to come down every day in like he had this Chinese ...\nYou know what this does sat in ... and he'd come down and that and he looked like and slept all night he'd wake up and time to watch the gong show remember the bury the was that guy's name Barry ... who did the gong show\nHe would wake up in time to watch the show on television and then you know he'd have lunch and he lays around all day spending his tuition money\nSo if you needed another reason not to your child the tuition money if that [laughter]\nAnyway [noise]\nAs I mentioned we are from that uh we uh we ... we specialize in retirement planning that's what we do so we we work primarily with people who are over fifty who are retired or retiring soon and so that is you then we want to work with you and so if you go to our website it as money matters dot net money matters dot net is our
