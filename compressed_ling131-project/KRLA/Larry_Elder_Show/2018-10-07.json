Solomon or your host and me\n[noise] you know just as a plane of ... pro bono hours that many layers on are giving to this day care I can say first hand on\nHaving some of our young lawyers participate and homeless veterans project and these were young lawyers at that kept that out of law school about really wanted to be an advocate and ... gap where you're amazing staff\nAnd were trained how to help homeless veterans they focused on winning\nAnd it was so delightful a he's young lawyers come back I had my first client I had my first advocates teach and we wind and it really just went fetch a win win situation for everyone and you see that time and time again\nYou know if there is the prejudice against homeless hey you're homeless because us around you took whatever [noise]\nYou can't be prejudiced against homeless that the reason that they're they're a man they were up protecting us they were getting hurt they were getting those mental issues because of us and then they come back and now they're unable to get work and so forth [noise] these people didn't choose this route\nAnd boy if there's ever been in an area that\nWe have to help or those people that did everything for us and now they're in a terrible way\nI think that's the right time and it just to add to that there is a on the way people can help if you're a landlord\nRight now because of the influx of resources to help folks who are homeless and veterans who are homeless in particular there quite a number of families and a veterans who have vouchers\nThat will pay for rent for having trouble finding apartment because of our low vacancy rates and so if your landlord is renting an apartment and you were willing to accept one of these vouchers and rent to a veteran or to a low income family who's either in danger of homelessness was become homeless\nA that's a way that you could be helpful as well\nAmerica's homeless are growing older also would grading so to speak of America's homeless that means they're even more vulnerable are they not\nThat is correct David it's the the baby boomer generation\nComing to age where we're seeing folks are more and more on the streets from that generation and it's a looming problem I'm not just because it's heartbreaking and homelessness always is but because of that group is also moving into a time in their lives when they need more health care\nAnd more health assistance and living on the streets is incredibly damaging to your health so\nWe are facing not just a a human\nProblem but also a a health and human health crisis and very costly health and if people are getting older no question about it and they happened to me every year to [laughter] I'm\nIn uh in jury instructions if a person had a permanent injury at the end of the case the judge would say in the first was fifty years old uh about how long it's going to take with this perimeter injury or a male age fifty will live to be\nAnd we looked at the steps in Nineteen sixty six [noise]\nAnd the fifty year old male was due to live to sixty seven [noise]\nAnd now if you look at the new ... the fifty year old male is due to live to eighty six\nI mean a huge change over you know two or three decades [noise]\nSo you have certainly a grain of America is present and then for these people could be one thing if you have some robust guy who's homeless while he can get back into the workforce for these other guys you know Seventy years old Seventy five years old it's much harder for them\nAbsolutely and they're going to need assistance and they're doing it probably need it for the rest of the last\n[noise] okay here's the story both of you are coming back next year Amy is going to be here I'm going to be here David you know it's going to be here [noise] okay let's just start with you Adam I'm what have you done the past year hopefully\nWe have a much less homelessness and the county of Los Angeles due to the new investments and perhaps more importantly we have a ...\nA source of revenue and funding so that we can be implementing the planet's going to take time\nTo dramatically decrease our homelessness in Los Angeles and I would love to see\nThat because we'd been successful at that we've been able to shift more of our efforts to preventing people from becoming homeless right now a lot of our efforts are focused on people who are homeless how do we get them back in their housing how do we get them back on their feet and I would like to see us get past that problems that we could focus on stopping families from becoming homeless and the first place\n[noise] Greg [noise] an addition to that it I'm hopeful that communities throughout Los Angeles there will be permanent supportive housing projects in development and people in the neighborhoods would understand and support that\nHomelessness is a regional problem and it's been require all of us each in our communities helping to provide the shelter in the housing and welcoming it instead of resisting I\nYou know Greg it helps if you're let's suppose you or you have a restaurant and then you have a bunch of homeless people out in front\nThat's gonna that's gonna negate your businessman his rent on the other hand if there's some place where they can be reasonably put up and do well themselves and you don't have that problem and I understood from the some of the ways you're getting money\nFrom dean of new projects that are being built that they'll have to be some sort of a attacks on those to help the homeless and quite honestly that'd be a good thing for the guy to do to make sure that the homeless or some place other than camping out in front of his restaurant\nThe threat these solutions aren't simply for the homeless person themselves we are all going to benefit we're going to live in a more functional city it'll help business and helps property values were\nAll going to win and that has been a very interesting how much more than interesting

called you forage on conditional love you\nHeard me right it's you forge because this is the ultimate happiness happiness with the highest energy level you can imagine\nThat kind of happiness that makes you feel excellent about yourself\nVibrant cleats and makes you become that intellectual in entity that you are created to be\nI think we all can be more intelligent we all can be more creative and we all can be happier with ourselves to allow that to happen we all are able to experience it on a daily\nBasis we all can make the right choice when we experience that euphoric unconditional love and guess what\nI Believe and again in that book I have uh gone through a little bit of more scientific areas of energy and frequency and vibration on energy isn't all that and I don't know how I got into that but I got into that and that is another part of new discussions we should have about how these things are coming to me but\nI really want to say this to you you can connect the positive side of your existence\nThrough that positive side of your brain called the Palestine pathetic nervous system that activate your positive emotions and the spirit of love and ... and you\n[laughter] what the positive side of this world there is\nOf positivity to this world we just have to ... to it we cannot do that when we don't feel good about ourselves you know that person who did that Las Vegas mass killing\nA really know the only made me feel sorry for all the victims in that shooting but also made me feel so sorry for him\nBecause he could never experience his best something that he was entitled to\nHe could never come out of that darkness and see the beauty in this war because he was so detached from his inner beauty the true sounds\nThat he definitely deserve to experience at least ones and his lifetime and he didn't get to experience didn't tell me a little bit about that I'm about to cry [noise]\n[noise] um you would hope that someone in that situation would seek help why that doesn't go through it or to seek help I mean he really recordings of his girlfriend\nOh you did have a girlfriend but she knew absolutely nothing about this she knew that he was becoming more distance and so forth of the six months prior um but he didn't open up to her about any of his feelings why why couldn't have opened up\nBecause he was so locked into his own negative thoughts he was just so trapped\nAnd his negative thoughts he was so consumed by his dark side that he couldn't get out of that and come back to the positive side and see if you just really read that book a gym did you get a chance to read that book shifts\nOurs or Amazon or from Amazon\nBut this is what I say when you get to that phase one of dance to the music of your soul or D. T. M. S. this is what happens when you come home and you connect all parts of your mind body and soul and a positive way together\nThen you are going to be able to connect with others in a positive way you see that individual was not connected to the world and a positive white because he had not been able\nTo connect himself to his own positive sight when you do dance and music of yourselves and you have that mentality that everything is beautiful you are beautiful you are able disease has to go away depression has to go away\nAnd you see yourself after that then you become holy and you are channels your pie is any channels open up\nTo the rest of the world that is how you can get\nOther people's love other people's positive side and I really say this I mean well you said something very valuable that the person really did every child to anyone and no ... nothing\nShe he tried to ah get from outside but what I'm trying to tell you is that maybe also our ... our belief system off today is labeling people who reach out for help\nMaybe our belief system our society has to think differently maybe they have to say you know this person is aware of some problem\nAnd maybe this person needs to be held to open up his positive\nEnergy over love is ready to evaporate from this person let's do something about it before it becomes a real issue\nAnd you said he's right and they needed and reach out because the system also doesn't approve of it but what I Am going to say at the beginning of the second half I said modern medicine I really I mean for me as a person\nAnd who tries to experience the energy of unconditional love on a moment by moment basis and I really tried to do it and as I said today at my house event it's not that hard anymore because\nInitially it is a little bit of hard work that it requires and that and that's a difficulty because you have to get into the habit of doing it on a regular basis but then after a while you really\nGet used to it and it becomes like a part of your day becomes a routine tank\nAnd it becomes a something that you enjoy your experiencing like for me I Know I get bombarded by a lot of phone call that a lot of duties and a lot of things I have to do and trust me it's not easy to the ... the doctor because I still go to for hospital maybe\nFive hospitals and see patients myself not someone else and to form a physician assistant or nurse practitioner a\nI mean with all due respect I really love you but I Want to see my patients as a double board certified doctor my sense especially one day or so sick that they have been admitted to the hospital so I go to these hospitals I get all these calls that I get all the other responsibilities that I have to respond to\nGuess what all I Need to do is have an episode of Kansas City Music Hall your soul to turn around the course and get that highest level of\nIntelligence in my mind and my brain in my emotions in everything actually made it and be able to make the right decision so here we are with Jim ... all\nThe host of Hayden true show with me and I I just say Jim do you see any connection between you and me I mean how did you end up being here adult to do\nIt is kinda strange a surfer and George that brought us together and we started shouting about what you've been up to what I've been up to a with the student for show and ah I loved how you love the name of my my part of the first\nShift so beautiful because you know there is a lot of head on information in each and every one of us see in that book I also have said we physicians just pay attention to that conventional DNA you know DNA our genetic makeup\nSo we just pay attention to that to how was the blood pressure how is that body mass index BMI how was your crew yeah tending to monitor of your kidney function till we get the attention to the physicality of\nOur existence but there is more to us that inner beauty that in that book I call it an or beauty DNA there is something more than justice physical DNA hidden and nuts\nAnd if we just reach out to that hidden aspect of our existence can you imagine how much more beautiful we would feel\nAnd manifest what do you say [noise] say something you're [laughter]\nWell I I Love I Love everything you're saying and uh you know we can feel very bad for the shooter I also feel horrible for the victims we interviewed a lot of the victims of the shooting on on the show when we did our deep dive into the shooting 'em\nAnd so many of them still suffer today for P. T. S. D. so you got the victims that were killed the victims who were shot the victims who were trampled and then you have a ... almost everyone else that I've spoken to they're still suffering from ... from what the experience that night\nDo you think Jim if we had these\nAreas that were designated to dance to the music of yourself\nAnd in every part of their society every corner\nAnd we will just tell people you know and instead of maybe just a becoming unhappy and a depressed\nAnd feel negative why why don't you just stuff for free I mean you can go to these deaths are the music of your soul classes or episodes that America's singing dancing dog I Would hope for you and you just feel good about yourself what do you think that would have\nWill begin in Washington with the drama surrounding the confirmation process or judge Brett Kavanaugh imagine the horror of having your life dissected publicly because some people want someone else to have the job you been nominated for\nNow imagine what it would be like if the opposition drummed up thirty five year old accusations to humiliate you and then said proved them wrong\nOr judge Kavanaugh is not alone in facing the humiliation his wife and two young daughters have encountered threats and they've had to witness the character assassination of demand they love well after the initial accusation fell apart another one came\nThat one more sketchy than the first then a third but the woman involved in that accusation changed her story Democrats committed to removing Kavanaugh then dug up a report of a bar fight from the Nineteen eighties in which Kevin allegedly wait for it through ice\nYeah to sorted out Salem host air attacks is spoke with John's mere act senior editor of the stream\nOkay John what do you have to say\nWell what we saw was the the equivalent of a show trial\nWhere the people in charge of the show trial trying to destroy someone's name destroy him politically and destroy us politically or they just kept rewriting the rules and moving the goalposts and\nTo mix metaphors throwing ... one piece of spaghetti at the wall after another to see if it sticks\nAnd then if it doesn't stick it doesn't matter because there's more spaghetti and the thought oh my God and Audi found some\nYou know a disturbed woman who's been you know who's been subject to penalties for harassment and defamation of character\nAll right well that's what I Try to walk out something else for you what do you think about this just like a traveling salesman comes to your door and he's pulling these weird gadgets out of a velvet bag you know oh you don't you don't want a watermelon sharpen your okay that's absolutely fine I got something here that you could make toothpaste outta him you don't want\nThat okay let me try something out [laughter] it's like Mr ... from green acres [laughter] yes and Mr Douglas I have a genuine raccoons coke I've always wanted to do my mystery an impression on the air so anyway the the thing is ... let me just say this um we are\nUnfortunately\nAt war we yeah we were playing Patty cake we're playing nice and I really think that if Kavanaugh had been\nAble to be voted on before the flake flake out\nUh I think\nWe could have proceeded and the the the bitter left would have continued to sniping and growls but we could have moved on with some semblance of order with this having happen now with this call for this FBI investigation I think the gloves are now off on both sides I think like\nYou know they tell you what it's about it's not it's not just about Kavanaugh it's not just about the Supreme Court it's not even just about roe versus Wade without even know how the voter bitches about destroying Trump's president I was on the phone this morning with some very serious people who who used to work in the ministry and it says about\nStopping Kavanaugh preventing Trump from from getting a nominee on the court\nGetting the base of the Republican base so dispirited so defeated so humiliated that we don't just lose the house of representatives\nAnd Trump gets impeach which is like an indictment the Democrats now think they can win the Senate and remove him from office that is how lived up\nThis package sharks are because they taste blood in the water\nSo relieved that's what this is about this is all about taking down President Trump it's I mean each Brett Kavanaugh is a nice guy who was friends with the Bush family he's the kind of establishment Republican I Would probably normally avoid like the plague\nBut I'm sure they are very good jurors none\nOf that matters nothing about his character matters now people are saying he's guilty of perjury we can't prove that he molested Dr Ford with can't prove he ever met her it doesn't matter doesn't matter the inconsistencies in our story which she told under oath none of that matters what\nMatters is maybe we can catch him\nIn in an exaggeration or a slight\nInadvertent misstatement of facts concerning his college drinking habits\nNow I just want to be clear people are saying he committed perjury because he denied that he drank too much no he didn't he spent he said quite specifically\nI never drank so much that I blacked out\nOr had time where I didn't remember what I had done for that is all he said under oath anything else you hear people talking about\nI wouldn't call it spin I Would call it a why I Would call it leibel and character assassination and anyone who says otherwise you oh he lied about drinking no he didn't eat your lying now a perjury what is your character problem\nWe have to I mean the fact that we have to have this silly conversation but just to so people understand uh we're talking about something that happened a million years ago for for for starters then we're talking about you know the whole thing is sort of degrading\nAnd I'd I'd like to point to point people to an article I wrote last week which job has gotten some some play the title it's at at the stream Christian blaze blazing forward abortion profit here I just want to point out this woman did work for six years for a company called course apps that makes the abortion pill\nKnown as the question John I just got to ask you how do you account for the fact that this woman who is their number one a witness this everything hinges on her we find out\nAmazingly that she was on this gigantic multi multi billion dollar company that produces the abortion pill always thought I'm not talking about this but they're but they're only not talking about this and I end up\nIn a second going up but yeah\nThey don't want this to be about ... the way the White House is saying no no\nDon't make this about abortion because we need Susan Collins of all we need Murkowski's out\nDon't make this about abortion sell the ward has got out from the White House don't make this about abortion but I'm a journalist I worked for the White House and I have to point out that Christine forward work for six years for a company costs have technologies that makes one product the abortion pill now\nIt's also used for Cushing is disease okay and that's how they got an FDA approved for innocuous uses and then what they do is they use it off label you know the way people use opioids off label right\nUh only most of its revenue there that it makes like two hundred and sixty million dollars a year they're not enough crushing stations on the face of the earth to provide that kind of revenue so it makes its money from abortion\nWhen I Want to know what is it ...\nHas stock in it what does she have stock from what she worked there does which ... which ... Lewis financially if we're all the way to overturn a senator should have asked chart that\nDr Frank ... phone is the national director of Greece for life as he examined the attacks on Kavanaugh he noticed an underlying motivations which mere act touched on a moment ago he explained the bigger picture with Don grow on weight I in Washington D. C.\nWould you agree with the heart of all this really is the issue of the pro life movement terrifying ah those on the left the pro abortion is in fact judge Kavanaugh joined the court things may shift in the next few years regarding abortion in this country\n[noise] and yeah so you actually write and the Democrats are admitting that look whatever the results of this at the gates you might be whatever uh uh proof we can or cannot present a or any alleged misbehavior as\nThose actors they consider him dangerous pick for the Supreme Court and its ideological edge it and the ideological position that they most\nFear is the one regarding abortion or many commentators have pointed this out to those of us who are in the ... the leadership of the ... movement I mean the cast of characters who are on the Democratic side of the Senate Judiciary committee\nAre among the leaders in the pro abortion effort in our country yeah we do these people\nAnd Kamala Harris for example you know came over from California and and uh was busy over they're prosecuting toys activists and I I mean we see it as clear as day and even before Brett Kavanaugh his name was announced by President Trump\nRoe versus Wade was the subject of the hysteria of the left ever since and it's every step down\nNo excuse me course behind this throughout all the ... and the\n... and the the lines would have been wrong the culture of Planned Parenthood has been of course the biggest boar abortion provider in the country although\nThose who support them and they themselves are you will look only three percent of what we spend actually goes for abortion speak to that the erroneous thinking about this on his thinking and reporting as a matter of fact I'm really oh how they also have a big stake could miss [laughter] yes\nI Am a very big steak or you know first of all that three percent are a number even if you take it at face value which ah it it is not valid or even if you take it that way I mean what business do you engage with if they say why we only killed three percent of our customers\nI mean we're talking about the taking of human life will talk about abortion but the way that they count their services they combine them\nWhy why might the guy being angry people trying to ruined his life destroy his family gee I write\nBut our our our our society says no this is not the way a man is supposed to respond this is to me I'm just for the sake of discussion this is another example of what I see as the war on men\nI rarely get involved in any Twitter back and forth but something crossed my path in the Twitter Twitter rivers\nAnd I last night posted a couple of things I posted scripture Matthew five six [noise]\nI also posted something that a man that at one time was a professional baseball player she makes ... no bones about he has a right wing conservative God fearing man\nShe shared young men please remember talking about cabinet Kavanaugh was yes she got angry LDL she'll cry young men please remember crying as something real men do when they are passionate about their causes it's a sign of strength integrity and honor\nAnd I read tweeted that on my wall\nSo a woman chimed in earlier is insulting Democrats not answering their questions what a real man does too\nAnd I'm like here we go right don't fall ploy into the publisher magical bantering and bickering that is politically based\nThat's just what the enemy would love us to do [noise] so I just responded here's a word for you context this man has been vilified has had his character assassinated by the left viciously\n[noise] so I said yes\nThat is what a God fearing man does he ... just like Jesus formed the whip\nAnd so a short time later another man jumped in and then I thought okay I'm Out I'm not going to do this back and forth thing\nBut he had shared his fallible he's made mistakes in his life like we all had but all I saw was a very angry man\nWho was not humble was not contrite felt like he deserved to be on the Supreme Court that is not a man I see Jesus supporting\nAnd I just said humble question mark contrite question mark brother [noise] if my character was assassinated viciously in my family was threatened you better get out of the way\nYou better believe he was angry I say amen to his anger\nHis anger his his emotion his crying stating his case clearly\nMen ... okay to be righteously angry there are women that no part of that anger is also protecting them from wrongdoing\nBut there's a very cynical devious spirit that is rearing its ugly head\n\nSaid dark spirit of rebellion I talk about [noise]\nIt's evil fully manifest in the realm of spiritual warfare right here right now coming up\nBut if I'm saying what the word says job by his Holy Spirit still take that very voice of Jesus to the hearts of this people\nLook at how good pastors preach when the Christian outlook returns in a moment [noise]\nNow dead [noise] then no law\n\nVice president Pence today

wonderful and very exciting years\nAnd ah you know are for money matters is that we are a retirement planning specialist and so we work with people that are over the age of fifty primarily and who are retired are retiring soon and we are so so very thankful we not work with over eight thousand four hundred families in forty three states\nAnd recently barons named more your paypal host one of the top one hundred independent financial\nAdvisors a and actually for the sixth year in a row\n[noise] a flyby thank you but you know without our clients so we would be absolutely nowhere so all the things go to them now one of the topics that we do talk about with our clients are very frequently is estate planning which we call\nHow to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and the reason why you\nDo this is because money isn't everything but it sure keeps the kids in touch does it not Baton Rouge sports happy\n[laughter] and you weren't happy squirts okay let me tell you something unhappy square it's not good don't want that you weren't happy squirt anyway so this is the time we normally we talk about that but this week we're going to deviate from our normal appointed task and we're gonna talk instead about you're giving\nThe opposite of greedy I think a very clean not on washed\nAnd I'm very deserving spouse\nOkay and so we can talk about how to uh protect your spouse in the event of your dad how to create a trust for your spouse and it's called a Q tip trust just like the thing you stick in your ear and a Q tip stands for qualified terminal interest property and so we're going to go over that but jak can play it [noise] I Know I\n\nWould say\nMy saga may be and\n\nI Am a\nFan\nOf course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite is designed it take you from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to you so every week at this time we have our state tip of the week\nSo but this week as I said we're deviating we are going to talk about your love it and most valued spouse okay so we're going to talk about a Q tip trust so\nWhat is a huge trust will basically\nYour if you live in a community property state or if you have divided up your state for a state tax purposes and all that you're half of the state is what would normally go into the Q tip trust or some portion there up okay now the ... trust is designed\nTo benefit your spouse so therefore the rules of this trust are set up for their benefit so what does that mean it means that they can your spouse can get to the money that first of all your spouse can be the trustee which means you're your spouse decide where the money's invested\nYour spouse decides on distributions from the trust so there there's very little lack of control that has now happened for for your spouse that's number one\nThere is a little bit of control and that is because the trust has some rules and the rules are that the money can be distributed for what's called hams H. E. N. S. health education maintenance and support\nSo what the heck does that mean I mean how do you find those and that's the point okay health education maintenance as well so anything that yourself needs for their health for their education their maintenance and their support\nThey can take money out of the trust for that for their benefit and they're the decider as a trustee if it fits that definition\nSo essentially what it means is that the trust has to keep them in the lifestyle that they become accustomed to okay so that if they are accustomed to a a Toyota lifestyle\nThey can't suddenly have a Ferrari lifestyle [laughter] okay [laughter] so they have to have to live within what they were living before but you know most spouses I think would be okay with that so what are other advantages well suppose your spouse is not good with money\nYou can name a different trustee to help with that also if you have the Brady Bunch family you know if if you have different children\nAnd you want your spouse to be taken care of while they're alive but upon their death you want it to go back to your kids you can do that with a with a Q tip trust so there are lots of advantages to the Q tip trust and it can protect your spouse from lawsuits and if they get remarried\nThen the new husband or wife that that is in the picture and have no access to this money so there's all kinds of benefits that distress can provide okay so it's one for your spouse and it's called a Q tip trust qualified terminal interest property but shoot tips easier to say\nAny way if you'd like to talk to one of our financial advisors about your estate planning about how to pass onto the aforementioned greedy ... undeserving airs a than what you can do is you can go to our website is money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd you can click on meat with an advisor and what we'll do is scheduled time to visit now when we visit this is for those of you are over fifty who are retired are retiring soon like I said that's you when we visit we want to talk about your entire\nFinancial life not just your estate planning so we want to help you with Social Security decisions we want to help you with a retirement planning decisions or income tax decisions you know all those kinds of things that impact someone who's retired are retiring soon we want to help you to make those decisions\nAnd if we can help you that's fantastic will do it at no charge or obligation\nAnd if we can I help you that's fine too okay so either way we will part French\n\nWell Dorothy is not too wonderful to be true because it is true\nSo do that okay now if you don't want to go directly to an advisor then what I Would recommend is that you go to one of our seminars okay and we have seminars near you if you can you hear my voice there's a seminar near you pretty much\nAnd uh you can find those again on our website money matters dot net at the center we're going to talk about the several things were going to talk about you know a Social Security decisions are going to talk about how to protect yourself in the next market crash which we think will happen in two thousand and twenty\nA we'll talk about ah do you have enough money to retire on all those kinds of things we will talk about at the center or some money matters dot net for all of the above\nWell you know what Jack I cannot believe that the show's over already well ladies and gentlemen I Hope you've enjoyed it as much as I have enjoyed doing it for you will see you next week same time same channel by by everybody\n[noise] telling them\nInformation presented should not be regarded as a complete analysis on the subject and should not be construed as an offer to buy or sell any of the security is mentioned none of the show's content you knew that person alive indefinitely by a professional\nAdvisor Cindy consulted before implementing any of the strategies presented time nothing investments involved with varying degrees of written and therefore giving no he's er into any specific ... strategy will be suitable profitable for a client worth only taxation\nState planning information offered on this program is general in nature always consult and attorney or tax rational regarding years the deadly legal more tax situation sounded ... should not\nBe construed as an endorsement of ... or ...
