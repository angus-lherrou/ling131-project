[noise]\nNow before the for Kavanaugh hearings where for Nader accusations and Kevin responded sixty nine percent of Republicans supported Kavanaugh's nomination to the court thirty two percent of the general public supported it\nNow [noise]\nWhen Ford testify but before Kevin responded listen to this panel headed up by Clinton up all this\nBut people are watching this all across the country has this began I got a text my friend saying she looks like every woman you know she is she and dean does uh she is someone\nThat if you don't mind this pan always before Kevin testified but after four did\nCompletely recognizable to everybody in the country ah we we know women just like her and uh and she's certainly doesn't seem to be somebody with an agenda as she is putting herself in this very difficult position\nI it's a very ... hearing and the difference between the Democrats and Republicans has been very striking that her for some I think has come off and so far as highly credible I've examined\nHundreds of witnesses on the witness than she is extremely credible she's extremely detail oriented they're a little things about what she has said\nLike the fact that she has two front doors can't make that stuff up it is so unusual that sort of detail it makes her testimony extremely credible and also that she said I Am terrified\nTo be here I don't want to be here but I feel that this is my civic duty I I found her to be one of the most credible witness is I think I've seen\nIt in Georgia have to say it is unmistakable here how how clunky it is the transition between the Republicans on this committee to the Democrats you talked about Rachel Mitchell there who's been brought in by the Republicans are that\nThey would not have to question Dr Christine Blasey Ford or a bright capital and he appears\nTo me for us here later today but that transition back and forth has been um bumpy if you will but what has not been bumpy sort of the temperature in tone in that room from the woman who was answering the questions Dr Christine Blasey Ford obviously up to the American people at home to make up their own minds about the veracity of what she's saying\nWhat she has been very consistent George\nAgain that's an ABC panel led by George Clinton awfulness after Dr ... four testified before Brett Kavanaugh did me well on CNN Simone Sanders said this about Kevin\nWhat I don't believe that cat and mouse on the entire to um get the part that he noted about the yearbook entry but we call the young woman do when that ... because she was one of them but she didn't know that I just thought it was unbelievable I think he he he told not to buy lied about things I don't think he needed to lie about that perhaps he thought that that he could not get in the ground\nUm because he didn't want to be found a couple of anything I think ... I understand\nIf you had been you believe you have not done something wrong and us that and you angry but the way he portrays himself at the outset of this hearing today um he looked on hands\nOn hands so based upon that reaction based upon the reaction by the ABC panel one would think that even Republicans might have gotten wobbly on Brett Kavanaugh\nContrary moments where I mentioned that before the Ford Kevin ... percent Republican support his nomination to the Supreme Court\nAfter the Ford Kavanaugh hearing the figure rose to Seventy five percent meanwhile forty six percent of Republicans said they will be angry as opposed to maybe disappointed\nIf Kavanaugh is rejected\nNow as far as the public at large is concerned but for the for Kavanaugh hearings as I mentioned thirty two percent of voters favorite Kavanaugh's nomination now thirty seven thirty seven percent favorite now in thirty percent opposed it now thirty seven percent of post\nSo it's appeared to shower the general public on Kevin up and not on Republican ProPublica's if anything the again Lindsey Graham has warned that this is the new norm watch out for your nominees guys\nThe polygraph and they didn't tell us until September twenty six\nAnd deal with this what's in front of a guy who adamantly dads if everybody who actually knows him in a real way say this is not the guy I Know\nI got Dr Ford can't tell me the time in the place and we'll see what happens to be something to go to an hour I I don't know for some Republicans not to my Republican colleagues if this becomes\nA new standard for you have an accusation for weeks\nYou drop it right before the hearing you withhold from the committee a chance\nTo do this in a a professional timely fashion and when they publicly say their goal is to delay the get the Senate back in twenty eight teams to make sure he can't fill the seat they're publicly saying that I don't want to reward that kind of behavior I think we've been very fair and to my Republican colleagues\nIf you can ignore everything in this record looking at allegation is thirty five years old is uncertain time place\nDate and no cooperation if that's enough for you God help us all as Republicans this happens to us it never happens to them but let me tell you my democratic friends if this is the new norm [noise]\nYou'd better watch out for you or nominates why\nSenator Hirono said women should not only to listen to they should be believed to she told me to shut up and do the right thing for a change to that Lindsey Graham said this Senator Graham\nThank you I Know I'm a a single white male from South Carolina and I told I should shut up but I Will\nNot shut up if that's okay\nBecause I got here the same way everybody else did\nThe people in South Carolina voted

Africa apartheid were ten percent white people were running the country [noise] what\nHe's like they just want to hold onto that's how I just saw him all day like South Africa apartheid temp and fat or white people were running the country it seems like that's the trajectory that we're on to me the trajectory\n... on now where we're going we're\nDid we not just relax and re elect a black man for

candidate for governor John ... is the unpopular gas tax is unpopular if he thinks it is I'm Larry Elder don't leave town\nLarry Elder all through\nJohn ... before this happened I didn't know the difference between a general city general lost city in a charter city turns out that the largest cities in the in the state\nUh San Francisco or LA San Diego Fresno\nThese are all so called charter cities which gives them a lot more control over things like I'm a police authority and therefore they can uh cooperate with a with the federal immigration authorities they can if they want to er during routine traffic stops inquiry about the immigration status of people\nUh this is not what the governor wants to happen but apparently if you weren't charter city and there are about a hundred and twenty starter cities in the state\nComing about two thirds of the population you have all these rights that you don't have as a general law city\nAnd uh but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for San Francisco to do anything about this uh I mean you\nKnow they're they're in the process of trying to get the state to approve a a legal injection sites where addicts and shoot up in a nice clean environment which I think it's it's certainly are ridiculous and it's not going to solve the problem the horrendous drug addiction that's afflicting California\nJohn Cox when are you going to debate

looks he he is a a good looking guy or a ... and I'm thinking maybe that's why you been able to get away with some of the stuff you've gotten away with this is the guy who had an affair with his best friend who was his campaign manager the wife of his best friend who is his campaign manager who does that it can still survive\nA I don't know that's the broke called people tell me a lesson Larry I got so many issues that people in California you don't want the rest of the California looking like San Francisco does these days I mean you need a roadmap to avoid the feces on the sidewalk so\nI don't think Mr newsrooms answers or California or anywhere near what people want a they want lowered taxes they want lower cost\nThis guy will just Jack up taxes Jack up the cost of government he
