hour show I Know you can't do listen to the entire three hours [noise]\nBy\nLarry over here that said from South syndrome and the union bizarre and all the great ... don't even though the Bagram Bill Clinton allow because we've got to get her to eat [noise]\n\nSon go\nWith a late night seven one F said gee it's really nice living one seven to for three very old relief that the dot com studio and outrage district attorney you're in California Fresno County is lashing out at the governor's blacks\nAnd not quite sure what to call them [noise] loosening\nThe law so that more and more prisoners are released from prison here in California because of overcrowding see our budget so badly mismanaged that public safety which ought to be the top priority is not the top priority top priority or things like\nAnd single payer annabelle trying to know where we'll talk about that just a few minutes [noise]\nFor someone to get back to Hillary Clinton\nRemember this cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about\n[noise] where we start with\nThat what about traditional marriage\nAnd its Supreme Court case that alter the marriage laws for every single state\nWhen Obama ran he was asked about same sex marriage he posted Hillary posted Obama said and I'm quoting him God is in the mix close quote a few years later he opposed traditional marriage\n\nBut you want to talk about a party that is undermining traditional values roe v Wade\nToday's decision Nineteen Seventy three struck down every single anti abortion law in every state and federal ice issue that should be at the state and local level as Antonin Scalia so eloquently put it\nThese are the kinds of matters that should be dealt with at the legislative process not before the courts healthcare\nObamacare one giant leap towards single payer\nAnd of course Obama Care was supposed to solve all our problems with Joe Biden say when Obamacare was assigned quote is the big ... fast forward it's not nearly far enough Obama's already now signed onto single payer knowing full well Obamacare was nothing more than a\nStop towards their eventually goal which is single payer and you want to talk about a party that's threatening traditional values and everything we stand for\nAnd don't get me started on sports and now they've taken politics to take an attorney\n\nAnd if you oppose that\nHe was a problem\nMy goodness this phony narrative of\nInstitutional systemic structural anti black police bias\nNot only is it wrong not only to the facts not support the narrative but it's making things worse\nRon Emanuel says fear of being accused of racist as cause police officers in Chicago to quote rogue themselves into a fetal position quote unquote and be passive not proactive as a result crimes gone up\n\nYou know I haven't seen the numbers recently but a few months ago year to year\nPolice deaths were up fifty percent\nYou think maybe just maybe the anti ... rhetoric has inspired some of these bad people officers Lou in Ramos in New York We're sitting in their squad cars and they were executed by some person who was inspired by the black lives matter movement we can we know that is because he posted on his\nFacebook post\nCops in Dallas who were shot OK and execution style\nShot by a guy who also was motivated by the black lives matter movement because he said so she posted it\n\nYou can't even have dinner now you have people like\nJohn Lennon who's not a lawyer and his colleague it being a at a CNN Chris Cuomo who is a lawyer both saying that you have a First Amendment right to enter a restaurant a privately owned a restaurant and heckle and a fish person provided that person is a public official are you kidding me\n\nAnd you want to talk about a threat to values and tradition\nWhat'd Maxine Waters say if you find a cabinet member surround them let them know they're not welcome anywhere anymore and you want to talk about\nAn attack on everything you stand for what incredible chutzpah\nDonald Trump is frequently called a liar right we play this clip from Hillary one more time listen very carefully what she said about the white vote\nLike when all when they went for me and white women have been a voting against democratic presidential candidate for a decade now\nWell because um people vote typically the way the spouse votes than if you're married you vote the way you stop a vote but according to Hillary that means the man is telling them what to do right\nBy the white vote has only been one twice in the last um sixteen years uh my husband being one of the two ah Lyndon Johnson being the other\nLet's hear that one more time since Donald Trump of course is a liar and\nHas only been one twice in the lab than sixty years uh my husband being one of the two ah Lyndon Johnson being the other [noise]\nOkay now according to the rubber Center for public opinion which is based in ... a Cornell\nWhen Bill Clinton ran in Nineteen Ninety two\nHe got thirty nine percent of the white vote George Herbert Walker Bush got forty one percent and Ross Perot got Twenty one percent when Bill Clinton ran for reelection in Nineteen Ninety six he got forty four percent of the white vote according to the rubber center Bob Dole got forty six percent\nIn Ross Perot got nine percent so let's let's hear that again and of course the person a tomb she told us the interview worked either it's a list or didn't want to correct her vote\nHas only been one twice\nGo back a little further\nCandidate for a decade now or the white vote has only been one twice in the last ... I'm sixty years uh my husband being one of the two uh Lyndon Johnson being the other [noise]\nWere you on me to say\nThe bigger problem of course if the person who she was interviewing with who didn't say jak excuse me a no your husband didn't not in close three thirty nine percent Ninety Ninety two forty four percent in Ninety six\n\nOh George Herbert Walker Bush when a greater percentage of the white vote then your husband did in Nineteen Ninety two and Bob Dole want a greater percentage of the wide open your husband did in Nineteen Ninety six you were wrong and of course you weren't corrected Heidi Heitkamp says she decided to vote against Kavanaugh because of his body language\nObviously yes vote on on Capitol then switched\nYou know after you we watched his testimony understand with the sound off I found that really interesting I'm Wondering can you explain what you saw with the sound off but that made you change your mind\nWell I think first off it's it's important to know that I watched it in its entirety I watched her testimony I watch their tax money I listened and at ... for the sound down\nCouldn't tell that point of this hearing um I was preparing a statement saying I was going to be a yes I watched the hearing and during the process of listening I thought\nThis is a this is I'm at a you know we expect someone to have the Koran we expect someone to have a judicial temperament and what I thought I thought was maybe tainted by what I heard and so I turned off the phone and watched it with the sound off just his opening comment\nAnd um what I saw was\nSomeone who um was angry someone who is aggressive someone who really um I think a challenge to everyone in the room and and you can understand that and appreciate that I mean\nOf course he was going to be angry but I think there is a way to express that anger and in ways that maybe I'm not communicating or by maintain judicial that\nPoint and what people ate and I said one S.

could've don't touch my Medicare dot com right now that's don't touch my Medicare dot com right now John from San Diego you're still listening\nOr you said that Hillary was probably talking about the white vote\nWhile she was she was wrong about that too often two percent of the white vote went to Donald Trump\nShe got the female vote overall this because of the\nWomen are quote women of color and single women are but fifty two percent of white women went for Trump so even if a Sean you believe that what you would referring to when she said that uh uh the white voted been won twice by Democrats and the last six years her husband being one of them uh that was false\nAnd you say well she's probably talking about the other white female vote well she also lost that a ... against Donald Trump and the twenty sixteen okay All right\nSo governor Jerry Brown assigned a bunch of criminal justice reforms that effectively let people out of prison earlier or prevent people from even going or for staying very long because\nFact is that because of our budget being so messed up here in California they're not doing enough presence here is what the Fresno County da Lisa Smith camp just about all of this\nAre you at the clock is how can you only moving a comparative Oregon I mean to\nCanada and Mexico it's phenomenal how much they mirror by them basically if we go\nFor people who spend money conservatively you are in that I really sat on the I don't know I'm not going to be back at you know\nGet over that you\nCan find the young people\nAt the end even at the mother is cheating or disability getting money they're actually borrowing money\nFrom their children and grandchildren if we stay in this much and so when they say oh we we got rid of the TPP the person doesn't understand\nWhat even the United nations about I mean I didn't really realize that some countries don't even have\nA military so they complain that we try to be the world's police force but people are paying to bend and Donald Trump as I read in a tweet or heard somewhere on the Internet\nTo Americans when he speak so that we learn more about how the government actually work I'm very concerned because the young people who will be paying for the pensions the\nEducators are not being the very foundations of how the financial system works on our nation Larry\nI Hope that people will help to teach them and help them understand but I don't want to learn that we've got to vote conservatively it got our government to stop making these great budget\nAnd star there ain't no such thing as a free lunch and half the country beliefs as a free lunch and then the other half of stopping them from eating it and that's where we are\nTold that that there's not one trillion air in the world not one in there and we're over twenty trillion dollar than\nWe are finding that man who runs Amazon because the GOP is going to work for free while the taxpayers are paying their salaries and they're um retirement\nIt's very very discouraging sometimes I agree with her neck um kneeling\nSingle banner is being played by honestly there is a lot of\nProblems like Hillary not being sent to jail there's a lot of people get away with things because they have money and it isn't fair to the right to work hard might have homework Seventy hours a week for many many years worked very hard to job and we're\nHonest people and it's hard to see someone like McCain thousand dollars of our tax money on a damn table\nWill start thank you very much for the call by the way you mentioned that Hillary ought to be in jail Colin Kaepernick said that as well\nShould if she had any other name rather than Hillary Clinton she'd be in jail people don't usually cook that part if Kaepernick protest they caught him talking about how the police are killing people and nobody's\nAre being held accountable they quote that part but they leave out the part where Kevin Nicholson said that Hillary or if she had any of the last name would be in jail that wasn't a forbade them cope with that was pretty close to it\nWhen we come back the media are encouraging Democrats\nTo impeach Kevin\nAnd again we're talking about what's at stake star was talking about what's at stake this a term\nLimit the six these guys get back into power in the house\nThey will take a piece in proceeding not just against President Trump also get Brett Kavanaugh\nOf course neither neither of them will be kicked out of office but that's not the point the point is to go up the agenda have Trump spent time or energy fighting all these investigations so that time and energy I Will not be devoted to doing the kinds of things that Trump wants to do typically\nBuilding the wall\nAnother tax cut more regulations\nThey can't stand that they want a single payer\nAnd I was saying star half the country believes is a free lunch you know the other half is stopping them from eating in stars Epley right government has no money until

H. G. to relate to them\nTo court [noise] no I haven't read it and we're gonna talk just a few minutes about how the media are encouraging Democrat to impeach Kevin took\nAcross and had a very interesting conversation with a former illegal alien name seeds are Vargas who was formerly employed by the New York times as an illegal\nAnd Don Lemon and I'm a I'm a\nWriter from the Daily Beast who's not a Republican by any means cut into a shouting match over whether or not to go into a restaurant a and harassed a public official whether or not doing that is protected by the first and then ... says it is it is not all that and more coming up mark is in Dallas marking the Larry on the show thank you so much for calling\n[laughter] I hear you fine [noise] I I mean yesterday about how white right\nI think he was one of the ones that I uh that that is on the article that I posted about black cowboys\nI learned my side [laughter] well that's right [laughter] I don't know why why why don't\nWow [noise]\nUnless there's something about hurricane Michael slammed in Florida as a category for storm just a little bit short two miles per hour short of being called a category five as of late afternoon the winds have dropped to a category three\nSo far one death has been linked to a storm authorities say Florida Panhandle man was killed by falling tree that crashed into his home in Greensboro\nWill keep you updated triple eight nine ten and one is a G. E. calling us to come out in favor of a President Trump your parents going to have a meeting in trying to arrange a meeting between Trump and Colin Kaepernick here's what happened on CNN\n[laughter] maybe look better to do that I mean they don't work there I don't know\nI'm going to war in the black ... black folks are about to train Kanye West and the racial giraffe okay they've had it with him he's not\nThe ... well I Do I Do know that reference I Know that that is an old Dave Chappelle skit I Know All right good luck going wow\n\nSuch were after they loved already killed people saw intelligence Larry Elder a colleague of mine who happens to be black I think it's only relevant because we're talking about racism here doesn't think Trump is only racism there's CNN analysis which was unreal I mean he is aware and it doesn't mean that he is smart [noise]\nBut when a Donald Trump suggest Maxine Waters says low IQ\nCourse he's racist but Don Lemon can say that I'm not very smart and Don Lemon and ritual the intelligence of Kanye West\nProblem that we can only do that if we elect people who are going to back our agenda and fight for our values\nAnd that is why we have to defeat Nancy Pelosi [noise]\n\nAnd [noise] Maxine Waters a very low to\nMe well media have not gotten over the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh there was talk of in teaching the new Supreme Court justice if Democrats take control of\nThe housing but will support would you support and impeachment effort if your party controls the house\nThe I word impeachment when it comes to the president any longer but now I'm Brett Kavanaugh it's something that you would support if he were elected in the Congress\nYou think it is a good move for Democrats politically ... ethically morally to pursue potentially and investigation that could lead to impeachment\nAnd painting and not the president but Brett Kavanaugh now that he and his Supreme Court justice running on this idea that Democrats are are ... Democrats intend to impeach judge Kavanaugh it's a way to keep the enthusiasm about the nomination and play I guess it\nRealistic to expect an investigation that could potentially and with impeachment proceeding\nCabinet off they get control of the house possibly looking at impeachment uh what do you make of those pledges that they will be an attempt to impeach our justice capital\nI think that if they would you support the house investigation at the start for an impeachment vote to judge Kavanaugh from Democrats could launch impeachment proceedings open investigations hearings against Kavanaugh but again the entire ... how much\nPressure are Democrats hair under when their vote for their voters to do something like an ph Brett Kavanaugh\nWhen you won't basement or we've only had one job is not willing out and says where they are afraid of everything it's like oh we can't have Hillary Clinton talk because it will motivate the Republican base we can't have Iraq Obama talk 'cause it'll motivate their base we can't talk about impeachment or to motivate their ... Democrats\nOf sidestep the issue of ... and ... but I think it's likely there could be renewed investigation that the thing that's going to\nThink back cabin on the fact that he lied about how he liked to get down in college but I'd like to find out about the bill Clinton got impeached or lie about it yeah [noise]\nMine under oath right away\n[noise]\nHey Kevin or where to get impeached she could uh then turn around and run for Congress and maybe get elected the way ... or you didn't know that you know that ... Democrat from Florida was a federal judge until they accepted abroad he got impeached and the Senate threw him off the bench\nAnd then he ran for Congress played the race card and there he said as we speak now getting back to CNN and the trashing Kanye West the Rockies sellers is a democratic strategist why isn't the comment he just now made bigoted\nI'm not sure he and using that as a ... per se but what Kanye West of done with Donald Trump is what other people have done who gravitated in his in his orbit which is just shower him with adulation for what reason I have no idea um but the my issue with Kanye West is is quite simple\nAs that anti intellectualism simply isn't cool and Kanye West these issues as you say to these issues that they're going to talk about our our issues that are that are central issues and many African American communities are very important issues\nBut the fact is we're not sending Kanye West of the White House to talk about these issues because he can't he doesn't have the depth to [noise] um I Want to hear what Kanye West wants to do a when we're talking about criminal justice reform or prisoner reentry the fact that he can not he doesn't have that that just the other day\nHe was talking about a stem programs and how we needed to have more than program that had to turn around and ask his colleague what ... me it was over ... what happens when it was as what happens when negroes don't read 'em and then we have this now\nKanye West is what happened when negroes don't read can you imagine if President Trump said something like that about Don Lemon speaking of home\nLook at the constitution of the United states and it gives people the right to protest it doesn't say where you're going to his wife ... will you please\nOK okay ... so you can do whatever you want and you can leave a show if you want but let me finish that well maybe my point okay well then shut up and let me do it\nAll right thank you very much in the constitution\nYou can protest whenever and wherever you want to do that and you can do it at a restaurant that you can't do it on a football field natural tell you that you can do it on a cable news show you can do it wherever you wanted to call people\nMobs because they are exercising their constitutional right it's just beyond the pale we'll be right back in service that you saw\nThis just ignorance and stupidity on stilts the first amendment allows you to protest anywhere in wherever you want are you kidding me\n\nThe first amendment is ... is to prevent government from Simon see political speech\n\nYou're

doesn't tell you that you can't do it at a restaurant it doesn't tell you that you can't do it on a football field tell you that you can do it on the cable news show you're incredibly stupid\nTo do it wherever you want them to call people mom do it whenever you want because they are ex what the government cannot regulate time place and manner\nThat can't seizing their constitutional right it's just beyond the pale we'll be right that conservatives that\nYou tell us\nWhen we come back [noise] recalls and wears off within legal avenue says yeah the number might be twenty two million into the study they all should be given a given a pathway to citizenship why because Ninety percent of are going to vote for Democrats for the other way around the border will be field in the clowns behind I'm Larry\nLarry over all drew them [noise] to Larry\nElder show am eight Seventy theater\nUsually only outlet calling\nYour\nSo you don't have to sell off a little lame stream\nLike magic you're smart becomes the basis of uses try one alternative Chavez [noise]\nQuite a few ... merge right now in the area but here's the first one on the forty seven Westbury street\nSo they're more illegal aliens and there are voters who made the difference in the biggest blow out an American presidential history you're falling to hear what the map\nWill definitive\nHere I just want to know really quick if they're twenty two million twenty four million twenty nine\nHe want to give all of them citizenship and voting rights are you still for that you'll absolutely no way to look at the economy was doing it for the wall three point seven unemployment rate for point to economic growth we want to be able to do them better look if we had twenty two million I immigrate oh now we're doing pretty well economically so I say Baptists citizenship\nThat didn't make sure we will have it even better economy let's just talk about now with a whole month or so that so they're not paying\nWait hold on your conceding that they're not paying taxes now I thought having talked to many times you're always was they're paying into the system more than let's say yeah which I certainly ... we started on more taxes well why don't they they went to war like wait wait wait citizens don't pay more taxes everybody who works pays the taxes pays our tax rate\nSo you're conceding that a lot of these people and digital break our racial are breaking our tax\nLaw and they're using fake IDs I set it on our oh he'll let him million on deck and they would\nLet them pay taxes the eleven million on back and I thought they were the only way to pay taxes I think more taxes so if there is more ... than let it let them pay more if there is\nIs that ... on the show 'cause it doesn't even make any sense at all I Want to let another on that immigrants are there any let let the eleven million pay taxes no\nVery simple math I'm not saying anything complicated on what you're saying\nYour point is illegal aliens
