some of the main thing for me that you need to go to the FBI\nAnd you need to ask them did they feel like they were able to do their job with that as parents and I think the answer and shifts they

not it was true that Brett Kavanaugh had attempted to sexually assault somebody that's what I thought this was\nThen it was about his duty shall from it because he lashed out after being accused of being a attempted rape is orange one pundit refer to him that's he's serial rapist he lashed out so therefore now he lacked the judicial temperament\nAnd then it switched to well he wasn't candid about his partying days he drank a lot more than he said he drank he partied a lot more than he said he did he put together an image as a choir boy\nHe already said he didn't he had too many beers

the ability to do as extensive a background check supplemental tack that look at it as\nAbsolutely because you've already heard and they'll pay a week ago Saturday they're not going to look at

done and some of the other tips that they have gotten so the White House just basically said we don't want you to do five years fifty thousand interviews in the case\nBut narrow it down as much as possible to the most recent allegations that are credible and take a look at that and it sounds like they did or these senators who have already looked at the report wouldn't be saying that look

concluded investigation with out permitting agents to investigate we're deeply disappointed by the failure we can only conclude that the FBI or those controlling its investigation did not want to learn the truth behind\n... accent the the argument there and that she gave the FBI\nOther people to talk to and that was\nFollowed by but I mean I think the problem is that if you let me control who you ask questions who I'm going to control what your answers are going to get back to when he's in the second\nAnd that's the big unknown because it's again it's White House was shepherding this whole thing telling them and they are the clients to them than helping them who they should talk to and that's all they can talk to doesn't matter how good they are when they're talking to them they're only going to get the answers the White House or the is prepared to have and that's where the problem is in terms of our\nConsciousness though was the world's on or not well done it's technically probably done\nPerfectly but the problem is if you control who get the question you can tell the outcome\nOf the right and I think that than it than what the ... not a criminal investigation do not a normal another normal thing that people think of when they think of the FBI and but this is a big part of what the FBI\nDoes and so I think what the the fact that the backstory here that could have played on you know if the Democrats take over the house that they are going to spend time\nReviewing what the FBI I didn't hear the FBI knows that and that's why you see a lot of this information including the tip line information is being set up so that you know I think the way I kind of hired over the last couple of years of being sort of the political football for\nYeah for the politics and I said I Would imagine Brooklyn breakdown flooding fourth lawyers are saying that it back to when these ridiculous that she wasn't talked to like well as somebody who has done this before to agree or do you

[noise]\nBut you know what not being down with the circus is not the same thing as being indifferent to the complexities of the me too movement\nI Believe that we have a widespread legacy of sexual assault in this country I've left with the victims of sexual assault and I believe the advocacy groups data between one fifth and one third of American women have been sexually assaulted at some point in their lives\nAnd given most women have many other important women in their lives along the daughter sisters and a couple of close friends it means that the overwhelming majority of American women have been deeply affected deeply hurt by the tragedy of sexual violence\nI've had two dear dear friends who've been raped and it is an act from the pit of hell the me too movement of the complicated

law in a letter to the FBI from one of your constituents regarding the ... investigation can you tell us more about\nThat I found the FBI and someone who ... who I felt like I said I have to be part of that or their background check or what\nHave you know the FBI is agreed to interview this person\nInto now now and that's why I bought it because I think that you're asking a lawyer because he that work for her and sampled\nDianne Feinstein the one who sat on the litter for all those weeks since she had an opportunity to read some of the FBI report but not all of it\nAt nine o'clock this morning my staff and I reviewed the FBI report into sexual assault allegations\nAgainst Brett Kavanaugh will let me be clear I Can't talk about the detail because this remains a confidential part of the background report I Hope that uh changes are made and we'll be able to talk more about what the FBI did later but what I can say\nIs it the most\nNotable part of this report\nIs what's not in it as we noted by the White House the FBI you're not interview Brett Kavanaugh nor did the FBI interview Dr lazy for\nShockingly Dianne Feinstein feels that the FBI report is an adequate as does senator Coons\nI think it's going to be very close um I think um there's a number of centers both Republican and Democrat who haven't\nYet the senator they did the deal with with like and I said at the time watch Coons then say oh it wasn't it wasn't adequate enough it wasn't their own up it should have taken more time\nThat made public what their final position will be a and I hope they're going to look at this report and I hope they are going to reflect on a number of other things are ways in which a judge Kavanaugh showed um I think a part isn't inclination or a lack of judicial temperament and how he conducted himself in front of the committee and a number of other issues\nYou see when you were accused of sexual assault you're supposed to be calm cool and collected about that and if you don't mean to you last traditional temperament\nIssues that have been brought forward or both through this process in\nProbably oh I've been accused of sexual assault is not right before I'm an old hand if there's a if you finish it really\nQuick and I hope that will reflect a hard on how this balances out against what they might hope to accomplish by having a conservative on the Supreme Court most of the undecided senators would prefer a conservative Supreme Court um but I think they have to weigh it against a fitness and character\nIn other words you you have no intention of voting for him nor does senator Blumenthal\nMSNBC is reporting that they still have failed to interview now this is\nThe one who misrepresented his Vietnam record said that he was in country when in fact he was never in country probably as a result of and if you lie about one thing what did he say to Kevin all when you lie about everything else so should we play the same standard to senator Blumenthal just saying\nSelf imposed constrained by\nRather straits acting from the White House and they need to talk to for example one of the witnesses that I put in touch with them you can tell them about possibly improper outrages to key witnesses and there were mirrors incident who\nWere known to judge Kavanaugh and potentially indicate that he knew about that New Yorkers store before it came out\nWe come
