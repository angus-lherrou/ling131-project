{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "I think even though we get these foods scares on various things I think manufacturers you be more responsive and concerned about Seminole and their food\nBecause now the you know there's a downside to it [noise] and the terrible miserable rotten trial lawyers to get some a terrible a feeling among many people in the country are the people that are responsible for all that they deal\nBut let's talk about how you really feel for just a moment okay there is a very famous printed out and I wish I wish the sad we'd be printed and updated every year that was put out by the trial Lawyers Association many many years ago showed a car and it had all kinds of little arrows\nGoing to various portions of the car and it indicated these were the the safety changes that had come about because of the efforts of trial lawyers this was a much safer ... pointed out all the various or is that we're safer because of your efforts now\nInsurance companies\nThey are known perhaps to be among the most vocal opponents of trial lawyers and and and in some of our real preparation today we've linked the words insurance companies and bad faith and yet out there in advertising they're always saying we're here for you\nOkay while\nEmailer here it's either a fire ha ha there are only saw the show so anyway I have to talk about my neighbor to my good ... good has Wilder uh\nThat is what we've been talking about and that is the the issue um are they interested in the bottom line profit are interested in doing what in fact is it important to their um consumers the reality is is that\nThe uh article you are the ad you referred to\nThat sounds to me like a a a trial lawyer report card or in every year we should be able to put out a trial lawyer report card and say what are we done this year to make a place that is a better place for you to live\nThat it'll make the better products safer see that you get your ... your bills and medical bills paid see that you get your insurance benefits the problem is\nThat takes a great deal of money and are advertising budget it pales in comparison to the advertising budget that all these major multi million billion dollar insurance companies have the spent\nStencil that rather than a recognize the advances their interest that of course only in their corporate image only\nThe problem is and I I really wonder who runs these companies who are these people it's kinda like the movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid who are those people because\nWhen you have a safe or product and when you point out to all the things that have happened to these vehicles that means less death lasts injury less insurance claims as we're out there and making money for these people so rather than attack as you think they might even\nA little short thank you every now and I was a real bad [laughter] but so I was wondering why haven't these titans of industry figured out\nThat there is profit and there is money and doing the right thing\nAnd that looked at work together as a team now that does sound Bali Amish but the reality is I just can't figure it out because I think on a dollars bottom line basis\nWhat we try to accomplish is to put ourselves out of business make cars safer have people not get injured and the first instance not suffer serious injury or death\nAnd in the process of doing so we get all this incredible resistance it's a\nIt's it's enough so I guess to make your passion and set up to make you angry at them enough to make you are engaging like we had this great dinner the other night called rage for justice a cause I we're all full of rage as long as we keep our ad job\nAnd it isn't just the trial or is it the group like the foundation for taxpayers and consumer rights is the Harvey Rosenfeld than the Jamie according to the world who are doing this and sacrificing to try to make things better for consumer working with the nurses working with lawyers anyone who will listen to them\nAnd they do this dinner and and they and they remind us that it's not just that we need to do ... says we have to have a race for justice to keep us driving and to keep us moving\nYou know I'm all these toys the get recalled\nBecause of lead paint in the toys somebody just because the heads pop off in the children's suffocate forty five percent of those toys that have been recalled the sheer for manufactured in China\nSo now than a manufacture here by so it was obviously a they're less expensive setting out into the marketplace subjecting now\nChildren to some very serious risk of harm and when a mom or dad goes to the store to buy the toys they don't go tested for land they don't go tests the if the head's gonna pop off they don't and choke the child they don't do any of that so the\nThe real a source here of product quality has to be with the person selling the product\nAnd unless there's a severe penalty in serene up a bad product I think it's a lot cheaper to sell the one from China when they hit box offered the lead results or whatever [noise] so\nI think the trial lawyers to pretty good but widely\nTheir budget cases out there that are total baloney the lawyers should never bring that are brought and insurance companies have to defend that case for corporations have to defend the case and the cases baloney truth me or not\nI I'm with you on that and I totally agree and we've seen it in our practice a for a long time but the problem is is the number one those are a bills are a few of the case that they're they're very much lower percentage of cases as a whole\nWe are all in perfect human beings and an imperfect world that means that are going to be bad trial lawyers who bring bad cases\nBut you don't fill out the baby with the bath water and the reality is yes there are some abuses and we're alert to that I Know that Amy will be working on that when her leadership with the trial lawyers here to help eliminate those types of cases\nWith a ... you know our biggest problem in terms of getting rid of bad cases are it's not us as the bar association or the trial lawyers police in ourselves\nWe do that not as well as maybe we could but we do that\nI've had many conversations with insurance adjuster his insurance claims people the people who had up the claims they permit and I say why do you pay those claims why aren't you engaging in ... the discovery in the fraud why aren't you saying no and not paying these claims\nAnd they said why Ali we figured out it's cheaper to\nPay 'em than it is the fight them so we just go ahead and pay them I said but by paying them you're you're part of the culture and part of the problem and they made an economic decision not at the what's right just\nEliminate some of these bad claims eliminate some of these lawsuits but to allow them to continue because it's in their economic interests to do so\nYeah why they but guess what you can't blame the people who were brought into a case that don't belong in the case you can't blame them for that that's all there is\nNo no I'm not blaming them I'm saying that their claims that are the person who has a claim brought against them and the carrier who knows it have decided it's easier to make a payment than it is to force those cases the trial because again it's short term thinking when they stand up to those cases those cases will start to go away\nThe short term solution for them is to make a simple payment and move on and yes all yes there are people who get brought into law suits that don't belong there and they shouldn't be either I mean I Know it's difficult sometimes to say yes that I might have to pay ten thousand dollars\nTo the Vita five thousand dollar claims of I just pay five thousand dollars I've saved myself five thousand dollars but that short term thinking\nAnd Solomon what are you going to do about it\nI think we continue to police our own I think it's a really small a minority and I think it's really easy to say that a lot said is fabulous and kill it here on\nYour own and that is going to bring us to the end of our time together today and I got to tell you

I think it's a I think it's pretty cool background is what appeared to be an effort to keep her case at the center of the news\nDaniels' attorney whack job Michael ... filed a lawsuit on details we have back in April the suit alleged the Trump attempted to tarnish her reputation and credibility by dismissing her account and description of a man who she says threatened her in the parking lot two thousand eleven\nOr so so what happened is she said that some guy came up behind her and said oh what a cute baby it'd be it'd be a shame if if something happened to her mother and a and took off\nAnd uh that that was somebody from Trump and uh so so President Trump um dismissed it he\nDismissed it on Twitter and he tweeted\nSketch years years later about a non existent man a total conjure up playing the fake news media\nFor schools but they know it and uh by calling the incident con job so basically basically the or the picture that she had drawn up\nThis of the suspect looks just like her ex husband like I'm looking at a picture of her and her ex husband I'm looking at a picture of the of the detective sketch\nThat's the same guy I mean he's it looks just like him so by calling the incident a con job Mr Trump's statement would be understood to state that are Stephanie Clifford was fabricating the crime in the existence of the assailant\nBoth of which are prohibited under New York law as well as the law the law of\nNumerous other states avenue you wrote in the lawsuit Daniels was seeking damages in excess of Seventy five thousand dollars [noise]\nWell you know for a guy who was on TV all the time and a porn star that's on TV all the stops all the time for someone who's making such a big deal it who's such a a pillar strength from the community that she's worried about her reputation\nMaybe shouldn't have been porn star she's worried about her reputation um by someone saying she's a liar you'd think they'd go after more than Seventy five thousand dollars because it has to pay that has to pay his piece the oil we\nUse Stormy Daniels vans that sent money in the Gulf and me for her uh you've paid the legal just fantasies plus Donald Trump remember this is the attorney you can't see on TV for more than two days at a time\nYou're talking about a human being who was apparently chop ...\nIn a in a consulate here\nAnd and the president is not lifting it would seem to me to Republicans in Congress [noise] Lindsey Graham in particular has been out there saying I don't want to do business with the Saudis anymore if it's as if this is what is going on compare that\nTo the Kavanaugh hearings I mean that's just an apple and an orange we're we're talking about here\nAnd and he needs to act as a moral leader you know the people look to the United states from our leadership\nAnd um instead of talking about we need to get to the bottom on death row cetera et cetera you prepare with over there he's talking about well be careful you don't want to conduct the Saudis too quickly must be nice to the thought is\nWell you know it uh it's it's it's all the convenience of when we want to be moral\nLeaders in the in the country or I can I can remember when you know and I am and Don told me that one of her uh\nOne of her uh her Democrat friends are from childhood said she got a message or as a Facebook post or something I blocked her 'cause she just makes me mad I'm that said said look a guy who was murdered in Trump's doing nothing about it\nOkay there's a whole\nBunch of people in Chicago there get murdered every week in nobody does anything about that certainly not Brock Hussein Obama when he was president for eight years and that's his hometown or at least that's the county was in before Washington D. C. um you know before his hometown of a of a belly Indonesia\nUm oh I'm Sorry I mean a Honolulu, Hawaii is what I meant to say\nI'm so uh but you know it uh it's it's convenient if we remember a Brock Hussein Obama was out on the golf course when we heard a I forget the name that guy's first name I think it was James Berg or maybe it was ... I don't know is his last name was his last name was ... he was a contractor\nOver there in in Iraq or Afghanistan and uh they they got captured by by the uh al ... and they cut his head off and put it out on the Internet and uh and\nGot off his golf cart with his buddies not senators or or Congress many was out the golfing with some of his well some of his a celebrity buddies he got off the golf cart walked all round a book in front of the ... in front of a backdrop\nSet a few words and then got back on his golf cart and continue [noise] so I don't know he never did anything so but nobody is\nThe Republicans didn't say anything but even I mean the the Democrats never said anything about that but now that it's somebody that you know Trump's in there well you know you can't just let somebody get killed and not do anything about it in another country\nEven some Republicans are saying we need to get out of the one hundred it's one hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia here's Marco Rubio\nI don't think we should continue ... harm sales are a lot of the money but also a lot of leverage over their future behavior you know they don't need are there are so we are training and those are things we can use their influence or ... or I Would not take that and not off\nThe table well Marco Rubio or a contradicted himself he said well I don't think we should continue doing business as usual until we find out\nI think maybe we find out first and then we make a decision what to do you know let's let's stop doing business with you let shop shipping and stop collecting money and I stopped doing this until we find out whether you're guilty or not I don't think it works that way I think we continue doing business as usual until we find out until we find\nOut otherwise and then we make a decision and this is a slippery slope here this is a this is a this this is why nobody wants to be the president I'm also I don't want to be the president because I don't have to deal with this kind of stuff because you've got a lot in the balance here here's a here's why President Trump feels differently\nSo I have a tremendous order a hundred and ten billion dollars every country in the world wanted a piece of that although we got all of it\nAnd what are we going to do that you know when I had some senators come up with some congressman just as well you don't you know I think what we should do is we should have said orders who we hurting as five hundred thousand jobs will be ultimately a hundred and ten million dollars the biggest ordering the history of our country so last a village or\nGenocide we're going to turn that down why would we do that\nSo you know who is who is he a who's looking out for now so uh Rubio says hey you know what I'm we should we should do that because it's not just the money why these things are important it's the uh we have we can control their behavior because they're gonna need spare parts and they're going to be training there you need this thing in the ...\nWell that's one reason we shouldn't cut it off before we find out for sure what the deal is and uh because we should say until we find out otherwise we're not going to we're not going to\nHave sanctions against you weren't going to have you know it's if if we know for sure that happened and we have to decide if that's really important to us\nBecause again they're important in in some uh foreign Foreign Relations with other in in a a hotbed of\nOf a of a psych psycho chaos out there in the middle east and uh\nYou gotta you gotta consider that to consider all the options and it it's going to be a tough spot I'm Glad a President Trump's there and I'm not and I'm Glad that he's got a Mike Pompeo and a General Mattis and\nUh some smart guys over there that are going to help advise them and they're going to come up with those going to come up with what's the best way to uh to deal with this um\nI just think I just think that the Democrats are making a big deal out of this but if if they were in power they wouldn't make a big\nDeal out of it because it's\nOne guy in Saudi Arabia didn't really have anything to do with us they're just saying hey we're we're doing business with these people\nWell we're doing business with the country and we got some bad actors over there is that and I'm not and believe me I'm not defending anybody I'm just saying hey let's think clearly\nLet's consider the whole situation before we make judgments so side not ridiculously this week started out with liberals actually trying to blame Trump for the show the tragic death because he likes to verbally attacked journalists here's Obama adviser Ben Rhodes in CNN's Brian seltzer\nMessage to the Saudis wanted to send\nThat you're not safe anywhere to criticize us in the middle of the president is sending that there's a cost one just wave of planning on those are also the same song values like freedom of speech and the sense\nThat suddenly are very endangered around the world\nTo lure someone to counsel to dismembered body and to take it bounces all day is a ... of a different caliber\nI Wonder if you look at the top in the last ... and you wonder if\nThe enemy of the people rhetoric\nSlump just from President Trump but also from other world leaders\nAnything to do anything at all\nYeah so I'm sure the people over there are a attacking the a journalist in America because remember this guy left and he's been writing for the Washington Post and so they're taking it out because Trump said that\nThe the\nThe uh media is the enemy of the state\nI don't know that they take they take a Trump stuffed so seriously and we lured him we lured into the conflict so he can be killed I think love lured him he was going to get a marriage license well how do we how did anybody lure him to the to the constant well you've got to where we live with him\nInto here so we could capture him we told them he had to have a marriage license to get married to someone who's Turkish I think he just wanted to get married so anyway [noise] kept pucker sea\nSo ah another Caribbean immigrants oh hold on I'm changing the subject and other Caribbean of immigrants from Central America is on its way the U.S border this week traveling from Honduras in Guatemala through Mexico where does it expected that most of them will be granted passage in a series of tweets Thursday President Trump indicated he would call our military to the border and stop\nThe new NAFTA deal which is called the U.S NCA United States Mexico Canada agreement which\nSeems like a dumb seems like a dumb name but it is what it is a nap that sounds so much more cool um North American free trade room so you know when we talked about this about three or four weeks ago the new agreement between Mexico Canada and United States\nAnd he said he's going to cancel if Mexico fails to turn the the share of an around which I think it's reasonable\nYou know what we have leverage on these people why do we let them just do whatever they want an assault our country\nSo Donald Trump to put out a bunch of tweets the assault on our country at our southern border including the criminal elements in the drugs pouring in just far more important to me as president then the trade or the United states Mexico Canada agreement hopefully Mexico stop this onslaught of their northern border all Democrats fault for week laws\nHe continued in addition to stopping all payments to these countries which seemed to have almost no control over their population I must in the strongest terms acts asking Mexico to stop this onslaught\nAnd is unable to do so I Will call up the U.S military and close our southern border in big letters\nI liked that a guy who's working from strength\nHe continues I'm watching the Democratic party because they want open borders and existing week laws assault on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador whose leaders are doing little to stop this large slow people including many criminals from entering the U.S Mexico from entering Mexico to the U. S.\nBecause you know they have to go through a border at the southern border of Mexico to get there and ah he treats another picture can you believe that the Democrats are allowing to be done\nHere and I'm listening to myself without a great shows where you live so in fact\nGet but before I bring home I guess\nI just want to mention a few things first of all did you see that report that there I think\nOn Fox I saw this morning that a a Fox reporter interviewed one of the Hondurans on the on the a caravan\nThis man actually said the sixty seven hundred from Central America\nTraveling to the U.S border I don't know if that's an accurate number he was probably just talking off the top of his head but\nTraveling to the U.S border and\nSaying this home during didn't say that he spoke in broken English yeah he didn't say that uh well you know we're being so tortured and there's it's so dangerous in Honduras in our town that we must come to the usa we must seek asylum\nYou know we're trying to get a better life we want a better life we want the American way in Los Angeles and in the United states and even if were sent back we're coming back\nBecause the last time the Trump said you know the last time that the caravan came up Trump's that well you know once you get to the border we're not going to let us and yet they were let in so that you know this is sort of like madness and you know they're gonna come straight to Los Angeles most of them right we know that\nSo this is madness but you know\nWhen when they discuss the midterms when the when the politicians are off off on the campaign trail they're not saying that well you know the Democrats won ... open borders yeah look at this caravan coming here now well I'm In Trump talks about it but the Democrats are now talking about the\nIssue the main issues like immigration not illegal alien not this invasion which has been going on for decades which I've been talking about on this show since since its inception\nBut they're talking about health care seemed ... city and the ... on a ... of the you know how they're just on is they're trying to say that that may the Democrats are trying to sell to the American people that the most important issue if health care\nI think the the number one reason like Trump was nominated will won the presidency ...\nRather is against immigration has been illegal aliens this invasion from the ... from the south of the border has been an issue for Americans most knowledgeable America Americans for decades\nAnd yet the Democrats act like it's no big deal and watch these illegal aliens if they make it to the U.S border and the you know catch and release if they make it and you know\nThey can only be held in detention for like twenty days then there'll be let out into you know it's going to be a whole other uh you know the press is all Trump is such a bad guy people are so racist they don't want these folks from Central America that come in\nIllegally\nSo you know I just wanted to touch on that but we're going to get straight to my death I mean I think the mid term hopefully hopefully hopefully because I keep hearing the ... say that you know that the Democrats are going to take the house if the Democrats take a house we know what's gonna happen it's gonna be investigations and subpoenas and all that stuff to impeach Trump\nWell we want to get some work done\nThe American people want some they want things done they want something done and they want progress they want to move forward they want to they want betterment of their lives right that's what the American people want and when I think about betterment of our lives I think about the betterment of black\nMen it's important that we have black men black American men leading our families leading our communities\nRight I talk about that all the time that the black man you know you don't see good role models you don't see good examples of black\nMen leading the black American community leading their family you don't get that in the media you did not get that in the media and that's why I'm delighted to have my gas today\nRight [laughter] you're smiling I'm delighted that my guests today rock head you said to say rock had Johnson rock had Johnson yes rocket Johnson is a ... a chief of staff am I getting this right you'll let me now the chief of staff or

I. S. yeah dog and Dr Dre given that negative music as opposed to that love and music okay\nThat's right yeah no absolutely out for no but it's in the ... that that that's the way up and change the way they've changed the the the whole dichotomy around\nWalk you know I'm Glad you said what you said with him staying there because I agree with you\nWe live in a culture where it seems like all were fat as negative about what what fails and instead of what succeed so I've been very familiar with Jim Brown organization for years grew up with them think he's the greatest running back ever loved him as an actor but he's got a lot of heart and soul and he's got the uh he's got a real Christian spirit when he talks\nAbout adolescent avid ... you have a question\nYeah no no no I'm just saying I'm just saying rock\nWhy do you why do you think it is that there are so much emphasis on the media and others are just what's failed in the negative instead of looking at more closely at organizations like John Brown's they're succeeding and turning the lives of people are and what's your what's your feeling about that why it or or do you do get the feeling that they're that they're\nSeeing it and it is I I give you example in two thousand five ... ... per capital\nWas murdered murder capital of the U.S there ... capital murder as any other for the fourth largest murder rate in the U.S and two thousand and five American programs on a contract to come in the county we bought that down from Seventy five murders to like twenty something the next year when lower\nAnd they said that they didn't want to renew the contract because we didn't involve the law enforcement officers but we were getting the job done\nWe're crypts and blood working out that often rather get the money to the park it made me a ticket meter to give the money back to the organizations assessed from on the stand the fifty years ago dean Witter wanting to buy the ... program\nAnd Jim said if I saw this program here never touch\nThe community to actually touch they've become another hooked on phonics\nPeople are people want this to recommend a critical mass worked in pressure high school will be dealt with all the freshmen is that we're we're we have worked in a city of Downey when we did all three schools on this program works we worked as a cargo down over Minnesota New York and I work as a cesspool want because\nOf the myth of Jim Brown the myth if those are black program or the myth people are in denial of something that truly could help change this society in this community as a whole so\nYes is it is there but people are in denial you and then now you don't want to accept the realities of life and the realities of life it there's things out there that works that people don't want to buy into because it doesn't benefit them or doesn't see their pockets yeah\nI agree with you I agree I just wanted to get your take on that ah it's a shame because uh this is this is I Know all about this program and it's something that can really make a big difference in changing it has and do we need more of that and a infant here more than instead of\nWhat's failed and because they felt that when people force feed the negative it causes people to give up when they see that something is succeed and they hear more about it it gives them hooked\nOn it and they let me show you so I totally agree\nI got out in Nineteen Ninety two are connected with Mr Brown\nIn Ninety two ten in the middle part in uh Ninety two I have not went back to jail since\nThat men showed me how seal to have a father figure that man shows you how to feel once I took responsibility for my actions skill allow me being a father I Know how to be for my own kids\nAnd it and that they're not and I say I have not went back I have not went back and I was a very violent tenacious person mhm all my life\nWhile you were a mentor to now you can become a mentor say that's that that's how it works right\nYes yeah and I was talking about the importance thank you for calling in to the neck and says I I was talking about the importance of the daddy I'm a ... I Believe in daddy's so strongly and that has been missing in our communities we started out with in the forties I think we have a seven percent\nTo ban two parent families by sixty five LBJ said we had sixty six two parents that today we have twenty five percent two parent families I Believe and daddy's\nDuring the first number around\n... two days he said he there since first you're not ... percent Bertha your somebody I grew up thinking I was always present birth or the one who has ruled don't want to be loved by somebody you know and raise\nTheir hand\nNo one raised their hands fathers\nHow do we get back his father's [noise] that's right and when he deal with these these three topics\nHad to do with myself mhm\n'cause not having a father mhm not have respect for the adults mhm at that time and now I'm a father mhm I'm a father who lost\nHis sixteen year old daughter in Nineteen Ninety eight the lifestyle lived there all his life she got her hair blowing off not to do with that and that's very painful to do with it and she got killed on my birthday the only thing I celebrate because people say I wouldn't live to be Fifteen sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen twenty\nSo when when I deal with that not deal with the responsibilities of that mhm and I still have to worry about her sister whose mother daughter mhm who want to commit suicide at one point because she wanted to join her her sister\nI we had to stop and then she deals with she goes to all that stuff right now the day or the thirty six year old mother of five my daughter my oldest daughter who do you got for the daughter five other daughters and then you got one son a son that are we everybody called Little Rock\nBut a son who's nothing like me and my son who has a scholarship\nAt a university playing football and basketball ... a ... I got one fighting all his life\nA son who asked me every day said that you think I'm a ... ... us in the house I don't think you know\nWhat the only way you look at me sometimes I said look I think

to college\nWhen he's young men call me up on me and I looked at him I said man in half of me for me so I have to be there for you\nI don't care who you are I don't care what color you are\nSo father

communicate mhm well my eight nights your daughter's today I said I'm you're in college you know you you did your party so yeah you drank tried and like you smoke we had\nYou know but she looked at me

my son's\nDiagnosis summertime see what I Try and we you like it no I didn't like it that ... you're not mad at me so I can Munich ... with my mhm and I asked to miss an art how can we get our kids to buy back in the U.S as parents and his father just trust us around and one thing I learned a gym told me as long as I stay\nPositive as long as I'm not writing that spans than my Sears everyone I deal with any any life on end they don't get that same vibrant that same feeling that do negative I'm On a negative thing in front of the people\nWho are who I see I care about Mm that's not a good look mhm\nThat negativity you know our community is is just the thing with negativity and I think that\nAll the negative responses to con you a meeting with Trump it was this negative couldn't you know I spoke about that last week with Wayne it's like they couldn't pull back and just like let's just wait and see how it plays out don't just be so we action airy and you know\nAgain again I met with them for three hours to me and to the American staff\nRight so we we had a not not only Jonathan who thank goodness ah ah ah was here even though he was under the weather I appreciate it a Patricia and I were road traveling in the northwest for so long overdue visits to people\nThere are good friends up there near uh Bellingham\nAnd ah you know we were not able to listen last week I did listen to the podcast is so good and thank you Ari David for being part of the program Ari\nAri David and I have known each other who did he runs Disney run against rat face Waxman\nYeah back in two thousand ten I think yeah\nYeah those before Waxman but uh well I don't know that he turned that he just resign because of redistricting and decided to just time to make some money\nBut it in any event was good to have already a David here and they took the program in a little bit different direction last week talking about gods now\nThis movie and and of course a\nA ... one of our most prolific serial killers\nEven if you don't count a prenatal abortions what this guy was doing or is just outrageous it and I'm so glad that you guys talked about that program\n... and ... and believe me this is not a social issues sometimes people tried to dismiss it as a social issue but the lie of abortion in our society a is a one of the core lies at the heart of our political discourse tended to we can reconcile this\nAnd and act on there's a legislatively as opposed to being a having a more abortions such as it is\nJudiciously impose by a tyrannical a judicial branch we're going to continue to have problems in this country\nThey it in God's Janelle or he is you know he was always a bad actor and even now the left won't even acknowledge that ah he exceeded even their own bad behavior standards is shocking so I'm Glad we had that and uh you know we love to have a a\nI'm a you know we'd love to have you ah a cold and again on these issues if you like to hear about them although as you know are we spend most of our time here\nOr local and fiscal issues and not so much on the Supreme Court\nBut of course abortion effects are so many of our fellow citizens are hundreds of thousands of them and they're all unborn\nAnd um and it's a it's a terrible terrible thing so uh in any event yeah a gift for Brooke\nI just saw blurb up on the screen to somebody at a column they want us to read\nHer something less okay All right well you can bring you would you can in the meanwhile uh you know we want to give back to a ... program here tonight we're going to be talking about some huge issues are particularly the uh uh the three major tax measures\nThat they're only three of them but there were there on the ballot up here in Saint Gabriel\nValley Pasadena\nBurbank in Glendale Ariz each of them both seeking to raise the sales tax rate by the maximum point seven five percent\nAnd that is going to generate around twenty million dollars worth of additional revenue in the city of Pasadena I think it's good to generate around thirty\nA million dollars additional revenue in Glendale and I don't know what it is for Burbank but we can tell you this for sure each and every one of the taxes is nothing more or less than a pension tax\nUh which uh which we you know we definitely have to have to uh to to understand more because it's getting ready to bring down the entire state and they're just trying to whistle pass through graveyards\nThe other important election [noise] ah is one of our signature issues and that's down there is south Pasadena and south Pasadena local citizens there after many years of struggling have put on\nA measure and initiative a local initiative on the ballot to repeal\nThe uh uh ten percent utility users tax do of course uh the city and everybody else or screaming down there\nA a a they have no arguments are just screaming that the quality of life will be effective do which we say yes it is going to be affected in this a three point six million dollars\nIn revenue that you would be short is a tiny fraction of the amount of revenue that you're already short of down there\nIn Pasadena you say oh we can't afford to lose three point six million dollars\nIn the utility tax but yet even under ... phony numbers you owe twenty nine thirty million dollar show your audio ten percent of that the the dirty and wipe out any savings so what are they doing they're cooking up another safety tax a partial tax\nA a a a a parking deaths you name it there'll be a any number of creative issues\nAnd they hope that you focus on their quality of life\nRather than your quality of life because believe me it's going down now a approval to have you with me here Jonathan Wilson who is the editor of the taxpayer goes dead and Jonathan uh our our second official ... went out this week\nUh the taxpayer ... south Pasadena election edition\nAnd did is eight solve the pages long they tell us about that word to to go how ... how long has it been out was the reaction\nWell we got we got printed this week here in Glendale and or have them delivered to every household in South Pasadena on Thursday morning starting at four AM how many how soldiers that are proximity ten thousand five hundred wow yeah\nSo yeah we've been getting some great response we had a guy come in and the other day that was just over the ... and you guys did a great job explaining it or he owns an apartment building he wanted all of his tenets\nUh to um get that right so they know either rents going up right there you go to Beijing is there I thought that was incredible\nAnd I did you know we're always disappointed when we don't get the negative angry phone calls I was thinking well yeah you know the first day or so we didn't get any angry phone calls
