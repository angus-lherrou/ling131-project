it done All right eight eight eight nine seven ones age eight eight eight nine seven one saves Larry Elder dot com even when the filling guys are here again I Mark Davis from six sixty am the answer in Dallas Fort Worth around me a happy\nMorning show host and this morning a boy what a what an emotional exercise and as I always say when I fell in for Larry or Dennis Craig or some of the other shows on the U.S are in that some of the best preparation I can possibly do for these national shows\nIs my own local show each morning and boy did I Do that today\nAnd we talked a lot about the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre and we talked a lot about the arrest of the bomb scare guy or they're in a\nIn Florida or we talked a lot about the approaching caravan and so with another day of news in progress and least on the\nUh the the eastern Mississippi half a day to just about done in terms of the business hours as we head into a a lot of people's trip home let's talk about where we are I Am going to share some thoughts with you and then you just share them back into the method of your choice on the telephone lines of course\nEight eight eight nine seven once age eight eight eight nine seven on\nS. A. G. eat out or they are on the Twitter account at Mark Davis follow me there and the shooting stuff they all take a look at the various things during the during the commercial breaks and as I say that's another whole show that takes place over there but the one that involves um us in close proximity is right here and\nDo our phone lines are open for you and I've got some questions for you I I actually plenty of things to say but I always couch them in questions for you before I Begin asking you what you think about some things I'm In a time when so\nLittle unifies us I think when we were lashed together on Thursday\nHere on the Larry Elder show I think I went through my usual speech about how unity as for the birds common ground is a is a mess\nAnd in fact we are a better people we are a better government we are a better society when everybody just\nIt is true to their beliefs let the conservatives be conservative and fight for conservative things let the liberals be liberal and fight for liberals things were going to have winters who wins losers who loses what the election is about the week from tomorrow the winters are going to win the losers are going to lose and I've been preaching a conservatives for years\nI don't think you're going to win by trying to reach out to the left 'cause all they're going to do is buy your hand off because they ain't reaching out to us and nor should say the left should be left if their ideas prevail good for them not so good for the country in my view\nBut they're they're all this common ground unity combined nonsense I is it\nIn terms of policy it is ridiculous but I offer that as an on ramp to the following\nThere is a short list of things that unify all of us under the umbrella of our humanity or at least should I Wish it were all of us are but there is a a a little tiny sliver of a subsection of of humanity in its steamy underbelly [noise]\nThat uh that does things like what we have seen\nIn Pittsburgh and so before we dive in and talk about Pittsburgh before we die then talk about the media reaction and political reactions to Pittsburgh let us just pause and do the most important thing we can do as Americans as people\nIs lift up those last people in prayer let us lift up the soles of those who are shot by this this this monster their their families their friends\nTheir faith community there at the tree of life synagogue it is it it is probably it it is sad\nThat it takes thing the only things like this truly unify us but this is not a a policy battle this is not a left versus right thing this is a good versus evil trying\nNow in a minute or you will hear people say that that in their take on good versus evil they consider the president of the United states to be evil now that I'll have a word or two to say about those people but before we before we had down\nThose various rabbit trails of talk show land [noise] um let us just no matter what we are doing right now where I Am here in central time a little after five in the sun is shining it's beautiful warm Texas day maybe you're a little bit into your commute on the east coast may be a beautiful vistas of mountain time it's\nThe afternoon and you're enjoying whatever you're doing it out on the west coast and not in a\nAn elder country of Los Angeles and various other affiliates in California where it's a little bit after three it's the middle the afternoon to Monday and maybe you've come through a weekend filled with blessings filled with faith and filled his family at least that certainly my hope for you [noise] this is exactly what these folks thought\nAs they walked into the synagogue on Saturday morning\nI've heard a lot of people say that the one victim they can't get out of their heads as the Ninety seven year old woman and I I Confess to that myself out that any one life is is worth more than any other are like that was really bad I mean they're all bad it's all terribly there's all heart rending but if you're Ninety seven\nYou saw the Holocaust first hand a lot of people who are Ninety seven are Holocaust survivors and they were a dwindling generation we should cherish them while they're here\nAnd the notion of somebody surviving that time when we had a global force in the Nazis who's goals including the eradication of the Jews\nTo defeat the third Reich to win World War two\nTo ... see decades of further one would hope enlightenment a surround the world\nAnd to have that horror be led increasingly distant memory but a memory we keep alive there's a reason those words never forget are so important never never\nForget it's not like this was thousands of years ago with all kinds of brutality were common\nIt's not like it was the rushing in time and you know a few centuries ago the kind of world gave birth thank God to the United states of America this is when this was this was the thirties and forties for crying out loud we're people walking around alive who who were ...\nTeenagers and young adults from that time and this this this wonderful woman was one of them for her to survive all of this only to take a bullet in the safety of her synagogue in in in Pittsburgh in October of twenty Eighteen are you kidding me\nWell no we're uh we're ... we're not kidding [noise]\nThere are people who are this twisted there is hatred there is anti Semitism there is racism and massage any and all of these these behaviors that are a ... that that are the devil at work\nIn our lives [noise] uh how many such people are there I don't know if it's not many at all but it doesn't take many this only took one\nI I Am not comforted by the fact that it's a tiny sliver of humanity that that dives to this death but the fact that they want us to many defected to any human being taken ... view this kind of nonsense about about the Jews I mean any\nType of hatred makes more or less sense than than the other there's some people who hate other people you know because of skin color or others who have other people because of religion others who have other people for a wide\nVariety of reasons and ... and ... and it's pathetic and\nAll good people unite a segment where he talked a lot about division in unity all good people unite to to mourn\nTo lift up these people these victims these beautiful souls in that Senate God we lift them up we celebrate the they're welcoming into the arms of a loving God\nAnd we keep their families and that community there in squirrel hill and all of Pittsburgh we keep them in our thoughts and prayers and and our our best thoughts as we move forward as we do move forward it is time to take a look at the sorry tawdry bottom feeding\nThat happened is people politicized this oh and you're going to hear some of that\nAnd then you're going to hear about some of that from me and I'd like to hear about some of that from you we may not agree on everything that's fine that's why we have phone lines eight eight eight nine seven one said Mark Davis in for Larry Eller very very glad you're here on this money's going to be an important show very blessed to be here with you right back\nAll through all the other\n\nThe answer [noise]\nThis morning and democratic candidates sizing up their chances to be the nominee to run against President Trump who was already said he'll run for reelection namely here twenty twenty leading the polls the early favorite according to democratic voters is the former vice president Joe Biden\nAbout the care of in\nThe thousands of people who are headed our way in order to intentionally violate our borders that a president who is vigilant about that\nHe somehow set the stage for this kind of a reaction I mean\nHow low will these folks go and and and I think the answer is in why is the author\nFirst thing that the president and deadly convincingly attacks surfing Pittsburgh and in the pie found the very first thing the media did was blamed the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous\nYou can't start putting the responsibility of individual on anybody but the individual who carries out the crime is delivered on the promises he snakes and if anything I think is sad I and I said the way that every single thing that comes out of the media and Ninety percent of what comes out of the immediate slouch negative about this president\nAmen amen and that's where our level of discourse has been dragged down\nAs you hear word afterward and page after page and speech after speech about how our our ability to get along just kind of been thrown into the toilet about how our level of discourse in civility is all kind of dashed against the rocks and observation that you certainly can make\nIs it because Trump won or because of a Trump tweet or because of some sharp elbows the salty thing that he might have said it some rally are you kidding me is everybody that stupid\nReason our discourse has been dragged into the muck is the reaction of people who hate him the reaction of people who cannot handle that he won the media have have been biased for as long as many of us have been alive\nAnd this this is nothing new\nBut the level of hatred that's how you know the change is real by the way\nThe level of vitriol the level of venom when you have an entire dominant media culture walking around saying the president is racist the president is a hater\nOut in the

obviously it's harder for just one idiot to to disrupt that but usually there's kind of a peer pressure that kicks in where even somebody as a the the is there in the mood to make that moment about

nobody's getting along with any by all of that is a lie all of that is a lot\nOf what is going on right now is there is heightened attention to the misbehavior of some\nBecause there is a media culture really interested in a bit diverting your attention to it so that they can say look at that guy look at that ... look at that media post look at bat or tweet look at that person doing this saying this in some corner of the public square\nAnd if it's a hateful terrible thing the reason they attract attention to it and want to attract your attention to it is so that they can blame

well would you look and I've got a cheetah queued up ready to go Sarah Sanders a wonderful moving moment then into the um and then into the jackals questioning or about why it's all Trump's fault\nBut I'm Sorry I I just I've got a shoe on something and you're ready or the beginning because I'm just I've just absorb is myself\nAnd look I I don't\nI don't really care what is in Shepard Smith brain I often hear even less about what's what comes out of his mouth but at Fox News you have to know something and and I don't know what the deal is is there is there a a a a turnover in either the leadership change or a change of flavor\nIt but because I mean Hannity still handling the addition of shows like Laura Ingraham the magnificent of of of Brett Baer doing special report\nOr Tucker Carlson is just a star and and I just love it love him\nAnd it's not like I necessarily need all my conservative shows\nTo have exactly the same take because even as conservatives as Republicans ... there are there are shades and nuances and ... and things that we we don't all we don't walk in lockstep like Democrats do I envy them at some time but but we don't\nBut what am I leading up to here\nI I just I Need you to absorb a minute and a fraction here of of shepherd Smith\nNow that this is ... it's funny listen they're they're the opinion shows and there are the news shows\nBut look there they're all ... ... maybe ... the news he is show that Fox does is special report with Brett Baer where you basically get a straight dose of news and then a panel of people of a wide variety of views who discuss it in that great\nHead of the conservative opinion show Laura Ingraham conservative opinion Joe Tucker Carlson conservative opinion show more than the gallon planet more more straight and and less of of of her opinions and it's great and they're all great what the hell is that in that our was Shepard Smith just what is that\nYou got that starship enterprise set may cover breaking news and and ...\nIs a talented man he is a compelling broadcaster\nWhat in the world compels him to do list today\nThe U.S will deploy some five thousand proof to the southern border as early tomorrow as thousands of migrants make their way north from Mexico\nThe migrants according to Fox News reporting are more than two months away\nWith any of them actually come here [noise]\nBut tomorrow is one week\nWhich is what all of this is about\nNo one's coming to get you there's nothing at all to worry about\nReally\nNow obviously look what I Do for a living everyone's entitled to an opinion obviously\nThis is a mockery of Americans not all of them necessarily conservative most of them probably aren't that right there was a mockery of you\nIf you think thousands of people pouring across the border is a bad idea I don't expect that they're going to set up a you know and MS Thirteen headquarters next door to my house I don't expect that but you know a hundred thousand of them will come pouring across the border like some remake of World War Z\nBut I Do expect\nThat if we don't make a strong message that this caravan will come and as soon as successful in breaching our borders been others will follow\nAnd I do not need weasel lectures from the likes of shepherd Smith is about how my concerns are are somehow silly is titled you he\nAbsolutely is I Would expect it from from psycho pads like Lawrence O'Donnell and and from finger wagging scolds like Rachel Maddow I Would expect it from that\nAnd again and and I just went I I don't need Fox News to be a cheat\nYou know which we all ... for for just the same exact echo chamber news every day I I I liked diversity of opinion I like 'em but they they get they give us a show they give it a sinking show every day to insult the Fox news base\nAnd I just want you to know it ain't by accident is intentional they know he's doing it and they wanted him to do it why you'd have to ask them okay let's see here [laughter] ... let me call\nIn here and there was a break come back and you'll hear Sarah Sanders in the media jackals born after ... after we were in LA rich hey Mark Davis in for Larry welcome how are you [noise]\n[noise] Hi thank you very well my art or whatever but it might mean that can do or anybody listening to might go for it for me one year old I watch the news and it's actually when I catch a credit score I get so mad I have to shut off the TV and I have to go meditate\nBecause I'm not going to have my wife understand and I felt that\nIt may get mad and I got to the people and they get mad I have a real question here who created this credit score who voted all these guys didn't pay them but then and then how do they ever get to say they represent may\nVary that I Know that they and they and they know it and they don't care not and and I mean they're not supposed to quote unquote represent us in the way that elected officials do they are supposed to cover news in an unbiased and professionally honest\nAnd corrupted matter and the media have not done that successfully in at least a couple of generations and the ...\nOr so have you not hurt Americans want to know [laughter] we ... we represent the American popular hello now\n... and it's an ... rich Wheldon thank you I mean\nThere are ... opinion shows how lovely opinion shows the conservative opinion shows tend to show up on Fox obviously the liberal opinion shows I mean ... I mean listen I just took a little ... both Donald and mad Allen Chris Matthews and that whole coven and\nAnd and and and ... and in that\nTotal head case Joe Scarborough but did they get to be over there on MSNBC and stoke the Trump painting fire of their viewer base of course they do of course they do when it's a free country and and there's a marketplace out there and\nAnd they've got X number of viewers and Fox has X number of viewers and and the trolls over on CNN have X number of viewers and they're all trying to slice of pie and get as many folks who they can sell advertising and make a buck good for them that's all just fine\nBut remember what reporting used to be\nAll share a secret what do you draw close to the radio real quick\nI have\nA journalism degree\nPull up I Know I Know I Do University of Maryland Nineteen Seventy nine College of journalism proud of it\nAnd I was saving somebody's ... I went and uh and and did radio news reporting in Charleston West Virginia soon to elect Senator Patrick Morrisey or it had a blast my first two years I went to Jacksonville, Florida did some reporting before the talk show thing but it drops in my lap\nAnd I guess that's worked out well for everybody but when I was a reporter when I was studying journalism everything was drilled into us even in the People's Republic of Maryland was objectivity present both sides to try to keep your own opinions out of your stories where in the world did that go [noise]\nAlready here's where I'm going to go out for a second let you uh catch a couple of messages and come back and the message of Sarah Sanders is very moving in the press briefing and\nThen you'll ah watch the wolves come after her there after right here on the Larry Elder show Mark Davis in today in your eye back\nAll through all that [noise]\nYou're listening to the Larry Elder show am eight Seventy the answer\nThe question at the time between now\nGoing against you know\nLike crazy accusing the president of being a liar and you know a daily occurrence of the mainstream media itself they have a new name caller\nTo be the president is leaving a bunch of\nIs I Can't see for themselves so mainstream media sees some based so it's actually one of the country even find out how\nFound those known that to bring our country together and certainly focus on some of the things that all of that can support and all of us are kicking down as well but\nHe's also harshly attack some of the various people received as pipe bombs in this morning suggesting that the news media is responsible for\nThat is you do that when the cameras was somebody who was the Trump rallies this is somebody ought to van covered with a\nA tax on the media and praise for for the president on either the shooter in Pittsburgh and somebody who was\nWith so much time talking about why is he out there\nWho say training I country why is he out their first\nThing that the president didn't condemn the attacks in Pittsburgh and and the pipe bombs the very first thing the media did would blame the president and make him responsible for the ... year\nAccent is outrageous that that would be the very first reaction so many people on top of the country I'm\nNot finished the only person responsible for carrying out either these heinous acts were
