George Clinton was played in helping to orchestrate the so called nuts or slap strategy was used to malign women like Jennifer Flowers\nWho's called a saloon singer Paula Jones drag hundred dollars to a trailer park no telling what you're going to get [noise]\n\nWhen he to Broderick selected she was raped by Bill Clinton until we got the electric was threatened by Hillary\nWe're going to talk to Larry claiming about the role that Mr Clinton let's play because\nOf the sanctimonious way he interviewed Sarah Sanders and Sarah Sanders has graced not to bring up his behavior during the Clinton years\nLet's let him tell his side of the story before we allow allegations to determine hasn't\nSeen though that the president has already reached a judgment about their stories and there does seem to be a pattern here when Roy Moore is accused from Bill O'Reilly is accused when Roger ales is accused when Rob Porter is accused and that one very Kevin always accuse the president consistently every single time takes the side of the math you\nKnow it's interesting that you say that it's not a lot of Democrats that like to ignore Keith Ellison and Cory Booker they love to fight and champion women until they disagree with the Al Franken lost his job in the Senate\nAs I said Sara had too much class to mention Mr putting up speak Hebrew back in Nineteen Ninety to resist it\nThey'll go to the Clinton has a character problem but I take it the ... and has no ... is that it only well let me he is\nNot the night that he is engaged in Myrtle infidelity is not as as soon as he had problems and is that right and he uh he has talked about the draft him to some people it's a character brother Bill Clinton's\nPasses character tests throughout his life and throughout this campaign and these two senators commitments to real fights and what isn't doing this campaign is focused on this point to the American people on the jobs and education that's what the American people care about\nThey want to move into the future they don't want to be devoted by side issues they're not going to lead Republican attack machine diverse that was then and this is now\nAnd a number of other Democrats should have that same type of sprint they look to present that is a question every\nSingle time the president is taking the side of the man against women user's trip isn't\nThat an amazingly annoying can we go back again Nineteen Ninety two George putting up a list\nOf names and just I can send your facts names addresses phone numbers of us all year and a fair with\nThis is from the documentary war room he's talking to a reporter who's calling him about an allegation that Bill Clinton had an affair\nWouldn't make a true it is completely\nIf he went on the radio\nAnd it's at the Clinton is the father of eligible black child he would be laughed at what they get crazy I guarantee you if you do this in other words and Democrats see\nNow you're talking to a reporter and you're saying if you report this you'll never worked in democratic politics again what is a reporter doing working in a democratic politics you're crazy\nI guarantee you if you do this and that would probably say that\nYou were threatening the people that do what you do right now isn't it ironic\nYou don't want to say a matter of wanting to be embarrassed for the national people will think throwing library or what do you believe you\nThis is again George Clinton was Nineteen Ninety two threatening a reporter who had apparently a story on Bill Clinton Governor Bill Clinton\nAnd people will think is\nThe alternative is don't do it cause any some temporary and people who tomorrow I'm going to matter of\nFact and you have a campaign handled in a difficult time something right or wrong\nAnd that was then this is now and in this case the president knows Brett Kavanaugh he's heard his story there hasn't been a shred of evidence ... the other individual stories and there's been a lot of individuals that have come forward and talked about Brett Kavanaugh that they know\nAnd they're confident that these things that happened final question was the present health is\nAll right\nJulie sweating it because the one who claim she observed Kevin up dissipating in a gang rape or being near a gang rape or she says she herself so she was victimized but can't say whether or not a Kevin I was one of those who assaulted her\nCan you tell me what happened is comfortable telling us what happened to me\nIs probably the most horrendous awful thing that could happen to any given day my body was violated [noise]\nMy soul is broken why I was not able to have somebody to stop and I said no stop [noise] you know I felt like somebody took me and basically said you're worthless there's\nNothing to us who are disposable I was\nAt a party and I remember that I started not to feel very well and next thing I Know I was shoved into a room and I'm having my clothes torn some different rock show um [noise] I was touched everywhere\nI was physically assaulted\nIn every way you could possibly physically assault on that it was horrible I had no way to fend them off\nWe know what I'm going to ask everyone is wondering if one of those people was that cat I\nCannot specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me but before\nThis happened to me at that party I saw that catalog there I saw mark judge there and they were hanging about the area where I started to feel disoriented and were\nThree wives were the other boys were hanging out and laughing I could share them laughing laugh at the very hard for me to talk about that but it's important that somebody says something because if Brett Kavanaugh\nWas one of those people that did this to me there is no way in the world that he should get scot free on this and that he should be a Supreme Court just\nThink ... if he died I there's this whole world\nShe said that she saw him standing by the door or ... or the\nPunch container is I don't know what he did that I saw him by them\nIn her declaration sweat Nick also wrote I also witnessed efforts by mark judge Brett Kavanaugh and\nOthers to cause and girls to the ... disoriented so they could then be gang raped in aside rumor bedroom by train as numerous boys I have a ... recollection of seen boys lined up outside rooms at\nMany of these parties waiting for their turn with a girl inside the room these boys included mark judge and Brett Kavanaugh what did\nSay that well it's so what happened\nHappened to me I didn't put two inches to gather\nThe boys standing outside of rooms congregated together sort of like an outlet and I didn't know what was that crank out that I Would pay them laughing a lot of laughing I'm falling in line outside or anything like wind definitely huddled by doors and I didn't understand what it could possibly be\nAnd you're declaration you describe that cabin on his friend mark judge standing outside seen them stand outside the door that\nOther voice [noise] and you're suggesting that hindsight things with Saddam Hussein I Would say [noise]\nI I it's just too coincidental\nNow here's what NBC's Kate Snow said about the things that's what makes it on camera there were different from her written statement\nBut we want to do here is a way out all that she sat her story our reporting we want to be very transparent because these are very serious allegations Kavanaugh\nHas called joy sweating story now says as far as the president today question her credibility and NBC News for the record has not been able to independently verify her class there oh\nOur phones that she told us on camera that differ from her written will say oh we've been trying independently to reach out to anyone who are hanging parties which was sweating like I'm Brett Kavanaugh and we've asked for her attorney for names so far we've not found her liver fat she's also unclear\nAbout when she first decided\nOh hey well as just Tuesday we have a whole week we come back Mary claiming what role did Georgia not play him aligning they choose a Bill Clinton and how they're have effect ammonia is right now I'm Leo is only town\nHe came into that position on shape and the shovel insulted the judge which was about ... the legal opinion is that the ... the nine hundred Republicans and others are Stephanopoulos\nWere caught by the

how could you leave this guy on the air when he's now a certified liar and of course now you know he's a multi millionaire he's riding high ABC\nAnd now he feels a duty bound to take a shot at the president simply because he defended judge Kavanaugh\nLarry claiming a you said you had\nA stepping off a cliff under deposition twice did he ever admit under oath to doing some of the things that you claim it's done\nWell I had a very good memory you know the the favorite phrase of the Clinton people was\nI had no specific regular recollection is our number is something I Can't remember now ... on the front of the ... justice so no he wouldn't have the right thing and like I said he he was found to light on\nWell given the fact that he won't admit to anything how do you know that he himself has done these things how do you put his fingerprints on these things\nHappen widely reported him in Reno because actually he he wrote a book called the war room which became a documentary where in that book he admitted to working recovery quick tend to address talked alligator by your characters\nBut Bill Clinton's accuses the women that I represent now ironically Laurie in today's world with the ... are out of control\nCurrently denying an allegation to say that you think someone is that correct It's got to look right now because he denied that he sexually harassed any women\nHe's very ... to
