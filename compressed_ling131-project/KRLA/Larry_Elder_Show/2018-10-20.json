{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "Your reasoning the brain that the good lord gave you\nAs you evaluate this story that is presented to you that the FBI and the Obama administration said Carter Page was an agent of the Russian government and has been for years and worked on behalf of the Kremlin and Vladimir prudent to colluded with Donald Trump to meddle in the twenties sixteen presidential election as they say that\n[noise] understand to facts number one to this day no one has charged Carter Page with anything not James Comey not Loretta Lynch\nNot Jeff Sessions not Rod Rosenstein no one at the federal\nLevel no one of the local level no one at the state level\nQuarter page has not been charged with a crime of any kind and they have sort of veiled every inch of his whole life\nFor almost two years they've got everything on him no charges number one so so think about that per minute and then think about this if you're Carter Page\nAnd you are an agent of the Russian government and you did commit near treasonous acts\nBy colluding with the Trump campaign and let him recruiting scrambling to alter our presidential election at twenty sixteen if\nIf that were true why would you file a lawsuit why would you file a defamation lawsuit\nAgainst the DNC because you see the perfect affect the DNC can defend themselves and get out of this lawsuit\nWith one very simple strategy it's only defamation if it isn't true\nSo all they got to do is proof that Carter Page is in fact an agent of the Russian government and if you're Carter Page why would you invite that\nWhy would you open yourself up to discovery why would you open yourself up to a full court well funded and you know there's gonna be a lot of money funding their defense all well funded investigation into you\nIf you truly are an agent of the Russian government\nWhy would you do that would you do that\nAnd I again I I he could be an agent of the Russian government Carter Page and James Comey and Peter Struck in Andrew McCabe will read a lunch and and the whole team over there during the Obama administration\nWho ordered this investigation this unprecedented spying on an American citizen who was connected with the presidential campaign during a presidential election and then oh so much of it got leaked to the press shocking how much of it got leaked to the press they could all be true\nIn there with the angels right now and how pure they acted in behaved and they they were just defending our nation against a foreign attack a former of foreign cyber attack from Russia with their with their agent Carter page that that could all be trip I don't know\nBut I'm using my brain I'm thinking it through logically and I'm thinking if it were true I'm thinking the last thing that I Do if I were Carter Page is what he did this week\nRight down one less thing\nIf it were true think about it for a minute the last person who wants this to be discovered is not even Carter Page it's Latimer ...\nSo that so since you're still using that brain I Want you to think about something what has happened to people historically who had gone against the wishes of Vladimir ...\n...\nDo you think ... if if he is a spy for ... you think who wants to that's out there\n\nSo either Carter Page is a spy and he's going to end up with a bullet\nIn his head where he could very well be assisting in exposing the biggest political scandal in American history\nJust to provide I'm wary of counter it's the market within a month\nAm an age of ... no ...\nHave you ever thought about the word education well it means to lead forth\nThe word fourth raises another question which way is fourth\nHow do you know you're going in the right direction easy answer is it just depends on which way you want to go well my friend Dr Larry aren't president of Hillsdale College says young people almost always say that and that they've been taught to say that but you and I both know that's the wrong answer let me tell you about a place that leads fourth\nHillsdale College had Hillsdale they understand that true education means pursuing the highest answer to that question which way is fourth he'll sell students are challenged to discover the right way forth by reading the greatest books by the greatest minds in history\nAnd they learn the meaning of the three ultimate unrelated things they good the true and the beautiful and I encourage all of you all of my listeners to learn more about this remarkable institution at living for Hillsdale dot com that's L.
