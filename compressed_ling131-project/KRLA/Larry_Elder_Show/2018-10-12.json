one said this is what happens when negroes don't read now calling a black person in equal in the year twenty Eighteen is a slur\nAnd I guess he's black commentators believe they can get away with it because a lot of white people don't realize calling a black person the negro in twenty Eighteen is a it's a it's offensive\nIt's something if you say when you want to put somebody down\nBecause that's what they're doing the getting away with this victory left wing bigotry\nAnd Kanye West says he grew up without a father\nAnd told a President Trump today in the oval office how much that bothered

close all the other stuff people talk about all this other nonsense far and away and you have somebody calling us you can call them uneducated you can call him a not terribly literate call them what you want at least he gets the big picture\nHe also understands that there's a connection between the welfare state and the demise of the family\nMy friend Walter Williams and Thomas all have written about the black family after slavery\nA black kid was more likely during slavery to be raised under a roof or the biological mother and biological father them today and after slavery because\nFor years it was illegal for slaves to marry it was a huge uptick in Mary and if you look at census reports Eighteen Ninety Nineteen hundred Nineteen ten a black child was slightly more likely\nTo be brought into the world with a biological mother and a biological dad under the same roof than a white kid more likely and then along comes the welfare state and dependency and the LA Times\n... for people to non poor people questions about welfare in about dependency they asked the question to Nineteen eighty five they asked him again or in twenty sixteen\nDo you believe welfare creates dependency or do you believe it is a stepping stone to get you on your own two feet\nAnd they asked poor people in non poor people those questions forty one percent of people living below the level of poverty responded welfare creates dependency and forty one percent felt that it gave you a stepping stone or to get on your own two feet so as many poor people felt that welfare I was harmful\nAs felt that it was helpful\nSo don't you think maybe just maybe that's worth looking at\nBest a topic worthy of discussion is many poor people think that welfare as bad as they can be good and about eight percent or so have no idea that don't have an opinion one way or the other\nThat is a boatload of people on welfare who believe that it's created dependency and that's what Kanye West was talking about you don't think it's worth having the conversation of course you don't know if you're on the left because you look into the mirror and say oh my goodness what have I done to be stabilized families to change value is the change incentives\nMy dad used to many people are motivated by two things promised again in fear of loss you monkey around with that with welfare you've destroyed human

just led to than on the big white people Hama at least most of them come\nAnd go for a guy I think he's a racist\nBowl people of Spain using each other for their own cause but you may\nNot necessarily be shocked to find out\nI mean I'd be shocked to find out if people that were involved in politics in marketing use each other for their own benefit when did that ever happened before I mean I look I I think these two guys Trump and tiny I Do have something in common and that\nThey are both marketers they're both promoters and I think maybe that's what they see in each other they both think they'd trends in their industries they both think they transcend\nPolitics so maybe they have a connection over that I don't know of anything except\nThat there's got to come out of this but I Know this President Trump has advisors who say sir or we have a very low approval rating among African Americans what are we going to do about it so the\nOnly sensible analysis in the last four minutes\nThey go out and they talk about the low unemployment which he did you played that clip you got a very a well known African American entertainer top of his industry wants to come and stand with you and talk about issues you're going to do that of course the president's going to take these meetings any president would take this meeting or under the circumstances of Trump's been handed ...\nWhat does it say that in a panel of four three being black the only one who didn't\nDemean Kanye West is the white Republican\nPoint that um oh I don't know what can the because we know that we are very few people to like someone I think\n\nYou have a I Would say that they will fare for the reason why a lot of black people and I say you know first of all a limit to a lot of jobs\nOr by now we see all these sorts of problems so we've got a thousands of ah a voter registration so you know the the the envy reported last month at a big twenty three thousand voter registration errors resulting from\nWhatever they they blame it on other Fifteen hundred ballots other potentially a mistakenly registered by the DMV or the DMV insists that no illegal or legal immigrants as I've gotten them but it looks like some potentially some non citizens\nThat are gotten these these ballots send them to the LA Times they'll get a software that that there may have been Seventy seven thousand voter records that were misreported\nSaturday if that was always gives me Seventy seven thousand\nSeventy seven thousand that were misreported to the DMV are some cases allowing people to get valid in other cases um the envy seems to inexplicably have changed the party registration of some voters\nSo we've just we've just got a total mad\nAnd uh you know it's become it's a big scandal that even the Democratic controlled California is somewhat of a scandal\nOr you know again the DMV insists that are no illegal residents voted or whatever but you know it's really hard to uh it's really hard to trust trust what they're doing and this comes against the backdrop of you know with the ... id law\nWhich is the federal law mandating you know new driver's license is that where people provide a you know a information so that the security on airplanes\nWe've got these enormous backlogs\nAnd the DMV had these huge commercial license backlogs of the drivers would go through school they get they get a job and then it would take months for them to get a commercial license just because the DMV process so how do you allow these folks\nTo be in control of a voter records and then the law and it was passed in two thousand and Fifteen one of the big problems with um you know it had some amendments to it um\nWhere you're not a lot where really limited the ability of the secretary of state to check out the the immigration status of the of the person uh you know who who is being registered and in the law said if a person as a quote if a person who is eligible to vote becomes registered to vote by operation of the California or new voter motor voter program\nThat person's registration shopping presumed to have been affected with official authorization and not the fault of that person so if you accidentally get\nRegistered and you're not eligible to be registered to vote it's presumed that it's not your fault so it's just we're just looking for trouble right\nSteven Greenhouse gases article surprised DMV may have registered non citizen voters Steven I was not in favor of illegal aliens getting driver's licenses and I was called a racist you are in favor of illegal aliens giving drivers' licenses and you're called a racist so I'm not quite sure what\nThe right out of the other libertarians ... and I'm not you know my views on immigration are really quite you know quite a courts I lean towards bloody as many people and that that's possible uh provided they followed the rules so I'm not exactly you know some kind of\nImmigration restriction is done yeah I I get it to we all get it right\nNow uh again if somebody who's an illegal alien inadvertently gets registered to vote and he or she votes what happens to that person\nWell according to the law nothing nothing zoom that to ... and less and less I guess you'd have to prove that they get so will fully ah but you know basically when I asked the motor voter laws and I am against those in general\nBecause like if you can't go through the trouble of of the minor process of registering that maybe you're not uninformed voter and maybe you're not to be voting ... and the state the state's low turnout we're very low turnout it's caused by a lot of things that have ...\nMaybe it's the fact that the fact that they're there to ... vote in which case I'd rather they not vote Steven gotta go thank\nLarry we'll be right back
