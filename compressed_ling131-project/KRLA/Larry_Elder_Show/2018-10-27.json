{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "That they can put together and then when you try to\nBuckle down on mosques and try to stop 'em in the next thing you know you're watching hardly run around the because he just kept the ball or on a path so this off as has found its rhythm right now but I still think the key is to not let moss have a huge game\nWell I mean if you have that market in a big football game that's going to bring up a dairy picket quitting legged that safety position and have to stop him and then all of a sudden they Tyler honey is running his own read you can keep the ball and go outside and once again\nNow everybody else is going to come up and then Troy Taylor they often the coordinator for Utah is so good then finding one on one match us especially match up for their in his favorite at the wide receiver position and you have a safety point of Utah wide receiver or\nYou know Britain copies in in one on one coverage and that's where it Tyler hunted gonna go he's going to attack that one on one covered so yeah your number one concern to stop and Martha let him get rolling and then also make hardly hardly a pocket passer ... I mean make 'em stay in the pocket\nAnd be like your you know and I felt pocket passer I Know that's hard to do but when you let him get outside and you have that run pass off and most of them is going to run to the truth\nBut you do want that if you're a defense I mean he could really struck a defense in different ways so make him a thriller\nMad I Want you when I'm when I'm done right here to break into your book and talk about UCLA secondary because you know it it's been hard because you and I both are fans of matters and for whatever reason this year there's been some games where he's taught us\nSit a focal point of the other teams passing game where there's been a couple of players and I might tear down the field watching these Everytime inmates got great coverage she's right there and the guy just catches the ball over the top or you know sometimes when you're playing David back you're you're doing what you're supposed to be doing and guys just make place it happens all the time but when they went down\nAre starting to step up there's some guys that are getting in the game right now in the secondary that are really good young players\nYou know I mean you player in Rogers he's going to get his and we're doing with Nate matters is he's playing the toughest guy man I'm In coverage and it's usually that slot receiver but you know ... even the coordinator he knows what he has been better so\nYeah you managed to get more attention because that office is going to try and get that ball to their best wide receiver and you know there's a lot of battles that matters is winning but I still like\nThe odds in terms of matters plan on their best guy and see what seasonal or see what happens and eight minutes we'll be back for this football game which is really good news for UCLA and if UCLA\nUh gets in trouble and they can't stop jak moss and that run again gets going there's going to be a lot of Bob Mann coverage and the second\nYear and that's why it's so important to come back at a couple of the other players that have been getting some action that have done a good job at Shaw ... blaylock Jay shock this is a young players blaylock can bring it bring it saying it's so you know we talk about picket we've talked about quitting lake we've talked about ... and ... there's two players right that they're pretty darn good\nAllies you gave a little better and soft coverage to impress man out here Sean pointed extra is really good but he had his first pick last week you know and the other side of the ball UCLA offensively it's important to get first down I mean this Utah defense they only give up sixteen first down\nAn entire football game and you cannot give opportunities opportunity to the Utah often in terms of\nGoing three in out going three now you need to get first down first down for more important in scores and I know everyone was like no I take a score but it really is I mean you have to stay on the field and have some long drives to have any success against Utah\nWe all want points ... but I kind of agree with you we've seen it too much over\nUm over to law that there are so three announced that happened there was one of the knocks on no one was only when he was off as a coordinator skirt really quick and they would have some good job when you played a team though that was like a staffordshire back then the organs of the world\nThat just didn't have enough there was too many places where it was one two three pie and they were on the field too much in the by the time you got to the fourth quarter you know even it gets to Utah to see you can't beat down here ... tired so for me\nI Love the long dry talking I'll go back to the Washington game on I'm going to go back to the second half even though those were quicker drives last week when will sleep state was playing quarterback than they were official payers go right down the field\nAnd that's one of the keys to offensively is to have a quick passing game so that are a Utah defense can't tee off I Will say that it's important to a year to see a lot of listen from Utah or from the corners of safety they just bring everybody at the Lawrence scrimmage\nHave some quick passes and trying to expose the man coverage or you're an episode of all over the middle of the field but I don't think you want to take long before you hit that red button and that red button meaning of banning the running game I mean this is talk defense\nIs is the best in the business in college football an soften the run and uh you know if it's not going to work I mean start getting a running back to the flat you know out over the middle check release you know do different ways or create different ways to get the ball to you're running back to science running in between the tackle\nIt's funny that you said that cause Joshua Kelly has been such an integral part of everything that you see all he's doing you know I Know that ... but but what I'm getting at\nIs is is a game and it might be where the passage sets up the run I mean even in even in Arizona game you certainly wasn't running the ball as well at the beginning of by the end of the game though they started to wear down Arizona now this Utah defense does not Arizona\nVery better defense but I still think it can happen I think like you said we'll say it again you talked about blitz is what I think it's hard when you're young quarterback\nIs seeing a corner but seeing it will end and during times around us it was getting better at that stage in the game for a long time is put into big time games and it's really really good teams so he's seen a lot so hopefully\nMichigan State bring some corner of Lake Michigan and Ohio is that we actually had a plane and the Big Ten you face a big difference is so I think I'm a moment like this he's going to looking to be honest with you Utah historically has played more of a big tent type of style football they're kind of going to beat you up a little bit so\nIt'll be interesting to see if if we can pick that up and you and I both know this what seems I Try to bring pressure\nAnd you can get it out the receivers and then it's going to be key because we talk we'll talk about this more but run after contact Joshua Kelly's been really good at ... yards after it gets hit for most of the receiver is not as much they're getting tackled and they pretty much just fall down\nGot to make somebody mess you've got to make a big play if one guy tried to tackle you may can't be raw\nTaylor Wilson is going to play an important part of the football game because of the safety is two of the better safety's besides\nWashington Taylor rap but in Joe Joe mcentire a Macintosh a marquee flair and core of large\nThey are really good and they get up on that line of scrimmage you're gonna have to have a vertical passing game in order to push them back off the line of scrimmage him make them respect the passing game and not get up and stop the wrong guy\nThe deep track a threat\nSo seems like that's what they've been trying to do I know the ... and you got to play did you got ahead of the post to have\nTo because like you said that everybody's coming to say you know so funny I say I'm coaching my by my kids' teams and ... actually both of our kids to play the championship game tomorrow which is perfect for us we have a fighting game we get to see our boys play but not coaching my my quarterback quarterback coal and he's got picked strong arm and\nHe just for whatever reason we've had so many teams in the middle of the feel why open and I'm like oh you have\nTo do is put it up and let him run to put it up and let him onto it and we saw that was ... last week was a little bit\nDarker color and blackface came up because making county was fired\nFor saying she didn't know it was inappropriate to wear black face for Halloween or whatever the discussion was about can you say double standard see what the left does whatever they do is okay sports plane away\nBut whenever a President Trump does even when he doesn't do he's guilty scene you gotta you gotta understand if that's what it's all about these days we are in a big shot\nUgly bubble and let's go to Richard in Louisville, Kentucky you run with mark\nAnd mark Maguire won't all week long call going to move on them called the ... election coming up we'll do\nNot believe the mole the mole the mole or global from one end quote unquote ... got about a ... who clearly ... whom or go home called Google government on a whole lot of ... by law we will no lie about\nAlmost call them ... going to call ... about ... ... ... or ... or ... or ... and also ...\n... by ... we were going to call on bronco bomb a lot of those ... ... ... ...\nWhat were the calls ... on a local call ... ... ... a little run by former calls him alone\nWon't go mow the lawn among all move on to the polls on ... boat who will ... will walk the walk ... ... ... ... will go on the job well\nFlorida Man was arrested and is in custody after being charged on friday Don Was sending what looks like anywhere between Thirteen to Fifteen explosive devices at least so far to critics of president Donald Trump in what would they days along ...\nInflaming it pretty polarized United States everybody seems to be at each other's throats the person ... arrested on friday with Cesar ... he's fifty six of adventure up in Florida who has a criminal past\nHe has ties to New York he was arrested outside of a strip mall actually in an auto zone parking lot in a van that was covered with pro Trump stickers and now done it is the media's task\nTo try to give us the meaning behind each and every one\nThey really have it's been interesting to see the way that the media is analyzing uh this individual who for all intents and purposes ... is a Trump or you know we support was at Trump rallies CNN dug into their archives they probably had to review Jennifer\nNo less than a hundred thousand hours of video in order to find one video\nFrom February of two thousand Seventeen\nThat had ... or ... at it and holding up something that looks very much like the details that CNN has spent most of the day individually dissecting a ... for the benefit of their viewers in order to build their case that\nThis is the fruit of Donald Trump's presidency and Donald Trump\nThe candidate well law this guy's user say Iraq has that been charged with five federal crimes there was a big press conference\nOn friday afternoon attorney general Jeff Sessions was their FBI Director Christopher Wray was there and others and this has resulted in five federal crimes including mailing of explosives and threats against former presidents if he is put on trial and if he is convicted he could face up to forty eight years in prison\nAnd um this is being called domestic terrorism I think by pretty much everybody on both sides of the aisle\nAnd President Trump in for his part congratulated the swift effort of law enforcement who really were able to crack this case said at least it seems on the outside relatively quickly here's a bit of President Trump who was at the White House talking to a group of young college students taking law enforcement I've\nJust concluded a briefing with the department of justice following the apprehension of the suspect\nI Want to applaud the FBI Secret Service department of justice the U.S attorney's office for the southern district of New York the N. Y. P. D. at all law enforcement throughout the entire country credible partners these people at work so hard\nAnd to have done it so quickly it's looking like a a you're looking it's a needle in a haystack how do you do this so quickly they've done an incredible incredible job but I Want to congratulate him and\nGet it really was a very quick apprehension and I think that's exactly what we're hearing from FBI forensic experts were saying that it's very unusual to have a this many unexploded devices with the remnants of what would be fingerprints DNA\nAnd other markers on the in the construction of the device an important factor was DNA on at least one of the packages that helped investigators a dentist by\nA shack as our ... we re pronouncing that I think it's sad that show out and yeah that's how I've been saying as a white oh see as a suspect investors investigators were also used his cell phone to track him and\nUh they're now saying that he was initially somewhat cooperative after his arrest telling investigators that the pipe bombs\nWouldn't have hurt anybody and that he didn't want to hurt anybody according to a law enforcement officials he's now got an attorney and is the questioning has ended as attorneys will five of the Thirteen packages meal we're about it through a single U.S Postal up processing center\nIn open locked up Florida according to a criminal complaint that was available to the media and as recently as Wednesday he had posted a tweet that was critical of billionaire investor philanthropist George Soros\nFormer president Brock Obama and others according to the complaint to this guy was activism as as recently as yesterday on social media accounts\nAnd he was he is also a a body builder we know that he was living in his van according to law enforcement he had been kicked out of his parents' home and it was living there we don't know if his wedding in that parking lot I Know what the lord I how come they're living at it on his own\nOh you do man with a lot of beautiful stickers on them\nHe uh he definitely has a story to tell it we don't know how he was how he came up with this idea if he had help to those types of connections are still being\nExplored at by law enforcement but certainly there is something here he said he didn't want to hurt anyone his lawyers said that to this is a former lawyer not his current lawyer said that he was one of the nicest guys he ever met and he didn't even know he liked politics so there's a lot going on here President Trump said\nThat to this group earlier today these group of people at the White House that she had her ... month for rent at someone in custody\nI Am plays to inform you that law enforcement has apprehended to suspect and taken him into custody\nCredible job by law for us we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation finds a person or persons responsible for these events\nIs terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country was struck did authorities despair no resources are expensive and finding those responsible and bringing them to swift and certain just\nWill prosecute them him her whoever it may be\nThe extent of the law\nFacebook on his part said that they're going to continue to ... uh you comb through his content route anything that praises or supports the bombing attempt for the suspect as soon as they are aware of it they've also taken down his social media accounts\nAnd they did they did that really quickly actually now attorney general Jeff Sessions with at this press conference on friday making the announcement that someone had been arrested and they use it as a as an opportunity to warn others who may be compelled to go down the same path\nBut this be a lesson to anyone regardless of their political beliefs that we will bring the full force of law\nAgainst anyone who attempts to use threats intimidation and outright violence to further antigen we will find you we prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law\nYou know there's an interesting part of what Jeff Sessions here and I think we need to zero in on it real quick\nWe will find do we prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law\n... you know Jennifer this sounds really really familiar why am I I I've heard this before wait I Know\nI don't know who you are or what you want what I Do a very particular set of skills quarter for very long career to mind for people like you know look\nYeah that was that it was it ... Liam Neeson I knew I had her as Jeff Sessions been watching his movies\nI don't know Jeff Sessions sounded like a big for that I Will find you I Will hunt you down if you pay [laughter] alright attorney general Jeff Sessions also asked about whether or not this guy looks to be a partisan was he acting because he was a fan of Trump didn't want it to make those Democrats pay you tell us when\nKnow and then uh what you buy in a way that he may have been a part of harsh and that would be a determined by the fact of the fall or non\nInteresting question from the media because I actually searched over a couple of different incidents are particularly the shooting at the D.C ball field that injured almost killed Steve's lease\nI searched a couple of those press conferences you know what I never found I never found a member of the media saying why do you think James Hodgkinson was targeting Republicans\nThis question I think really does reveal a ... the media's a you know hunger for this story and I think they're trying to capitalize on it especially\nYou know ... you know what what are we now hum of ten days before the midterms\nFBI Director Christopher Wray also talked about the devices that were used hit by this guy Caesar say Iraq\nWe can confirm that Thirteen Days were sent to various individuals cross country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe smallpox\nBattery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives and materials they give off sheet and energy or a reaction to heat shock for friction\nSo we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nThere are several churches that have been challenged recently about that very thing ah we have one in Marietta we have one in corona\nWhere they were literally threatened for their five oh one C. three status because they had a you know gotten a little too political according to their adversaries where does this stand today especially under the Trump Administration\nWell a great question because ah thirty days and the Trump Administration he gathered national a Christian faith based leaders from the from the U.S\nInto the White House and he literally said Donald Trump said by the way during my administration I Will not I want to repeat that I Will not be enforcing the Johnson Amendment in other words\nWhile Trump Trump is saying the pastor's of America hey go for it said speak it do it that's remarkable and then the second thing is is\nJust the Johnson in them and it's been around since Nineteen fifty four but we've only been threatened and it's never been prosecuted it's never been a successful oh look I'm hoping I Would like to see our church be challenged by that for this reason\nThere are law firms in line literally in line waiting for church to\nTruly be prosecuted on the Johnson Amendment so that it can go to the Supreme Court because everybody including our president believes that it's an unconstitutional law and so it needs to be removed and it needs to be challenged so I actually think that's good news\nTakes us to get their hands and critics I think to let this movement we talked about your participation with the California renewal project clearly there are some people who are saying that this is an attempt at nationalism there are things that are that are kind of post online how how do you answer that pastor jak\nYeah it's very simple because we know\nWe know why the American renewal project was formed I've worked with them for many many years and that's simply not the case it is made up of and founded by very very concerned a Bible believing evangelicals who listen now this is important\nWho believe in Jesus could come back at any moment for his church and well if you if you think that they want to get involved no the whole idea is because we believe that Jesus could come back we need to hurry up and get out the good news because\nHaving is our home um America is not heaven on earth we're not going to create a Christian nation we don't intend to do that is not going to happen it's not the right thing to do but we want to have the freedom of religion that our founding fathers that frankly began with those coming over the Mayflower\nBut they envisioned and we want to get back to what really made America great and it's not our economy it's not our industrial revolution that we went through its back to our nation's sun God first and that's why our founding documents\nSite God show so often and we're we just want to get back and I got to tell you the experiments are removing from court removing got from the public square removing them from schools\nHow was gone for us was gone so well the early Nineteen sixties it's not gone well\nAnd one of the most dangerous places to be an American since gods been kicked out of our culture is the public school and the mother's womb those the two most dangerous places to be for a young person in America and that's very tragic\nWhile I Wish we could spend much more time we're literally out of time with the pastor jak appreciate you so much for being with us

back in twenty Thirteen or he's been arrested as the main suspect\nIn these twelve pipe bombs had been delivered so far\nThere were two more devices delivered a this morning I tempted to deliver they were all you know intercepted or those who were going to Cory Booker a senator and James Clapper uh CNN contributor and former director of national intelligence to CNN again um the the so far this started on Monday\nWhen the pipe bomb at its Soros home or none of these have exploded no one has been injured but it has caused a lot of tears member the evacuation of the time we're talking about the significance that with the hotel with the office buildings with the apartment buildings with the grocery store shopping\nUm which CNN located there I mean the effect has caused hair\nEven if these devices were voting\nOr just weren't built correctly a and that would be a good thing that thankfully no one was injured there's no place for the star politics eleven days out from mid term elections certainly puts things into perspective\nUm but it does not mean we can't have vigorous debates and disagreements in our country or without resorting to that's his violence but\nTear which is what this is is that acts as a domestic terror and the tempted uh to to terrorize people and to get we condemn it to the fullest extent of should we have a name now a again of the suspect\nWe know the location in Florida sunrise implantation Florida up here's a vehicle was in one of those locations homeless and the other location a such a north of Miami kind of inland from Fort Lauderdale\nAnd uh and we don't know yet or if there were other people involved this is the suspect\nSo I get it may not be over the president is planning to address this that happens while we're live on the air we will certainly cover it I Want to take a your your comments or Nancy on Facebook it over to your phone calls as well at one hundred sixty four thirty one to\nNancy on Facebook writes in what kind of consequences does a person like this face and well\nOf course the obvious ... and then most appropriate and prudent and proper consequence is that he's put in prison because someone like this is not\nFit to live in the society of human beings and they're locked away for a period of time because they've obviously committed or attempted to commit to the most terrible crimes are and and then the worst scenario this could be considered an attempted murder\nBecause you're doing everything you can do to a eradicate the life of the human being by means of an explosive device if in fact that's what it was and even if it didn't ah explode the the fact that the perception of the recipient is what counts so the ultimate penalty here is jail\nYeah I mean this is again what we hope is that this will bring it\nUp to this time period after this week in the United states if a these are devices being delivered even as early this morning with two more devices so a total count at twelve but the postal service law enforcement said they have\nNo reason to believe that all the devices um and uh the Biafra hitting the person that will stop them from sending more but how many more out in the postal system is is still the question so you have to remain vigilant uh let's see we have listeners on both sides of the aisle is obviously a focused on a lot of uh left uh those on the left\nUm if you work in those kind of offices in in Capitol Hill or in regional offices for members of Congress or be vigilant you know is going through mail and if you work in the postal service\nBe vigilant as well or we want you to be safe because while some of these individuals are so high profile their mail to get screened especial facilities others are not\nAnd they're going through the regular postal service so again I we've got to remind all of the people who could be in the light of danger\nBecause of an individual like this we condemn it to the fullest extent I think you put the politics aside because that may be their purpose or their ideological purpose behind it but obviously a something seriously wrong with a person whether it's they are criminal\nOr or or just insane or criminally insane\nI used to put it all together or they should be facing serious law enforcement penalties that they'll go through the process but again this because the disruption the use of the mail service or the people who were targeted a very serious and now we expect that President Trump\nWill address that as well as ... will cover that on the broadcast if it happens while we're on the air department of justice is also going to speak to it later on today a show or taking your phone calls running hundred six eight four thirty one hundred sixty four\nThree one one zero we're going to get into a little bit\nOf this caravan issue out got Andy here as well or the caravan of migrants heading towards the border or are they are in Mexico now their looks like they're heading towards either a Texas border or a California border Texas border crossing it's closer\nThe president Andy yesterday's authorized\nEight hundred additional troops through a a General Mattis a Secretary Mattis department of defense that includes that would then up the number two ah they're already Twenty one hundred National Guard troops there that could increase to four thousand this eight hundred could be more as well so the U.S is preparing\nFor for a border effort for this to happen at our border if it is not\nAble to be stopped before in Mexico but that is the hope is that we work with the Mexican government and get this stopped and dissipated\nBecause the numbers are still in the thousands estimates anywhere between three to fourteen thousand people that is a lot more than the last year amid we experienced in April twenty Eighteen so and so again and I mean it appears that the Trump Administration preparing for two things one\nPossibly are having to deal with this or their own and to try to get Mexico to work with us to deal with it together\nWriter as we've said position as they sailed Jay has always been that we want to have an intervention prior to the arrival of this a wave of humanity at the border and by that I mean the intervening with Mexican authorities to stop them to turn them back\nTo put them into a\nCategory is perhaps of those who are\nLegitimately seeking asylum which says really available in the first state in which you feel safe and the first nation who wish to feel safe which should be Mexico in this case\nAnd then ... out those who are here to do ill to the United states are people who are not here seeking asylum but the danger those who are engaged in human trafficking and so forth and we were working with the Mexican authorities to do that\nOn of course as you said Jordan we're sending troops to the border but the ... they're they're only to support the civil authorities and they are not expected to come into regular contact with the migrants if they carry arms is solely for purposes of self defense\nAnd of course the law and the United states currently prohibits the routine use of troops in ... in routine law enforcement activities I don't expect that that will happen I anticipate and hope that they will not be confrontations at the border between this wave of humanity and the United states troops you never know I Hope it doesn't happen\nThe president's executive order that was ultimately okayed by the U.S Supreme Court after many legal battles on a a immigration and preventing a certain individuals certain from certain countries uh for periods of time off from immigrating or being granted visas to the United states\nThere's discussion now being reported\nThat President Trump a one idea is to use that executive order\nBecause it can be expanded on the list of countries that use that executive order\nTo actually shut down the crossing point so that our offices are closed there so that people who make it don't even have the opportunity to apply um that again\nWe'll call it that will cause legal issues and legal battles but I I Do believe that under that executive order the powers there for the president to do it it would be a unique way uh to apply because it'd be happening at the border instead of somebody applying for a visa\nRun and I think that that would be an excellent thing to do the president clearly\nHas the authority under the executive order that he issued modified issue another executive order that deals with the same thing but stop the portals stopped the ports of entry stuff those\nAre places where you come in McAllen, Texas was one Tijuana was the other if they win in either direction but he could stop that is the point of entry there would be no question here of any discrimination because of Islamic\nA or a Middle Eastern origin we're talking about invaders to the United states potentially which the president has exclusive authority as the head of the ... executive branch of government to protect the country to do\nYou talked about the troops power on the border down on Facebook writes in Kim the troops help make sure the situation doesn't escalate dangerously once this caravan if it does reach our southern border that is what they're they're just to make sure it does not reach a dangerous situation for citizens ...\nOnce the troops are there to do is really a defensive posture\nAnd you're talking about the disease issue there's this these are all issues you have to face if it makes it to your border and you decided to open those crossings to process the applications let me try to grab one more call quickly before we go into our our next break Laurie in a Arkansas on line one Lorrie welcome to Jay secular life\nAll right thanks for taking my call scale Hitler is there any opportunity for the United nations to get involved to protect our borders [noise]\nI don't think we want the un involves on protecting our borders they they get involved with their regional\nCountries not when countries should be able to work together [noise]\nLike the U.S and Mexico to deal with this so they're involved in like Lebanon Israel border\nTogether so let's not get the UN involved let's handled this between us Mexico working together\nHopefully long before this caravan reaches our southern border\nMid term elections eleven days away politics get your calls in

building relationships with one gets out of time\nSitting at ... ... five Ninety pie in their lives\nWashington DC\nGoing to get right into the mid term elections but says some people joined us or just the beginning\nOf the second half hour Jay sexual alive let me up to you with the biggest breaking news the day and that is that they suspect has been arrested\nIn these pipe bombings the twelve that have been intercepted or some high profile individuals are current and former\nGovernment officials both some celebrities or suspects has been arrested or they again does that mean there's not other devices that could be out there so were made its vigilant\nOr the president is likely to address this if it happens while we're on the air we will go to the president's comments but we do want to focus in I'll give you an update on the mid term elections right now we're only eleven days out there is a yeah we've covered the caravan of which obviously is an impact on the election or we covered the devices\nObviously has an impact because the entire week of news has been on these devices are but now we want to look right into the mid term elections were eleven days out from election day but let me remind you of many places including my home state should already vote\nMany people are I'm actually planning to vote in the next few days I'm so people are already making up their mind cast their ballots a lot of those will be end before election day so we're at a time period now in America where we have election day but it really is like a two week period where you can go and vote and convince people to get out there to actually cast their\nFinal vote for candidates they don't want to start off in the U.S Senate ah because that is where it looks like Republicans are having to potential for the most gay and there's pretty shocking news\nOut of New Jersey a Senate race there are pretty blue states do to elected people like Chris Christie the bench Christie Todd Whitman types and in uh in New Jersey the Senate race there Bob Menendez is in some trouble in the race has been moved by the cook Political Report to a toss up that would be a huge victory for Republicans\nMe monumental Jordan I mean this is one of the races that you and I have talked about several times on this broadcast and keeping an eye on it because if it did move into a competitive territory it was going to be a clear sign that not only the we're the Republicans are going to keep the majority in the United States Senate but it might be a significant majority now pulling inside that state\nHas it in some cases within the margin of error with Bob Cuban closing to within five five points a button and then ended it Monday and as of course Jordan a bottom an index has been plagued with scandal over the last couple of years ... has run a very good campaign he's a businessman he\nAppeals to people that are maybe a little tired of the political process but the fact that New Jersey is on the map tells me that the Republicans dinner or in a very strong position\nIn the United States Senate Jordan as we've talked about most of the political battlefield in the United States Senate is in Trump or states that were carried by Donald Trump in Republican states as a ... Point New Jersey would certainly not be one of them and yet it's in\nPlay let's go to the president right now he believes addressing the issue involving the type\nOf that law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him and took us\n[noise]\nCredible job by law for us we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation to find that person or persons responsible for these events [noise] these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country [noise]\nI've instructed us our days just there no resource or expense and finding those as possible and bringing them to swift and certain justice [laughter]\nWe will prosecute them him her whoever it may be\nOf the law much never\nAllow political violence to take in America come out but I have a pet I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it [noise]\nJust like we have echoed and the president waited to suspect was apprehended to say we will not accept\nPolitical violence in America to do everything possible\nMake sure it's this individual and not a ... additional individuals as well prosecute them\nThe fullest extent of the law so there you heard from President Trump the announcement of this suspect being arrested but still law enforcement activities ongoing he's taking it very seriously also taking the mid term elections very seriously as well uh we will continue to talk about those we come back ... New Jersey has now we toss up\nBetween incumbent Democrat Senator Bob Menendez a again a folks this was a race that people were not watching that closely and an upcoming business in\nBack to Jay sexual lives Jordan sexual recovered the president live\nAddressing the apprehension of the rest of the suspect in this pipe bombings are still packages could be out there so you have be vigilant hopefully this is the individual involved there could be more but hopefully this is the person and that will come to an end even if they're more packages out there they won't be able to send out additional\nPackages is the president said no place for political violence that our country\nProsecute them to the full extent of the law use all resources possible or to uh make sure this person and anyone else who was working with them a is apprehended a again it's important for eleven days out from a midterm election people are already voting early voting I'd\nHas an impact I mean that's being tried to so crass but it does um the Caribbean issue has an impact as well we want to get into the numbers we want to hear what you say what are you seeing in your state one eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten do Republicans have a shot\nAt keeping the house of representatives and maybe make some pretty big games\nAnd then the Senate big gains are three or four or five seats that's a big game because only a it's a it's a a branch of government was only one hundred seats and so it's not really a question right now Republican majority and said it\nWhich is a lot different place from where we were just a few weeks ago\nA but how big that Republican majority could be eleven days long type of politics lot can happen but we update used route these time period because people are already voting so we want to make sure you kinda know since the layout of the land I Want to start back do stay in New Jersey because I think it's so important\nThis this is really the breaking news political of the day is it the cook Political Report which is very respected\nHas put the New Jersey Senate race which is incumbent Democrat Bob Menendez who's been there a long time has had a lot of legal issues but still no one thought he really had a chance of being beaten in a state like New Jersey though I remind you of Chris Christie's\nA Christie Todd Whitman zero Republicans it wasn't there before statewide um he's facing a businessman\nAnd that has been a move to a toss up tell us about them well\nThe reason it's so surprising is because it's New Jersey joined but the reason that they toss up is because of how hard the momentum is moving towards ... and I mean just a matter of a few weeks ago you were seeing polls are Fifteen and twenty point leads for Bob ... even though his favorability race inside the state we're not that high he still had an enormous lead\nWhen you looked at the polls that has been closing and closing rapidly so the last poll I saw had it within within the margin of error\nWhich if you are a an incumbent in a blue state running as a Democrat and the police shows it within the margin of there you have to be extremely worried and I think Bob Menendez is at this point but then when you zoom out a little bit Jordan you're right\nAh Martha ... closely aligned with President Trump on his efforts to secure the border and then work on an overall solution here since cinema just quite frankly is not and I think that has been the driving force of\nOf really having the numbers move Martha ... way a matter of a month ago it looked like a two three four point advantage for cure cinema\nAnd now it looks like Martha ... up by about a winter to uh the early numbers there as far as registration sure do look like they're favoring her up again Jordan go back globally this is one of the two Republican seats the Democrats absolutely have to have if they were to take the majority\nYeah I mean so again this is these are important races and they are down there within the margin of error\nEither candidate could win a but there's some momentum going behind the Republicans right now I take a listen this is just interesting the Democratic candidate congressman uh ... uh she said this in a radio show this is coming back to haunt are a bit by thirty three\nNo no no I don't buy more as an individual if I Want to go fight in the Taliban army I go over there or not you know I'm I'm fighting for the ... I'm Sorry that's personal decision and I guarantee that\nI mean I don't know why she said something like that find it I don't care if you go fight for the Taliban but as a member of Congress and then she says this about her own state by thirty for speaking to the very liberal this year that route station just a couple of months ago\nAnd that thing that they have a lot of stories of democracy and then my hair is calling\n\nThat line and they have read it but I'm happy here and you had\nYou know that's not funny if you're running for you\nTo be sitting there in your state where you've got to issue serious stuff like that just to please the crowd um so I get that is coming back um and I know that those those are vice are being used\nAnd said speeches are being used to remind people that just to these people are just so many times and the Senate candidates they tried to change who they are let's finally get to the vet and then it gets these phone calls ... Dean Heller is Republican incumbent are facing a challenge from a Democrat Rosen or what does it look like they're\nYeah Jacky Rosen a congresswoman from Nevada again this was one of the the states the Democrats really focused on early on they thought I had they had a great job to flip this each singer ... numbers were down a little bit\nA door and I think President Trump is actually played a big role in this state as well\nOr the turnout for Dean Heller are the numbers have turned around and it looks like he's got about a two point lead there again a lot of national dollars are going to flow into the state Jordan I think Dean Heller is in a better position than Jacky Rosen is again it's one it's a state that Democrats have to have if they have the majority so if you're in Nevada you're going to be inundated with ads over these last eleven days\nOkay we've got lots of calls try to keep your comments as short as possible so we can get to all of them let's start with Joe in North Carolina on line one Joe welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nIs I'm a manager an apartment complex in North Carolina I've been asking her as that's you know you see it in your vote and then we found two Democrats say they're still going to vote Democrat are the ones that's told me they're Democrats or at least fifty all said after the cabinet thing they just can't vote Democrat\nThat is an interesting point right there I think that I Want to get as many calls as possible but I think we cannot forget the effect that Kavanaugh a behavior by the Democrats\nReally is what started this Republican beginning of the I I wouldn't say the red wave yet but a comeback for Republicans not just in the Senate especially in the city but also potentially in the house as well which we can get to it later show because there's a lot to talk about there as well focusing on the Senate today\nEleven days out back to the phones we go but I Do think Kavanaugh it was it was the beginning of this Republican kind of a resurgence in uh the mid term elections a along with President Trump hitting the campaign trail again are doing what he does best surely and Michigan on line to surely welcome to chase you'll live\nTo a couple of minutes go for that one state that to be at the soccer and I think that could be Michigan\n... up against Debbie Stabenow three weeks ago it was cool points down his last seven ... some competitive various things either even or had he is a rock star if you have any for all\nAll the ... website and definitely tell I I ... in several people already just tell her about him that are closer to vote for him so we we need to talk ... with our friends and neighbors that make them aware he had a wonderful ...\nThis was a lot of military experience very thin and again was twenty points down just six weeks ago is surging right now and Michigan State that President Trump did carry I I agree with\nSurely I think this could be a shocker who's on my list with Bob Menendez remember Donald Trump won Michigan Debbie Stabenow should be able to win that state but John James has run a terrific a campaign but I won't be surprised at all to wake up and twelve days and find out that John James ... was editor for\nA stab at all or Mendez losing for Democrats would just be historic for Republicans I Will put it that way those would be one of those two soccer's I think um maybe maybe both of the people we could have too shocking states let's keep going Billy in New Jersey on line three ability welcome to Jay secular life\nI Want to thank you guys for all the work ... here in my prayers all the time\nUm yeah I Do I I'm a Republican in New Jersey out I mean personally I was shocked when Chris Christie wind um they were Cain laying on the ballot chair nature there's not even out what public and candidate and a lot\nAnd I think you know that your hands you know when we had a governor that ran on that\nForm charting New Jersey until sanctuary date raising taxes that they actually won okay Chris Christie crews that there is a cool place to Republicans adoption out there but it's not getting out and voting I\nMean I think so and if you really that's right but you do have this uh to give you some hope I lived in states\nAnd cities where there are no Republican options no concern ruptures before a and a and it's disappointing but you've got a statewide race there that is very serious or was this a surging candidate against Bob Menendez what's rich that we're we're tired they're just quickly for people\nYou don't have that situation right now ... he is running a terrific campaign in New Jersey there is traction their she'll look it's not an opportunity where you can complain about who's on the ballot in this case you got a candidate that are right in the midst of Jordan\nAll right we've got two calls left let's take both of them should be Missouri online six very quickly city you're on the air\nYeah Hi I'm hey I'm In Missouri and I just drove airspace seven from St Charles Missouri Columbia, Missouri\nAnd I thought I was up Josh Hawley signs and only one Claire McCaskill son so I don't know what to say it but when you're driving Missouri people are on fire for Josh thoroughly\nAnother very close race within the margin of error but either candidate when turnout will matter ... state attorney\nGeneral state attorney general in Jordan Audrey one see what I can tell her with ... that had been so I get but turnout matters\nLet me tell you a Lebanese out early voting is a group of people are already cast their ballots you need to be talking to your friends and family I'll probably because she my ballot or the next few days and so I get a lot will happen but many Republicans it's interesting\nWay to go watch today and so sometimes those numbers are little lopsided we'll keep coming back from the mid term elections we didn't even get to the house yet which is a tougher battle for Republican votes to be honest about it but still a battle the fight for there is this kind of wave moving or we will talk about it next time on Jay said you'll live\n\nTo try to jump on the president the United states or to jump on people in the mainstream media or to jump on one party or another party or this one or that one and say boy did you ever get it wrong boy is this terrible boy are you to blame I uh I I wanted to try to avoid that\nBecause honestly we have every reason to celebrate\nAs a country and President Trump has been speaking recently about the need to come together and to see things in harmony and to see things as Americans not as Republicans or Democrats or pro Trump or their anti Trump per se\nBut basically to look at this thing citizens and when you look at this thing uh this has been remarkable and one of the things that I literally just moments before I got on the air here I put out a tweet that said look this should remind everybody of how lucky we are\nTo have people in place like yes Jeff Sessions and yes Christopher Wray the head of the FBI and yes all of those extraordinary people who work every single day sometimes putting their lives on the line\nTo keep us safe through the FBI and the rest of law enforcement\nThrough the New York city police to the local Florida police we just had a um a moment with Jeff Sessions are announcing the arrest if you haven't heard it and you probably have but Caesar say all coups fifty six years old\nWho um it at least as far as I can gather has known employment\nAppears to have been living in his van and yes his van is festooned with all kinds of a political a bumper stickers and posters it's actually kind of artfully designed but the messages\nOn the van are insane and a despicable and dare I say it deplorable in any event he was a arrested\nToday taken into custody he's having multiple charges filed against him he was being interrogated in what they call a national security exemption in other words they can't interrogate him without an attorney present dinner fear I think that what they're trying to do is to determine\nWhether or not he had any accomplices or had any associates and he doesn't appear to a a guy with a very very long criminal history\nA guy who as I mentioned may or may not have been living in his van recently uh before that during another very serious criminal charges in during another bankruptcy that he declared he was living with his mom\nAnd I'm at ... we're not talking about a an ... an upstanding or model citizen and when you look at pictures of the van I you know I think about this because\nMy most important role in the world is that right and that is true for probably many many of the males who were listening to me\nAnd I was looking at the pictures of the van with all the messages on it and literally you can see out the windows because the windows are totally covered with top youth soccer recruits for Trump drain the swamp dishonest media CNN sucks I'm hard rock weekly\nOr they have a seminal hard rock weekly now this has led to some confusion I think\nBecause people are saying well he may or may not be Native American I think the seminal there is not a reference to the tribe it's a reference to the football\nTeam or to the um uh Florida State Seminoles I Believe it is in any are there are also pictures of Michael Moore and Hillary Clinton\nAnd I believe in a Van Jones a with a targets on their faces and that's not good but in any event I ... when I was trying to imagine\nIs think if you have a daughter and somebody's coming up to pick up your daughter in front of the house and he was driving a van like this I mean um [noise] I Know somebody is is it okay if I say who it is Greg\nIs you are who has suggested a the any any time the police spot a van or a car or any kind of equal\nWith more than six bumper stickers they ought to investigate it immediately in any event this uh this is a sort of a tip off to where he was coming from but this is the way Jeff Sessions sounded this morning and and by the way I Hope that this leads to President Trump and all the rest of us\nAppreciating the attorney general a little bit more appropriate here's the attorney general of the United states\nI'm pleased to participate in this announcement that a suspected in the custody of the FBI I Want to remind everyone to defend it in this case as in every case is innocent until proven guilty he's been charged today\nWith fire federal crimes including interstate transportation or an explosive\nLegal mailing of explosives threats against former presidents and certain other person's threatening interstate communications and assaulting current and former federal officers for the charges a defendant faces up to fifty eight years in prison [noise]\nThese charges marry a change or expand as the investigation pursued [noise]\nThis is the law and order administration we will not tolerate such lawlessness was fast way not political violence\nOkay good for him or he's he's exactly right and you don't want the president spoke beautifully this morning no I mean it\nUh the Twitter feed probably best ignored but uh his speaking this morning was solid he uh he was speaking to a great group and they were so enthusiastic and he was bonding with him so well it was a moving occasion\nHe was speaking to turning point USA's young black leadership summit and it's it's ironic I just this morning I left a Minneapolis I left the hotel this morning at five\nAnd five AM and I wrote to the airport with my friend and colleague Larry Elder who was on his way to precisely this young black leadership summit\nAnd ah here's what the president sounded like with the announcement before he began what was a very successful and a fine speech to the people who are attending that somebody who is president the United states\nI'd like to begin as you are leaders that's a real leaders I'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update\nOn the packages and devices that had been male too high profile figures throughout our country band a media organization I Am pleased to inform you\nThat law enforcement has apprehended to suspect and taken him into custody\n[noise]\nCredible job by law for us we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation to find the person or persons\nResponsible for these events fish terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country [noise]\nBut I was struck the authorities despair no resource are expensive and finding those responsible and bringing them to swift and certain justice [noise]\nWe will prosecute them him her whoever it may be\nOf the law okay a good for you Mr President and then he went on to say this\nI don't even watch never allow political violence to take root in America\nCannot for the how read I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it [noise]\nI've just concluded a briefing with the department of justice following the apprehension of the suspects\nI Want to applaud the FBI Secret Service department of justice the U.S attorney's office for the southern district of New York the NYPD federal law enforcement throughout the entire country who's credible partners these people to work so hard\nAnd to have done it so quickly gets looking like a a you're looking it's a needle in a haystack how do you do this so quickly they've done an incredible incredible job but\nI Want to congratulate [noise] okay that's the president of\nThe United states and this is a fine moment for President Trump and I know he didn't ah the ... the DNA on the saliva on the stamps from the packages\nWith this guy personally but he's in charge you know things went wrong he would get blamed it isn't this something worth celebrating and and what is it ... on what basis would you attack the Trump Administration on this issue this seems\nTo me is a very very good day for America and that means it's a very very good day for the president as well we will be right back with your calls and responses and more about the details of the rest of the bombing scares us back coming up\nTry to get folks on on the left including I I heard earlier today a congresswoman Jackie Speier who was just way over the top and this is er flow reflective of the hatred of President Trump and it's all President Trump has that can you imagine anyone\nCelebrating if one of these bombs going off to\nThink about it and for conservatives it I mean we would feel horrible horrible\nJust as I I Know that when ... was shot and almost killed when there was the would be killer at the congressional baseball practice who fired at Republican members of Congress\nI didn't see anybody on the left celebrating I didn't hear anybody saying oh I Wish he'd kill ...\nAnd and maybe we can think in those terms and let that inform some of our rhetoric one eight hundred nine\nFive five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nI'm let us go
