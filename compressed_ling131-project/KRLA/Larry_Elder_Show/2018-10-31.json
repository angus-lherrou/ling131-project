of course the media last no time interesting that there is a connection between Trump's so called hateful rhetoric and what happened in Pittsburgh indeed what happened with respect to the pipe

Eric Holder\nFalsely argue that the fact that a black criminal defendant who commits a crime compared to a white criminal defendant who commit similar crime to get a longer sentence and that's true the U.S commission says any black from the defendant first as a white cream defend it gets instance about twenty two percent longer\nWithhold or didn't tell you is it the very same sentencing commission to what you referred also say that the reason for the longer sentences is that the average black criminal defendant compared to the average white from the defendant has more arrests\nAnd judges take rest into consideration when they're determined listens to the U.S commission to which Eric Holder refer to making the argument that the longer sentences\nOr an example of ... pernicious

son he would look like Trayvon I Know George Zimmerman was not a cop but he was operating as a\nNeighborhood watch captain\nObama in his speech for the United nations invoke Ferguson and said something to the effect of you know we've got our own problems here in the United states with a place called Ferguson and hands up don't shoot with a complete and total lie\nAnd while the Obama administration completely exonerated the officer in question they also hold the Ferguson police department institutionally racist why well the biggest finding was that the city of Ferguson is about sixty seven percent black\nYet about eighty five percent of those were stopped on traffic stops are black\nA gap of what Eighteen percent or go to Jeff Eighteen points or go racism [noise]\nThe problem with that argument is that as I said before city of New York about twenty five percent of its population is black about fifty five percent of those were stopped on traffic stops complex dirty point gap\nFerguson police department almost all white three or four comfortable black the NYPD street cops majority of them are people of color\nWhy isn't the NYPD if the gap between population and percentage of oh stop by cops is an example of\nThe tuition and racism why isn't New York city twice as institutionally racist as Ferguson and the answer is you can't do it based on just those numbers have to look at what underlies those numbers\nIn twenty Thirteen during the Obama administration the department of justice has a research arm called the national Institute of justice and he put out a report about race and traffic stops\nSeventy five percent of black motorists admitted that they were pulled over for quote legitimate reason to close quote\nAnd the study found that you named bill

you're talking about\nI have never suggest that I'm a white nationalist Army National is in that sense and I am a pro American guy anti global this guy nothing would ever to do with race\nBut then of course has not stopped the left of saying that the president is sending a quote dog whistle quote unquote ...\nVery carefully here that dog whistle are you hearing it now what is our friend Chris Matthews some say admitted\nFor white people white people won't vote for a guy most of them that they think they're racist [noise] now\nChris Matthews is most white people\nWould not vote for racist\nYou're suggesting that most white people are therefore not racist and it's a country is majority white who suggested that the majority racial group in this country is not racist and I'm sure you feel that black Senate races in Spanish and racist and Asian or not racing so you are really saying this country's not a racist country\nWhy then say with me here Chris ... and ... of the show why then with the president's in a quote dog whistle close cooperation is as you started\nMainly for white people because white people won't vote for a guy most of them that they think they're

people are putting themselves and their children in harm's way abide violating the laws of this country or they claim that they are refugees and we have an international law obligation to consider their claims for asylum\nBut as far as I've been able to tell them not one of them is making claims that actually fit the definition of the legal definition of refugee they're not fleeing their country because they are being persecuted because of their political or religious\nOr race or ethnic views\nThey're fleeing their country because they want to go to a place that has a better economy that's not one of the ground for refugee status\nWhy hasn't Mexico stop them even after Donald Trump has told them to even after Donald Trump has said he's going to withhold aid from Guatemala and Honduras my resume I have some sort of economic punishment to Mexico Hochul Mexico hasn't stopped them felt\nThe same international law that were require us to consider their claims for asylum required Mexico to consider their claims for asylum as well and ... should be stopping because that was the first country that they entered into illegally to make these reputation clean\n'em but but some of them have and I think Mexico is profit processing knows but we don't want to stop and Mexico we want to get all the way the United states with your guest further proof that this was an concern about perfect the ocean and they're all countries if they want a different economy to live and and that's not a ground for refugee status\nWhat would happen professor if we allow fourteen or seven thousand so called migrants to to transport themselves to our country to go all the way up to Canada\nCanada would stop him as well same or you know there there are legal processes in place here and countries have the ability to define a you know what their immigration and naturalization policies are\nIf if you don't allow that and there you have no such thing as a nation you have no such thing as sovereignty President Trump is absolutely correct on that without border you have no nation\nExplain the ground so which people can apply for asylum\nAbout you've got to have a credible claim that you are being persecuted or under threat of persecution based on your political views your religion your um your race\nYour ethnic background those sorts of things being poor and wanting a better life has a lot of ground for refugee status or asylum under international law and certainly not under any of the law the United states\nThe president professor has said that there may be some bad guys maybe people from ISIS or even al ... is there any basis to believe that\nWell we we've seen some a report of that I I'm not\nPrivy to the intelligence but it wouldn't surprise me what that border porous and if you're stopping people at the port of entry on the east coast in New York or what have you and vetting them properly uh than than folks that are aiming to come here to the United states to do with terrorists harm\n... with a more court entry and that Mexican border is right now the ... century so it wouldn't surprise me to find\nA significant number of potential terrorists and that group\nI guess the professor John ... Chapman University school of law professor what about funding you mentioned that this migrant a caravan of being funded by the last what do you mean\nAbout you know it made it takes a lot of money to transport seven thousand people to feed them every day\nUh you know over the span of faith that they've gone and that's ... I Want to know who's funding it and if they were so poor in their country that they couldn't you know you gotta living who's paying for them to eat on the ... along the way somebody must be doing it and quite frankly it's most likely\nYeah you you just kind of go to the explanation that makes ... that it's most likely somebody that is trying to interfere with the U.S election by setting up a confrontation that then to meet new media can turn a contrary to President Trump and his supporters\nLet's turn to the fourteenth amendment here's what President Trump said some immigration some legal scholars believe he can get rid of the citizenship without changing the constitution ... have you thought about\nNew law it was always told to me that you needed a constitutional and then by one and then you don't need a number one number one you don't need that nobody can nothing to do as much as well and you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nHow ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to kill us history they just and it has to end have you talked about that with ...\nWhere in the process in the process it will happen with an executive order that's what you're talking about really as I was thinking about I didn't think anybody that knew that but me I said I was the only one China\nEastman can he do this with an executive order\nWill either leave because let's let's be real hard for those because they cannot amend the constitution and executive order Congress and amend the constitution by an act of Congress and the Supreme Court isn't supposed to be able to amend the constitution by your feeling a judgment or ruling in a cave\nBut that's not what the president is talking about here the constitution doesn't require birthright citizenship as anybody born here and subject to the jurisdiction are citizen all he's trying to do with clarify what that phrase subject to the jurisdiction me\nAnd it doesn't mean anybody who happens to be subject to outlaw because they're physically present here it meant something much more complete that mad hauling allegiance to the country being part of the body politic and that's what the debate to the fourteenth amendment make clear that what the early Supreme Court decisions on that made clear and the Supreme Court has never held otherwise\nWe now felt so that would mean that the children of citizen\nOr the children are lawful permanent residents are automatically citizens by virtue of the fourteenth amendment that the children of temporary visitor whether it's a tourist visa or student visa\nOr or or or certainly the children are people who are not lawfully present in the United states at all or not automatic citizens according to the constitution and the president is trying to faithfully apply that clause that it was drafted and ratified and an avid Mac or the people that path\nThat forty five seconds left professor I thought there was some sort of Supreme Court case that came out in the early eighties have some sort of footnote which people point to to argue that anybody who's in the country even illegally has a child on the American soil a is an automatic citizen isn't there some sort of case that people point to that rightly or wrongly they use to make that argument\nThey do they apply liver at all and it's ridiculous that said that they'd have to provide free education\nTo the children of illegal immigrants under the equal protection clause and excited a footnote that that what they're they're they're awful citizens that they're born yet but that was not holding of the case it was hot it in that case it was it what we call that the Supreme Court for the back of that ad added something\nAnd people often think about what about all those people that make those high salaries up in Silicon valley\nOr forty ... they're only about Fifteen Percent of households in the Silicon Valley area can afford the median price tone in that location\nSo there's no there's no sense in which um there's there's there's there's absolutely a housing crisis in California and people are becoming very very upset about the ... and they're looking for government to put in place policies that will make it easier and less costly to build a increase supply and bring those prices down\nYou might remember a few years ago professor ... I've got a fact check when I was on CNN when I talked about\nUm the ... the high cost of a of of regulations and said that if you add up the taxes and regulations are all those things government takes about fifty percent away from the American people I've got a phone call from from some fact checker\nAnd they said how you know the cost of regulation is what'd you say it is a and I'm a I recommended them to a number of people and I recall you telling me that if anything I'd probably understated the or the number and the argument they gave me was that regulations also have benefit and and you're not taken into consideration the benefits of these regulations produce what's your reaction to that\n[noise] well regulation exist to provide protection is supposed to provide protection to consumers\nTo regulations in the housing market [noise] when I look at him I really can't see much a protection for consumers hum let's take California's latest folly which is to require by two thousand twenty of virtually every single family home will be required\nHave solar panels on its roof top\nThis will raise the cost of a building that home by about thirty thousand dollars [noise]\nAll for the purpose of generating solar power we already have so much solar generation that we are paying Arizona to take solar power offer hand around around noon one PM [noise] um that type of regulation feeds into\nA small number of people in the state who think it's just absolutely wonderful if we do everything we can under the sun\nTo be green um but it punishes people who have to pay those housing prices um so the residential housing market in California's not placed regulations really benefiting the consumers\nI'm Talking to UCLA professor Leogane into teaching economics says piece you wrote is called California housing policy reformers up on Larry Elder dot com professor going to have a few more minutes left more seconds then this break we come back I'm going to talk to you about\nA why things substantially change in California in Nineteen eighty what happened in Nineteen eighty or so\nAnd I want to ask you if you have time about the Trump tariffs as the caller was talking about and to what degree does Obama deserves credit for this economic boom that we're seeing right now my guess is professor ... from UCLA all of that more people eight nine to one S.

over and over and over again in different ways what\nA suicide note where he talked about all of this is there a line between Obama's anti cup rhetoric and there's certainly the police thanks so which is why he got maybe eight percent from from uh from cops on all over the country in his campaign\n\nEven Romney manuals said because of the attacks against the police the police in elbow themselves up a new city in a fetal position his words not mine causing a whole lot of people\nTo meet you why because the presence of the contract there they're not being proactive and therefore the bad guys are aware of that are in a lot of people have been harmed in killed as a result of that why aren't we holding Obama responsible if Trump's allege hateful rhetoric is responsible for the pipe bombs and for
