she had a Native American ancestor anywhere from six to ten generations ago\nAlthough the vast majority he says her ancestry as European with us the results quote strongly supports the existence of an on an ad mixed Native American ancestry close quote calculating that her pure American\nNative American ancestry appears in the family tree in the range of six generations ago which would make her approximately one one thousand and twenty fourth Native American\n\nAlso get this study was based not on Native American DNA but on Mexican Peruvian at Columbia and DNA\n\nNevertheless CNN headline Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence close quote their words of Native American ancestry daily beef also left wing publication Elizabeth Warren fights Trump's Pocahontas talk with DNA tests proving Native American groups close quote really\nIs that when it proves one one thousand and twenty four that means the percentage of Native American ancestry and her is actually lower

very light skinned and I believe my mother once even said that sometimes they could even pass for white\nWhich would probably indicates that I have probably more European Caucasian blood in me than it is it lives with Warren has a Native American ancestry and her now considering all my life I call myself a black person I therefore for the last\n... years\nAnd I'm just thinking this through so stay with me here\nFor the last ten years I looked at myself as a black person which means I have therefore fail to benefit from the white privilege that I was in title too\nSo it seems to me there ought to be some sort of reparations for black people who have more white blood white ancestry in them that he lived with Warren has a Native American Cherokee and Delaware and her and therefore I'm old all of the lack of my having benefited from white privilege for all these years\nSince white people all benefit from white privilege so it seems to me the people that could have been designated as white who didn't do so given the standard is pretty well one one thousand\nIt seems to me I don't know too many over here and I'm thinking about Obama now here's where it gets complicated that's what I'm saying we're we're we're we're altogether thinking this week that collectively given the new standards were learning from Elizabeth Warren who not once Donald Trump to pay up\nDonald Trump once said he give a million dollars to her favorite charity I should take a DNA test she now claims to protest wants Donald Trump to pay up so we have the new one thousand uh and twenty fourth standard\nNow

you can keep your doctor if you want to and that was a lie this one here\nYou can't keep Medicare Bernice plan replaces Medicare itself with Medicare for all the different kind of policy\nNot only that is twenty two million Americans people who have Medicare Advantage plans which are run by private companies and he would eliminate all of them that would be an increase fishing is fish would hurt

have great plants everyone should keep this number like twenty two weeks that's how long it takes for a major surgery and Canada after they examined you may take months but you have been examined\nAnd now after they say yes you need this major surgery twenty two weeks you average wait a lot of those people cross over the border and they get their operations in America\nThan wherever is my guest founder and CEO of a Mac ... association of mature American citizens now Dana probably mangled this guy's name but I Know the father of the Canadian health care system in Canada is named Claude Gaston way or something like that and he won that sounded it or in Quebec\nAnd all the other provinces ultimately adopted it he still alive as far as I Know in his nineties and he's come out and recently said that I was wrong we should have had more competition I should not have outlaw how private care and he pronounced the healthcare system Internet in Canada pretty much a failure\nYeah yeah and well we just got to look at all socialize looking at a cute but they don't even have\nA aspirin available in the local drugstores look at Venezuela they socialize the medical care thinking doctors were any too much and now the poor people literally dying and it's a shame socialism doesn't work because the socialism the individual mandate not that\nI'm often asked people this question whenever I have a discussion about this Canada Great Britain they have a a socialized medicine Canada has the what I think Obama wants to have a single payer are in Great Britain has something very similar but when you take polls the majority of citizens in both Canada and Great Britain seem to like their system why is that\nBecause if they get a sniffle they can go into a local clinic than they wait in line a long time but to go to the local clinic and I get taken care of that I won't be any money out of their pocket\nAnd so they have a serious problem not only that the recovery rates of cancer operations at the heart operations because of the way they rush medical care as much less survival\nAnd Canada and Great Britain compared to the U.S was something depending on what type of cancer\nWas somewhere between twenty and thirty percent higher survival rates because it's not a machine like they have over there well you march in your march out your number you know establish relationship with the
