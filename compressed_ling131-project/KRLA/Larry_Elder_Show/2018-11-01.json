I remember my colleague Dennis break if you're selling saying that it was a Jew was calling in one of these cases the some of these places and making these anti Semitic comments\n[noise]\nAnd says none of which is to say that there hasn't been a surge the question is whether the search is because of Trump\nOr whether there is a search so it is extremely dubious at best put the article up on Larry Elder dot com has there been a surge of anti Semitism under him because of Trump's as I mentioned yesterday no one seems to blame President Obama's anti cop rhetoric\nFor the assassination style deaths of three officers in Baton Rouge\nFive in Dallas who were killed and two in New York\nAll done by three men three different men\nWho posted on social media in one case let the suicide note saying that they were motivated by black lives matter\nWhich is a bogus fraudulent\nBogus fraudulent because the data do not support the allegation that they've been making\nWe've been looking at the data that Jeffrey Williams who on BP gave that ran about how the cops are where I'm a mining and misleading black people in typical looking at the data and I tried to get him on come on show to talk about his data looking at the data\nAnd I don't know whether or not uh she got my messages but I put 'em on social media and ask him to come on and somehow he couldn't make it I guess he was looking at the data [noise] [noise] now a Don Lemon says that there's more and more to fear from a white men are then or any other group\nThat's also been fact checked and Cory Booker said this quote in American history since nine eleven we've had eighty five major tax on our country Seventy three percent of them had been by white nationalist hate groups minority against Muslims and it gets others in the quote\nWe'll put the article up on Larry Elder dot com fact check or far right groups the biggest us terror threat\n\nEditor of the Daily Caller said that when you look at the data the picture is not nearly as clear cut his book or make it out to be there were serious issues with report [noise] she went with that Seventy three percent figure\nFrom a study from the government accounting office\nWhich reported that white that that a\nRightwing extremist responsible for more incidents\n[noise]\nBut if llamas killed more people\n[noise] I find it interesting that Booker decided to go from September twelfth two thousand one to the end of twenty sixteen he doesn't include the day before\n[noise] between\nTwelve September two thousand one at the end of two thousand sixteen there were eighty five deadly attacks by violent extremist according to the geo resulting in a total of two hundred twenty five deaths\n[noise] separate research carried out by the University of Maryland\nReveals quote a slightly different picture\nFound out that the extreme of carried out thirty one attack leading to Nineteen deaths while far right extremist responsible for killing hundred and fifty eight people in in eighty nine shepherd attacks\nBut another group so the so the opposite so it's completely unclear whether or not there's a cultural connection between a Trump so called rhetoric\nAnd white nationalist Trump's so called rhetoric hate crimes against\nJews but it's fascinating at the same group of leftist do not want to give Trump any credit for the booming economy but they want to give them total blame for pipe bombs total blame for what happened in Pittsburgh [noise]\nMaybe you can swear that for me [noise]\n\nWhen we come back [noise]\nI Want to remind you of an exchange that David Horowitz who's been called a hater by the Southern Poverty Law Center of the day but her with freedom center which we call it a hate group or the Southern Poverty Law Center when I go over it David heart was this encounter using or with a Muslim students who support cilia law\nFeels all Jews should be gathered together and Israel so they can be killed in one fell swoop\nAll that's coming up for like most of the one S.

University School of law and we talked about this here's what President Trump said\nImmigration some legal scholars believe you can get rid of the citizenship without changing the constitution Wade executive order exactly right\nHave you thought about this law it was always told me that you needed a constitutional a member on and you don't need a number one number one you don't need that number to nothing to do you get into well you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nSo how ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to kill us history they just said it has to end have you talked about that with the council you wearing the person in the process it will happen\nWith an executive order that's what you're talking about something that I didn't think anybody but I knew that but me I thought I was the only one China ... couldn't get\nIssue when can he do this with an executive order\nWill likely be ... what's your your purse or for those because they cannot amend the constitution provide an executive order Congress and amend the constitution by an act of Congress and the Supreme Court isn't supposed to be able to amend the constitution by your feeling a judgment or ruling and I think\nThat that's not what the president is talking about here the constitution doesn't require birthright citizenship\nAs anybody born here and subject to the jurisdiction are citizen he's trying to do it clarify what that phrase subject to the ... I mean\nIt doesn't mean anybody who happens to be subject to our laws because they're physically present here it meant something much more complete that mad or when allegiance to the country being part of the body politic and that's what the debate of the fourteenth amendment make clear that what the early Supreme Court decisions on this make clear and the Supreme Court has never held otherwise\nWe now so so that would mean that the children of citizen or the children of lawful permanent residents are automatically citizens by virtue of the fourteenth amendment\nPut the children of temporary visitor whether it's a tourist visa or students either\n... or or or certainly the children are people who are not lawfully present in the United states at all or not automatic citizens according to the constitution and the president is you're trying to faithfully apply that caused that it was drafted and ratified in an ad that meant that the people that path\nForty five seconds left professor I thought there was some sort of Supreme Court case that came out in the early eighties has some sort of footnote which people point to to argue that anybody who's in the country even illegally has a child on the American soil a is an automatic citizen isn't there some sort of case that people point to that rightly or wrongly they use to make that argument\nThey do they apply liver at all and it's ridiculous that said that states have to provide free education\nTo the children of illegal immigrants under the equal protection clause than excited a footnote that says what they're there but also citizens if they're born here but that was not a holding of the case it was hot it is in that case it was just what we called it though is that the Supreme Court for the back of the head added something\nWe come back I'll tell you about what the author of the fourteenth amendment to some cost said his name as senator Jacob powered also there was an Eighteen eighty four Supreme Court case a rule that a Native American born\nUnder the jurisdiction of a Native American tribes not unilaterally making so United States citizen that was Eighteen eighty four case Eighteen Ninety eight case to court ruled that child born in this country to legal\nResident Chinese immigrants was included in the birthright citizenship but they have never ruled that a child born to illegal aliens on American soil is an automatic citizen yet that is how that fourteenth amendment has been interpreted and what I Believe Donald Trump is doing with this executive order you're trying to spark\nA Supreme Court challenge to the executive order that ultimately will go way up to the Supreme Court a and the justices she hopes and I hope will rule the way the senator Jacob powered who drafted this intended it would it Howard say we need rapid it has it for you when I come back I Am Larry older do not leave town\nCalled the Larry Elder show now with the eighty nine seven one eight eighty nine seven one Seventy four three or ... you know what's on your mind\nYou've got the truck and\n\n\nThank you for finding the Larry Elder show on a I'm a Seventy [noise]\nWorking you read about San Francisco spinning over three hundred thousand dollars to register forty nine non citizen for school board\nElections in the epoch times newspaper work and you get the story about Trump's approval among black voters writing forty percent\nIn the epoch times newspaper and work and you read about China stealing data from western countries by intercepting Internet traffic the epoch times newspaper\nThis is Larry Elder I rely on the epoch times for factual unbiased news coverage and now you can get the same index information available to me for the next four weeks for only one dollar just log on to trusted newspaper dot com\nThat trusted newspaper dot com you always see four weeks of the epoch times home delivery and online access for only one dollar get your four weeks trial or the epoch times newspaper for just a book at trusted newspaper dot com bust trusted newspaper dot com [noise]\nTons of you would think ugly oh terrifying windows ... spooky sounds that keep you up at night\nReleases aerial windows with beautiful windows from civil and windows and doors I.

I'm positive it's over a hundred and I don't know the exact number well\nI'm not I'm not calling with you I just never heard that number and I know there there are some I thought that was just a handful I certainly believe it's just a handful of industrialized nation where that's the case but uh but I'll check it out\nAnd I know most European countries are that way and the obvious thing to do and that's true yeah I'm In the southern hemisphere countries that I Know but\nThat also that also makes that also makes Harry Reid wrong when he said there's no sane country that would allow this clip I just not played you\nReally took it All right\nAll right well All right well I'll check it out I don't think it's nearly a hundred but Greg check it out [noise] so of course I check it out and about\nNewsy on let me tell you a what a New Zealand to children born in New Zealand or on board a ship or aircraft registered in New Zealand on or after January two thousand six will acquire New Zealand citizenship\nBy birth only if at least one parent is a New Zealand citizen or a permanent resident so I don't know how old are Greg's kitty is but I'm assuming he's born before January one two thousand six which case I suspect that I'm that Greg is right\nUh but no one no moss ... as it were ... of July one two thousand six four New Zealand\nFor his assertion that there are over a hundred countries I'm calling about thirty five\nOnly one only to I Would be industrialized countries and that would be us and Canada the ones that have unrestricted a birthright\nArgentina Barbados Phillies Bolivia Canada's I mentioned chili Costa Rica Cuba America Ecuador El Salvador Gambia Grenada I'm waiting for the European countries that he mentioned he said all of them right ... ...

five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve Thirteen fourteen Fifteen sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen twenty when we do anything for any President Ghani they're one two three four five six thirty six thirty seven little short of a hundred and not one of the European country now could be wrong\nIf anybody has better information please provided this is just a kind of a quick look and it appears that Greg is completely wrong about his assertion that\nThat uh uh every a country in a in Europe or allows this in fact no country in Europe allows it or and even ... have changed their laws so I'm just saying even looking at the data and or just don't just don't see it but he Greg if you think I'm wrong call back and correct me\nAnd I've given you the quote from the draft or of that provision\nSubject to the jurisdiction there up in the fourteenth amendment senator Jacob our hope this will not of course include persons born in the United states were foreigners [noise]\nSomehow some way that fourteenth amendment has been interpreted as meaning that anybody in this country where they are legally or illegally has a son on our daughter on us soil\nA that son or daughter is automatically an American citizen nonsense says the draft or other fourteenth amendment and a Trump is right that is certainly rare he's wrong when he says we're the only country uh there are others or the other one I suppose that is um one of my calls and difficulties Canada\nAbout Greg ... and you heard him that every country in Europe or has a this kind of automatic birthright interest in every country in Europe does not in fact there is no country in Europe the dust sock match you nailed it anyway thank you very much for the call I appreciate I Want to get back to the anti Semitism in

ah we never get help from anyone so he\nDidn't clarify the cat can we can you get these\nWhat you don't have much information as you can connect other on the UCs\nBecause actually it wasn't too clear and the pamphlet just to clarify\nWhen you uh condemn her boss here and now\nI'm Sorry what would you condemn Hamas\nBut I condemn from out of the terrorists are getting genocidal or are you asking me to put myself on across [noise]\nSo you well I I actually had this experience many times he didn't read the pamphlet because the pay for this chapter and verse uh the main connection is that the MSA is part of the Muslim Brotherhood network has revealed in the document\nI don't think you understand what I meant by that I met if I say something I'm sure that it will be arrested\nFor reasons of homeland security to forget please just answer my question if you\nCondemn Hamas homeland security will support\nAnd that gives you a question for me to condemn the last ...\nReally not condemning moderates obviously supported [noise]\nCase closed [noise] I've\nHad this experience I give you I had this experience to do the Santa Barbara where there were fifty\nMembers of the Muslim students

association was the first person to ask questions and I said before you start\nWill you condemn his\nAnd he said well my question is too complicated for a yes no way I'm so\nSorry I said okay I'll put

countries having the same um citizenship by Burt situation was an accurate or may not be accurate I I'm not able to research or not but here's what I Want to emphasize\nThe Donald said we are the only country right and he's wrong and and your dictated on your on your show right now at least thirty five country correct that's correct okay\nAll all all the way by all the all of which all of which\nBy
