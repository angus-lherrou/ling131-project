Oregon and I would not be able to tell the story in plain language so that everybody could understand it\nAre my law school has been the courtroom\nHas learned an awful lot from lawyers um whenever I've come into a case where there is an issue that I don't understand I ask a lawyer and they're always more than happy to give me a quick course and what it is I'm writing about for instance I covered the Exxon Valdez trial Alaska\nAnd uh besides the fact that I got there it was twenty below zero I had a few other challenges to face which were that the whole case was about maritime law of which I knew nothing\nAnd so I didn't know what to do so I went up to one of the the lawyers for captain ... and I told him my dilemma\nAnd he said don't worry I'm going to tell you everything you need to know and after court we sat down the coffee shop and he told me all about maritime law and whenever I had a question after that he or someone else would answer it\nAnd by the end of that trial if I had to steer that tanker myself I think I could have done it I knew enough by the end\nOf Phil Spector was a little bizarre it was\nHe was so he was\nYeah well that yeah that to those you're covered that I did\nUm okay so as I get it here you are\nGone all through these trials you've tried more cases and move trial lawyers in California and you think these judges or any good\nOh I think judges you know in general are just fine except for the ones that try to throw me out of the\nCourtroom I don't like them very much as they try and talk she out now and they well I've\nHad that experience where I've had to get a lawyer because I just decided for God Knows what reason that the press should not be in there and I know First Amendment law which is very useful to know in my job and so I Will go to a jazz or say you know you can't\nExclude me from the plume Eric hearing because there is the riverside press enterprise case that says I have to be in there and uh and often I'm able to convince them a those are the only judges that I have\nTo ... a couple of taking your down though\nYou know we've always gotten your way as\nWell um you know we've lost things early on and then we've gone to the appeals court in one um\nI think that in the Michael Jackson case we lost more battles than we've lost in any case and it was very sad because among other things to judge prevented us from getting a copy of the indictment I mean the indictment is the basis of the whole case and to seal the indictment was unheard of\nAnd unfortunately because of the way things went down there we got almost all of the documents fast to the trial was over\nHe he may be releasing stuffed to this day it just kept releasing it after it was over and uh and it was useless at that point because the case was over ... been acquitted we didn't need it then\nBut we didn't need it beforehand\nAnd it's interesting because in the end what we're talking about in the OJ case in Vegas we just won a judgment there from the appeals court from the Supreme Court in favor of the press because um we were are not given copies of jury questionnaires\nAmong other things and the jury questionnaires would have revealed that the jurors had these strong feelings against OJ have we didn't know it and had we reveal that it might have made a difference in the case\nTo hook a crystal ball on demand\nAnd I'm Sorry Dave I gotta jump in here but you can't overrule the press can't overrule the judges concept of fairness otherwise you should have been a judge you could have done it yourself do you think now so if he thinks that that's unfair\nSo I'm not saying with the ex saying that we think okay with anybody else thinks I think it's unfair when we don't get the the information because the public has a right to know that\nOkay he gives me ...\nI'm just going to ask the windows a crystal ball take on the Internet versus newspapers cause your name was on millions of times Associated Press all over the world in ten years people are predicting that won't be any more newspapers the ... his name off of uh you you think we're just going all Internet\nI don't think so I don't think there will ever be a time when they were being known newspapers I think that the number is diminishing um people are willing to adapt to the Internet all those certain people are not I know an awful lot of people that say I have to have my daily newspaper in front of me with the coffee or it's not that that day\nAnd I'm afraid I'm In that category I have to read my paper on paper I have a hard time doing the crossword puzzle with my PIN on my right it's very messy yeah so I think that there will always be a print presence\nBut I think that a lot of the newspapers are adapting and are offering their papers online and readers are adapting to they're they're starting to pay for it and that's where it it will come down to whether it becomes\nRoutine a and whether every won't\nBe able to afford to keep printing the news you know what I'm here referred to as the queen of journalism oh well thank you have a you know that in invested in written about use for a long time\nYou have to feel pretty good don't you know here in this very competitive arena and in this arena where the press is frequently referred to as massively unfair and here you stand out\nAs the queen of journalism and even your comments today as we listen to you on did you take a side here who was right who was wrong I think you were genuine and those responses\nI'm just going to report you know great\nWell I appreciate that I got it it is a great it's humbling in many ways and um it's also you know I I also have to realize that I have a lot to live up to and uh and I hope that I'll be able to continue doing that\nOkay

in front of their enemies older plants\nOnly to confuse them only to fake it only to make them do something different and never never really true way of what you're going to do to them\nAnd I think

by a vote at fifty to forty eight\nAnd he is taking his seat on the court justice Kevin hospital at the White House\nSenate confirmation process most contentious an emotional that processes over my focus now is to be the best justice I can be [noise]\nI take this office with gratitude there's no bitterness on the Supreme Court I Will seek to be a force for stability immunity my goal is to be a great justice for all Americans and for all of America\nGreg plugs in of Sri news joined John Hall and Kathy ... onward ethics in in Pittsburgh Greg this has been painful in every regard but Brett Kavanaugh is actually just doing a job\nRight the first day on the bench shut the Supreme Court there were a couple of oral argument cases regarding a prison sentences for for prisoners and I'm so he's off and running and there was a very friendly and good spirited a welcome by the chief justice John Roberts inside the courtroom washing\nThe newest member Kavanaugh out you know along and happy career on the bench and so you're right this was a this was a nice day of relief certainly for cabin on for his family for the White House on the president for all of Kavanaugh supporters but it was a brutal and bitter process\nGreg tell us about what the welcome chief justice Roberts looked like\nWell I was not in the room I've I've read news accounts of what happened you know at the beginning before or arguments begin on any cases that are before the justices that the Supreme Court they sometimes will do some business you know ahead of time they'll swearing\nMembers of the bar they'll make other announcements about other pending cases and then they sometimes just you know make these kinds of remarks obviously they weren't knowledge that they are in the fall Supreme Court mode now nine justices at the ready to hear obviously the Supreme Court when the first week\nOf their fall term with only eight because of the ongoing confirmation battle\nHave any of the justice has weighed in on the cabinet situation\n[noise] yeah it was interesting over the weekend at a previously scheduled event you had justices Kagan and sort of my or um make a joint appearance and I don't remember the name of the conference or the event where they were they were speaking publicly but\nEach of them did raise concerns primarily about the more hardest some anger that was expressed by Kavanaugh on the day that he followed a Christine Blasey Ford's testimony [laughter] um I I don't think that anybody who felt like Kevin hours wrongly accused\nCould really fault him for being angry that day although there were some even some who supported him who thought that\nBy mentioning the Clintons and by going after the Democrats in particular that raise some questions or concerns about temperament and that's what we heard from sort of my or and Kagan they they weren't elaborate remarks about that but they did raise that as concerning mhm\nSo talk about the a standing ovation and Mitch McConnell got when he walked into the proceedings\nYeah Mitch McConnell got a standing ovation I mean it was in it was it was a very interesting Germany and that you have the you know you have the fitting eight justices independence there you have the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy so you've got a lot of\nYou know government star power in the room there the Easter I'm I'm Mitch McConnell he and and you have to remember this is this is a heartless and the White House sponsored GOP friendly audience for this is not like just a general audience ... this was you know\nOne of these are the same\nExactly it was a it was a friendly for him to start with but they looked at McConnell and realized he's done a couple of things that one as he stood strong even though it's been widely reported that Kavanaugh was not his first choice for the president to have made for the vacancy [noise]\nBut then he also lead the way in a very unusual manner and twenty sixteen by not moving forward on President Obama's nominee holding out for the election having Trump ended up winning the election and that of course love the way for Gorsuch so McConnell played a key no very critical role and both of these appointment\nYou got to give it to him I mean for I mean he has been the two chess master\nAnd all that he really has been watching so much of the news coverage over the course of the last few weeks the casual observers or the uproar over\nJustice have enough to be led to believe that this frightening conservative jurists bring politics to the bench in fact the opposite is true\nKevin and justice Gorsuch before him as a judicial philosophy that seeks to keep the courts as much as possible\nThe politics conservatives had for decades now been looking for judges who are strict construction is judges that apply the law\nAnd understand the constitution as they were written with history as our guide that hasn't been easy to achieve Albert Mohler provide some historical context tourists from his briefing program\nBy the time George W. Bush was elected president of the United states in the year two thousand conservatives had had enough of pledges about the nomination of strict construction is judges they wanted proof that justices who would be nominated by Republicans would actually be strict construction is\nThe U.S even going back to the first decade of the century groups such as the federalist society committed to that very reading of the constitution began to grow in importance and influence\nBut then fast forward not to two thousand nine to two thousand eight but the two thousand sixteen when Donald Trump was running for the Republican presidential nomination\nIn an effort to try to demonstrate to conservatives that he should be supported as their candidate he indicated that he would go to the federalist society for a list of judges whom he might appoint as justice\nOf the United States Supreme court it was a list of somewhere around twenty five justices it has been smaller and greater since then\nBut the point is that this was supposed to be made up of judges and legal scholars who had already demonstrated their commitment to originalism and strict construction as him and us then candidate Donald Trump who had previously shown very little interest in the Supreme Court and had one even talked about nominating\nHis sister little liberal federal judge to the United States Supreme court he was then that Donald Trump indicated that he would follow exactly what he had said and he would nominate from that list and only from that list\nWhen President Trump was elected in November of two thousand sixteen he himself subsequent to that election made clear that he believed that the pledge that he had made concerning the Supreme Court was in large part the reason for his election especially for conservative turnout\nThe arguments made by many evangelicals and others to support Donald Trump in the two thousand sixteen presidential election a move that was completely out of sync\nWith the kind of candidate that conservative evangelical ever supported before the argument was made that the Supreme Court is virtually everything and winning the Supreme Court and actually changing the direction of the Supreme Court was so important\nThat it would justify supporting and voting for a candidate unlike any candidate that evangelicals have supported before especially given the moral and character issues that were then involved\nBut what's really important for the sake of history is to recognize that this past weekend is exactly what Donald Trump promised when it comes to the Supreme Court in the United states and it's not only the nominations\nOf Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the court that are important it's not only the fact that they were both thoroughly vetted in their constitutional interpretation it has to do also with the fact that both of them were completely supported by a White House and made very clear\nThat they would not back off of these nominations even under intense political pressure\nOddly enough the confirmation of judge Kavanaugh is due to one of the most unique partnerships in the history of modern American politics the partnership between the Republican president Donald Trump and the Senator Mitch McConnell the Republican senator from Kentucky who is the majority leader of the United States Senate\nIt took the absolute determination of both men to see the Kavanaugh nomination through and sources close to both men were very clear that they both understood that it would be a political battle royal to confirm any nominee\nWho would come to the seat that had been occupied by Anthony Kennedy the understanding was that the cultural left would fight it with everything\nAnd that it would take an equal determination in order to gain a successful confirmation process\nJust moments after the Senate voted to confirmed judge Kavanaugh Robert Barnes writing for the courts and law column and the Washington Post\nBegan his report with these words the cabinet court will be the one conservatives have worked for decades to construct experts say with the loss of the the only question about the Supreme Court's advance to the right end quote no here's where we need to understand that when the Washington Post in the column like this talks about the court\nAdvancing to the right\nConservatives would come back and say no it's not advance into the right it is just returning the court to a motive constitutional interpretation that was implied and required by the constitution when it was ratified they're not trying to take the quarter back to Nineteen forty nine they would argue they're trying to take the court back to Seventeen eighty nine\nExactly right you know the school had a lot of options that it could have offered to this young boy\nA dove giving him a single use the restroom that he has access to\nBut what it should never do adopt a broad sweeping policy that says use whatever restroom you want to go in there when little girls are in there\nAnd that is the danger of these policies was rather than taking a stand and say no we're not going to compromise the privacy and safety of our other students were going to find solutions but we're not going to do it at the expense of everyone else they took the route to say no let's just adopt this broad sweeping policy let's not have the courage to take a stand and say is it's really bad for all of our students\nWere not going to do anything to compromise the safety of ... shows daughter and others like her\nI I didn't think when I when I grew up there we would be in a world that is in some ways a crazy that this is craziness when you when you cannot\nUh have a common sense to say that a five year old should not be given the option to identify as anything other than what he is which is a little boy the idea\nThat this kid is gender food I mean the question is do the doctors say that he needs to be a treated this way did his parents say it we don't really have those facts but the idea that\nThese schools are so afraid\nOf doing something wrong that they're allowing this to go on it really is a kind of madness I think we have to call it what it is it's a kind of madness a but it has to do with religious liberty in this case because ah as the lines defending freedom\nHas said over and over and over uh the people who believe that the men are men and women are women were were were being treated like where this crazy minority when most Americans understand these ideas about these transgender twins have just been pushed on us and here you have a case where\nA this woman ... Thomas ah is is not being treated right now what what what are you in what is the ATF looking for in this case because you said that this woman I'm a I mean who who is suing whom and what are the details of that suit\nAs things stand right now we we had worked with posture to file a complaint with the federal government with the department of education office of civil rights\nAnd we were encouraged to see that the federal government is taking a look at this and launching an investigation into the school district because their concern is not only is you know this is a dangerous policy but they the school district may have violated federal law by\nAdopting this policy not responding appropriately to to what happened in and creating a hostile environment for Bosch his daughter and and other young girls at the school so that's a bright light and all of this is that we now have a federal government is taking these issues seriously and so we're going to continue to work throughout that investigatory process\nBut at the end of the day what we're wanting is a good policy in place when that ensures something like this doesn't happen one that ensures that girl showers locker rooms and restrooms are reserved for girls and the young men and boys don't have access to them\nDo to Christian outlook dot com to hear the rest of that conversation and while you're there sign up for our

Monday on that show Monday at noon on AMA Seventy the answer\nBack to the Christian outlook I'm georgine rice\nSo many of the political battles we face today and the protest movements on college campuses claim victimhood and oppression\nEssentially claiming that group a has harmed or threaten the dysfunction is that each party and the victim classes is humid and that's deserving of dignity I rent every hyper pushes this point further and his conversation\nWith Don crow type or the president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University was a guest on waiver in Washington DC\nThis is my guest describes in his opinion piece of the Washington Times titled you must be singular or be damn he says the sirens of many progressives who are left of center seems clear there's so much more that's wrong with the world than abortion\nMe women alone to make their choices and let's move on to solve societies real problems Dr Pfeifer it's always an honor to have you on the show and you proceed in your column by basically saying let's not argue about our critics claims let's just ask you questions\nAnd maybe take a look at a few very real and stubborn fact so let's go there what do you say\nWell here's a I think one of the best ways to debate us to follow the model of Jesus and often in the face of the conflict twin somebody was challenging am Saddam guy the guy that was smarter than anybody else in the room arguably so\nHe's got incarnate himself he knew how to win debate he knew the answer but often if not almost always Jesus simply ask questions so let's try doing what Jesus so let's ask the left a progressive ... a few questions and here's one if you feel conservatives and Christians are too concerned with abortion and\nPay too little attention to the more endemic problems of the world like gender equality on social justice and human rights why do you think\nYour list injustices has any merit in other words what\nGives you the right to put together this list\nAnd uh so recently barons named more your paypal host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors actually now for the seven year in a row\nAnd I'm very proud of that designation but without our clients that would be no where at all so all your clients listening right now thank you so much\nA if you're not a client I encourage you to go to our website it as money matters dot net money matters dot net you can learn more about us we have podcasts of the show you can go back to listen to a we have articles on retirement planning topics we have videos on the same so\nWe have all kinds of stuff on there that I think you can benefit from um this is a part of the show where we talk about estate planning we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and we do this because money isn't\nEverything but it sure keep the kids in touch does it not that I'm a real sports happy\nAnd that's what we want we want happy squirts\nLadies and gentleman you don't want to see unhappy squirt says not a good thing okay so we weren't happy squirts anyway this is a time when we talk about estate planning and so we're going to talk about this week the dynasty trust and I think the dynasty trust is one of the most powerful\nEstate planning documents there is I really do and so we can talk about that but before we do it jak can you play it I Know I\n\n\nMy fog and may be and\n\nI knew him\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes in probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite and we don't want that to happen to you so therefore\nEvery week at this time we have our state tip of the week now this we were going to talk about the dynasty trust which is a kind of trust that will hold the inheritance that you lead to the aforementioned greedy and washed undeserving airs for up to a hundred years\nAnd not only that it'll protected from lawsuits divorce and state taxes during that entire time so wow Mr Spock it is also very logical thing to do I think so let me describe to you the way it works a dynasty trust basically\nIsn't it its own separate entity okay so it has its own tax id you have to create it\nAnd you can create a junior lifetime while you're living or it can be tested ... which means that it is in your will upon your death they read the will and it says create the trust so it can be done that way as well now the dynasty trust is what you put money into okay now once it's in the trust\nNow what happens is it could stay in that trust as I said for up to a hundred years and during that time it'll be protected from lawsuits and and divorce and the state taxes why\nWell because for example let's say that ah you know your your daughter gets a divorce [noise]\nWell your ex son in law is not divorcing to trust he's divorcing your daughter\nAnd so therefore the trust the money that's in the ... the inheritance that you left behind is not available to the former son in law or because\nThere's no no no liability they're also in a lawsuit if your child goes bankrupt same thing they're suing your child they're not so into trust therefore the trust is immune from that\nAnd then also you have a state taxes estate taxes in the end the dynasty trust a ... it's called the generations giving tax truck because it skips generations when it comes to taxes so it's a very powerful document in that regard\nNow while they're living they have access to the money as trustees your children or whoever you've named as the beneficiaries can receive that money from there and it and therefore they can choose the investments that they want to use\nAnd they have access to the money for what's called health education maintenance and support him H. E. N. S. and you know hands is basically covers I mean what what does that not cover health education maintenance of sport is pretty much everything right\nSo it is a very powerful document I think it's one that uh anyone who has let's say over a million dollars in in assets that they want to leave behind do they're greedy and washed undeserving air should be thinking about but even if you have less than that it might be of interest if they are real estate or something like that\nSo talk to you or a financial people talk to your attorneys before you do any of this stuff but I think it's something for you to consider\n\nWell Dorothy I've got something else that's two wonderful to be true and that is that if anyone listening to the show right now would like to talk to one of our financial advisors
