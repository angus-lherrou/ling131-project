{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "On the other hand you know I think we know that\nA part of what is important about movies is is not necessarily a you know how well they jibe with exactly what the law is but what kind of message they send about lawyers or judges or the legal system you know what is the image that the viewers they're left with and so we try to talk\nA little bit about that what is this film\nWhat is its message about justice what is its message about how\nUh lawyers are because I think both of those aspects of film or are important\nLawyers are easy targets politicians love to talk of lawyers trial lawyers particularly but lawyers why with ... with the law and\nWith lawyers being such an important part of our whole judicial system are American\nWay of life why are they not thought of more highly\nWell I I think uh [noise] from my perspective I think your rights as an empirical matter that lawyers are not thought of a\nTerribly highly usually when they do\nA you know sort of public surveys as to uh uh trustworthiness or who would you trust to a professional as like a pilots and pharmacists surprisingly\nA and a very high on the list a and lawyers are tend to a and a half\nA much lower on the list that you know down with the actors\nAnd and I think maybe that's one problem for lawyers that day or you know in on television and movies that these are actors portraying lawyers well there you have to have a at least highly thought of a professions a mixed together maybe that's something to do with it\nYou're listening to champions of justice with dumped already and demand McClintock our guest today is professor Paul Bergman he is a professor of law at UCLA also the co author of real justice the courtroom goes to the movies\n... trial lawyers do a very important job you know if you are a company and you're putting out a product and you're not\nTesting properly you're not warning properly and so forth [noise]\nIs very hard for a good company to compete with you [noise] you're cutting these corners\nAnd the only thing that's going to keep the balance is the trial lawyers and says hey listen you put out this drug and caused all these problems of Andy cause heart attack and stroke you knew about it you have the memo that says this will never see the light of day [noise]\nAnd unless the trial lawyers bring that to the surface [noise] um this other company that's doing the right thing has no ability to compete\nAnd I think that you know the justice system although it you know it has a a few flaws here and there but by and large I think it's a pretty good idea and I think the jury system I think jurors get it right I think jurors understand if a company out there is\nCutting corners and not doing the right thing that they want to make things right so I I have a great respect in regard for how it works\nYou know a few years ago I was doing some law teaching in France at a French a legal University in English luckily\nAnd ah we're actually talking about this uh down in France say the civil countries civilized countries generally\nAre the portrayal of the lawyer that you were just talking about Tom as someone who's a says it's social purpose by holding companies and the government accountable\nUh for a mistakes for not doing things the right way that's not really the role of the lawyer and France and or in the course of by a teaching their I happened to go to Barcelona for the weekend\nPulled up at a hotel and was guided or to park around the side of the hotel on a little deserted street even though the front entrance of the history of the hotel was on a busy main road\nA park there are and was held up\nBecause of the street people know where uh people are gonna go park on this little quiet street while they go to register that's where they hang out and they hold up the\nPeople who stopped there uh well when I came back and resume that teaching in a ... in front of the French law students I said well who might be held accountable for this horrible thing that happened to me and it took them a long time to me to uh [noise]\nThey they were aghast really at the notion I think an American lawyer would see the hotel as partly responsible for that because\nThey themselves were guiding people to go around to this quiet street where they provided no security and on the other hand in the front of the hotel in this busy road there's a dorm and there's the kind of security you would expect to find\nAnd I think they appreciated the sense of a lawyer as kind of the protector of the little guy or in the American system in a way they never would have appreciated without that story\nYou know what um\nIt's a great job being a lawyer that's all there is to it I'm a little surprised that you with this artistic ability with you know looking at all these films and the effect of the films and lawyers are portrayed in the law and so forth [noise] I don't know why you're not a joining or for him and try these cases\nI mean\nWell I'd be why the euro older lawyers that but I appreciate the author ... thank you some I have\nA question for you because we've been talking about the movies we been talking about how lawyers are are portrayed in the movies and of course in all almost all legal uh movies we wait for that one big climactic moment\nIn the courtroom what was your most exciting moment in a courtroom\nWell Dave dino the jury is told when you have a verdict was three times in state court [noise] and\nYou're standing around maybe for a day or two [noise] and then pretty soon those three buses to take place and they do you know I don't care if the cases over twenty five grand or twenty five billion okay this is exciting stuff and you're about to get your report card baby and incomes that jury\nAnd the judge says that the court attended may pick up the verdict so every court attended knows how to take a quick look at it [noise] it can be handed to the clerk\nClerk then looks out at the things about three sentences okay now the clerk looks at it like she's reading war and peace and then she hands it to the judge the judge now\nNot knowing he was going to need his glasses finds his glasses are sitting there they do [noise] and your heart man I don't care [noise] your heart is moving\nHe finally finds his glasses he looks at it then he hands it to the clerk to do may read the bird [laughter] Cirque title of court all cause\nLos Angeles superior case number such as that we've been there for three weeks we owe the case then but we do the case there we find in favor of holy Toledo Dave do you know well it's very exciting stuff\nWell I Want to end a today because we've talked about lawyers when we talked about them in a lot of different ways [noise]\nFun to talk about what a lawyer is from one more movie and it's a very moving scene from the movie Philadelphia\nBefore we listen to this I Will simply say you've been listening to champions of justice with 'em dirty and demanded McClintock\nAnd are very special guests today professor Paul Bergman professor of law at UCLA co author of real justice the courtroom goes to the movies it's available at Barnes and noble and Amazon and all the normal outlets and it has a great read so I encourage you to pick it up\nThis is how we want to end today\nAre you a good lawyer and\nExcel practicing [noise]\nSo what I Love the most about the law [noise]\nThat every now and again not [noise]\nYou get to be a part of\nReally is\nThank you for joining us today here on champions of justice joined us again [noise]\n\nThis pre recorded program or sponsored by Thomas ...\nHave you checked your Google Search results like search results are usually the first impression that people

I left my three kids my wife and my three kids and one is just newly born\nIn I don't know if you let them Honduras Guatemala and I'm going to America and we rent so they're talking about who's paying off their houses by working for a couple of years in America and he goes but uh I think I'm Better off going back home and struggling with them then\nPossibly dying on the way like one of my friends did yesterday so so one guy\nDoubt and one guy died so apparently they're Seventy one hundred and Ninety eight people now in the care that\nRight well I guess the thing has been going from four to six to ten thousand so I guess that means they're picking up people along the way\nAnd it yeah and exactly and if you and if you think about it imagine they everybody just got ... got the idea all at once said let's walk two thousand miles and go to America\nAnd I even thought the same thing like let's say I decided you know and I'm going to walk to Canada or tomorrow and to be like OK yeah and I'm going to do it without any luggage 'cause nobody's carrying any luggage you notice that it I didn't notice that no luggage\nUm you know the the logistics of walking a couple of thousand miles without any form of assistance um yeah but there's definitely some organization going on behind us so that that makes a question I mean who's paying for this who's feeding them where's\nWhere's the food for how long does it take to walk two thousand miles I don't know how far can you actually walk and one day I've heard people talking about thirty miles a day okay thirty miles a day that's three days for every hundred three point so that's a\nThat's actually three that's sick so for every three hundred and ten days so there's a six of those so they're ten times six to sixteen so\nTwo months' worth of food and they're going to wear the same underwear for two months\nYeah well that's that's the thing that's kind of odd I mean they all look pretty good you know what I mean I mean they're they're dress nice it looks almost like a group of tourists more than anything else primarily young I'm young males by the way yeah and er and most of them\nDon't have their families hey you know I left my wife and my three kids in Honduras or a or Guatemala but I think I'd go back well wow how come all of these guys have kids when they get to the border of our country that are out on the along the way is that what you're saying I don't know ... maybe they steal I'm from Mexico ...\nOr maybe they deliver the kids the kids can't walk that far so we're just going to put them in a in a plane flying to fly him to a war as or some place close to the border and uh and work and we'll just drop off you just pick them up to the airport after you walk walk up there for six days I think after six days I'd look like hammered or\nSomething yeah I Would be on my hands and knees I think are by the time I Would get to the border these guys look first there there are certainly got enough energy to hop over barricades and again there are still just accept like who's paying for all this where do they shower where they go to the bathroom\nI you know they were talking a massive massive coordinated effort it's like a it's like a bike it's on you know that they have little checkpoint some with with snacks\nOr you know the Haiti stations yeah they have the\nThe stations where you check in and people who are the marathon they they ... they hand you a water bottle while you're walking you dump it on your head or drink it and now here's here's an energy bar\nYeah but that that's a marathon we're talking like a couple of thousand miles here yeah yeah well I'm just saying well I think and they just organized somebody organized this\nSaying no I don't I don't anybody out there thinking don't and I'm not saying I assume everybody listens our show things so I said and I'm when I say I don't think\nThat this thing is just spur of the moment everybody just decided to go or things just got bad in Honduras or things just got bad in Guatemala and they just they had to get out it's it's organized but I'm saying I say that too because I Know you guys think exists in the show but don't let your kids think\nOr your neighbors your co workers things to say hey you know what\nWhat do you think and everybody just got a oh let's just go\nI'm leaving my wife and my kids are I'm leaving all my belongings and I'm not taking if I have a car I Can't take it 'cause I Can't get them across the border and uh and plus I Would rather just walk and um 'cause it looks cool or on TV and uh what else\n[laughter] yeah I I don't know they do well and yeah that sounds stupid well the other thing\nThat did Jimmy didn't make any sense that they're flying to Honduras flags at least I think that's the hunter and flag I don't really know exactly but it's like why are you flying the Honduran slack I mean isn't that the reason you're leaving the first place because it sucks there\nYep exactly no but I you know they won't be refugees by the time they get to our place\nAnd of course ah some of them speak English but they won't be able to speak English by the time they get to replace earlier in the week President Trump took a lot of heat for the sweet that he put on Monday he said sadly it looks like Mexico's police and military unable to stop the caravan heading to the southern border the United states\nCriminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in I have alerted the border patrol in the military that this is a national emergency must change laws\nSo you know for so for those of you for those of you don't know uh you know Trump just signed into or just a negotiating off it's officially signed the the U. S. M. C. A. the United states and Mexico Canada agreement which is a a revamp of the of NAFTA north North American free trade agreement\nAnd he's saying hey you guys either stop these guys in Europe or you're in your country before they get to ours or\nThat that agreement thought and and we're every every man for himself in the in the national trade and ah I guess they tried they made some kind of an effort to try but they can't they can't hold them back where reporters pressed Trump on Tuesday the president doubled down on what he said\nUh threats against Democrats as we wake of the string of terror threats aimed at prominent Democrats and guess who's getting blamed\nIf you look at who they've targeted so far it's almost like they're following Donald Trump's Twitter feed we\nAre in an era now where violence seems to have a license by the president can the United states\nThe president certainly has encouraged to kind of rhetoric is what happened when the president calls the enemy and the people\nAnd if anybody ... daresay that it was set up by the Democrats as an October surprise uh you're automatically dismissed as a conspiracy theorist but\nWhat else would be for you know you got you got like twelve bombs that were delivered none of them went off ... none of them went off at all\nYeah one thing we can say is the guy's a lousy bomb or whoever this was and it looks like we're always finding the identity of this I actually read before you can go on the air or just learning who this person actually had exactly\nSo let's let's do a recap and then we're going to break for a for a ... a bird some commercials but here's the recap on Monday a pipe bomb was sent to the home of someone we talked about earlier George Soros the ... the devices discovered it source home and\nKept in a New York Wednesday morning three similar devices were found address to the ...

with me as quite often Mr Scott McAfee owner of a Scott's bikes and a second most prominent a political commentator\nIn the country that's right you said Scott Scott bikes though I said what you said Scott's bikes it shouldn't be Scott spices Don's by thank you at man [laughter] man that's this is the second time I've done it and always counting Scott Scott and migrate care of and who's counting exactly Scott Scott's\nBeen hanging out with me here for several years so it's like a home away from my exactly you know it's a cause my alter ego a so anyway we've been talking about the uh we talked about the caravan and now we're talking about all these bombs that are going up every well that none of them are going off\nIt just seems curious to me that\nAll these bombs arrived and let's see there's like twelve of them a Wednesday ah so it's a twelve I'm so between Wednesday Thursday and friday all these bombs being delivered pipe bombs and none of them have exploded\nRight which again as I said the last half he's obviously a lousy bomb maker and thank God they didn't go off obviously but it begs the point I mean or were these bombs were not intended to quote go off so what was the purpose of them then\nI think so I don't want to say October surprise but I I think\nI think the Democrats will number one I think I think someone in the Democrat world thinks that sending that care of and I was going to ah create some and just specifically targeted at our at our mid term voting day to get here um I think that\nThey thought that they were going to create some scenes that people are going to feel sorry for all these people coming up and vote against Trump and vote against the Republican Party vote Democrat\nI think it's had almost the opposite effect to look\nIf if the Democrats think that the majority of people in the United states want this massive influx of people in here from\nFrom other countries I mean look even the people that are here illegally now don't want more illegals coming in right because they ought to compete for the same jobs the same resources are we all have to you know share the same roads and fruit did they did they really want more people pouring in I don't think so and\nI don't think so either and now and now I think they're starting to figure out that ah the early polls the the early polls empty the early that people are early voting they're starting to see that hey you know between the the the Kevin out there that I'm going to say the crap they did to Brett Kavanaugh\nThis all the all the shenanigans or pulling their is starting to backfire on 'em in and people are saying hey you know the Democrats are just out of control we're voting Republican and uh so now they want to change the narrative so now it's let's set up the let's set up the uh the Republican so it looks like\nThey're bombing the Democrats so on a on Wednesday the president delivered multiple statements on the threats this was a statement from the White House\nIn these times we have to unify to come together\nAnd send one very clear strong mistake bull message that acts of course the rest of the political while as many times have no place in the United states of America [noise]\n\nLet's say you're in ... when I can tell you from both sides we both agree on that\n[noise] yeah but the liberals continue to say the president encourage this to happen with his rhetoric here's a Maxine Waters it'd be probably five who tells a Democrat to harass Trump supporters in public\nI think the president of the United states\nShould take responsibility for the kind of violence that we're so for the first time in different ways I think the president at the United states if they don't listen to his constituency making them believe that their problems are caused by those people over there and\nRaise taxes except for the bonds hundred and forty million dollars per year um won't raise taxes it'll help people off the streets and into comprehensive mental health services an addiction treatment homeless advocates social workers doctors and emergency responders agree yes onto the con is\nA takes up to five point six billion dollars away from a severely mentally ill to fund bonds to build them a just housing and without requiring treatment so they're going to take five point six billion dollars\nAnd I just put housing up for um doesn't do anything to treat them for their disease and a will for so many people into many more people into homelessness\nIt's unnecessary because last year legislator authorized county use of M. S. M. H. S. A. funds for housing\nIs again the it's it's a it's a money grab for the state to come up with a solution the solution is a a revised HIPAA laws so we can actually do something for these people because most of the homeless people want to be homeless [noise]\nWell I mean it's it's a cordless this is a complex problem it's a combination of drug addiction mental illness and people that as you said maybe just want to be there so the answer of building you know the public's subsidized housing for them as a solution to know the answer is no\nSo vote no on two K. number three authorizes bonds to fund projects or water supply and quality watershed fish wildlife water convenience it's this is going to say save some more uh save some more a selfish melt the smell K authorize\nEight point eight seven seven billion in state government general obligation bonds for various infrastructure projects\nFiscal impact increased it costs to repay bonds averaging four hundred and thirty million per year over the next forty years you know what the state will never recovered from all this stuff\nThe the the yes on three people say secure safe reliable and clean water for California provide safe drinking water repairs unsafe dance you know what they should have done this years ago ... repaired the dams before they before they broke the should a repair the ladies before they broke\nAnd uh they shouldn't be sending our water from northern California out into the Pacific ocean to save the delta smell\nAnd or the fish will migrate where they need to migrate and uh but the ... the state of California and he has a farmland that needs water and uh somebody in Sacramento has no brain\nAnd somebody all over the country or doesn't investigate anything when they uh when they vote 'em the cons against it will not produce one drop of new usable water interest payments on the bonds will double the amount of has to be repaid the bond holders or\nKnow the answer is no use the delta ... for fish tacos ...\nGet more people eat a and people drink cars will not use a will use the water it will grow food K authorized bonds funding construction hospitals provide\nThe children's health care uh the the pros California citizen California's children's hospitals provide specialized care for over two million children each year\nCancer sickle cell organ transplant no matter what families can pay eighty five percent of children with leukemia are hurt or cure proposition for increases the capacity\nThe you know what the people at Loma Linda are saying vote yes for it because they're going to get a hundred and thirty five million dollars that it is\nBut if I work construction yes towards construction on their new hospital for seismic or for the for seismic retrofit so hey they came up with new government uh um regulations on how they're building it it's going to cost an extra hundred and thirty five million so instead of\nInstead of a somebody coming up with a hundred and thirty five million or getting ready to the regulation uh they're uh they're just going to say hey we're going to we're going to\nA fund these children's hospitals by and\nIt's a it's a waste there's somebody needs to have some a common sense and in managing the state of California vote no on for for a vote five is ah for property owners transfer ... I'm just going to the skin to explain that one what this does is for people who are over fifty five\nAnd as well as a severely disabled homeowners a and people that have already contaminated or disaster destroyed properties that allow them to move\nAnd keep their tax and their tax rate\nWhat they had so you got people that bought their houses for a hundred thousand dollar an hour five hundred thousand they need to be moved to someplace else as they get elderly but they can't because they went from the cars if they go from another one five hundred thousand dollar house they paid a hundred thousand for\nThem to a new five hundred thousand dollar house that might be a lateral move\nTheir tax rate will go from that fourteen hundred dollars a month or two or six thousand or fourteen hundred dollars a year up to six thousand and they can't afford that allows people to move\nAnd take their uh their tax rate with them\nA lot of people are saying we're going to lose ... billions of dollars in ... in tax revenues by the property taxes staying low but you know you forget to where they're already paying fourteen hundred dollars a year on a five hundred thousand dollar house someone's going to buy that thing for five hundred thousand in the tax rates go up on that it's good it's good for real estate and in California\nAnything else real estate helps everybody\nSo yes on fire [noise]\nSix is the gas tax\nThey tried to tell you that this is about uh about uh repairing roads and if we say and if we vote on this where are we are going to have potholes we already have potholes\nThis is a this is about repealing the gas tax that made the uh the taxes go up a twelve cents a gallon for gasoline and twelve twenty cents a gallon for diesel and uh and it set some new rules so that\nThe the state government can't just arbitrarily raise taxes on things like a DMV registrations in gas without having the people up\nFor it yeah the biggest biggest problem for me on this thing was that it was put on it was put out there without even a vote and if you allow these people in Sacramento just arbitrarily pass laws without people voting where's it gonna stop that definitely where we're looking at a a yes on prop ...\nExactly K prop seven or as for daylight savings time we uh we had a little bit of a debate on this because ah what is this really do so saying that have some people think daylight savings time just confuses people because twice a year we have to move our\nClocks forward and are twice in a ... or moving back uh it throws people off you know they're they're late for their meetings or they're or they're\nThey come early they could have slept an extra hour when they when they end up showing up early or whatever his youth throws off your body clock um there's arguments for both pros and cons for daylight savings time and when we looked at it you know a yes vote on this just says hey the state can change if they want\nTo right you're right it doesn't actually change it I Am in favor of change again having one freaking time because it does screw up everybody's clocks that does make people ate it cost millions or an untold inconvenient says the whole idea is stupid or in a lot of states don't have daylight savings time either we should we on saying yes on prop seven huh I'll probably\nVote yes on it that has just hey we can change their mind later so it's a it's all just they can vote on it and change if we want um I think uh Arizona\nArizona doesn't have daylight savings time and neither does Hawaii and the I think there's one or two other states seem to hurt them at all it doesn't seem to hurt him a\nProposition eight regulates out patient kidney dialysis clinic\nUm this is a no uh we don't want the government a telling people telling the the dialysis people um what they can do what they can't do the more the government gets involved in\nIn health care of the more the government gets involved in anything it costs four times as much the government skimming off this stuff because the people that are that are directing the money\nThe people that are directing the money it's not their money and so they just waste it costs it takes twice as long four times as much cost\nAnd ah and we don't want them getting in the way of people actually getting a dialysis they're going to try and try and make it make it totally fair totally fair guess what just keep the government out of it and let the free market a fix things people go where they get taken care of and uh people that have kidney problems that need dialysis need to just not\nBe screwed with or you can if you if you have to have any health care issues and you you know what they're doing to prescription drugs or if you're not if you're if you're not upset with that it's because you don't have any prescriptions\nK proposition can is ah rent control expands local government's authority to enact rent control um there is there are laws in the state about rent control what you can do this is going to take\nOver the the ... the rental part you're going to find if or if this passes you're going to have a a ton of of uh people just get out of the rental business and you're going to you're going to get out of the rental business um there's going to be no incentive to buy you're going to see a ton of properties come on the market\nAnd uh you can see prices go down there's gonna be the prices of houses probably going to go down\nTo is going to be flooded kinda like when a um Reagan made made some changes on on the taxes in Nineteen eighty six\nSo I think it was and uh everybody dumped all their rental properties cause he change some of the the loopholes that people were enjoying on having rental properties\nSo vote no on ten

rhetoric or the rhetoric of a of the media identified as a a a as a problem it was just really outrageous and you know we have to keep everybody in our prayers and needless to say though we we you know we cannot tolerate a society\nIn which a these are disputes or be settled by violence\nThat is the polar opposite of what our constitutional system was about\n... and the opportunity to resolve these issues peacefully\nTo particularly effective way to transition of power in a in a peaceful way\nThis was what the American Revolution was about in this in large part is will we continue to fight for\nA throughout the world does for the rule of law for constitutional of free speech and a ... or a rational argument you're not gonna come back to many of these things but it is a stark reminder to us that our freedom once you get is not free\nNobody just gave us our freedoms and the first place that is a safe from God we know that God gave us or give us our freedom is inherent in our nature\nBut no political system handed us guarantees of that of those freedoms\nWe had to go out and fight for them and no one is just going to magically keep our freedoms in place now we're going to
