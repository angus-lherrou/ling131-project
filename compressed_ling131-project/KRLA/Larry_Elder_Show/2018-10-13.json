All right and the end on a lighter note I couldn't help but ah but they do actually the first time I remember hearing the name Kanye West and\nIt was a when I was doing radio in Savannah during the Iraq War\nThe folks you saw in a Baghdad toppling the statues of Saddam Hussein heroes among heroes those are the third if the third Infantry Division third id at Fort Stewart just outside of savannah\nJust amazing people and outside of the tourists that come to savannah it's a major military town everybody is either friends or family was somebody serve it and back then somebody who was overseas\nSo when we have the Iraq War going on it was important with all the major updates to get the information out to all of our radio stations we happen to have a a urban station a rap station there was a young rapper they are in the afternoon\nAnd uh he was playing in in ... is from Atlanta and so he's got a big deal in Georgia you just starting to become a big deal I think nationally about that time to anyway I'm supposed to be going in there to do this major update on the third Infantry Division and the Iraq War\nAnd I go in there and this young rapper is doing his thing and he's all worked out and then he is coming over to me out of a Kanye West dog\nAnd he couldn't remember my name and he went it's it's it's Whitey with the news\nAnd I became Whitey with the news\nAnd [laughter] I managed to hold it together long enough to give the the update but after that we kind of turned it into a thing and for ... for many couple of years that was in Savannah he would end up

to law school the president has apologized to Jewish students over recent controversies [noise] what controversy and one of the worst run states have in common\nAnd I think you know I'm going with that one [noise] but first we're going to talk about\nWhat happened yesterday with [noise]\nKanye West and the president and how Kanye West has been called Sambo by TI\nWho's not exactly in my play list [noise] he's been called a token negro by a pundit on CNN [noise]\nAnother punted on CNN said Kanye West quote is what happens when negroes don't read close quote and when Kanye West mentioned in the oval office that he had some mental issues with bipolar\nDisorder they were laughing I thought this was the network that cared about people's feelings about mental illness and wanted us to make sure that people who are mentally ill sought treatment because after all a lot of the\nRecent gun shootings have been done by people who had some issues and have people been more aware and perhaps and I've been a stigma maybe the government might have gotten out I thought that's what you guys thought but I guess not that when it comes to a\nBlack when the gate somebody who dares to talk about the welfare state of the connection between that and lack of fathers somebody who dares to say that if he said yesterday the issue with guns is not illegal is not legal guns it's illegal guns I have a right to keep and bear arms I was a short conversation wasn't it\nIn for Kanye West Adair suggests that he had an issue because he grew up without a father\nWhen the person who sat in that Oval Office for eight years wrote a book about his difficult relationship with his father and how he earned his own father and his house I'm Talking about rock Obama\n\nAnd it's been fascinating watching all these people ridicule somebody who has the care issues do dare bring up the number one social problem in this country and in a climate change\nIt's a number of people growing up with out fathers and this is an issue that cuts across racial lines although with far more acute and the black community than anywhere else except for Native Americans living on reservations\n\nWalter Williams says you look at census report Eighteen Ninety Nineteen forty a black kid was slightly more likely to be raised my mother and father than a white kid\nSo perhaps it's long overdue for us to maybe have a

set about Democrats they might give you something for nothing and when you try and get something for nothing you almost always end up getting nothing for something\nMaybe just me and my dad was where I'd\nWant to have a discussion but I Know not all that was the way to kill this guy\nHe I actually used to a record with him did something with him and now since I'm embarrassed ever work with you you don't have a discussion about this became ever talk about this\n[noise]\nHere's what gets me\nOver on MSNBC her they were ridiculing him and ridiculing him when he killed him do you know what the most watched cable network for blacks is MSNBC and I've read that MSNBC hall about thirty percent of the ratings for black viewers\nViewed as the top cable channel watched by black in America and that is why you have people like Chris Matthews constantly constantly putting out the race card only to admit when it's gone down\nThey didn't believe it how do I know that here is what he said they before yesterday listened very carefully\nBut I Do understand President Trump is as much as any of us do it we shouldn't do that than it does the thing and they get in the contest of ideas and politics than the other people don't do area studying what a hip hop guy who apparently is it's got some sort of bizarre\nBecause this was just yesterday this is Chris Matthews explaining why and his view al ... was was invited to the oval office\nOur politics that fine I think it's also it's it's runs against the idea that he's a racist that runs against the Trump like minorities that he's going after her Ronan going after a Maxine Waters going after the usual suspects did you get your comes it will and politics\nAnd it's sort of a racial way and Harriet flipping it I think if people but mainly it's for white people because white people won't vote for a guy most of them that they think they're racist\nDid you hear that mostly he invited Kanye West in the oval office for white people because white people most of them won't vote for somebody if they think he's a racist says Chris Matthews if that's what you believe in why that you were constantly saying things like this\nHe said today America First there was not just a racial\nI mean they are but I should say racial the Hitler areas of backgrounds are nothing about human rights I think about gender rising to hear from a Democrat\nAnd Russia and that's a serious thing did you notice anything sort of ethnic about his attitude and answering your questions wasn't it wasn't it said something about they have all the three hundred and some executions in Texas and they were on Syria I remember that was something that may have pretty data Trump clearly and say I think you think it is\nMaybe what is it going up to the football players father I mean uh I I don't get it he just seems like there's a certain aspect he likes to go for people of color or sometimes I I notice a pattern\nI'm Sorry I notice it by then there's the brutality to a ... as an added to the ethics each of the racial thing should be ... I think his love on saying throw them out to lob the top where these people that anything that suggests that sort of an ... you know that that's just sort of point of view\n[noise] went to one of my high school reunions\nOne of my classmates comes up to me and says I really enjoy your show don't believe or anything that you are but you say but I find it very entertaining and I and I and I know that you don't believe what you say either Indian smile on his face if you have to say I know you're just saying stuff because you can make an income for you\nAnd I didn't smell back\nAnd I said uh would you mind telling me what you think that I don't believe\nIn and he stopped smiling you realized that he had\nSaid something that I found a little little Simpsons I repeated I said I get that a lot tell me what you think I said that I don't really believe two out of a robot law\n\nChris Matthews is clearly saying a bunch of crap she doesn't believe\nHow does somebody\nCall Trump or racist called Trump's supporters of racist and then say the average white person would not vote for somebody if they thought he was a racist\nWhite\nBut I Do understand President Trump do as much as any of us do it was just among he does that say they don't the thing and they're getting a contest of ideas and politics but the other people don't do area sitting with a hip hop guy apparently is as got some sort of bizarre politics that time\nI think it's also it's it's runs against the idea that he's a racist it runs against the either in terms of like minorities that he's going after her relatives I after a Maxine Waters going after the usual suspects if you will and politics and that sort of a racial way and areas flipping it I think if people but mainly it's for white people\nBecause white people won't vote for a guy most of them if they think they're racist\nHe knows that Joe Biden does it look as these guys are all about\nMan the Republicans don't want one of the class people voting on black folks vote and look at what we're doing now\nThey know damn\nWell the average person in this country not places it's all about convincing black people that the average person in this country

Sunday list in\nFact I don't know why it was because he was the fastest heavyweight I've ever seen and I tried to stay out of the way of most of the you know every time\nYou also thought he was fun and entertaining Kirk and the reason I mentioned that is because surely before or a ... minute Lee died a very close friend of his told me that they were watching the news and uh this is during the the twenty Fifteen his job at the time around and they're twenty Fifteen I think it was\nTwenty sixteen early and he asked um Mohammed Ali who he supported for president\nAnd you know who he said no

isn't a sellout an Uncle Tom when Mohammed Ali who's embraced\nLoved by the black community or support supported Donald Trump and I'm either nobody knows that um Mohammed Ali supported him or because

... per se but what Kanye West has dealt with Donald Trump is what other people have died who gravitated in his in his orbit which is just shower him with adulation for what reason I have no idea um but my issue with Kanye West is it's quite simple\nElements that anti intellectualism simply isn't cool and Kanye West these issues as you say to these issues that they're going to talk about our our issues that are that are central issues and many African American community they're very important issues for the fact is we're not sending Kanye West of the White House to talk about these issues because he can't he doesn't have the depths to\nI Want to hear what Kanye West wants to do that when we're talking about criminal justice reform or prisoner reentry the fact that he cannot he doesn't have that that just the other day\nHe was talking about a dozen programs and how we needed to have more than programs and had to turn around and ask his colleague what ... me with what happened is way which is what happens when they grow don't read 'em and then we have this now\n... what happens when the girls don't read ...\nI mean it is it's kind of ... because he made a ... really good point the

here's what he said about Kanye West\nIs white supremacy by been true of course I'm a black mouth is moving but white races ideals are are flowing from Kanye West smiles Kanye West is engaging in one of the most in the various practices and yet\nAll black body and brain are the warehouse for the articulation end the expression of it and see black sentiments I don't know how much more I can take her\nTo find them after that you notice they didn't talk about the guy sitting next to Jim Brown yeah mhm not one single word it's been mentioned about him and he would fit right next door\nAnd he also Jim Brown said that he does not want to denigrate the flag or in where he playing in the NFL today he would not be taking the neat\nPart yeah not a word has been said about ...\nWe got him he can have it a little bit uh in in black media but not not the way Kanye West has been hammered\nNo Michael Eric Dyson also said this Kirk listen to this\nI miss the old time gay understood that we're dealing with serious insidious forces undermining the gates who joined with genes easy to talk about you know a black excellence and the quest for black accidents and that was being road blocks\nI missed the ... who loves to taco say just the other day I got Lynch bought some cricket cops into their state\nIn sync up going to be getting major pay when I get my check they take in Texas we\nWe

start talking about we need to focus more on the communities that have not benefit you know maybe get some jobs some industry or something in those areas made perfect sense to me\nOne of the things you said was that wearing the mega had made him feel powerful he felt like Superman he said because he grew up without a father and wearing the mega kept gives him a sense of power\nAnd David Gergen a
