N. N. E. R. M. C. I. T. Y. L. A. W. dot of Archie [noise]\nInner city law fought a large out orgy\nYou are listening to champions of justice we're talking with Adam ... the executive director of the inner city Law Center of Los Angeles and Greg Spiegel director of strategic initiatives Tom ... Solomon or your host heavy\n[noise] you know just as a plane of ... pro bono hours that many layers on are giving to the ... I Can't say first hand on\nHaving some of our young lawyers participate and homeless veterans project and these were young players that get out of ... really wanted to be an advocate and ... gap where you're amazing staff\nAnd were trained how to help homeless veteran they focused on winning\nAnd it was so delightful to see these young lawyers come back I had my first client I had my first have to teach and we wind and it really just went fetch a win win situation for everyone and you see that time and time again\nYou know if there is the prejudice against homeless hey you're homeless because us around you took whatever [noise]\nYou can't be prejudiced against homeless vets the reason that they're they're a man they were protecting us they were getting hurt they were getting those mental issues because of us and then they come back and now they're unable to get work and so forth [noise] these people didn't choose this route\nAnd boy if there's ever been in an area that\nWe have to help or those people that did everything for us and now they're in a terrible way\nI think that's right time and I think it just to add to that there's a on the way people can help if you're a landlord\nRight now because of the influx of resources to help folks who are homeless and veterans who are homeless in particular there are quite a number of families and our veterans who have vouchers\nThat will pay for rent for having trouble finding apartment because of our low vacancy rates and so if your landlord as renting an apartment and you were willing to accept one of these vouchers and rent to a veteran or to a low income family who's either in danger of homelessness was become homeless\nA that's a way that you could be helpful as well\nAmerica's homeless are growing older also with gray and so to speak of America's homeless that means they're even more vulnerable are they not\nThat is correct David is that the baby boomer generation\nComing to age where we're seeing folks are more and more on the streets from that generation and it's a looming problem I'm not just because it's heartbreaking and homelessness always is but because that group is also moving into a time in their lives when they need more health care\nAnd more health assistance and living on the street just incredibly damaging to your health so\nWe are facing not just a human problem but also a health health crisis in very costly healthier if people\nAre getting older no question about it happened to me every year to [laughter] I'm\nIn uh in jury instructions or the person had a permanent injury at the end of the case the judge would say in the first was fifty years old [noise] uh about how long it's going to take with this perimeter injury of a male age fifty will live to be\nAnd we looked at the stats in Nineteen sixty six [noise]\nAnd the fifty year old male was due to live to sixty seven [noise]\nAnd now if you look at the new ... the fifty year old male is due to live to eighty six\nI mean a huge change over the you know two or three decades [noise]\nSo you have certainly the grain of America is president and than for these people could be one thing if you have some real bus guy who's homeless while he can get back into the workforce for these other guys you know Seventy years old Seventy five years old it's much harder for them\nAbsolutely and they're going to need assistance and there's probably need it for the rest of them less\nOkay here's the story both of you are coming back next year [noise] and he's going to be here I'm going to be here David you know it's going to be here [noise] okay let's just start with you Adam I'm what have you done the past year [noise]\nHopefully we have a much less homelessness and the county of Los Angeles to the new investments and perhaps more importantly we have a ... a source of revenue and funding so that we can be implementing the planet's going to take time\nTo dramatically decrease our homelessness in Los Angeles and I would love to see that because we've been successful at that we've been able to shift more of our efforts to preventing people from becoming homeless right now a lot of our efforts are focused on people who are homeless how do we get them back in there how they how do we get them back on their feet\nAnd I would like to see us get past that problems that we could focus on stopping families from becoming homeless and the first place [noise]\nGreg [noise] an addition to that it I'm hopeful that in communities throughout Los Angeles that will be permanent supportive housing projects in development and people in the neighborhoods would understand and support that\nHomelessness is a regional problem than require all of us each in our communities helping to provide the shelter in the housing and welcoming it instead of resisting\n[laughter] you know Greg it helps if you're let's suppose you or you have a restaurant\nAnd then you have the bunch of homeless people out in front that's gonna that's gonna negate your businessman just rent on the other hand if there's some place where they can be reasonably put up and do well themselves and you don't have that problem and I understood from the some of the ways you're getting money\nFunding of new projects that are being built that they'll have to be some sort of a attacks on those to help the homeless and quite honestly that'd be a good thing for the guy to do to make sure that the homeless or some place other than camping out in front of his restaurant\nThe threat these solutions aren't simply for the homeless person themselves we are all going to benefit we're going to live in a more functional city it'll help business it helps property values were all going to win and that has been a very interesting much more than interesting though hopefully it's been a very helpful our for\nAll who are listening and in helping to deal with the issue of homelessness you've been

Kavanaugh unique fifty one votes the vice president came cast the fifty first voted necessary there was concern that one Republican sitter had a daughter and wedding to attend a tomorrow he made clear\nA sitter days that he will fly back to Washington DC tomorrow evening if necessary to be the vote 'em to be that fifty or\nFifty first vote so that is no longer a a really a concern I let me say this before we get into kind of all of the what ifs as well\nI told you yesterday that and again they're not related to the Democrats they only had one ... defection Joe ... all the rest including some who are facing very tough political battles\nIn states Donald Trump won and Republicans traditionally win state wide and um they just all of the ... and decided to vote against cloture\nAnd let me read some of these comments that came out there were the word temperament I said listen to that from Democrats here senator Heidi Heitkamp from North Dakota she's a no vote now she was one that used to be that group of five to than talks about always the word potential a vote for judge Kavanaugh no longer now\nShe says last Thursday's hearing called into question judge Kavanaugh's Kurt temperament she's voting no\nThe Washington Post editorial board which is no surprise opposing judge Kavanaugh in calling for a no vote says that his judgment and temperament would be in doubt the New York times just comes out and call him a jerk seriously\nThat's the term they used to call judge Kevin a jerk Senator Feinstein says that he's angry at a grass and and the aggression so talking about her but she didn't use the word but Senator Schumer did\nQuestion the confidence to judge Kavanaugh has the tip permit Senator Durbin\nUm uh it's asked me put it on ... how could you trust his temperament center Doug Jones the Democrat from Alabama also a show your temperament it's becoming a judge in sitter Patrick Leahy a he has neither the judgment or the temperament that is just a sample again\nAnd they're not going to let up on this folks I think that the seats we made very clear to you\nThat we have a time period here it's more than twenty four hours for like thirty hours where people like\nJeff Flake and Susan Collins a A R go under the under immense pressure as well as Joe mansion ah from both sides but especially the left right now who is flooding the offices in Washington DC and obviously did have an impact at least ... so they they it sits\nUm I think with the white Lisa Murkowski is claimed she was the only Republican to vote no on cloture she decided that she was walking into the Senate chamber or right before we went on the air they had that vote that ah those protesters did have an impact\nSo I don't think they can impact every senator I think that they probably don't have as much for the impact on someone like Joe Manchin of West Virginia especially with its Hollywood liberals are protesting but they did on in Alaska Senator\nSenator from Alaska Lisa Murkowski now\nThe big question of today is what will Joe Manchin say what will um what will Susan Collins say she's already scheduled a press conference and we'll just like say anything or do we go into tomorrow it it really still not have a clear indication that the votes are there for\nBrett Kavanaugh saying right before I get to the phones I just wanted to make it kind of clear to people you need fifty one votes\nUm he got that today that give to cloture if those votes held he would be confirmed without the need for the vice president he could lose one more and the vice president could be the fifty for ...\nYeah that's right joined in fact if everybody votes as they did today the way this would probably go down as the vote tally would probably actually be fifty to forty nine\nBecause the Danes will not have you back in Washington DC now now you're absolutely correct he said if his vote is needed he will fly back in time to cast it so if you play that hypothetical out so you did you know Jeff Flake or Susan Collins or Joe Manchin\nA flip to know the final tally when it is initially taken will probably be forty nine fifty but they won't close that vote Jordan and in in that scenario you would see Steve Gaines get on a plane to come back from Montana\nAnd at the same time the vice president would have to make its way out to the Senate chamber so if everybody votes as they did today I expect it would be a fifty to forty nine confirmation and if you see the tally a sort of come to a close at forty nine to fifty then it's gonna be holding held open for several hours to get the Danes backdoor and\nAll right I don't want to put words in a sitter college math but she's having this press conference which to me is unique because she she indicated one way by voting yes on culture I think she could have let that stand but she decided to have a after do press conference\nThat hypothetically you lose Susan Collins and if you assume that Lisa Murkowski's that's which you could vote or you didn't have to rely on a job at your to save this nomination\nYeah I I think that's paralysis or Jordan I mean I Know there's a lot of reporting out right now the Joe Manchin has a pretty solid yes because of his race because of how popular judge Kavanaugh is in the state and maybe even some speculation of a party changing after the elections but Jordan\nThat's a very tenuous place for this nomination to be now I won't tell you that it's absolutely impossible for that to happen\nBut look if you go down to the floor of the Senate and the final vote is forty nine to fifty and you're starting to fly Steve the Danes back from Montana like we just talked about and you're starting to bring the vice president over to cast a tie breaking vote can you can you imagine the pressure that would be an Joe Manchin during those hours while that Bo was held open and the delay was\nHanging on his vote look it might happen\nBut that that is not the best path to nomination for judge Kavanaugh the best path to nominate a confirmation productive Kavanaugh is the whole Jeff Flake vote and hold Susan Collins vote and by the way during there there is some reporting coming out right now the Jeff Flake is Tovia quarters that he's a yes on Kavanaugh unless something changes yeah I mean\nThe ... I mean bright things can change the thirty hours of a debate right now it's just started last hour or so ago Jeff Flake is a waiver yes uh but still is leaving it out there to be persuaded to vote against\nAh the nomination I did want answers one called the companies I think this may be a incorrect information may be some confusion with names as well or something that would be totally breaking news ... has not to report it looks good Roberta in Colorado on line for Roberta welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nHigh if I heard correctly Cory Gardner is thirty no encouraging Colorado and say it's called ... Gardner's office and encourage him to vote yes for cap now\nYeah I think that that's incorrect information he's a Republican from Colorado I think you might be confusing\nOr you're in Colorado but don't confuse the Cory there's also Cory Booker in New Jersey fan who is definitely a no vote but I've not got any Cory Gardner whether yes he was a yes vote on cloture he has not indicated all that he'd be a no vote on Brett Kavanaugh\nYeah I think he's a yes on final Jordan I mean there there there was some reporting last night that he was still undecided as of last night but he has since announced his vote so you're either there's some confusion with Cory Booker or more maybe it's thinking back to that story of last night you know\nJordan there were several senators yesterday that came out and sort of made their first public statements like Ben Sasse you know you had some problems with the process\nBut his vote was never in debt in Dallas and I think that's the category put Cory Gardner and I don't think he's somebody you have to worry about at this point\nAt that point if those votes started dropping a you've you've you've got the nomination is duped um so you know you've got to really be able to focus in\nOn these final hours out which we got some questions about these final hours to than we have to be the focus in these final hours of because if you got everybody out there's ... ... let's see if they voted for cloture and that was their first kind of comment on it and they haven't been one of the people who have hung themselves out as I'm undecided throughout the whole process\nI might have ... I Know my total was sharp and I said a few things I probably should not have said hope everyone can understand that I was there as a son\nHas been and dad\nI testified with five people for most of my ... my mom my dad\nMy wife and most of all my daughter's so that again I encourage you to read the entire off into the wall Street Journal I tweeted out posted on my Facebook page it's an op ed that was written by judge Kavanaugh and appeared I just yeah it was published yesterday at this again because she knew that the face three attack\nWas not about the allegations but typically but as I read to you I told you yesterday listen for the words to prevent it appears in all these no votes\nStatements city that senator Heidi Heitkamp which I think she's good by North Dakota or the Washington Post editorial board that says to vote no uses to prevent a New York times editorial board just called him a jerk a very very uh get very uh\n... just a bit of ... these are the kind of terminology certified side uh angered aggression is how she explains it Schumer uses temperament Durban uses ... Doug Jones' Alabama uses temperament so does Patrick Leahy plenty of others have as well as just kind of\nA sample for you as well this is a a good ... what company from Facebook you talked with Saudi and one eight hundred six eight four thirty one to that's one eight hundred six eight for three one was zero\nUh which stood on Facebook I'm surprised that sitter jokes from Alabama voted no on culture\nThan Doug Jones just showed every body that uh you could ... an Alabama senator\nAnd a Democrat or that he is he's got to be voting with the Democratic party are so long as he's a U.S Senate\nYeah he's been showing up for a while and I mean honestly he was never really in play on this one and he's not been on play on a lot of heat up pieces of legislation as well as on the nation's um\nYou know I I guess I Would read the political tea leaves on that a little bit maybe Doug Jones doesn't think the as much of a chance for reelection so he doesn't have to play or to the base in Alabama I'm not quite sure but I Would just I Would just say this I don't think this is the first indication from Doug Jones I think this is a pretty much more of the same of what you've been getting from him since he's been in town not\nListened to today on CNN bite Nineteen\n\nInappropriate\nThere you go for Doug Jones is the temperament issues phase three the question is is faced three successful [noise]\nIt's a question because the cloture vote was so close to that is just the vote to allow a final vote\nAnd just because you vote to allow it up or down vote does not mean you also we're going to vote affirmatively for now many\nThe fish out of the first half hour that you should always allowing\n'em out but again this was fifty one forty nine back or second half hour and they say you live\n\nFollowing the lengthy ...

Democrats voted for cloture that was Joe mansion Lisa Murkowski is from a Republican from Alabama I'm from uh Alaska and Joe Manchin is the Democrat from West Virginia\nWe're taking your phone calls at one of the sixty four thirty one to the final vote\nIs likely tomorrow evening I mean that's was scheduled for a Jeff Flake voted yes if you're wondering that on culture he said he's likely a yes vote\n'em on the nomination unless something changes so he's left to caviar doubt there she was in college was a yes vote as well um she has a press conference scheduled for later today where it's reported\nThat she's going to announce how she will vote\nOn the confirmation or we can play off the Sears for you and we will throughout the second half hour the broadcast as they had been a joy to be a from Washington DC I Do want to get right to the phones people have already been hold on for half hour a Andy calling from Missouri on line three Andy welcome to Jay Sekulow life\nYes how are you doing today hey I'm enjoying it I'm enjoying your program where they got the whole hour here [laughter] but real quick my father my question regards if Kevin uh it was voted down tomorrow\nLooking ahead to Monday morning I'm my thought is known Trump you think he would just come right to the microphones Monday and say okay you didn't like this but and I'm Renee Thompson's town sledding a woman to yeah to run for\nI feel is I think you know I don't want to think past this vote because I think judge Kavanaugh deserves to become justice capital I Hope he does become justice Kavanaugh for his family\nFor him up for our country a as usual philosophy\nA and a and I so I ... for ... you know for those reasons that's my personal opinion so I don't really want to look past that\nUh but I Am also a political realist that this is a a nomination that have the balance could go either way and the next thirty hours certainly um and we have to do before that exactly um or how they come down I don't speak to the White House will take a long time and announcing if they had to\nBut again I don't think we ought to mentally go there yet I'm sure that they're prepared because there could be more vacant they're already preparing for potential for more vacancies on the Supreme Court during the Trump presidency during the first term even\nPotentially so they're ready ah always with a ... they have to be a things happen um\nAnd so because of that they're they are always ready their lifetime appointments but no one knows again I'm sometimes justice retire sometimes to pass away while they're still serving and sometimes it's unexpectedly like in the case of of justice\nScalia one hundred sixty four thirty one Ted we do have a couple of lives that we just got opened by taking some phone calls early in the second half hour if you want to talk to us on the air one eight hundred six eight for\nThree one zero that's what a hundred six eight four thirty one ... said um\n[noise] we have a press conference coming out from Susan Collins\nWe're waiting to see if Joe mansion issues are the kinds of statements um people can follow me on Twitter for that it will be you know I I did was that tweeting on the hearing involving the allegations of making statements about that I Am on the ... the political votes and things like that if it doesn't happen while we're on the air it's certainly the final vote will\nHappen tomorrow but that just briefly we go to this break\nOut competed should capital supporters be right now [noise]\nSo I think they got what they want it today Jordan I mean it was the third or fourth votes he needed on the floor of the Senate I think they'll feel a lot better after Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins go down to the floor as part of this final debate and announced their position assuming it's a yes\nOr but look I think you set it up right I mean this is a margin that really hang on one Republican right now because of one Republican where the flip Jordan or did it all hangs on a Democrat and I don't think a judge Kavanaugh supporters would feel comfortable in that scenario\nFolks we will continue to take your phone calls we come back\nRole of men\nCapital here still suffering you know\nThere are many time wasting\nIn business I call it noise noise prevents you from growing your business the\nTrick is to determine what's real and what's noise\nHere's an example if a payroll salesperson contacts you it's noise I say this because patriot software stealing quickly with our five star rated payroll and we don't have salespeople because our payroll products sells itself\nPayroll is for businesses with up to one hundred employees we handle payroll taxes offer free set up and support and our prices are proudly displayed on our website Go to patriot software dot com used from a code radio and get\nYou know you represent out and I'm thinking about what is Kenny he supposedly has political aspirations after the health and believe that if people are sitting on the phone and doesn't help the fled their online\nAs well yeah I think that was I think that their phone lines are being flooded um I'm not really the position right now I don't think I Need to give up the number because I think that what we've been checking in basically these phone lines for these key senators are are pretty flooded\nThat makes it as a constituent like you'd never absolutely if your constituents Jeff Flake if you're a constituent of Susan Collins or if you're a constituent of Joe mansion you absolutely uh have have the right and and if you have to pick up the phone call the ... you know the other side is doing it right now\nUm and again I think that we can be limited in this I think that most senators are made up their mind\nUh but uh but again there are those handful remaining a Jeff Flake certainly is one of those who is still not been clear a he's kind of said I I play the vote yes tomorrow that's what he said unless something else uh is to occur\nTwenty eight twenty nine hours or for something else to occur uh uh that ... for Jeff Flake that can be just being convinced by someone like Chris ...\nUm so you get a pretty open ended statements would not be nasty this and we want these people to vote in a positive way so I get I'm not going to cast dispersion is all the uh I Do think that they you could say that they have ... these are a sitter to put themselves out in this position\nBy publicly take euros a day or undecided or feel like they're going to vote yes but they're not a hundred percent I'm at a stand up or down our chat that if you can't get to their D.C office called their stayed off especially your constituent if you live in Arizona kick it to the D.C office for Jeff Flake calls Arizona office\nAs well we've got a minute left and they're saying we come back we will focus all on your phone calls which I think it's been great for everybody listening to um I Know that everybody can call into the show but it kind of focusing on uh the key\nIssues in these final ... breakdown in these final hours before you devote to either I put a ... for judge Kavanaugh to become justice capital for ah for for a judge I ... the Supreme Court to be voted down [noise]\nBelieve judge Kavanaugh should become justice Kavanaugh that's my personal opinion\nI support his nomination\nBut it hangs in the balance we just have to be clear about that\nOne eight hundred sixty four thirty one tend to get involved our final segment of the broadcast gonna ACL jaded or two there's a lot\nGoing on we haven't been able to

certainly more\n[noise] but Janice on Facebook right soon as they keep talking about judicial temperament but\nKavanaugh wasn't being attacked as a judge he was being attacked as a person so he reacted like a person and he says that it is often a this was so when he was doing this or a primary for his parents for his\nWife and primarily for his uh his children as well as daughters as well so

have the formal or a swearing in done very quickly what was it that you know immediate time per se on Sunday and then they can be more and more formal kind of ceremony even after that\nYeah I think it would happen virtually immediately Jordan I mean I think he would be over at the court on Sunday whether or not the swearing in half the men are Monday morning if he's confirmed by the Senate Jordan he's going to go to work immediately\nSo yeah so just to answer your question very quickly sure it happens immediately what you would likely be a kind of a small quick of it\nAnd then there would be a kind of a larger of it we're friends and family go um uh that's the case for other nominees huh up but they start to work immediately as Dave said back to the phones we go Stewart in New York on line three store welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nThank you for a while you do if you're supported Israel my question is in the audience Brett Kavanaugh has been a judge has this ever meant that they've been in this you\nKnow I mean he got the highest rating you can get stored for ... the American bar association which is very far to the left politically by the way but when they they they look at these judges they look at the kind of what how how they conduct themselves it's not really supposed to be about it's not supposed to be about judicial philosophy um and he got the highest\nRanking you can from uh the American bar association well qualified so that again there's been no issues about judicial\nTemperament if you disagree with his usual philosophy but no issues about judge Kavanaugh's temperament at all uh brought up personal on the bench at work or throughout his career before big a judge or the twelve years he served\nOn the bitch back to the phones or we go mark is in California on line to Marcus welcome to Jay secular life\nThanks for taking my call before the court\nGot my civil marriage they talk they attacked us\nAnd he said basically\nThat is that is that basically it was it was at least a attempted rape or ... or\nAssault Syria these serious crimes is accused of mark is with no core operation or even after another FBI airport no core operation no one will lead to even say you know say that they they even heard about this ever occurred [noise]\n\nYeah well is it I mean this this is it's politics um the temperament issue again is it was just there next five attack see he's too angry to be on the court I mean they actually say that\nIt's too angry too much aggression to be on the court that that was not him as I get in the city of ... of judicial philosophy there who defending himself there's a big difference uh back to the phones we go stand in Nevada on live for staying welcome to chase alive [noise]\nBy my baby I met this earlier but I guess I Need a lesson on representative government I cannot in my mind imagine a summer like Heidi Heitkamp or don't match it who have hit us with overwhelming references but one one direction [noise]\nTo even consider the other I mean are we sending people to Washington to do what they want to do on their own or they won't be people who\nAre under the rug rats red state Democrats who really get through with talk\nThat never really became ... see that it's catching up to ... to this vote ah than I think that at a race was getting just as getting a bit too tight\nAnd the Democratic party moving a bit too far to the left so that he couldn't talk with no action just didn't really work but it ... it been okay for them by the high camp types of North Dakota of all places I think she's given up\nUp and down a crunch all boulevard from ... to ah\nAh Inglewood I say that all the time right\nFive decades of businesses should be up and down crunch of black businesses should be up and down ... boulevard because we'd been sustaining the Democratic party for five decades right\nLiberal ideology is what sex feminism how many black of babies have been aboard it in these last since liberal ideology has been emanating out of the Supreme Court you know for a change it's time for the pendulum to swing the other way\nAnd we saw you know Trump tweeted something about you know you don't hold you don't you don't give matches torn arson is and the Democratic party\nWe saw\nThat escapades imaginations of Schumer and Feinstein and how you know this mob rule was trying to get a a cabinet all off or they were trying to halt or straw get Kevin on not to be you know nominated confirmed for the for the for the Supreme Court\nSo I think most of the American people know at least those of us who are thinking those of us who are peeling back the layers of the onion and connecting the dots\nAnyway I'm ... I'm going to bring my guess right on cars I see is on the phone I'm delighted to have you know I like to think of Larry as my colleague because we work at the same station or we colleagues Larry Larry Elder Hi Larry\nCaplan thank you for having we certainly are college\nI I Love your ah your model or they were standing still are also after ... ... how they turned that race\nOr all all of a sudden he was he was somebody who benefited from white male now everybody in the story is white there all the all go to prep school\nAll of a sudden they found out a way of in injecting the race card because as you pointed out carefully that Democratic Party needs that model is they almost Ninety five percent\nBlack vote without which they cannot succeed at the top level so given the fact that the weapon policy that pretty much destroyed the family story you're in a city where what do they do to mobilize at ... ...\nTalk about racism racism racism lame cop Republican whatever you can do somehow are energized the black face are into thinking that these guys over here these definitely Republican or the black hair and he'd want to hold on a ... year it would white has well no matter what the qualities that bond whether it's\nPorous borders whether it's a posing voucher whether it's a stupid law like your minimum wage law whenever it is a strong family\n... we're the good guys when it comes to raising them because these guys over here you guys are bigger than what they are on immigrant able to pull it off and more and more black people are waking up\nYes yes yes they are in fact I just saw on Facebook that the Congressional Black caucus yesterday put out of four minute video about well you know when a Trump asked one of black America what a black folks have to lose would have been so the Congressional Black caucus have\nHave put out a four minute documentary and telling telling black folks what we have lost because of Trump's policies can you imagine\nAll time all time on employment is you know and this guy is doing something about illegal immigration\nAnd there's an economist named George ... and he had a Harvard economist probably done more work on the impact of legal and illegal immigration bill right there's no question about it but immigration is headed detrimental impact on on black\nEspecially unskilled black and brown we're living in the inner city right you look at all the illegal aliens coming here they don't have to kill my father cat we used to clean on this when I was growing up until I was almost ten or twelve years old he had two full time job cleaning toilets\nBlack people are and and they are Americans use the Google yeah don't tell me it'll jak couldn't be can be done by Being American can and they were aren't we have the legal immigration now putting pressure competition our job it otherwise will be gone by by people living here in this country there's no question about that\nYeah you know I had the Los Angeles a law in Los Angeles\nBuilding inspector a talk on my show and he says it eighty percent approximately at least eighty percent of construction jobs in Los Angeles are held by illegal aliens so we're grateful for Kavanaugh right because we know what his position is going to be in fact I think a case from the Ninth Circuit has just gone too will be going to the Supreme Court\nSo we know what how can you know conservative\nPosition on the constitution and their position on illegal immigration are legal aliens we know that writer\nTried them to talk about the ... here in California there's a group called fair and they estimate that illegal immigration primarily the cost of education and healthcare and that includes the children of illegal aliens illegal or your children wouldn't be here so I think it's fair to include those car\nAnd that's about twenty five billion dollars\nEvery single in you're in California and I tell you something else a lot of people from Mexico bring attitudes that are very hostile towards blacks\nIn two thousand and step in the Southern Poverty poverty leadership council and there's no right wing or left wing group put out a paper\nThat said the penal gangs are engaging in a genocide against black people living in in ... and greater LA and this is not just getting people to anybody by being targeted for execution by some of these\nFacilities gang before him as a team and this is again the Southern Poverty poverty leadership third this is a left wing group\nOr and or the or the other consequences of illegal immigration but many of our so called black leader like\nMaxine Waters is simply not addressing\nRight right right and in fact I just saw on Facebook a let's see and ... are lift driver or a black man was being accosted\nAnd being called the N word and being you know by to Latinos okay maybe they were in Puerto Rican I don't know they you know they had heavy accents like they were from\nThey could have it was the east coast so they could have been Puerto Rican or are hurting but they were definitely you know Latin they were not you know there were Latinos they weren't black Americans but you know what I Want to back up a little bit

how I can get in three hundred markets right [laughter] what part of\nIt at first people just went crazy but little by little over the course\nI think about a year and a half or two years uh-huh dot

giving the commencement speech and at that time this was Nineteen sixty five they were concerned because there was sixty six percent two parent families you know some studies and in Nineteen sixty five or Seventy seven percent\nBut anyway it was more than what it is now and they were concerned now we're down to twenty five percent I'm Glad that you are I on the same page and maybe you know so now they're two voices you know and and also you know I saw ... cannons Owens a you know and I might yes some more\nOf us and in fact ... says that's thirty six percent of black folks are now supportive of Trump\nThe hour and a lot of people think that that cold if an outlier in here because your other polls but even the people put their export at Twenty one percent which is\nWhich is for a time when he got them in the election and twenty sixteen something is happening and I believe a heavily into something is two things one of the economy obviously have to believe it's the economy stupid ... no matter what the polls say the number one driver of people's economic security and the second thing is that why people more than non blacks recognize\nQuite diabolical the idea that the Congressional Black caucus who has a they can actually come out they destroyed black America like I said we're forty percent of the homeless in Los Angeles right when you ... you know well\nGo ahead and Nineteen sixty five when I was a I was in college in Nineteen Seventy there was a report called the negro family a case for national action Britain by William Patrick Moynihan already the
