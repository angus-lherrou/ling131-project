topics\nAnd twice that you make our our ... ingredients of what is taking place in the destruction of Europe and fortunately we in the U.S are just mere in that image and I I Believe that uh\nThat what we're seeing happen in this country is just a um\n[noise] it just what they're seeing taking place in Europe as far as the the uh what they called them they know that they're there Mike when they're um uh people coming from the Syria Sudan and all these regions that are going through wars\nAnd we have the needed that is destroying everything and has their opinion and agenda and they have in Europe the EU which people that are wearing suits but not appointed by anybody they're dictating what's going on\n... and I find very interesting I fight and I like I can share on the air with you\nWhile let's not but uh you make you make some interesting points there and um [noise]\nAnd you're probably not aware of this but you're quite right in this to this extent the progressive movement a reaches to its philosopher kings in your roof so and ... and marks and ... among others\nAnd also you know in in certain respects the signing of this nation reaches back into your\n... to skew in Sydney and and others but also of course Aristotle and says real but but the point is these are really two different ways of looking at humanity\nOne looks that humanity one individual at a time that's where we come from you and I mean one individual at a time individuals have merit individuals have value individuals have worth their God given God given God created\nAnd then there's another view which is to look at the whole the community and if people are stepping out and they're not doing what they are expected to do for the better good\nWell then those people need to be addressed and dealt with\nAnd of course what happens here is a relative handful of individuals when compared to the overall population determine what is good for the community whether it's good to the community or not and this is where you get in trouble you get into these various ideologies and theories and obstructions\nIn which I'm a relative handful of individuals seek to impose their will and the all of society\nAnd to destroy man's nature\nAnd so the individual is only as good as the individual is willing to surrender his or her individuality to the greater good to the state because conformity and uniformity our priorities their primary\nNow are viewed as in view it that way conformity in uniform me that's not the priority as much liberty for an individual that as possible and in order to society and amoral ordered society that's our model\nAnd so you want in in addition to that an economic system that is competitive that his market oriented that is relatively voluntary and so forth and so on as opposed to this constant central is Asian a government\nPower uh but that is essentially sees by unelected individuals and a will that is imposed on you rather than exercising your own will you can see this now your point on the immigration from\nThe vast majority of Americans don't want what's taking place on the southern border the vast majority of Americans do want the southern border security even those who are fairly liberal and the issue of immigration [noise]\nBut you have a political party and leadership in a political party that believes it must change the population it must change the electorate it must change the citizenry in order to have as close as possible a permanent hold on power\nAnd that's exactly what's taking place that is what Merkel date in Germany that's what's taking place and people don't have a right to come to the United states of America they don't have a right to come here at all they're not even covered by our constitution\nIt's the people in this country who have rights and the right to make these determinations\nAnd so uh I agree with you to that extent that\nWhat's happening here on the American left as they've taken the European left the progressive left both of which are ... of uh of haggling marks and then the angles and the and the Russo and others are and that's the that's the row they've taken as opposed to the road we've taken which is the light meant\n[noise]\nGoes\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd I was in the long in Miami voice lessons not\nMy best today's tonight where where does this might be listening but you can hear the music [noise] and that means you know\nThat we're broadcasting live from the great your toaster rock and roll capital\nBelieve Leno Ohio that is ride from my home base of am fourteen and one of the answer including one suffering sitting in for the shades of south central air ... thank you so much for joining us statement as fast as we all we've got a very very live an important show for you coming up uh over the next three hours yeah one hour from now [noise]\nI'm very much looking forward to hearing from my friend Kurt slicker\nLiquor is a town hall senior columnist or at home all the time he was also the author of a brand new book called notice of normalcy and he\nPulls no punches\nHe takes no prisoners whether we're talking about caravans coming from Central America or whether we're talking about pipe bombs or fully pipe bombs or suspicious packages or whatever it is that you want to call them\nHe is ready to go hard core so coach liquor will be joining me about one hour from now the top of our number two so if you are settled in and able to listen wherever you might be\nYou're going to want to hear that conversation also I've got conversation scheduled for the broadcast a today slashed and I know with some pretty important in a press of people ah listen I sat him more Hugh Hewitt on his Salem Radio show this morning\nSo I did his program and as part of that regular schedule um I got an opportunity to speak with an MSNBC liberal anchor slash host\nOf other members Stephanie rural you probably know about her you've probably heard clips played from her and all of her I got a chance to talk to her to say that it was\n... entertaining\nI think was an understatement enough so that I feel like replaying it for you it's only about five minutes long that's how much time they have on the morning drop clock but I Want you to hear from stepping in rural just to get a feel for what the liberal point of view is as it pertains to President Trump and his supporters headed into these midterm elections\nBecause the president can't say anything without the liberals adding words to his statements in order to make them sound offensive\nAnd you know exactly what I'm Talking about the left going crazy about the president tonight you're do speaking in Houston, Texas on behalf of Senator Ted Cruz at a sold out Toyota ... sold out packed\nJam packed Toyotas center with thousands of more people outside the president declared he's a nationalist that is a dog whistle we're told that is an absolute state minutes a call it's code coded language to the base saying I'm with you white supremacist wow and what\nYeah I'm going to talk about that we're going to I'm going to play back for you\nThe conversation that I had was semi rural wells are going to talk about what nationalism really means with where he has some ah who is a very impressive person he was a a close senior advisor national for Raj when uh the Brexit was decided\nAh we're in England or into Europe rather a when Great Britain decided to essentially remove itself from\nA view and you know what that is that as an actor of\nNationalism we're going to talk to ... to ... ah and then also as it pertains to the ongoing and ever marching inexorably\nToward the southern border the United states the northern border of Mexico that Central American caravan now believed to be some fourteen thousand strong [noise]\nAh what does it mean for the United states on what can we do to stop\nWhat I think most of us would agree is an invasion that is not a migration it is an invasion RJ home and is the director of governmental affairs for bear the federation for American immigration reform so we got that coming up next hours while so a lot of really good people to talk to including Kurt collector RJ Allman ... replied\nSuffered in rural from a conversation that I've had with her earlier today but the lead story of course we have to get into is who is sending explosive well potentially explosive devices too\nProminent Democrats in New York and in Washington DC the homes of George Soros the Clintons Brock Obama and others apparently have been targeted for these suspicious packages let's get a little check your of the news on this from Fox\n... latest tally fix packages were confirmed threats three in New York at the home of billionaire George Soros on Monday and today it's CNN and one addressed to the home of bill and Hillary Clinton in ... for which Mrs Clinton at a campaign stop in Florida thanked Secret Service who intercepted\nAnd dress she was long before it made its way to our home\nAnother was addressed to the Obamas in Washington and also to Florida in Maryland for Democrats five packages were cleared three in California and one received by New York's governor\nSo this of course all happening less than two weeks before the midterm elections and uh right now as you can imagine the finger of blame is being pointed\nJust being pointed by the American left by which I mean elected Democrats\nMembers of Democrat activist groups members of the DNC and members of the Democratic controlled media which is to say virtually all media that isn't conservative talk radio when maybe that Fox News report\nThe finger of blame is being poured it squarely at Donald Trump and Donald Trump psychotic supporters\n[noise]\nIt is um an astounding thing uh hypocrisy when you see and hear these kinds of things\nWhen\nSteve skull lease was nearly murdered on a baseball field\nNot too terribly long to do\nWhat Eighteen months ago someone than ever ... was nearly murdered and when an entire softball field or a baseball field\nFull of Republican elected officials congressional members practicing for baseball game were attacked by what we came to find out to be a radical extremists Bernie Sanders socialist who wanted to murder as many Republicans\nAs possible do you recall what the Democrats said do not point the finger of blame at Democrats for the psychotic actions of somebody who happened to support one of us\nYou can't put blood on our hands because one not we didn't tell him to do that we didn't tell him to to try to murder people that's not on us right this is what they said very loudly very clearly a very repeatedly\nNow those very same Democrats you said you can't blame 'em his politics for his decision to try to commit mass murder on Republican members of Congress on a baseball field\nYou can't blame his politics are now saying you must blamed the politics of people we don't even know\nWe have no earthly idea at this point in time\nWho sent delivered made fabricated or whatever any of these could be would be might be potentially explosive devices and sent them to Soros CNN the Clintons and the Obamas\nWe have no idea but with I don't know who it is they are ready to say it's Trump's fault\nAddicts Trump supporters fault because President Trump doesn't like the media President Trump demonize the media especially CNN and therefore his followers are carrying out what he wants to have done to them\nThat is exactly what they're spending their time doing meanwhile there are others myself included\nAsking for at least a modicum of patients asking for just an idea\nJust give us at least I had to have an idea of who this is before we start describing motive and blame because there are a lot of people who six suspect that this close to the mid term elections that this is a false flag and these are things being done by liberals to try to embarrass and to try to hold the conservatives\nIn Trump supporters accountable for this where a lot to digest year we want you to be a part of the show triple eight nine seven ... seven more than seven two or three friends in foreign Larry Elder I'm\nThe sage\nHis back AM eight Seventy the answer by\nNow you've figured out a fact of American Life the mainstream media hates President Trump were other presidents have been given a past President Trump is home to a different standard\nThey don't seem to want to report anything you know it's good that they didn't want to turn I shouldn't be good and painted with a negative rush you know sometimes they're just unable to disguise their disgust for all he stands for making America great again that maybe they really don't get any foreign don't want to that's why you have us\nOf the United states could not have been more clear in defining what he meant\nHe said between globalism which is being more concerned about the people of the globe then you are about the people in your own country versus nationalism which is putting our people first the people that are elected me\nAnd then I'll deal with the rest of the globe second between those two I'm a nationalist\nThat is exactly what President Trump said and what did the left ear well\nJim Acosta tells you what the left her just rather than just a follow up on your comments about being a nationalist there is a concern that you are sending coded language for a dog whistle to some Americans out there that what you really mean is that you're a white national\n[noise] it's like Jim Acosta the grandstanding glory hounding attention grabbing stowed journalists for CNN and he really is she is a phony journalists the is just about as bad as it gets\nAnd this is a nation that produce Dan Rather Jim Acosta\nIs playing the role of Google auto fill right\nDo you ever going to Google and you start searching for something is that the first few letters of what your what what you want and then it says do you mean\nBlank right\nYou type in you type in the law and as you're typing L. A. W. or do you mean lawnmower no I actually wanted to talk about the law I Want to search for something about the law about asylum in the United states why are you giving me look here's the other costs that he's Google auto fill\nPresident Trump I'm a nationalist Jim Acosta do you mean white nationalist how you'll get white nationalism out of a very simple definition of globalism\nCompared to nationalism\nBecause they hear what they want to hear and they smear what they want to smear keep that in mind that is their goal especially as we head to the ... the president as popular as he's ever been forty seven percent approval rating according to NBC\nAnd the wall Street Journal poll and they are scared to death of what that means at\nThe midterms and that's why they're going to continue to

here\nAs I mentioned I was a privilege to sit in for Hugh Hewitt and the early morning hours this morning and uh as well as sitting in for Larry here now in the in the later hours and I want to share one thing from them with you now\nI had a chance to talk with um Stephanie rule Stephanie and I'm a I'm MSNBC host an anchor and\nQuite frankly a very very passionate liberal and anti Trump or as you can imagine I wanted to talk to her since I had her on the schedule about President Trump and his nationalist comment that I played for you in the last segment\nThis I think is a revealing interview it says a lot about the left so this is from this morning a conversation that I had with Stephanie rule of MSNBC\nGive it a welcome Stephanie rule to the program now Stephanie of course the MSNBC Live anchor coming up\nAt the top of the hour Seventy good morning morning here\nYou for joining us okay so the story of the day seems to have more from the caravan at least for the time being anyway to what it means to be a national as the president of course declare to Houston rally that he is not a global is the is a nationalist and he was instantly seized upon as being\nGive us a list of the president Stephanie the president very clearly in Houston very clearly defined what he means by comparing nationalism to globalism not comparing whites to blacks not comparing white America to to minority America he said global is\nThink about the globe burst in our country second a nationalist think about our country first and the globe second I'm a nationalist he made it very clear that this had nothing to do with white nationalism and it seems like people are going out of their way to find fault with it\nThey're not going to agree to disagree given the president's history on racial issues killing his professional history given his father's professional history I prefer\n... extra careful in his word choices especially as we go internal action or he is capitalizing on your mark right so we're going to agree to get where we started\nWell yeah we we certainly are but what I Want to know is ... how it is that you are going to take the position you are when he defined globalism before defining what he means when he says nationalism you can't put words in people's mouths and I feel like that's not caused it sounds like what you're doing stuff and\nI'm not putting anywhere in his mouth what I Will be able to do is look back on many many all that ... had said over the years and it's why it makes me feel uncomfortable\nOkay what what exactly has the president said recently about this issue that makes you feel so uncomfortable as a matter of you know your your expertise just is largely in economics you or your you know Bloomberg TV [noise] ah editor as well you're a former anyway you know you so given all of your economic history the president is largely talking about global or ah nationalism in globalism\nIn were you know it matters of trade you know he has often said look we're going to stop other countries in taking advantage of the United states I have to use tariffs if I have to start trade wars in order to make sure that we get a better deal out of the market is that now is not like to nominate nationalist but is that not economic\nNationalism is my question not if you look at the way the president of the capital of south that gives you the truth chatting impact would engage and things like the teacher is going up and partner with our outlining\nThat have ... definitely rural thank you for coming on your first year that she is on Sunday that live at the top of that\nMusic can be on there of course was the end of the top of an interview that I did with a seven year old this morning so that was a replay of this morning's conversation that I had there and I'm waiting for that to end up but what I Want to get to and I want you to respond to is this an eight eight eight nine seven on\nStage um she says she's not putting words in the president's mouth but she is doing exactly that she is saying that the president is talking about white nationalism\nAnd it said globalism nationalism global just put the world's first in our country second nationalist put our country first and the rest of the world's second I'm a nationalist she entered my costs are saying\nThis rather than just a follow up on your comments about being a nationalist there is a concern that you are sending coded language for a dog whistle to some Americans out there that what you really mean is that you're a white national I've never\nI mean that's if that's not putting words into somebody's mouth for the purpose of trying to tear them down\nThen nothing is he literally said why did you skip the word white don't you mean white nationalist he stuck to stuff that word in his mouth I asked any real about it and she said no we're not putting words in his mouth that's just what he meant because he's been dog whistling and using coded language from the very beginning\nFor goodness sakes the president of the United states has set on numerous occasions I was not elected president of the world I was elected president of the United states it's my job to serve the people who elected me they are first\nI Want to give one great example that I cannot take credit for\nOne great example I think this is just the perfect analogy alright\nOn Twitter this morning when I brought this up and I had the conversation with Stephanie rule [noise]\nSomebody tweeted to me and you can do so as well as France radio F. R. A. N. T. Z. somebody tweeted to me and said you know when the airline attendant tells you to put the oxygen mask on yourself first on your children second there's a reason for that because you are no good to your child if you're a pass out\nThat's nationalism\nIf we don't take care of ourselves in the United states first we are no good to anybody else around the world that is economic nationalism that is military nationalism that is taking care of yourself first and then being able to help others the president is white\nYour reaction please have eight nine seven wants age coming right back opera and simple Larry Elder on the radio network\nYou're listening to the Larry Elder show [noise]\n\n\n\nThe stage of LA Larry Elder AM eight Seventy the answer\n...

yacht or maybe you need to go that not house or or a lack of trying to disrupt a and there is not a single conservative out there\nWho condones this violence there is not one\nWell that that's that's

I I talked with him cause some earlier today he was one of the first people to start using this term again several years ago trying to revive it because of the actual meaning it had been given a negative connotation by some\nWho are looking and you know what are we talking about political correctness in this uh open to the to the show there in the open up the hour\nYou know this uh this is the following his rated PC for politically correct\nIt'd be able to think politically correct about me when I Do this thing is that my politics are correct my politics are right that's the political correctness that I'm about as far as being not offensive I don't care\nI'm not about not offending people and neither is where he cosigned now he's a fellow at the middle east forum the gates donating Institute and the Lincoln Tunnel Claremont Institute he was a former senior advisor to our brags that leader natural for Raj\nAnd he knows about nationalism he knows that it means taking care of yourself and your nation's first not about racial politics not about identity politics it's about the nation versus global is\nNationalism versus globalism\nIs exactly what President Trump was talking about it was not a ambiguous it was very very clear so I wanted to talk to Rahim ... about what nationalism really mean since they have that experience there and as I said\nHe's one of the first people to kind of revive the term as the president said when he said you're not supposed to say it anymore and it's ridiculous to say to not be able to say I believe in my nation\nFirst there was this is part of that conversation with Rene ...\nThank you for having me I have to have to say I was with one of the first ad but given that given that nationalism goes back hundreds of years but\nCertainly certainly in in in in modern loans I think we we reintroduce the political lexicon across the uh of course the ocean I'm here in the United states\nI think that's that's a that's a great point a great distinction in and let's let's talk about that as as the president declared a correctly when he when he tried to draw the contrast between globalism thinking more about the world's a needs rather than the needs of the nation that you are elected to represent the president said that very directly\nOr that he means nationalist in that I'm going to put my people first we're worried about the concerns of less than the rest of the globe second\nUm he said that national him is kind of light nationalism is kind of become a word that you don't use any more and I think we should use it again\nWhat does he mean and why he's right of course because you saw the instant reaction writing but why do the term nationalism which when compared to globalism is a pretty benign term as far as I'm concerned that says more concerned about our people before the world's be\nWell he was actually a big role to generous about ... I mean globalization if you think about what a dog um over the past Fifteen Twenty years actually it hasn't really conserve itself with the rest of the world instead of itself\nWith a political or cultural and media release a around the world whether it's in Beijing London or New York city of Los Angeles you know it really shows to shed be addressed um of the very very very few\nAre not very very very few have been exploited workers and folks on factories are exposing jobs from Racine, Wisconsin\nAnd so we'll see the reason\nHe jumped Shea\n...\nLaw all the people up with all the media were up ... because ... ... email for several years and I think people have studied it live by the way of seeing over the course of his life especially when he talks about trade deals and that sort of thing that he's had these nationalistic plenty\nBut he actually come out and said it and and he and what he's doing by saying it\nIs is crazy gets another dividing line is very good at doing that is\nA dividing line that he knows that the that sort of the city to machine the Democrats the media one of those guys that they have to attack that like they have the attack that ... and that's how it is very very hard if I can get ... what would you be he's\nIndispensable even at the age of Seventy whatever it is um and they don't have the lecture logging them so they call them fight the idea of nationalism there to fight the idea\nThat the nation states should be the final arbiter shady be show for it is almost impossible especially amongst Americans I mean you'll you'll you'll revolution was nationalist revolution\nHamilton Hamilton's ... on the subject matter ... was a national issue document\nUm you know what Roosevelt said about having one ... one of them one language and say goodbye to the immigrant assimilate is nationalism and they had arguments against that so that they're angry they are upset that he's been yet another from from them and I think that's what we've seen play out last routes\nI think that's well said the only argument they do have against that is just just say just scream racism which of course is the you know the easiest argument to make a ... is our guest is a fellow at the middle east forum the gangs don't Institute in the Lincoln fellow at the uh Claremont Institute you know the president said when he pulled out of the Paris climate accord he said look\nI care more about and I was elected by the people of Pittsburgh not the people of Paris and another event he said in his first year in the presidency I was elected president of the United states not president of the world\nHow can any elected official whether he'd be president a member of our Congress or anywhere else suggest otherwise your job is to represent the people that chose not to represent the interests of outside nations especially if it comes at the expense of those who chose to lead them\n[noise] you know that's that's a really great point and and there's actually even touch the book it's just come out on this subject which included the victory of matched me like a\n... a professor at Golda your I'm has everything and and he he sort of explains his childhood and and it it sort of awful and by awful I mean the rest of the world's all you know the United kingdom and and I'm staring Mac leave a a an empire that we won't have right now\nYou know it it sort of ... dominant historically imperialistic global distinctly\nIs look to one leader you know whether it's the king of England\nOr the Roman emperor or you know the world is used to have a ... ... ... words to one person where they already well or several people wherever they are in the world and the world is currently doing that over his hysterically I'm the last few decades was the president of United States you know I always refer to build\nA ... in that in the in that ... that is referred to as the world leader the most powerful man in the world you know all of that sort of thing\nAnd and it gets it's refreshing ... not just I think for Americans were tired of you know like trillion dollars being spent in Iraq and Afghanistan but that it should be no money for public schools and it's right\nUm I think it's refreshing for them but it's also refreshing it shouldn't be refreshing but the rest of the world a wet nations like Italy nations like ... nations like India stray and an ... a a three independent sovereign nations\nActually don't have to act as protectorate channel\nThey actually do have to act that independent sovereign nations and this was another thing that President Trump stretch it when he talks about ... so he says look I'm not looking so so so protectorate started looking for allies\nAnd and so this is a major reset what's going on now I'm ... and it pains me to say but yeah he spoke about nationalism yet so there was a period in history where nationalism\nUh ethnic nationalism specifically but very I'd be very quickly and spiraled out of control but it pains me but people don't know that nationalism and she goes back hundreds and hundreds of years and still looked like so many countries most countries I Would say around the world but for whatever
