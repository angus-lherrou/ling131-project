{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "I now know what I'm doing a you know you come in as a youngster and you don't know the law yet and you're uncertain and uh now I I pretty much feel confident that at least I Know the law and each case is different obviously it has different um\nRamifications but I I Am confident that I Know how to cover a trial and so I look forward to each one and look forward to whatever new challenges that they have\nAre you disappointed that\nHe never went to law school no\nNo come on now here you are you're you're totally into it okay there you see in the right side and the left side and you got it all down and I'm sure you've been there city you know some of those stupid benches say man I can do that\nOr you know and I mean you know and they come out and the guy that I can do that here you have to say that\nNo I feel that my obligation is to the public\nThe lay people who are not lawyers and if I were to go to law school I always felt that I Would get bogged down in ... Oregon and I would not be able to tell the story in plain language so that everybody could understand it\nAre my law school has been the courtroom has learned an awful lot from lawyers um whenever I've come into a case\nWhere there is an issue that I don't understand I ask a lawyer and they're always more than happy to give me a quick course and what it is I'm writing about for instance I covered the Exxon Valdez trial Alaska\nAnd uh besides the fact that I got there it was twenty below zero I had a few other challenges to face which were that the whole case was about maritime law of which I knew nothing\nAnd so I didn't know what to do so I went up to one of the lawyers for captain hazel would and I told him my dilemma\nAnd he said don't worry I'm going to tell you everything you need to know and after court we sat down the coffee shop and he told me all about maritime law\nAnd whenever I had a question after that he or someone else would answer it and by the end of that trial if I had to steer that tanker myself I think I could have done it I knew enough by the end\nOf Phil Spector was a little bizarre it was\nHe was so he was yeah well that yeah that to those you're covered that I did um okay so as I get it here you are\nGone all through these trials you've tried more cases and moved trial lawyers in California and\nYou think these judges or any good\nOh I think judge just you know in general are just fine except for the ones that try to throw me out of the courtroom\n[laughter] I don't like them but I really try and thought she out now and then well I've\nHad that experience where I've had to get a lawyer because adjust aside for God Knows what reason as to press should not be in there and I know First Amendment law which is very useful to know in my job and so I Will go to a judge or say you know you can't\nExclude me from the plume or hearing because there is the riverside press enterprise case that says I have to be in there and uh and often I'm able to convince them a those are the only judges that I have\nTo ... a couple of taking your down though no you've already gotten your way as\nWell um you know we've lost things early on and then we've gone to the appeals court in one um\nI think that in the Michael Jackson case we lost more battles than we've lost in any case and it was very sad because among other things to judge prevented us from getting a copy of the indictment\nI mean the indictment is the basis of the whole case and to seal the indictment was unheard of and unfortunately because of the way things went down there we got almost all of the\nDocuments after the trial was over\nHe he may be releasing stuffed to this day it just kept releasing it after it was over and uh and it was useless at that point because the case was over ... been acquitted we didn't need it then\nBut we didn't need it beforehand and it's interesting because in in what we're talking about in the OJ case in Vegas we just won a judgment there from the appeals court from the Supreme Court\nIn favor of the press because um we were uh not given copies of jury questionnaires\nAmong other things and the jury questionnaires would have revealed that the jurors have these strong feelings against OJ had we didn't know it and had we reveal that it might have made a difference in the case Linda has got a crystal ball\nOn demand is I'm Sorry Dave I gotta jump in here\nBut you can't overrule\nThe press can't overrule the judges concept of fairness otherwise you should have been a judge you could have done it yourself do you think now so if he thinks that that's unfair\nSo not the same with thinks I'm saying that we think okay I don't know what anybody else thinks I think it's unfair when we don't get the the information because the public has a right to know that\nOkay if you if you go right\nI'm just going to ask the windows a crystal ball take on the Internet versus newspapers because your name was on millions of times Associated Press all over the world in ten years people are predicting that will be anymore newspapers to ... his name off of uh you you think we're just going all Internet\nI don't think so I don't think there will ever be a time when they were being known newspapers I think that the number is diminishing um people are willing to adapt to the Internet all those certain people are not I know an awful lot of people that say I have to have my daily newspaper in front of me with the coffee or it's not a good day\nAnd I'm afraid I'm In that category I have to read my paper on paper\nI have a hard time doing the crossword puzzle with my pin on my right ...\nYeah so I think that there will always be a print presence but I think that a lot of the newspapers are adapting and are offering their papers online and readers are adapting to they're they're starting to pay for it and that's where it it will come down to whether it becomes\nRoutine a and whether every won't be able to afford\nTo keep printing the news you know what I'm here referred to as the queen of journalism oh well thank you have a you know that and and that's been written about you for a long time\nYou have to feel pretty good don't you know here in this very competitive arena in this arena where the press is frequently referred to as massively unfair and here you stand out\nAs the queen of journalism and even your comments today as we listen to you on did you take a side here who was right who was wrong I think you were genuine and those responses\nI'm just going to report it you know great\nWell I appreciate that guy is a great it's humbling in many ways and um it's also you know I I also have to realize that I have a lot to live up to and uh and I hope that I'll be able to continue doing that\nOkay you're going to be back here in two years twenty four months what has happened during the past twenty four months\nBy then probably a lot of other people are gonna be in

received the call this morning from the president of the United\nStates President Trump who told me to have good news\nUm looks like your ... will be coming United States he gave me some of the details about that but the government has been obviously working on their release but that process would be going\nTo to military bases that's how these things are handled but ice threats to the president on behalf of all of our ACL Jay member or a blood family are ... for his unyielding\nUnyielding are efforts to obtain the pastor's release and of course your prayers in support for the past\nLet me also say there are I have a lot of idea what the media lot as you know on several different capacities outside being killed Jay but I Need to say this to my friends in the media\nThese reporters up for these ah newspapers that when I'm dealing with other matters I've been very tight\nIn covering pastor Brunson case and the story and that helped keep them alive as part of the process when you got people held like this and I'm a I'm a huge thank you and I told us look up a little reports today that preceded them covering it and continuing to cover it and uh that's across the board here\nUh it's been on many networks of Fox News CNN\nOr have covered extensively ABC News or as covered it down and talked about it with George Stephanopoulos on ABC this week a couple of weeks back so a good news on that front and we're thrilled with his release but again if you're just joining us ... now being processed out of\nTurkey and what that means is east they're removing the ankle bracelet which which is monitoring it was a house arrest\nIt will be taken to a military transport aircraft\nUh probably blow that directly after Germany I'll be evaluated the return to the United states I don't know exactly when that law that will be yet we're ... into that but I'm a will keep everybody posted as this progress progress over the next several hours but a great day\nA on a time you get these releases like this door to a great day we're still waiting\nFor the one of the baby that case was earlier this way I feel this way way out to the vision but yeah that there are there were reports running back back are becoming at any moment yeah out of the package and was a great day go ahead\nThe Pakistani a Supreme Court that that case here or what happened pastor Brunson ultimately was ordered as that is unique is similar to the situation\nAs time served all of the witnesses or I guess ... a Bronx of basically dropped their stories this morning in court in Turkey um it said they were there was they were not accurately reported as as uh what they had accused pastor Brunson of\nAnd uh and then ultimately the prosecutor a recommended in Turkey that he be allowed to travel or the ... no longer under judicial order and so that's why the ankle brace it will be coming off\nComing off as we speak right now his house released a house arrest or will be released and ultimately I Will be given his passport and able to travel and and we plan on doing that um later on today\nIn Turkey I just to remind you this is someone who spent\nTwo years ... and containment a year and a half that in prison\nBecause of his Christian faith a pastor been there for twenty three years in Turkey and American\nA racist family various three children and he'll be reunited with the United states ah two sons one daughter's daughter spoken out a very publicly for her father even going to the United nations in Geneva or a show again I've heard of his or as a sister on as well so there's a family\nWhich is very excited to uh to see pastor Brunson released it was a long and difficult process more difficult than it should have been with a NATO ally like turkey these and that was not like a situation I'm In Iran or North Korea right by a with how complicated it got 'em\nAnd because it's an American citizen that I think it's it's just as big of a deal\nOr to see his freedom or saw everybody's a ... who was innocent and persecuted because their face it doesn't matter what countries doing it what relationship the U.S may have with that country or their release is something to celebrate\nWhat look absolutely and we're thrilled with the outcome here ... I Hope this also goes a long way in restoring relations\nBetween the United states and turkey Turkey's been an important ally of NATO ally and they play up strategic role in the region and it would be good to see those relations are stored\nAnd this was a part of the surface of secretary of ... that they're very positive step it met restoration process having said that also let me just say that this also gives you a glimpse at I'm gonna go to bed on this gives you a glimpse of that nature which we have these cases that was a unique situation here in that\nUm we had a situation where we had a NATO allies Jordan said that took custody of an American so a NATO allies in custody but American pastor\nIt happened to be also at the very same time but that that was a big jail his family contacted us we immediately began a\nRepresentation of him that predated my representation of the president but that of course now represents and and that but for over a year and a half built about a year now representing the president the United states and so it gave us unique perspective it and\nUh I think it was helpful for the past year or two to have an advocate that got obviously a speak with the president but having said that this president has been very very assertive on were courting sausages that are Americans back to the United states and is that a great track record there\nBut it was a unique perspective for me it we've had a lot of these over the years but this is a little bit unique in that sense but I guess I when I got that call from the ... I was just a really delighted with the with the news that we wanted to convey that we set up a a video on Facebook immediately\nOr we sent out a report for or social media outlets as well but we're glad now that we're talking with our our radio audience than I think it's important for you to state the nature of the bipartisan ship that was involved with this is what we were able to accomplish on the legislative level that help move this all\nWell I think it was particularly important given the fact that you just pointed out jaded this was an ally of the United states that we had a vested interest in maintaining a good relationship with so today we're grateful to both countries but you're right this was a little bit different in that regard first of all it was important for the administration\nTo speak with one voice the vice president the president the secretary state ambassador brown back being in the courtroom Jay but didn't in Congress I mean\nI I I Would first give a it gave me a tip of the hat to senator Jeanne Shaheen Democrat from New Hampshire who went over to turkey herself and J I Will tell you was extremely engage behind the scenes\nBoth on putting pressure on turkey when when it was appropriate but then also engaging diplomatically with turkey and reassuring turkey ... states wanted a strong relationship with him and and free and pastor Andrew Brunson was the best way to accomplish that and so\nYou know there was sort of a a team of four senator Lankford senator tell us who went down to the floor the United States Senate every single week for the past several months to speak on behalf of the pastor\nAnd Senator Graham but Jay a multiple letters multiple congressional testimony a pastor Brunson daughter came\nTo Congress to testify visits to turkey engaging diplomatically and also through pressure means a by camera all bipartisan and all of them gay speaking with one voice on the half the United states government a behind the president\nAnd at the same time or you say you're my team our team your teeth are that are listening and members of the field day here to the gate bad but it is to even be see a ... a team at the European Court of law and justice engaging un on multiple occasions\nOr so we're very happy that are very happy with the way this tape\nCame out a low it's team that was in charge of the media and social media races a year stake here to our entire game where you are a lot where we said we utilize all the lawyers\nTo see the release of pastor Andrew Brunson from turkey and uh and ultimately to the there were very tough measures taken against turkey I don't want to focus on those today today's day to celebrate uh hopefully\nThis will be something good for uh the relations between the U.S and turkey who our NATO allies I mean ultimately that's that's a big goal here are the kind of bigger picture I even heard\nPastor Brunson a sister talking about that how important of a ally turkey is the United states and that you shouldn't have this kind of relationship so that's very important Senator Graham was talking about that\nAs well I I just want to underscore to all of you\nAre thanks and how how important it is to stay with it these are tough cases they take us a long time I saw you try diplomatic options um you could uh we had a White House in a president willing to take steps are\nDiplomacy or was not working just to get it done even issue things like us or a targeted sanctions\nOn Turkish officials to see the release of pastor Andrew Brunson and I cannot underscored enough um how important it is that all of you stood by for those two years I'm a pastor Brunson I Know he thinks you\nAdd to his family thinks you and as usual in these situations though he realized because in Turkey it was such a big story\nUm I think he will come to realize even more so over the next twenty four forty eight hours how many people were following his story almost on a daily basis here in the United states is certainly when they were updates on every news network\nA route or many different broadcast shows or something I'll be doing later today who ... who stood with this story I Would this American pastor

that it won't be not even according to articles I've read all can your pastor Brunson was convicted of aiding terror groups all along I've heard you guys said that he was charged with ... yeah that was just wondering what the difference is is this just something that turkey came up with all the way they could get a charge\nFace I mean it's hard this is your face saving measures we told you this is not normal process or so obviously this was okay at the highest levels of the Turkish government to allow for his release today um you know he's still there so I'm not going to get into a lot of details about\nA a turkey and how they handle this I Will say that ultimately they've done the right thing\nAfter two years and I think we could explain more of that\nUh once pastor Brunson is here in

news like this pastor Andrew Brunson after two years being in prison to then under house arrest in Turkey because of his Christian faith\nAfter a work as a Christian pastor turkey for twenty three years I think the issue at all raising his family their three children who are weight or their father as fathers returned to the United states um he has been released after this two year a horrible ordeal\nI and I know it's been in the news a lot of today but I always want to make sure people tune in and out of radio broadcasts that they know or the emergence of justice represent the Bronx and saying we continue to do so there's a lot worse they're raised to be done\nUm as as we air right now he's not yet left turkey I'm a for somebody you hear the broadcast at different times that may have changed uh but uh but again I he has been free by the court a and a and his passport returned ankle bracelet being taken off because he was under house arrest\nAnd ... and ultimately I Will return to the United states\nMay uh will likely stopped a ... at a military US military base in Germany I'm a which she could be on his way to as early as this evening I'm with his wife we are going to take more your phone calls are one hundred sixty four thirty one to that one eight hundred sixty four thirty what we've been taking\nThroughout the show so we do have some foe large open for you right now if you want to talk to us on the air if you've got questions about this matter a about how helpful the White House has been members of Congress have been in fact let me play\nSenator Lindsey Graham ah who is on I just saw a on a TV this morning about a pastor Brunson he's played a key role listen to what he\nDid on behalf of pastor Brunson\nThat's been too long gears as if to kill I taught a course to or to wind up about it directly affected relationship\nPleased to improve and this would be a great step forward\nPerson tropic by supposed to have been all over this and satellites or didn't tell us a shade pushing very hard for a long time and\nWhen he gets home I'll feel better but he's not home yet\nAnd I think again that is that everybody obviously you feel that way too is that you want to alternately see this a hundred percent completed\nAnd that is out to be that's kind of leaving Turkish airspace that military base or whether that's that Germany is a U.S military base I stand these members of Congress likely the Graham said they they played a key role even go as far as uh not just usually their contacts to me with\nThe president turkey but also to go right into the prison to meet with pastor Brunson\nYeah far more than just issued a statement or giving his speech tournament several members of the house and Senate went over to turkey or to visit with a pastor Brunson also to visit with officials I mean do you think about senator tell us in senator Shaheen who\nUh use their seats in the Senate Armed Services Committee or to raise this issue Jordan's so you know they they injected it into a conversation about defense programs that they cared an awful lot about and we're willing to take a human rights case like pastor Brunson into that debate and it really did put a leverage into the situation and again\nI Want to cast it in this lady was not you know leverage that was looking to push turkey away in fact\nI think Senator Graham said it very well he wants a strong relationship with turkey he wants turkey in the United states to have a positive relationship\nAnd he was very careful and directing communicating to his Turkish colleagues or this this release a pastor Brunson was going to be necessary for that relationship to be as healthy as he would like it to be so again\nA senator Lankford senator tell US Senator Shaheen Senator Graham and many others Jordan did weigh more than ... speak out about this they made it a priority for them and they spent hours and hours and hours are working on the case\nUh let me go to the parents called Oklahoma on line one I think it's important called the take right now Pam welcome to Jay Sekulow live\n... ... ... ... ... ... now that Reverend Wright\nAnd yeah I Want to thank everybody and I am going hey that night having ... not going to stop pray tell it\nLiterally I just you know I think you heard what Senator Graham says they'll feel a whole lot better you continue to pray I you know to to pray for this family even after you've back to the United states\nBecause of the process how horrible a process this has been on for the family this is tough\nUm it takes a vigil told takes a physical toll as health is a bit of an issue and that's why he was ultimately allowed house arrest was because of his house so it takes all the different kinds of physical mental emotional\nAnd psychological tolls or should continue to pray for the family obviously you could celebrate what is a tremendous victory and a great moment to see pastor Brunson are in prison because of his Christian faith and ultimately released today in Turkey you take a listen this is\nA shows the bipartisanship here than mentioned senator Jeanne Shaheen a Democrat\nA sitter she'd also spoke out this morning take a listen\nI Am trail and that really aren't I applied for it at so many people who have been involved in making that happen first of all the attic a\nWife and their family they have been so critical and making a case that he never should have been arrested in the first place\nThat that work at the White House State Department in our department at Penn Congress\nThere have been so many people involved in that effort and it kept writing is I Can't wait to see him on American soil\nBasic living basic light one on one principal for the most that you get from your your pop it in that you're grateful that you're\nGoing to have done it happened for you if you're just Debbie Downer negative negative negative everything is negative you know you just wait hold back don't we ask just one\nMy family I'm Tania ... with the negativity\nLike most people have been program like zombies don't you\nOh ... ... ... that time you\nWhen I sat and you're talking about a man who was the white has\nTrump's visit to the billionaire he's talking about opening up and people don't even decades\nStores up and down crunch all boulevard and you've been boating five decades but the Democrats your family were twenty five percent two parent families\nYour family and you\nKnow I don't want people\nThat negativity and you're not on drugs or something you don't have been shot or something that has made new ... action airy and\nCrazy yeah and you really passes meal you\nKnow many twenty four seven criticizing\nPeople judging people you never met you know he's mentally and you know\nThat's the ones that mental stability over a TV screen\nAnyway I'm so excited to have [laughter] I'm Sorry the side of the time I guess my VIP in Studio gas is weighing fish my pilings hello I'm so excited to have you here I'm not yeah I'm I've come down to ... to be here\nI'm Glad to hear and he he's been involved\nIn a dispute with is private property which is above the hills of Santa Monica between chatsworth and semi valley I think he has five hundred acres am I correct\nNow it's about five hundred acres of what I call an iconic landscape that this is not to be believed it was a part of the old movies and TV shows a that everybody knows and those Rocky Mountains of ... rock but doing chatsworth consuming\nSo we're talking about five hundred acres and he's been involved in a dispute with LA county and Ventura County for how long\n[noise] well I bought the first a ranch property in two thousand so it's been going on Eighteen years and um\nIt has just been a Ferris Ferris bell and uh\nThe way you got wound up on ... either way he treated and I would also mentioned justice a Kevin ... you know it's just people take out after you basically demonize you call your names and what you're doing and it absolutely has nothing to do with what I've done with my property\nSo we were talking before the show and you mentioned that they call it an illegal dump you know it's like well that it didn't start with that started trying to get me on zoning violations in getting me on grading violations and none of that stuck\nShow because I'm right next to the Santa Susanna feel laboratory I think this is what might have stimulated the idea\nThey've been doing a clean up where they did the rocket testing for that Susannah Susanna feel I have the uh uh oftentimes donors rocket de ... so they've been doing a clean up there for Thirty years mind you that's three times as long as what it took us to get to the moon okay Glynn clean up so that that that's a contamination there\nSo they decided oh let's go and many legal do because I was bringing in nothing but soil and concrete to stabilize what a was a lot of storm damage back in two thousand and five other thing is the biggest arms Riverhead dummy a country [noise]\nAnd ah so I have been following nothing but conservation practices that come out of the United States Department of agriculture comes from the clean Water Act\nComes from the resource conservation Recovery Act which is the recycling material so all of these conservation practices that I'd been doing the government's sits there and just says oh it's an illegal don't ... and it's just crazy\nSo let's back on an let's back up a little bit why did you initially purchase a property and what was your intention what did you intend to do with the property\n[noise] well I grew up on a farm so I'm I was a there on a farm for about twelve years a growing up and then my dad took a job in Washington DC\nAnd so I've never seen the farm sense as far as actually living on a farm but uh it was in my blood and uh I decided after taking a short of early retirement from active practice I still do a lot of international consulting but decided that a wife and I would build a dream home\nAnd I was er an architect and I'm an architect urban around Weiner yeah and the environmental consultant for them to\nHave worked twenty two different states five different continents or around the world and a show of had a a pretty successful career\nAnd uh we just decided that we wanted to build a home in the mountains and found the property but it has just been an absolute nightmare and it's really destroyed my family I'm just totally destroyed taken everything that we've owned were almost homeless ourselves at this point in fact but I'm just outstanding\nYou have a judgment against you for twenty two million dollars from yeah sure accounting\nThat's what I Wish it was only twenty two million was interest is now thirty million and they want me to remove all of this good material that we recycled and and made good beautiful terrorists land\nArrows on the side and a and a show that's another five man so it's up to something like thirty five million dollars a week we've got a\nA what's called the California public records requests the same as a federal freedom of Information Act Mm but we've got questions out there\nI'm speculating that this fine that they gave me is probably more than all the fines that they've ever given anybody that's been involved in recycling a landfills you name it in the entire state for the thirty or forty years\nThat the California integrated waste management act has been a you know they're all this year that's just ridiculous\nYeah and so the county is calling it now Los Angeles county are Ventura County is calling it in the legal dumping because you're taking debris and having it transferred into the property to stick to a level the land is that correct\nAnd uh I use the term terrorist thing terrorists arenas without any new ... nothing that I'm doing is anything no in fact it's quite agent who the terrorists have land has been going on for something like about three thousand years I think the trace it back to\nAnd it's taking land that's a pretty much just unusable and it's taking areas where you can terrorists\nWhere you have re beans that are just eroded highly eroded green beans and you fill those remains and terrorists them\nAnd it's quite different from the um typical developments that you see where they literally cut down the mountains to cutting bill and balance all of this material\nSo we're bringing in these materials that the government wants in fact it's mandated now that these construction materials have to be recycled which they're not there illegally being disposed of mostly over in the air when Dale ... and this has been going on for decades and this was typical government they want to maintain the status quo\nSo they want to keep things the way they are and even though the laws of change so Irwin Dale has been designated a from Cal UPA that came out with what was called us environments\n[noise] and virus strain did this study that says the entire state every ZIP Code it goes by ZIP Code in the state or when Dale was found to be the dirtiest place so what they call pollution burden have the greatest pollution burden of any place in the entire state now you believe and that's\nAnd and a big big contributor are all these core is that all of these trucks come in from all over the county lots of them from San Bernardino riverside county and dumped all of these natural resources that could be put to use the way I'm doing and just dump them in the quarry in this one place\nAnd because it's all concentrated in one place that makes it the dirtiest place in the state are you believe in us and and the politicians all know we all know what's going on\nAnd and yet they're calling ... thing you know what you're saying even though you're we are recycling the materials as opposed to having it as a legal dot is that correct\nThat's correct that what being an architect and I am not a license to engineer but the architecture responsible for engineering so they have to know structural engineer and they have to know civil engineering we have to know all of the engineering that goes in a building project\nSo I I was a pioneer of what's called green building practices in fact the building code the state building code today has what's called Cal green and so this mandate\n... materials and other than metal you know\nConcrete asphalt to kind of ... the kind of materials that we're recycling they're everywhere else in the country they're probably the most highly reuse recycle materials there are okay they're specifications all the specifications have been codified\nIn the statutes in the state statutes and at government knows all of this they all know this you know but they create what are called fake violations okay and these fake violations\nAre are terribly terribly difficult to fight because of what we're saying prior to the show\nAnd he says oh that that that's all about the heavens that's the heavens now here's Indians of thousands of years ago when they gave us painted thousand years ago\nPainting the heavens okay and now thousand years later this is where these tests to answer built that tested all the rockets took us to the moon now is is a story or what\nThat is a story we're gonna come back we're going to take we're going to listen to are running the right man that and uh we're ... we're going to take a listen to how ironic the right man and then we got to take a break and then we'll come back and when I open to taking phone calls ...\nOh if you're interested we're talking to my in Studio VIP gas outweighing fish back and he's talking about his property five hundred acres above the ... about chatsworth mountains is that around about ... and the Santa Monica mountains above ... valley yeah five hundred ... at the solution for the homeless folks\nHe has a solution for the homeless you know we we were going to come right back we're going to listen to ... we'll be right back\nTo the wrong he writes for both

[noise]\nAnd I have a I think I still have some of the pictures up this big giant chunk of of concrete they put up against the mountain and they had the engine pushing against the mountain\nSo that they could do it for us and the plume of paper and uh you know all of those uh [noise]\nProducts combustion we're just running right down the valley from the mountain and so I can imagine that's a terrible thing to clean up\nSo it's a quite a substantial cleanup you're right um\nAnd they've been at it for Thirty years but there is history that remains there that um if your dad was located up there I Would bet you that he would would like to see those um test and some\nPreserved for history [noise]\nHe was only after a couple of weeks pay a mostly it was a space division and downing where they actually worked on the space vehicle the um [noise] a space shuttle and and the Apollo a space crap [noise]\nBut I'm I'm One of the things I was thinking about I was wondering are these are state regulators that seemed to be be dabbling you the most\nBoth both the state the the um where all of this comes from as a guy by the name of Joe Edmondson who's the head of the Santa Monica mountains conservancy and so his his view is that there should be nothing done with any of the land whether it's publicly owned or privately owned doesn't matter\nUh there should be absolutely nothing done with the land now that's where eminent domain comes in if the government really has a reason that it wants to buy up all the property for whether it's a high school hospitals you know the routine on on the imminent domain\nThere are there have a right to purchase it but um they um do not have a right to to make up stuff against people to prevent them from doing things on their land data is\nVery true and I was wondering are are the federal authorities falling in with this garbage\nNo no it's on its own state driven by Joe Edmondson who then has lobbyists in Sacramento that gets these various ages ... and ... this is what's called calorie cycle now they\nCan't get the funds to pay enough money to put your land and the conservancy and then it has really know a real connection\nTo that river of land that runs from ... park all the way through Topanga Malibu and out to point will do so this seems mighty strange ... you know get involved with you but it's not surprising\nWell it's it's a you know he wrote the statute that governs his operation when Jerry Brown was um in these first terms of office back in the guys I guess it goes back in the eighties\nSo um he his mom and dad were big timers in the Sierra Club I think there were founders maybe ah worked as founders of the Sierra Club anyway I'm brown pick go Edmondson to write the law and then it and then as I understand it he said well do you wrote the law why don't you run this thing\nSo he's been running or the same since the early eighties and it was shortly after and tied in very much\nTo the national Park Service the Santa Monica mountains national recreation area [noise]\nSo what they don't buy the state is about trying to buy that land so he's grown from what used to be limited to the Santa Monica mountains to literally all of the mountains are completely surround the LA basin and I think eventually go all the way down into Orange County\nSo am I good and so is this is terrible you know I was just thinking fit to possibly\nUm uh you know there's the alliance for defending freedom in Arizona and they provide legal services for people that are having difficulty\nAnd it seemed this type of claims since you have\nAll of the knowledge and the expertise and all of the paperwork of how you have it here [noise] uh to the minute show of the law\nThat this is a a great time for a federal civil Rico suit that would a name some of the state officials and produce the evidence\nAnd have been subjected to trouble damages a for their behavior in federal court\nLast exactly where we have just gone to which I should have done probably about a and and and I've been in litigation was Ventura County starting quarterback or within a year when I bought the land but this this\nBusiness about using the conservation practices which they claim as is illegal dumping started in two thousand and five so it's about uh twelve to Thirteen Years old\nAnd I've always been in superior court but I I I don't trust the superior court a hall filled in with that are on this show in federal court from day one which is where I've just filed a suit about thirty days ago but if I could get a hearing\nUh out in Washington DC with the right people that I should be able to go to the Justice Department and have a U.S attorney look at what's going on out out in this situation\nYou have all that documents\nPatient and you have a good a solid attorneys to present that\nAnd a judge who has the courage to do that you would get a a department of justice a prosecutor even a to assist you or even bring the action against a you know because the law says all it takes\nIs to individuals conspiring\nTo cause injury to a third individual that is not a legal or otherwise a proper and this has been done under\nA you know for for tea of law and you have met that and with this difference of thing um\nThis is kind of a a little trick to suck your money dry in the superior court\nWhile they just get to keep on going and say whatever they want to say contract and pretty soon they're going to tell us that the sun really is flat and the judge is going to say oh we have to defer to them [noise]\nAnd so uh it's it's a losing battle but the of the federal Rico action is made to take people who are acting in concert and are misusing\nA you know their positions or\nActions that they do uh to hurt someone significant way [noise]\nAnd um your losses are so huge and they have a play these games with you um I don't know how all of them would like to be subject to triple damages of everything\nThat you have lost and all the good things that you have produce\nAnd uh the value of them and you know it's going to goal or it's going to come out of their wallet\nAnd you know one of the reasons for being on this show is you've heard of the court of public opinion that's right and I've had plenty of people tell me that I got a lot better chances of getting\nGetting this thing's settled in the court of public opinion as opposed to a court so I'm working every angle that I can but thanks very much for your comments are they're very they're very encouraging okay thank you thank\nYou for your great work out there and doing something for the homeless that gives them some hope\nWell it's a crisis isn't it it's a crime affected judge for calling in to the next to the ... okay let's we only have two more minutes David from Orange County you think you can get your question in and two minutes ...\nUh yes yes I certainly am sympathize with your situation and I wouldn't be on that show that you had great credibility foul ah well I don't know\nThat no doubt now\nWhat we have to understand that\nAs we see on the federal level than a great state it is controlled by rote people who are stranded and interpret the law wherever they way they watch it so I Would like everyone to keep that in mind this gentleman out and just realize what is going through and and they kept bringing that law to focus\nThe right way for your benefit and I would like to let everybody know there's an initiative ballot county has pushing it's crazy that fight a crowd cause the water\nTo clean up a ... to gather water from rainwater and clean it up but they don't even have a storage sport it's to stab her foot\nFor what they call it had trouble shirt on your property whether it's her show or your own house it's crazy and I think we need to look at that and they they rejected everybody because of the crazy\nI think it's illegal because of Thirteen so we got to reject that they plan so it's just crazy now\nAnd then I'm Nick Shearer see recently directed the movie ... come out I saw that last Tuesday\nIs a great movie yes it's really a heavy stuff yeah you should all go out and see that because it it's a movie that exposes it will be discussing this later with a\nNeck and probably some with Andrew too about how the gods no situation in the movie it in lightens us to the fact that there's a lot more to the abortion movement than the pro choice as they're called\nPeople want us to know or think about right well gosh now was even further than an uh an abortion as she was a murder right yes yeah the most prolific in American history with a number of people and I think he's serving three life sentences or yeah\nYeah pled pled guilty and accepted a multiple life sentences to avoid the death penalty\nAnd ah and then we're having um [noise]\nA ... a ... directed the movie and then Michael ... is the host of the uh the leftist party podcast and a conservative comedian who's working to change our culture through comedy and and work the angle of of cultural change to the entertainment business so all these guys should have\nThe often takes on stuff and we look forward to it will cool this is going to be a different show than that if you're a regular listener than you're used to\nI Hope we don't get in trouble with Mike but I ... I Hope we do yeah I Hope we do okay well I Want to say you know our big issue is pension reform in California so if we can kind of a you know at least bring that up with our guest it'd be great\nEspecially Dr right yeah here his his take on how to reform the\nCountry and and Dr right will ah his main thing is the uh the homeless issue but it directly relate so the decisions California has made and he'll talk about this the decisions California voters and and Democrat and I'm elected officials have made over the years does lead to these explosions in\nIn you know ... in our city center at at one point or on the one hand enriching certain elites and the other hand impoverishing the citizens and a right\nTo well you know we got a very important election coming up in what twenty three days and you've got an interesting take on the latest polls are basically the landscape of the election because I'm a little worried especially about those uh those house seats down in orange county yeah I think\nThere's been a massive misread in\nUh in analysis in what's truly going on and it it has it's kind of a unique California issue there are a lot of Republican voters in California there they are predominantly\nLocated in certain districts that are represented by Republican congressman and hopefully after the election to congresswoman to Congress people if you will\nAnd the the issue that we're constantly\nAre shown by the left just media the longest media is that these districts voted for Hillary Clinton and so they are right to switch to a Democrat incumbent after years of being represented by Republican suffer in the\nDistrict represented by Darrell life and is it a Diane Harkey Zion Marcus running and she's she's back in the polls but you pointed out in the green room for the show that these polls are paid for by by the campaign\nHe and many times they're misleading where they are done by media to make you think a certain thing or or um [noise] a break your spirit or get you not to show up but here's the situation even though Hillary Clinton may have won these congressional districts\nIn to the two thousand sixteen election that was at a time when these conservative Republican voters who are much more conservative than\nMany people expect because think about this if you're a Republican in California you're leaving behind enemy lines you're constantly culturally\nUh sometimes physically under siege by the forces around you and the the messages you get so a lot of times we're we're much more conservative than were given credit for many times you'll hear this whole thing well that's a California Republican who's ... or\nYou know a he's a moderate or a ... a he'd be at home or at any other state be a Democrat in Tennessee well no that's actually not true what we have are really conservative Republicans who are hesitant to vote for Donald Trump into twenty sixteen election because\nThey didn't know what they were actually gonna get with them but now they know and now we're very happy trust me after seeing say the American embassy in Israel moved to Jerusalem and Jerusalem recognizes Israel's capital\nThe record low unemployment rates especially the record on record low unemployment rate for blacks or Hispanics\nBeing credible jobs numbers the booming economy the the rise of the stock market all those things are are great conservative issues and successes that is ... are not going to suppress or depressed are turnout or need to show up at\nA un November's election day just show up and vote to support the Republican agenda\n[noise] so Hillary won those districts I think mostly because of damage\nAnd the lingering after taste of Arnold Schwarzenegger who really ran in two thousand three and then again in two thousand ten explain that to well his rhetoric was in many ways just like Trump's very brash Mary gung ho but once he became\nAn incumbent and and presided over the states he\nDid the opposite of what his rhetoric was right so think about what that does to Republican turnout the Republican Party a you know I I have this belief kind of like a bait and switch on what you're saying exactly like a bait and switch a bait and switch or a flip flopper a flop flip or any version they're up and [noise]\nAnd I have this this belief I called the already David theory named after me Ari David that in order for Democrats to when they have to convince the voters that they are much more conservative or conservative at all then they actually are\nAnd if they win big what they they do and succeed at is at the same time as disguising themselves as conservative\nThey paint the Republicans are running against as liberal\nThe perfect example of this is Brock Obama in two thousand eight running on if you will remember an agenda of curbing waste fraud and abuse at the same time\nPortraying John McCain who portrayed himself over the years as a moderate as a prophet get spender mhm as soon as Obama gets into office of course the waste fraud and abuse agenda that went beyond you know\nGone that you know from the get go right but the point is he won that election in many places by convincing a moderate voters some Democrats some of other parties were independence that he was more conservative than he actually was\nAnd uh Schwarzenegger's incumbency in California is our governor is a perfect example of that wouldn't Schwarzenegger ran to replace Gray Davis who was recalled the Republican Party structure was robust it existed it did had a lot of uh\nYou know I'm ... the voter registration ratio between Democrats and Republicans was much more favorable and then\nAfter this rhetoric we see what happened in after these actions would see what\nHappened okay so are you hopeful to sum it all up about the election coming up Oh absolutely I are they going to hold the house I I Believe so and I think we're actually after the Kavanaugh fiasco which I think is turned off a lot of people are I think\nWe're looking at possibly even a red wave kind of situation and there would be nothing better to me than a massive red wave especially in the Senate and then right after the election Ruth Bader\nGinsburg retired [noise] I like that I liked that a lot we're here with Ari David on Radio Free Los Angeles please give us a call let us know what's on your mind eight six six eight seven zero
