wow and Nikki Haley it's one of the probably the cabinet member who is the most respected although the United nations ambassador is not typically a cabinet level position but of the top\nOfficials and the Trump Administration to people on the left she probably is the most popular\nI'm certainly and that's quite on the curb of course\nOf my family my ... at the same and um my little one side door than ... than they sacrifice a lot a lot of time and energy\nInto it [noise] um but and they have a lot of heart and really wanted to make America proud\nAnd so with that I'm not leaving until the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is in the play pen for the next year to come in but\nIt's a great day in the United states and I'm proud to then part of the team now I don't have anything that I'm where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing was I always got an hour or six years and we've dealt with a hurricane a thousand\nYear ... shooting as well hitting there

for twenty twenty\nI can tell me what are we doing his campaign points out how it forward to support him to find him an actual action something like that\nI wanted to do this because to Mickey ambassador to the United nations has been very special to me she's done an incredible job [noise]\nShe's a fantastic person very important play but you also is somebody that she has been [noise] that the United nations from the beginning with us from the beginning and work with us on the campaign has been barely a long time very intense and\nShe told me probably six months ago she said you know\nMaybe at the end of the year the end of the two year period for the end of the year\nI wanted to take a little time off a little way this has been a very successful you know governor of South

home day will be in constant touch I Know that whenever you have an area that you're going to go all the players and that was doing that I think I think she did that for the United nations she got to know the players she got to know China Russia\nIndia she knows everybody every first day basis and they're like\nExcept for maybe a couple of normal get all like it but they do they really like her out I think maybe more importantly there is a factor show together just wanted to tell you that we will miss you or at least we can all the time but we'll let you never know let's say you got a job but I Want to thank you very much\nNow are competing friends in the media really really really wanted her to leave in the house to suggest that she was not happy with\nA boss like Donald

recently in Nevada are at in Douglas County a annual barbecue where everybody their addresses in western guard\nThousands either there to give the keynote speech and I was given a beautiful section

Comstock cowboys and other people are and are not a whole lot of black people were there so I presume that is what this person Mitt sorry Larry but you are not really part of that heritage\nSeveral back and I said really after twenty five percent of who recall cowboys were black and I put a link to an article from the Huffington Post\nNot from Breitbart number Fox News Huffington Post post headline a history of black cowboys and the myth that the west was white\nIn the Eighteen Seventeen Eighteen eighties approximately twenty five percent of the thirty five thousand cowboys on the western frontier\nWere black\nQuote and yet the majority of their legacy has been whitewashed and written over into ... talk about a photographer named Ron Carver or who is a historian\nAnd he said quote when I moved to the east coast I was amazed that people had never heard of or didn't know they were black cowboys\nTo set out to document black cowboy culture import is a tribute to his grandfather who was a cowboy\nTwenty five percent of the cowboys were black and clearly this person is ignorant about that and that's why she wrote you're not really of that heritage by the way the Texas Republican Party was founded by blacks\nNot the black Republican Party of Texas the Texas Republican Party was founded by blacks\nGoogle it\nNow Ron ... who's running for governor in Florida as a Republican is now being called a racist because of an article but he wrote\nAbout slavery\nOut when I look at right now I think I mean they have to enjoy what looked that actually came out of I think I went down by threatening them all the extent that how faith and then they now think again I think when you look at people and I can get one for if he had\nTo come out quite there is no debate

here's the ideal meal we cannot go down the road of nonstop\nPolitical correctness and people are going to demagogue what you say like that's just unfortunately where we're at in this in this country the voters though they know that this was a non nothing burger and so I'm going to continue going forward just speaking the truth I'm but I'm not going to be derailed by these fake controversies\nNow here's an article by a man named Matthew Chapman don't know who he is headlined GOP candidate wrote a book arguing the founding fathers were right not to abolish slavery\nAnd he's talking about Rhonda status around a standard wrote a book called dreams from our founding fathers first principles in the age of Obama and that's a take off from Obama's book range from my father\nQuote one of the most disturbing claims he made in the book was that Thurgood Marshall the first African American Supreme Court justice was wrong to suggest the founding fathers failure to abolish slavery in the constitution was a fundamental flaw\nIf the standard is simply left it at tolerating slavery was a central to get the southern states on board she might have had a point but the claim that the constitution somehow pre ordained at the end of slavery ever written is pure whitewashing given that it took a bloody civil war\nTo do so\nAnd he talks about the three fifths deal that was made between north and the south\nHow reprehensible that deal was another person who appears to be pretty ignorant about history here's an article by Walter Williams called slavery quote\nAt the time of the Seventeen eighty seven\nConstitutional convention slaves were about forty percent of the population of some southern colonies he talks about how the southerners wanted to ... count each late as one person in order to increase their representation in the north because they want it to limit the power of a slave holding ... states\nWanted them not to count them at all till they agreed on telling them as three fifths as a compromise\nQuote many criticize writes Walter Williams does compromise as proof of racism which is what this guy said about rounded Sanders [noise]\nMy question to these grossly uninformed critics it's whether they would have found it more preferable for slaves to be counted as whole person's slave counted this whole person would have given slave holding southern states much more political power\nBut which critics of the founders prefer that the northern delegates not compromise and not allow slaves to be counted at all\nIf they did it is likely that the constitution would not have been ratified that's the question emerges whether blacks would have been better off with northern states haven't gone there way and southern states haven't gone there's resulting in no U.S Constitution and no union\nAnd then walked Williams quote Patrick Henry who said of this three fifths compromise quote as much as I deplore slavery I see that prudence forbid its abolition independent\n[noise] one of the delegates Jane will streams Wilson said this about the compromise\nThey laid the foundation for vanishing slavery out of this country end of quote there's also a website maintained by the federal government called constitution Centre dot org\nAnd talks about this three fifty you quote in truth it was a political deal that many delicate felt was central to preserving the union do Madison was a slave owner he felt deeply conflicted about slavery\nBut he was a strong advocate of the constitution so we felt obligated to defend even the three this rule close quote what this guy criticizing wrong to say this is the saying is that the Sanders was wrong when you said that freezes compromise was essential a and at the\nStage had been set for the eventual abolition of slavery\nThis guy is not true and therefore around us and its most apparently be a racist oh my goodness\n[noise] Rhonda status has called out the double standard all these anti

you is that the u._s. than than commissioned a that came up with that with that that also said the reason is for is the fact that judges\nOr when it comes to sentencing will take into consideration and defend this arrest record and it turns out that a typical black the Senate has a longer arrest record than typical white defend it as a result that black defend it gets a longer sentence nothing
