that is now a few years ago Mr Obama\nFor federal suit against the state of Arizona and Governor Brewer for trying to enforce the immigration laws they successfully argued that immigration was the

decisions don't stand [noise] well\nYou got to remember we're talking about ten years ago when Obama was talking about enforcing the border and that that issue Democrats thought was less popular to be anti border security now they're they have to go all in on it Rick because if they don't have ... I think they'll keep losing the Republicans like Donald Trump\nThey need new voters in here and they need to give out amnesty and they need to do a quick and if you had to enter the I mean we could take cruises a perfect example with is that the race if all the illegal immigrants in Texas could vote Ted Cruz will be done\nAll absolutely absolutely\nAnd and you could argue that there's virtually it's impossible to win a presidential election if you as a Republican don't win Texas for darn sure and really there's a very good chance every time for us to when you got to win Florida because you're never going to win California well if you can turn\nTexas to them for the Dems those three states ... it's virtually impossible to do math\nThat makes it were Republican wouldn't get when the White House so all you need to do to switch Texas over is just skip the illegal immigrants are there the ability to vote\nAnd then you got it the same way that you have it in California\nThe same exact way\nBy the way we've got some very important breaking news Rosie O'Donnell you know she is very serious commentators she was just on MSNBC deadline White House\nAnd she had some very insightful

bitch use the fifth anniversary of the black power salute ... remember that in\nSixty eight by Tommy Smith and John Carlos\n[noise] he's calling for politicians to have a more civil constructive conversation about race relations quote we're politician to our devices with their disingenuous cynical approach that is disgusting\nAnd he goes on and on and on about his time for politicians have a civil conversation about race relations\nNow coach I Know you listen to the show I'm period in San Antonio appreciate the coverage\nTo tell you something you're not helping you're making things worse there was a poll that came out two months ago that said that six out of ten Americans feel that race relations are getting worse in America\n[noise] but most of them never discuss the issue with their friends or family and I think about that\nRace relations are getting worse\nPeople agree that they're getting worse but they don't discuss it with friends or family\nNow the assumption on the part of the people like the top of it that people are discussing it because it's such a sensitive topic because America still feeding racism\nThe legacy of slavery and Jim Crow you had a block cheddar me tell you what people don't talk about it first of all most people don't think they are racist\nThey don't most people think they're fair most people think that there give people an even shocked most people consider themselves to be Christians and the whole basis of Christianity is the golden rule\nCream people that way you want to be treated most people think they do that so they don't think there is number two if the great diversity is right and I am that racism is not a major problem in America anymore\nDespite the fact that you feel things are getting worse doesn't mean if some major problem is it ruining your day is a staff and even going into a marketing ordering something if the person behind the counter happens to be a different race in your course not we're getting along just fine here\nIn this country the third reason people don't say anything is is\nYou tell the truth about how you feel and you're going to be called racist or an Uncle Tom witness what's going on with Kanye West witness their retreat that Steve already had and give you a quick story buddy of mine just told me the other day he's in a bar my buddy is white everybody in the bars white and it's a sports bar is normally there are sports things on TV for some reason was local news\nAnd they were doing a story about how a bunch of ... every year uh for for several days or lend their services for free to poor people are and they interviewed some woman happen to be black holding her baby and she was saying\nI my baby needs braces my baby needs braces and some white guy said what about your baby 's husband what about your baby's father what about your husband what about your boyfriend where's eat\nAnd then some guy a table to over said hey that's right and the guy to an argument and the guy said hey this race if eventually left because uh you started to escalate to the point where who knows what might have happened so here you have all white guys one white guy saying out loud hey\nWhere's your where's the baby where's the father of your baby how can we cannot be that's what he said how can the father of your baby can't help you\nStories that perfectly legitimate question he's called racist by another white guy\nSo the point is people don't talk once the upside I'm going to say how I feel is going to be politically incorrect and next thing you know I'm a bigger around when I go to our idea of subjects that racism is not a major problem in America and I'm Talking to somebody thinks it is what's the upside how am I going to prove it what what am I supposed to say\nThat's why so coach you're not help\nAnything and Matthew is Chris Matthews expose the game listen to this\nMainly for white people white people won't vote for a guy most of them that they think they're racist so of his show you're not in some\nCartoonish way to get them off the hook you know what I'm saying\nNow Matthew is making two points although he doesn't realize the first is most people\nAren't racist sorry\n\nSecondly since most white people will vote for somebody if they think they're racist if necessary for us to characterize that person has racist to brand Reagan his race as to brand George W Bush's races to brand Donald Trump is right 'cause because most white people will vote for him to get in the heat races therefore we're going to characterize them as raises\nThat's the con he just exposing it\nMost white people coach are not racist or your friends races are you a racist or your friends' friends' racist knock it off Nineteen Ninety seven time CNN poll poll black teenagers in white teenagers have talked about this before\nBoth were asked do you think racism is a major problem in America more white steam started wasn't black teen\nBut then they asked this do you think racism is a big problem a major problem or a big problem a ... of my minor problem or no problem in your own daily lives\nEighty nine percent of the black teens that racism was a miner or no problem in my daily life\nBroke up knock it off you gotta do three things get to the middle class coach you know this finish high school don't have a kid before you're twenty get married before you have that kid you will not be poor regarding this business about up introduced you know racism and and structural racism and\nAnd uh uh what's the other word is ... structure Roland a systemic racism yeah\nAbout the police coach tell these young black men comply you won't die\nVirtually all of these high profile cases would not have taken place had the individual flash suspect simply complied\nAnd his record is rule even if the officer gives you an illegal order you must comply unless that illegal order your the company would force so you're not helping any anybody coach and the big problem coach isn't your leak\nLook in the mirror for every player that does not have a kid outside of wedlock there's a player with to\nDo something about that that is the number one pilot in the black community number one problem in the country forty percent of kids in this country are born outside of wedlock that is a massive problem Seventy three percent of black kids coach outside of wedlock that's the problem\nNot racism knock it off\nOr to be talking with Dr ... just a second one of the things we talk about you is the abduction and apparently the murder of this Washington Post reporter here's what Jake Tapper set about\nThis afternoon the president is denying he's giving cover in any way to the Saudis and the thing he simply wants to find out what happened but that's about as top of the president was willing to get any has had\nHarsh words in the last week or so for Stormy Daniels Senator Elizabeth Warren and Taylor Swift than he is at the Saudis responsible for the likely butchering quarter of a Washington Post columnist and\nYou see there are there going I mean well uh CNN defense guy mud to this\nLike with long that's only half the bombshell here I mean the the really interesting part of this is an addition to the typical prosecutorial side of this as you report in the opening we're talking about a potential report a draft report a narrative that you will\nFor smaller going over Rosenstein let me play this out watching it Rosenstein get narrative that says not only\nThis is what we found that my violate the law and this is my picture of what happened during the investigation that Congress I bet it's going to turn around and say we want to see that and and the Congress has been a leak there's going to be some dirt and they're so in addition to the indictments I really want to see what's in that narrative of work so we're going to\nTalk to talk to her about CNN reporting that we may see more indictments from Robert Mueller and

come out for the national anthem\nA one player villain a waiver who's an Army Ranger came out and stood by himself with his hand over his heart and he was not considered a racist so this even as much as a year ago it would not have been unheard of to hear somebody a leader in the party defend the flag\nSo what I mean they weren't executive director of the party you obviously know a lot of Democrats in your county traditionally democratic county what if what if your ... your former coworker ... since this happened\nI haven't heard from any of them I understand the party line is that is a personal matter and I can respect that however those that are elected officials or party members who are not tied with my direct sort of chain of command if you will I have not heard from any of them\nThat's a shocking what is the same to you about how the parties change\nWell it makes me wonder if there is room for moderate Democrats and the Democratic party nowadays um there were some elected officials who said that they acknowledge that they've known me and I'm not a racist however was insensitive and unfortunately\nIf my patriotism and standing up for family friends has become insensitive or that I think we as Democrats need to stop and reevaluate exactly what we stand for\nStanding up for the flag is considered racist then what happens to the country do you think going forward [noise]\nThat's that's a good question I'm a little worried about that\nWell I'd like to continue to bring this to light and continue to voice concern for this very issue um and then in the

accountability and a very thorough and rapid investigation but the problem is we've got a real elephant in the room here dealing with their credibility for almost two weeks the Saudi leadership has maintained\nThat ... existed because look that day he arrived in the conflict by a back door and provided no evidence to support that whatsoever and they obviously it was saying there was no foul play well now we know there is foul play ... and that brings a lack of credibility to what they've been talking about the two weeks it begs the question\nWhat kind of an investigation or we're going to get will it be accurate I Want to be credible and that's why I'm suggesting if you had the FBI on their side by side with them I think coming out of that it it will certainly increased the accuracy of the credibility of the investigation\n[noise] you know there's an article in the council for Foreign Relations and that's considered to be kind of a moderate a group not neo cons but I don't see her and talk about this difficult relationship that we've had for a decade with Saudi Arabia\nQuote\nIt's not that the u._s. should walk away from Saudi Arabia because it is a major oil producer\nAnd partner in the fight against terrorism or because the bilateral relationship has benefited Washington the larger issue is that Saudi Arabia if Saudi Arabia is left to its own devices you will so more chaos in

I played a clip from a CBS News report about this and the reporter said after the deal was signed a in Moscow all over the country or they were shouting death to America but more out of habit been out of conviction what the hell does that even mean\nThey're still chanting death to America after we did this Iran deal yes but more out of habit then out of conviction how do you know with the conviction is\nYou're okay with that\nBut now you're starting to New York now you're ... now you're George Patton now George now now a President Trump is being a being a worse he being pushed around she's a hawkish enough I thought your complaint was that he couldn't be trusted with the bomb with the button\nNow he's taking his time getting the data recognizing we've got a complicated relationship with Saudi Arabia they had been helping or in dealing with Iran the number one sponsor terror there\nWe do have some common interests\nSo the president is considering all of this being deliberate\nAnd now he's being trash for that you can't you really can't when and when I'm watching MSNBC hall and CNN and all them criticizing the credit for not more forcefully condemning the Saudi what is it you want to do you want to end the relationship you want to walk away you have any idea what they're doing to help us uh in dealing with the\n\nThe threat of around the number one sponsor

to back four plus quarter GDP Growth that's pretty stunning [noise] there is a um article and force magazine\nHeadlined the Trump manufacturing jobs boom ten times Obama's over Twenty one months talked about how when Obama at that town hall said these jobs are going to come back Trump would need a magic wand\n\nTalked about the unemployment growth in the manufacturing sector sector quote reversing the trend under Obama when overall employment grew faster than the employment in the manufacturing segment\nComparing the last Twenty one months of the Obama administration with the first Twenty one months of Trump's shows under Trump watch more than ten times the number of manufacturing jobs were added a and you know under the laughter than we had our competitiveness\nSlipped\nTo

wondering what you think about trying to heal and when he Bali Democrats\nCalls and e though he'd get they\nHave like I didn't go in and that is that how he ... going to be\nGay or I assume you're a Democrat or you're not\nI wasn't very happy that I changed again okay I ...\nI see and the reason I I assume that you're a Democrat is because many Democrats have said things that have been far worse and I'm Wondering whether or not you're equally outrage for example when a Howard Dean was chair of the DNC he says the contest between Republicans and Democrats is good versus evil and we're the good do you have a problem with that\n[noise]\nI I don't recall\nThat I didn't I didn't think he did I'm not I'm not trying to ... to gay but I didn't I didn't think he knew that and my point is when Democrats say stuff like that NBC CBS ABC they don't cover it the way a when Republicans say something like that I had if any if any Democratic president ever been called a Nazi or Hitler gay\nI I Know what it means like got involved in power that\nYou heard some of the things I see well gay or I Will tell you the president has been called a Nazi a fashion a racist or sexist and almost all do

understand that you're bothered by which you perceived to be his bowling or you bothered by the fact that ABC NBC and CBS the last three\nMonths Ninety four percent of their news of Trump has been negative even as the economy is getting all time high unemployment all time low stock market all time high you think maybe they can do a little better than Ninety four percent anti Trump coverage I'm asking\nWell yeah well I think that ... and ... why\nWhy lie about all the things that can defeat lying about unemployment if you're lying about the stock market is he lying about consumer confidence\nAnd it's not that great signing trying that for her it's not that great an economy and that ... actually it is we think that if anything\nActually it is name another nickname another
