Trump\nWas not wrong about grant here is a pretty good university on your best friend here was Eighteen sixty to America was in the depth of the civil war\nBack it's easy to believe that a union victory was inevitable\nThe north had more money more population more industry but no one thought that at the time\nIn the first year of the war it looked as if the south would win a series of high profile victories in the east convinced many that confederates were better fighters under better leaders where with President Lincoln signed a battlefield general who can do for the union what Roberts Lee was doing for the confederacy lead into victory\nThe man he found the man who save the union was delicious esque grant he wasn't Lincoln's first choice or second or third\nIn fact when the war started in Nineteen sixty one Lincoln had no idea who you listen to grant was hardly surprising since after time grant was selling hatched a farmer's wife in a small town in Illinois\nHis rise to glory as one of the most amazing stories in American history born in Ohio on April twenty seven Eighteen twenty to grant had no ambition to be a soldier\nHis father pushed him into it thinking he wasn't suited for much else\nGrants West Point career wasn't especially distinguished either but during the Mexican American War Eighteen forty six to Eighteen forty eight grant proved himself to be an officer of unusual ability he was cool under fire daring but rarely reckless even more important than men under his command trusted him\nAfter that war grant returned to St Louis to marry his fiance Julia Dent the daughter of a slave owning Missouri farmer grant was never happier than when he was with Julia and he was never been happier than when he was not unfortunately in this period army life force them to be separated sometimes for many months\nTo assuage is loneliness grant started to drink for allowing a distant posting in northern California a thousand miles from Julia his drinking got the better of him he resigned his army condition to avoiding embarrassing court martial\nIt was downhill from there one business venture failing after another by Eighteen\nSixty thoroughly humiliated and with no money and no prospects he was back working for his father in a small town of Galena, Illinois\nThen the civil war happened the union was in desperate need of experienced soldiers grant volunteered his leadership skills were immediately obvious he quickly advanced through the ranks\nIn a little more than six months he scored two major victories at Fort Henry Ford Donaldson along the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers he followed these up with victory in the largest battle in American history up to that time the battle of Shiloh making him a true union hero in a cause that was starved for here is\nThere was nothing flashy about grants generalship fall he did was when unlike the overly cautious generals that drove President Lincoln to distraction grant battle plan was to always move forward always put pressure on his foes any advantage to union hat and technology are manpower he employed to the fullest\nLike Napoleon grant was a superb breeder of maps he could identify the enemies vulnerabilities and exploit them as he did in his brilliant Eighteen sixty three campaign for Vicksburg a campaign that is still studied at war colleges\nIn March Eighteenth sixty four Lincoln made grant commander of all the union armies it took more than a year of the wars hardest fighting before Li surrendered and the war finally came to an end\nBy this point the president and his general had developed a close bond shortly after ... return to Washington Lincoln invited the grants to join him in Mary Lincoln at Ford's Theatre\nGrant accepted Julia however

she is racist so let's call him or her racist even when they're not racist so that white people don't vote for it and of course why people would never vote for somebody who's racist doesn't mean that we really believe the races\nBut I Do understand President Trump to as much as any of us do he always shoot the moon\nHey there's the the the thing and they get in the contest of ideas and politics

because people in our state are hurting and in those poll numbers that you're showing that in that response from him that might seem\nTo me that might seem turn the other cheek at a time when everyone's throwing hurling brick bats at each other I think it's resonating with people people are tired of all the\nFighting of all that in the race for horns they want someone who appeals to\nAppeal to their better natures but who also makes it clear that they're that they're not going to back down from a challenge and they're willing to go in and do the work to help people in the state because how many times can people go to the polls vote for someone and then nothing changes\nAnd that's been Andrew Gillum monitor follow along when he was nowhere in the polls and where he is four points ahead in the polls\nSo you know we've got twenty we've got twenty four days he's got twenty four days and I think you know the more that Republicans her all the kitchen sink at someone like Andrew Gillum and other Democrats across the country I think people are going to see what they're up to and it'll ... for them what's at stake\nSo that's Jonathan Capehart pundits for the Washington Post censor Florida Republicans are running a quote overtly racial campaigning against Gillum here's another pundits saying that the Republicans are trying to turn the Florida governor race into a ...\nCall it is and I think the Republican campaign the racist Republican campaign speaks to that as Cornell talked about\nUnless they make this from this campaign if you will on racial terms unless they turned it into a race war we've seen Andrew Gillum over and over again refused to take the bait he's running a unifying campaign turn it into a race war and talking about what he wants to

regular expression that people use he went\nWell I I I I'm\nAn implied was racial me and like that\nFor a while the Republican Party and his Republican opponent Rhonda Sanders continue to try and bring this down why\nThis it's very simple and I always find the white electorate in Florida yeah goes eighty twenty four yeah we're on to say at this and they can make this race and to find it on these disgusting racial jokes that they're trying to unfortunately that will be enough to wind power\nDisgusting racial tropes\nOr if they can keep those margins down we know people will call we're going to turn out much higher numbers because they're in ... excited and enthused by the given Canada save [noise] so that's not going to be an issue or concern on the Democratic side\nBut I I thought there was voter suppression you hear your saying the minority vote turnout is going to be large\nHigh but but I I thought they were being suppressed\nBy what if the Republicans can make this a race war which is what they're trying to do not so subtly\nThen I think not even subtle\nThat's their calculus for how they win this election but it's reprehensible and I think the voters of the state of Florida of all colors to ask themselves are we going to fall for these cheap tactics that not only undermined our campaign system they undermine our democracy joy that's the central question people need to ask themselves going into this election [noise]\nChris Matthews just\nConceded that most white vote for somebody if they think he's a racist why then with any politician with an IQ two points above plant life run a campaign that's racist here's what a pundit writings right for roll call said\nI don't want to go back to the women ... to the women's vote because I just I think it's critical that we you know we we always talk about the fact that they're the gender gap in elections and that whoever is going to be elected to office and it's typically determined by the women's vote but I\nHave to say I I I Am very pessimistic about what we will see happen with the white women to vote in terms of whether they're going to got Republican or Democrat and and I would remind the audience\nThat were not for the vote of black women and women of color Roy and Roy worry more would have been elected in Alabama I'm despite very credible charges um that indicated that hating gay had
