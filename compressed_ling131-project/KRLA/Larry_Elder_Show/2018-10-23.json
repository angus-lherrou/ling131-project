being up and literally urine they've you know I had nothing man man started to work and I was determined to change my circumstances saw praying man you know I saw it on Craig's list and I pray and his father gave me the\nThe energy in the passion to change\nMy life because I Want things better I'm tired of being homeless oh it's only on another video why I was homeless way back stance twenty six years ago when I was a very young man but let's just talk about now so anyway I was homeless and I prayed\nThan by hard work and also the support of a lot of people fellow American citizens black and white Jew or gentile everything you know I was able to overcome that situation but as\nI was going I remember when I was a young and I was getting food stamps\nThere's nothing wrong with getting food stamps if you need it but I was getting food\nStamps because the toll giant just got through from being homeless I elevated from sleeping on the streets to slip it in a crack house then the don't boy whose credit cards I Would sleep later he got arrested and they're so then I had to find another place and I work like three or four jobs work at work and work and I know that made it from the crack house\nTo a house that was pet rats roaches being an elevator doing apartment we just had roaches in it and then I elevated to an apartment and we'll just have mode elevated they kept on going that kept on going and then finally yeah here's years later after\nHaving seven wonderful children being a dad finally found my American Dream through hard work patience persistence\nAnd the grace of God and the support of American I said this\nSpirit of American lives on his way to make America great it's all of the mountains\nAnd the British things happened to me financially not when I first started making big money but the day the government told me that I made too much money for bone stance\nWhy James you got all these jobs are making so much money\nYou do not qualify to pay off boats that come along so you have to get off and they say no you must acquit somebody your jobs and just keep one job you'll still be able to keep your benefits and I started crying no accident many many years ago I
