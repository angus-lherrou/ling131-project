{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "And this is the thing that that really a hurts the feelings of a financial planner I Would come to your house as a financial planner you come to my office\nAnd I had it in a in a blue folder it was like a a royal blue so it was it stood out with a clear covering the royal blue back royal blue binding you could see it I could see it in the sack of papers I knew exactly where my financial planning was\nAnd if I happen to either come to your house you come to the office and you bring your whole if you even brought it with you by the way that it only happened about half the time but if I go to your house I said OK let's bring up the financial plans take a look and see where we are\nAnd you've got gosh it's around here somewhere\nAround ... and you'd look underneath the the used car sales newspapers look underneath the furniture store discounts for this weekend\nThe Memorial Day sale paperwork the newspapers up there to\nRight next to the latest election propaganda you guys ... you never opened it you probably didn't understand it or if you did you were busy\nSo when I started realizing is that when you would show up to my office with your notebook most most people not not everybody\nCertainly didn't understand the whole thing and probably never really looked at it that often and the financial advisor who spent maybe an hour half hour two hours whatever building it cause of software does a lot of it for us we just enter the data don't don't think that they're doing any kind of real work\nWe entered into the system and when it came out I Would sit there and\nMatt oh wow look at that oh neat I'd have a whole\nIt was exciting to me because it was my field\nIt didn't matter to you [laughter] you're like yeah\nAnd then one day of clients that to me ah\nBecause I was going over like this was a huge deal we're changing their financial life it was a big deal it was big numbers are worth a million dollars plus I mean it was a big big number\nWe sat down and the wife had gotten up and went out to the restroom comes back and she said you know we're going to be done here in a minute because we have soccer practice for the kids\nAnd I went oh my gosh and it hit me\nFive minutes after I leave this thing goes right back into the pile you were kind in polite to me so that's nice\nAnd whether you leave my office and you put it in the back seat of the car not to see it for a week until you get a car wash or you just put it on the on the kitchen counter and bury it once I leave I found out that people cared about just a few things how much do I have\nWhat does it cost me how much did I make and when can I take my money out and how much can I receive\nAll of the correlation and the other craziness that benefits your financial professional it does not benefit you\nMay be the end result might if you're lucky great you win and maybe there are some really good guys out there that just know what the daylights they're doing it and they're not getting themselves in a mess financially speaking\nBecause most of you\nDon't have a background and finances you're good at what you do your job is going to make\nYour wealthy like Warren Buffett says this is pretty amazing Warren Buffett said you know people ask oh what's the trick to well what's the secret to success you know the questions that people would ask\nAre all different things [noise]\nRelated and he was speaking and he said the number one decision that you can make\nThat determines your wealth is who your spouse's powwow so mainly the guys look at the wives and say shopping\nShopping and the husbands are and why is look at the husband and say you lazy bum you should have been an executive vice president by now\nYou should have gone to law school right now that's not what I mean by selecting your spouse\nThe way you look at money is very important\nAnd if you see money as something to be avoided or a necessary evil right I've heard those terms then don't be surprised\nThat you can't figure it out don't be surprised who wants to deal with something that is bad\nFor dirty or wrong or evil it's like being in a group of teenagers or high school kids who wants to be a millionaire but he raises their hand why because they think that equals stuff\nWho wants more stuff who wants nicer stuff everybody raises their hand but when you say who wants to be wealthy and successful meaning you're going to sacrifice you're going to go to college maybe you're going to go to school maybe you're gonna work in sales maybe you're going to be [noise]\nAway from your family and spend nights and hotels you try to\nBuild your company your business your oh wait did you say success or can have a job please\nWrite a lot of people forget\nThat your wealth is determined by what you do because that's the second thing he said the career you choose who your spouse is number one the career you choose number two\nYou know we have a like most places in LA you have a homeless folks that are out front and begging for money\nAnd yesterday I'm at the office in a guy and is out front with the sign and I said uh\nAs I walked up to him I said look you shouldn't be here full of course he he can legally be there to sidewalk right or street\nI said you should be working do you want you want money\nThat may have to do you want money said yes\nI said I Would never give you money and disrespect you as a man for just giving you money as to exist\nIt's disgusting you guys\nIt's degrading to the human condition\nAnd he said all I Want is loose change I said I'll tell you what I'll give you five dollars his eyes got really big I said but the block in front of my office from that corner to this corner you have to pick up the trash from the back corner to this corner\nAnd when you do you and I'll walk you knock on my office door because I'm On the amount of main street but it's a Saturday So the doors closed so I said you knock on the office door when I come out will walk together and if you got it all I'll give you five dollars he said you got it sir\nFolks if I could have captured that moment of excitement that somebody actually respected him if I could capture that moment of a man who had his shoulders back in his chin was up\nAnd not have had tilted forward with his hands outstripped at stretch if I could have captured that and and throw that in the face of some of these progressive liberals I think the answer is just more more free", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Glendale",
