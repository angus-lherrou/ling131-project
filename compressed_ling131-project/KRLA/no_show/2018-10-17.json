encouraged knowing that people are praying for me one of the fears that I had at center rational think perhaps but when one one that's isolated the way I was as it would be forgotten and that people would not pray for me and I desperately wanted that for her because I I felt very weak\nAnd so uh as I look back uh on my second year of one God was rebuilding me\nI didn't feel God's presence very much but uh I I Know very well that it was a person of God's people that was a\nThere was a grave coming to me that often was not felt right with like a hit and grace and I wasn't aware of it at that

react\nAnd Elena ... whole that whole recall April ... to get ready get ready for that time there for a full strength and courage cashed out Andrew\nYes I I think that's a very important question and a\nSign noticed one thing one when we when my wife and I were held together for Thirteen Days were arrested at the same time and I have a seminary that great I have a peace day New Testament and I've taught for many years and preached and yet I saw that my wife\nWas stronger than I was during the Thirteen days and it came from\nA deep devotion and she has than I should say a consistent time with the lord every day for years she set time aside and she read the Bible and she just spent time in God's presence and prayed\nAnd I was more sporadic I'd run fast and then I'd slowed down but she was very consistent and uh it's not that she had incredible revelations every day but it was the but over time the consistency and just feeding herself so that when\nThe crisis came and wear\nNFL together there are people and from ISIS and the cells around us and we thought what's happening what's going to happen we had no idea so we're Thirteen Days cut off a together and and that are holding fatter than she was doing better than I was ...\nFan so I thought this is a message says she carries and that I found\nA ... I Want to practice as well as emphasize just a consistent time spent with God it's strengthened says for the difficulties or will you be able to handle it when it comes\nA well you get the grace at that time you pay for and ah sometimes it doesn't feel like enough to be honest with you sometimes it doesn't feel like enough not working through that but the fact is that it did it it was enough\nTo remind people pass the Bronx you kind of Senate passing because of experience in Turkey for so long but because of the refugee flow out of Syria\nAnd that he was even in that original a holding the daddy partition facility out there with his wife with a prisoners from ISIS\nYeah I mean this is these were a difficult situation right from the beginning uh and then he's a man you got to remember that yeah the ... the ISIS part of this because turkey was dealing with this overflowed people out of Syria some who were ISIS fighters so\nAgain I didn't want people to to miss that it it passed readers' comments will go right back to the phones that David in Washington state on line five David you're talking to a pastor Brunson\nHello pastor Brunson my name is David ...

small we'll be matched by a generous donor\nUp because he he actually enjoyed the the goofy and us you know I I was worried about ...\n[laughter] I think he was in the car wire my here what's good for your book Donald drain the swamp by Eric ... look I sue ... is the illustrator\nHe not only is he the illustrator but I wrote it with him ... when I or creative partners we've done a number of books together people look it up online some of the most beautiful illustrations you've ever seen or his books but when I\nReally was thinking about who do I vote he's the guy that convinced me to take Trump's seriously he said this guy is a folk hero he's an American folk hero and that's what gave me the idea to write the book\nDonald drained the swamp I said he's a larger goal I figure I Need to write a kids' book or a or I mean this is the kids but but it's also humor book for adults in other words adults are going to find humor in this children's book\nThat kids aren't going to find I mean obviously there's a there's a little blue bird that tweets\nAre there is a there's somebody you know the first swamp creature is the lobbyists or is I mean kids are not going to get that and ah and then there's another swamp creature that looks a heck of a lot\nLike a crying Chuck\nI don't know if you've heard of crying truck but he's a senator from a there is George and then there's the the the biggest bad a swamp creature them all the Georgia shore is\nAnd you know adults will get that but kids I think I'm part of this book really is that I think\nWe who have supported this president we need to have some fun we need to celebrate and we need to have something a narrative that's a positive narrative about what's going on we don't need to be in the weeds every day with all the details and everything we need to just say\nSomething good is happening in America and by the way most people understand that we're being reconnected to our government were never supposed to have a big bloated\nBureaucracy we're supposed to be a free people who govern ourselves\nThat's what this big as the book is all about and I really think it's important that we remind ourselves of that and we teach our kids what that is and so this is a fable about American style self government\nFeaturing a caveman name Donald and the swamp creatures and all that kind of stuff I mean I have to say it's sweet it's innocent it's not mean spirited so I Hope people will will will use it to teach their kids but also just for adults to have fun I think a lot of adults are going to give this to other adults I Hope\nConservative adults will give it to a to they're never Trump or friends you know just as a joke or something because it is not mean spirited meant for us all to to laugh\nNo it's a total for them it's called Donald drainage drain the swamp it's probably the only book or at least be only one I Know is certainly\nA for a pug positive you president and it's just in a very fun way to ... ... it's a Donald became banned book as a as a series of Donald ...\nFor years going on I think the next one is going to be Donald build the wall or whether Congress gives them funding or not\nA you know that kind of thing but I'm I think there will be other books hey listen Michael in Dallas my pillow we're creating pillows based on this book that's not a joke that's actually true we're creating a plush doll it's going to go it's getting crazy Dennis it's getting crazy but people once you buy your make America great hat\nYou know ... that's about it right and so I thought we need to have something just a fun thing or you know so we can celebrate\nWhat is happening and it's not it's not a bitter thing it's it's ... it's a bipartisan swamp if you're a careful reader of the illustrations I Can't get too specific but it's a bipartisan swamp and you know it's it's meant to be happy and fun\nWhile it is absolutely I got a big kick out of the Donald ... what what caused you to even come up with this idea well\nHonestly I\nI was mentioning Tim rag when he's he's my friend for Thirty years and he's the one that that really made me see that I that I was missing something with Trump he said this guy's a folk hero and Tim and I've written all these children's books together and after the election I thought you know what I Wonder holy cow I should write a book with him\nLike a kids' book for ... ... with Donald as a folk hero I didn't know what the idea was but it just kind of jumped into my head like ideas sometimes do and I knew immediately it was a good idea and I had to do it but I didn't know what it was going to be and I kept talking to him about it and he wasn't getting it and I saw\nThis doesn't make sense he's the guy that that made me understand\nWhat the hell's yourself alright the book the book is Donald drain the swamp\nThe dentist Springer show the\nRelief factor\nSeven\nSprings here for American federal rare coin and Boulder
