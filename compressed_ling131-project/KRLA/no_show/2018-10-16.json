updated people aren't pastor Brunson is\nA situation but I wanted to get your thoughts on his release yours administer seeing him Neal and prejudice just your reaction to those that twenty four hours of of a release from uh what was ultimately house arrest in Turkey after a year and a half in prison or more than a year and a half in prison\nAnd uh you know stopping over in Germany at the military base than landing at joint base Andrews which you were based in and then um and then being in the oval office with the president I'd say a prayer for the president\nYeah pastor Brunson a spiritual in personal integrity or was really on display in not in a bragging doses we on his part\nBut when he prayed for the president and then just this whole demeanor his attitude he very quickly said that he forgave his captors and the officials in Turkey who not only arrested in under false pretenses but they miss treated him part of the time he was there and just say that he forgave them immediately was a\nPowerful powerful witness that in addition to him praying for the president in the oval office it shows the the the real a character of the man himself\nYou know I'm going to make sure you all had a chance to hear from everybody that our team who had been working on this comedy though this to the radio broadcast or to get west west his comment on that and with pastor Brunson but coming back or to be on the air with us live tomorrow\nOr on Jay Sekulow alive let's get right to the phones a lot of calls coming up politics what about a Michael's called to that because Michael ... was one of those folks who I city are you actually getting involved with the campaign he at the headquarters you volunteer and Michael uh you're doing just that I get give us an update\nBy just want to let you see them you know that um you know Dean Heller as of last friday he was asked\nYou know a head not that much ahead but he was still ahead and there's a lot of young people out there ... young Republicans getting out there and and you know getting the word out on the street to get out and vote but I just wanted to let let everybody know that it's not just us old guys anymore\nThat young people that are that are out there now\nOh you know I Will tell you as soon as worked on number campaigns young people play a very important role in the grassroots efforts of the campaigns are\nNot taking away from any of our anybody older but you know knock it on neighborhood doors a it takes a lot of time energy if you're out in Nevada and the heat or you can imagine are in other places where it could be called\nUm it's somewhere between I Am a hills I listen to it they they they fire up campaigns young people and that it is important that you you see that kind of enthusiasm around a candidate is not everything grass ... but grassroots plays a very important role in mid term elections and saying that race in Nevada is key\n[noise] yeah the Nevada race Jordan as we talked about that is one of the races the Democrats absolutely have to win if they want to be the majority in the United States Senate and that race like many of the others are has moved decidedly and Dean Heller direction I think if you look back a couple of months ago I think you would have probably prefer to be Jacky Rosen in that race I think right now you prefer to be\nA Dean Heller and it's followed the national trend that we've seen but er during the common I Would make about that race is Democrats and don't win that seat they won't be in the majority in the United States Senate that's ...\nYeah I mean let me let me go to west south west you you you know your thoughts just as the it seems like the mood has changed me\nYes one of that is the president's back on the campaign trail and doing what he does best which is a those rallies and they are a now happening you know almost every day or or or even sometimes too and one day they will continue to ramp up we've heard from a ...\nA White House orange she made clear as the president will continue to be on the road even today surveying the damage in forties do his job as commander in chief is with pastor Brunson on\nA Saturday but it was back at a campaign rally or you know that\nA following that showed me he is he is out there um it does seem like there's been just a shift I I I and I I don't just say that because I I'm a conservative it just it just seems like ... ... with the cabinet or what happened there everything's just started changing ... going the opposite direction for Democrats who were on the ticket least electorally\n... they were producing a blue wave and I think many people you know are believed it I certainly was concerned that they might be right but here's the thing Jordan the American people by and large or a decent in kind people\nAnd the political climate has changed and it's been so ugly you mentioned ... ... you know justice Kevin all that happened to him look at recent statements by Eric Holder and Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren\nAre that are really mean spirited kinds of things and I think the American people are turned off from that and when they see these kinds of things going on not only does it energized a GOP based to get out and vote which needs to happen but it moves independent voters also\nIn the name of decency and kindness which is the value of most Americans it museum also to vote for the Republican candidates that the Democrats really I think are looping when they ought to be running because of their own miscalculations\nThey're ignoring the values and the concerns I Believe that the average American a middle America in southern America and I think is going to come back to bite them and the mid term elections as a real possibility of that but to answer your question is the political climate and the ugliness\n\nMissouri Hi Canada\nFrom\nBradley Cooper but he got quiet because it rocked the box office\nFirst manned plot\nAnd there is nothing more predictable\nAnd ... of a movie about going to the moon that does not include Neil Armstrong planting a flag on them or\nShall I was one\nThat I mean people are just had it\nWith anti Americanism subtle or in bird\nAnd I know the flag is all over the astronauts I Know they show the flag on the moon but they they cut it out I told you are going to happen in ... blocked expected to do twenty million and that was a low ball number sixteen million and it's got a flop\nNo one's going to go to a uh I told you that I told you that there was so obvious sometimes so why do I begin with that because the reaction that Donald Trump interview on CBS was also a ... people who like Trump loved being interviewed people hate Trump hated the interview and Trump it\nEver say some things are predictable and obvious\nSo let me do the predictable obvious stuff about the elections that are coming up I was on Al Sharpton show yesterday and got asked that I listen to\nUm meet the press yesterday wasn't on the panel buys watch it and uh Stacey Abrams is running for governor George it started to complain about voter suppression I said okay she's lost that's over\nOr if you're complaining about voter suppression you're conceding that you're going to lose the election\nCannot read on jobs education or something like Scott Walker is up in Wisconsin around the fact that three percent unemployment in Wisconsin the really want to screw around with that\nAt all across the United states Republican candidates are surging\nKevin Cramer has basically defeated Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota already Josh ... has already basically defeated Claire McCaskill but big surging and we want them to win by a lot we need a repudiation\nOf what happened to justice Kavanaugh\nMichael Braun his surging in India that Rick Scott the governor of Florida is surging ... even though he's\nRepairing it devastated coasts and more on that and the second president is going to Montana for Matt Rosendale against John tester\nI wouldn't write off John James Jimmer nature way of ... or either\nLooks like Marsha Blackburn has got to hold her Senate taking tendency Martha McSally a surging in Arizona and voting is underway in Arizona by the way that this is going to win by double digits or anything I don't think it's going to be closed Christian center has been exposed as a hard left wing radical\nAs recently as eight years ago her do over is not going to work and Dean Heller of Nevada\nYou could add the Republicans win four or five net plus seat\nThat'd be a fifty six Republicans because they are that the country is rejecting\nVomiting out actually\nThe be angry nuts\nDespicable politics of personal destruction and the attacks on Trump it just makes so crazy now to turn on Morning Joe and see the handwringing about sixty minutes area which it was frankly very entertaining and interesting in a real glimpse of the president\nAs I as he thinks\nWhat story has got to be talked about today\nAfter twenty two those are\nThe greatest fighter in the world ever created\nThey're very expensive I Believe it was a hundred and fifty million dollars per point\nThey only have two hundred and something like that\nThe greatest they're stopping it could be anything they can be surprised if they can be any Russia and China which at the at play to our best jet and we should have made six hundred of them but we shot but why not prematurely Obama of course ah\nFor whatever reason inexplicable to me\nSeventeen at twenty twos weren't laughed at Kendall airfare space\nTheir condition as I Know\nWhich says to me likely badly damaged that is the equivalent of losing eight cruisers at a naval base but\nThe cost of that is staggering\nThan the accountability of it is going to be severe\nI bring that up because last night the president was talking about general secretary of defense Mattis\nHere's what he said ... number three what about a general matter is he going to leave I don't know he hasn't told me that they want her relationship with him it could be that he is I think it's sort of a Democrat if you want to know the\nGeneral Mattis has a good guy we get along very well may leave I mean at some point everybody everybody believes that's Washington\nThat is right away completely true even during the early days of the war\nWhen there and by the early days of the war the war has been going on since two thousand and one not two thousand Eighteen so it's a Seventeen year war now\nIn Afghanistan in Iraq and in ...\nIslamist extremism around the world for Seventeen years early in the war six years in the war W doesn't get to leave\nBut people left W\nAnd I always I always shook my head is like George Marshall walking off\nThe fired Don Rumsfeld he had to replace them after the two thousand six election that's not\nThat's not leaving but something made voluntarily left in the middle of the war I thought what George Marshall up during World War two really got started in thirty nine\nAnd Marshall just stayed in state and stayed never complained that the professionals in the military never leave but\nEverybody does leave and now I'm thinking [noise]\nGeneral at it I mean secretary of defense Mattis and it's important to refer to miss ... because he was a civilian without a general\nTo look at losing Seventeen twenty twos\nLet's say who is that on\nWho is responsible for that that is a ... that is a strategic why is\nThat the idea of Seventeen F twenty two fighters they are not stop all\nThey are not they are our front line of defense it it's just a natural that they left the air force base\nAnd service culture and accountability in the navy fired five senior admirals last year over three collisions and the grounding\nIn your animals that the Navy's\nA culture of a kind of I don't know at the airport says but I think secretary of defense Mattis has to be looked at in the mirror this morning saying so I got all that money I got\nSeventeen\nReplaceable have twenty two\nWere left at times it turned out I I just can't can't even describe what that means\nWhat the president say about\nThe show gate or this is a brutal story it's a horrible probable murder\nHave no idea who did it on whose orders\nI have no idea if it actually occurred at the Turkish embassy the Turks say dead at the Saturday consulate in Turkey and the Turks said did such a thing that they can spy but air to one of the bad guy to understand that\nA here's what the president said cut number nine\nTen mile ... shall gain\nThe journalists and journalists\nOnce he murdered by the Saudis and did the prince getting the order\nFor nobody knows yet but we'll probably be able to find out it's being investigated by is being looked at very very strongly that we wouldn't be very upset and angry if that were the case as of this moment they deny it ended that tonight the mentally [noise]\nCouldn't be them yes\nThe challenger ... got on the phone and asked\nHe did he deny\nDeny it they denied every way you can imagine the not too distant future I think we'll know an answer what are your options let's say they did what are your options would you consider imposing sanctions as a bipartisan group of senators proposed\nDepends on what the sanctions or give you an example [noise] day ordering military club [noise]\nEverybody in the world wanted that order Russia wanted at China wanted we wanted it\nWe got it so would you cut that on like what I don't want to do [noise] slowing ... racy on all these ... I don't want to hurt jobs I don't want to lose in order to like that there are other ways of\nA shame\nTo use a word that's a pretty harsh words on the show how\nEverybody what to take care [laughter] you know there's a lot\nTo say there's a lot at stake and [noise]\nMade me especially show because this man was a reporter\nTo something you'll be surprised me say that is something really terrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we're gonna have to say we're going to get to the bottom of it and that will be severe punishment\nDark so that is exactly the right thing to say we don't know we're going to get to the bottom of it is disgusting that it's a reporter a terrific and so the president is learning how to do these things he was interrupted like a thousand times by Leslie stall but we'll come back to that\nToday we begin week three of my campaign urging you to support the alliance defending freedom\nThis is the mobs versus jobs elections also the judges election it's a justice Kevin I'll watch the premier religious freedom organization the United states as alliance defending freedom senior counsel Jim Campbell tells us\nA it was started by people like James Dobson and Marlin medics and it was really just a response as these gentlemen and others like them looked out and saw there were a lot of challenges to religious freedom and they didn't see anyone out there to defend it so they said we're going to address this problem by putting together this new organization\nAnd so for the last twenty five years we've been defending religious freedom and defending freedom of speech around the country\nDon't touch my Medicare dot com\nIs run by a masters in return American citizens which you should be a member or\nA Mac it's a million plus strong they are up a potent adversary of A.
