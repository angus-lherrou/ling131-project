saying there isn't there some additional person purposes with Parkinson's or cancer I are paying a chronic pain I get it\nBut you don't have to have\nThe THC in the end the marijuana and you were part of a society that in a state of California that the thing that thinks that's the purpose that is the aggressive thing that we're going to do that's the part that we're going to push\nOur legislators\nWho go to San Francisco Gavin Newsom run that plays into the ground\nI won't even go back there ever again\nNever and it's a beautiful city\nFor human waste everywhere they leave food out for people as if they are animals\nHere people stopping and using the restroom on the sidewalk incoming holes in front of a business that somebody else is paying property tax on\nThat somebody worked very hard\nOne point to get to to to buy\nAnd you don't have a right to not have a person in your doorway sleeping or using the restaurant\nWhen did that become normal\nHow did you get to a place\nTo to to think that compassionate flooding somebody live like an animal is compassionate\nAnd the state of California thinks it's all about what the me too movement or they they think we should like ... criminals out of ... you know prisoner black lives matter or\nYou don't really care about people who care about human beings people\nIf you start from there\nThings will go in a better direction\nAnd our seniors are finding that the craziness even if they are for Democrats they're not the far left is a nurse and I'm outta here\nThey would prefer to be in a place\nWhere there's common sense\nBecause our state Democratic Party does not have any common sense anymore I'm Sorry they just don't\nInstead of standing up for their values they stand up for nothing\nPound on the door hard enough scream and yell right really mean nasty things\nAnd social media or in the\nNew York times or the LA Times that's it everybody caves\nNow it's just a bunch of mob it's the mob mentality\nIf you don't think the next step is a vigilantism\nWhen you're not paying attention\nWe had to buy my office\nOne of the local homeless guys picking up a rock and throwing it at the building next door to men broke the window\nWe saw the whole thing of it it was clear as day right we have cameras\nWe know who this person is he's out there a lot\nTo give it to the owner the owner of the building is on my gosh thank you take her to the police went to the police say\nYou know what after Jerry Brown pass these rules and the state Democratic Party that runs both legislatures passed these rules look\n... if we arrest them nothing's going to happen is going to be out in Fifteen minutes it's over it's a waste of our time it can't pull somebody off the street for this kind of\nAre you kidding me\nThey said there's no reason to arrest him\nNow think about this for a second\nYear that business owner who has to pay the insurance premiums you're the person down the street or across town that has to pay the insurance payment\nTo just go oh well I guess that's the way it is every day this guy can break windows no big deal\nEvery week somebody can there not a problem\nSo you don't think that somebody's going to set a stand up and say look enough\nAnd people that shouldn't have to be hurt or going to get hurt\nAnd it's going to be because the politicians tied the hands of law enforcement\nAnd made whatever criminal act that was criminal yesterday is no longer a crime and all of a sudden these people that live in a world\nOf listen I work hard I have myself I my property\nSo I think a lot of people are relocating from this craziness because you realize this is not normal traveled to any other state in the United states they don't call this normal this is not the way they do business you throw a rock and a window and and break it in forty six other states you're going to jail\nAnd you may not come out by the weekend and if you're not mentally stable they're going to check into a hospital\nAnd if you're an alcoholic or a drug addict you have other issues that they're going to do\nSo if you're planning to downsize you might think\nAs an option relocating out of the state of California\nI hate it I grew up here I was born here raised here\nSan Fernando valley my whole life\nRight until I had a family moved\nJust Fifteen miles from from my birthplace\nBorn in Hollywood\nSo you have to consider this as an option here\nOf the other things for an emergency for financial emergency if it entails something like disability or death\nWe have seen guys and this is pretty amazing we have seen\nLife insurance be there as a tool\nOf course it's there is a tool when you have somebody who passes away I mean that's obvious but it's a tax free tool\nIn other words you can use a hundred a few hundred dollars a month\nTo equal\nHundreds of thousands of dollars tax free\nSo consider that as an option and one of the benefits inside of that\nIs having certain life insurance plans allow you to access the death benefit which is a big number\nRight the three hundred five hundred thousand dollars of life insurance\nThey allow you to access it for chronic illness\nFor critical illness\nFor a terminal illness if you need help with some pretty serious disability you can access summer part or even all of that money while you're still alive\nSo there's some benefits to having a life insurance policy for certain types of emergencies\nAnd you you don't have to be in perfect health by the way it used to be you had to be a marathon runner just to qualify anymore you can have certain medications you're on you can have high blood pressure medication as long as it's reasonably control\nDiabetes reasonably control do what you're a once a year you're staying in range",
