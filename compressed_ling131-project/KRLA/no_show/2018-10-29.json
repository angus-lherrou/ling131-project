I Know I I don't remember which which I'm number or a letter a ballot is\nBut yet it is something ... amendment B or something like that Mr disease called did you hear a few minutes ago and we don't have it on our list but maybe if a if a color or listener\nOr or or somebody of my staff who actually has to be listening tonight would send me a ... would look it up to see what that did that bank is at what measure it is because we really wanted to condemn that oh what is your understanding of why they wanted to do this Alan\n[noise] I think they're on public money to use any way they can\nYeah a high school was that was asked you you are absolutely right that is the correct answer but what excuse to the offering what what what's the hustle what are they trying to do here\nThey don't they're trying to convince us that we should give our money the private banks set up a profit on a set the city will not make a profit they in fact will give us better terms or banking et cetera and therefore will also allow the city that have money to use\nYou know if I was a head\nAnd had been away for ten days I go for\nIt [laughter]\nI Do yeah I mean the idea I mean these these people\nCan't even fill in potholes and we'll go put them in the banking business it is just a joke at these are the same people I I don't know if you heard what we're talking about before but the city of Los Angeles pension plan\nCurrently consumes something like ... almost won\nA out of three dollars is a little bit less and that's like twenty seven percent or something like that but that\nYou know those pension contributions are phoney are understated as a matter of fact the uh uh the city of Los Angeles has been on funded\nPension liability of at least of ... of of of at least forty one million of forty one billion excuse me forty ...\nBillion as in a BS\nBill you I I I as a few thousand Fifteen but that's love is a phony number the number is probably closer to eighty billion and they wanted to go into the banking business you know but he should give these guys money at all and you know what I think that the real reason that they want to do the Citibank [noise]\nI I think it's it's to provide banking services for all the dope dealers a medical marijuana or whatever you call them that that are in the city who have trouble uh uh uh establishing\nRegular banking relationships\nOr because of regulations by the federal government because most of this\nUh marijuana and medical drugs and so forth remain illegal under federal law so these guys are out there taking in do money and and the federal regulators\nAre not crazy about it so I think that the city wants to get in on that and provide them\nA regular banking services so that people were purchasing so called medical marijuana could use their credit cards [noise]\nRather than the cash and makes a huge problem\nI I have a question do I yeah I'm not against factions for public employees I think you ought to be whatever well the city and employees should be able to negotiate those kinds of things but\nThe fact that it's all run to the point that seems to be a major concern what is the remedy ... present situation if you\nWill you do the remedy is insolvency but yeah I ... you know I I've been on this topic here Allen a you know I've actually\nConcerned about these things for Thirty years more\nThat that I've been watching the growth to the pension problems in the United states then it'd be get back to the eighties and early nineties wet when large companies started to get out of the defined benefit pension system\nAnd move over to the regular pension system which is a defined contribution in other words I get most of us in private industry we get a salary or compensation and and then we set up four one K. type programs\nWe make contributions soon to that most of us do not get a defined benefit like the government people do\nShow you know we need to be out of that business whether or not they ought to have a a have a paid should\nThe fact is is that we loved the political class to determine these parents used to pay themselves don't run the program to handle the investments and they just failed totally and completely\nSo we need to be out of that business I mean we're looking at over a trillion dollars worth of one funded liabilities here a pension liabilities just pensions for the three major programs but ... over a trillion dollars\nAnd a ... and no end in sight so which is good to have to have to visit the cities are are going to have to sit down with the employees and restructure the shakes but I'm not sure they get the job done\nThis is simply a vote for political party this vote for morality on God's green earth itself\nAnd I hope they will vote very seriously consider very seriously to vote only Republican because whereas Republicans might have many\nIssues and problems with their own pale in comparison anything the Democratic leadership present mhm and ... and ... yeah how's it and now something out there for witness all the tools that trade the Democratic leadership and even the Democrats who to realize that the rank and file voters\nThey don't realize they're just suckered and lie to every day\nEvery day and we all are and we're all caught up in this in this crazy rhetoric and I know I couldn't hear some voices and and a big criticism say hey look\nMike aren't aren't you an outlet issues were you in Brent there aren't you guys doing the same thing that you object to when the Democrats do it which is polluted seizing this terrible event\nAnd I think that my my my reply would be no that's not what we're doing mhm that these events do supply very important lessons as it is the purpose here it is to not not to make a a a\nDo turn their tragedy into a political ... I'd like to draw lessons and don't learn something from what has happened here\nCertainly and it was only one mass murder that would be one thing but we're not just talking about what happened and\nWe're talking about the rapid anti Semitism on our college campuses and California in our public schools the Christian beliefs and that's right they system isn't I'm not trying to take a political one particular event I think the whole thing has just been you provide\nYes and that's why I mentioned also uh\nYou know the you know the the ... the persecution\nAnd the murder of Christians throughout the world which is an unprecedented level and the point is is that whether it's a U.S questions or our elder brother is in the face the Jews from whom we got our of Christianity\nUm uh we we are believers in the one God we subscribe to the commandments we believe in the Providence of God we believe in right and wrong of moral order from which all levels is it descends\nImpressions from this is this tremendous at this lies at the core of our of our country the core of our values these are Judeo Christian values that are the absolute\nFoundation of everything the the the we have here in this country and it's all under attack beautifully every every last bit of it and we we have to reject that\nAnd we we do need to preserve our or rice but boy Christianity in anybody else ward chick you'll age any lasting proof\nAnybody who stands up and the opposition to the government is is this is not right you are going to be struck down ... ... and ... and that that's why\nThey go after the believing Jews when they have a chance to him but it seems to be part of a biblical curse almost a A N and they go after any Christian who stands up this to Jason that Baker but no matter who it is we have to stand up against it and there's one party in this country\nWho seems a which seems to ... to me ... more than the other and your property called them to account brand of bread we have a few other colors coming up here I'm into the last part of it uh yeah I I'm sure glad that you called\nAnd would these nights a you know let's have a special discussion on these issues after the election beautiful ... in a covered some of these things because\nPushing back against a totalitarian as it's state\nBy ... is our primary objective is manifestations of the state and the local level ... me and the federal level we need to\nTalk about it and we need to vote for truth and purr morality\nI'm with you with your breath you take care of my friends to talk to you again soon All right next up we have Jerry from Oh hi wants to talk about proposition six how are you today Jerry\nI'm doing fine thank you great are a lot\nMy problem with that part so that they said there's five point one billion dollars are going to be removed from a ... repairs along yes in a ... pie chart went all the way they spend the money from the taxes that ... and now\nLook all the old yes so they they budgeted for the day in dollars\nOut of that and uh so bad now point one billion ... percent of the six to ... oh you're going to go to a road highway repairs and maintenance right on public transportation\nSure there you go public transportation [noise] not the roads yeah\nPublic transportation\nRight now if you know the hustle Jerry if you if you if you did and lumber is on that flight path on\nBay and comes up as either thirty is better than thirty percent of that six to ... or more than fifty percent of that ... ... one day and that they have but you did for\nFor the roads yeah and and how can that twelve cents me\nOr that kind of a percentage of their their projected budget\nYeah well let me ask you this jury are are you generally in favor of proposition six are generally opposed to it because you know\n... thousand percent for\nFor it to okay good All right yeah what what did happen here and I've I've had the opportunity to speak\nWith some people who are very very knowledgeable about how this money has been working in in the city's so SP one when they came up with the ... the way that the sold it\nWas the way that they structured it\nFor for the first time in a long time they'd actually locked some money in\nTo the budget is the one to the cities and the county used to have so much responsibility for maintaining roads so that gave them for the first time but a long time as absolutely reliable\nA flow of cash in other words all the money that had been taxed to weigh in the past in order to to pay for roads was just a siphoned off\nEvery allocated everywhere else but as the one they finally got kind of serious now what we need to do is to repeal as be one send up baggage series about the existing buddy quit

I don't know if you have read it recently but it can be it can be really challenging\nI mean\nPaul talking about to the to the currently in church in particularly first Corinthians twelve twenty six if one part of the church suffers if one part a\nSuffers every part suffers with it if one part is honored every part Rick choices with it isn't that the truth really comes to anything\nWhen it comes to our family and brothers or sisters and Christ\nOne part of suffering really\nEvery parts suffer with that\nAnd I I just want to say thank you on behalf of the persecuted Christian families that we walk side by side with\nOver the course of the last few months there's been two hundred\nFamilies who are being cared for in Nigeria and I don't know if you're aware of this but the salon is a militant terrorist group\nUm I mean they're really I cannot they they they just Rome and their terrorizing of promoting hate destroying entire villages and stealing the land of Christians inhabited that land for hundreds of years\nAnd recently in June\nMy newfound friend and brother Dr Joel ...\nChristian solidarity international CSI as has already been on the ground all around the world and and what that may name stand for Christians solidarity international standing up side by side\nWith persecuted brothers or sisters or bars around the world and in Nigeria for Loni have a tactic continue to attack this militant Islamic group\nAnd Christians were boys girls young his three four five six seven years old watching parents be killed their crime they love Jesus\nThese precious little boys and girls to have what they call ... outlet gutless markings are being hit by a car was basically that's their work for a machete\nAnd they've been shot they'd been maimed\nChristian solidarity international on the ground partnering with the church to provide restored\nHope and dignity safe refuge food water medical treatment counseling\nToilets simply be able to have the dignity of being able to have\nA toilet to use after their whole villages been ripped apart we have thirty families in critical need now\nTwo hundred and twenty five dollars provides a full package of aid which are best gifted eight eight eight to five three three five to to how many families will you care for him again the phone number again and and look just drawn he invited I'm here to join us and\nWhat a privilege it as a have\nMy fellow brother here in the Dave cave here with me as we discussed the\nPlight of our brothers or sisters but eight eight eight to five three three five to two uh two hundred and twenty five dollar gift provides that full package of aid and enjoy you were there and June at the side of that massacre I welcome you brother thank you for being here man I'm new to take forever but what did it\nHow does it impact you when you were there standing on us soil that these fellow brothers just of ours were were killed just knowing that crime if they love Jesus that was that what\nYeah well I mean first of all I felt like I was on the ground imagine how many martyrs there were and just a four day period there were over two hundred and thirty five martyrs people who died because they love Jesus [laughter]\nSo there was this sense of awe that this this is a this is the new forefront of Christian persecution and\nAt the same time there were so many people to help Franco a suicide a project manager in Nigeria and I were there to bring aid to assess the situation um to come back to the United states so surely stories with people that that can offer help\nBut to be honest the there was so many people that are needed in media attention and we were listening to their stories we were taking notes we were assessing what the needs are [noise]\nAnd it didn't affect me until I left later I didn't realize how much sort of associated trauma would go along with\nJust witnessing that sort of event firsthand thrice and um as I as I went away from the situation there was just a lot of emotion\nUm a lot that I had to work through 'em on a personal level just to sort of the loop you thinking about those stories and thinking like by met Ruth for example who has a six year old son and a four year old daughter I have a six year old son and a four year old daughter and the\nThe challenge of so you know relating my life and all the blessings that God's given me and the safety that I feel here in this country to someone in a very similar situation with the family but\nBut ... reality day to day their their\nTheir lives are threatened\nI mean she is prepared to any particular time the ... a night with her family to hide under the bed when the phone and come to attack\nSo there's just a very very difficult to process all of that\nYou know we're talking Naomi just now Joel and um you know the most vulnerable her yeah her husband's legally blind she has eight children and to to know that God had a miracle take place there and Naomi life because she was praying\nAnd pleading with the father and he had it in his in his heart say okay now that Seventeen year old kid take that canister and go elsewhere but yeah the ... the most vulnerable are being attacked him and that\nThat to me as a Christian man it angers me brother it it angers me and the other the the most helpless mhm are being attacked by cowards\nAnd we're standing up and saying you know what in Jesus' name these Christian Brothers sisters of ours are not forgotten Naomi her blind her blind has been there eight children\nYou're talking about pastor John to me just a bit ago he had a really\n... what we had to he had to have this whole church burned down is that we're telling you I did\nThis is one of the things that is just an outrage when the flooding comes through their specifically finding the churches of course the burning the churches down raising the churches out just according churches\nAnd they take over the terrorists they take over the lab and they'll rebuild the from the foundations of the church that will tend to rebuild a mosque\nThat's why we can't let this happen they have to stand up for our brothers and sisters so John pastor John also from the Anglican Church\nWas one of these passers who was threatened he did a CNN interview some months ago and when the ... found out that he was speaking out against the persecution they targeted him specifically he told his family his wife has kids when you go to the marketplace don't use your last name\nBecause when they find out that we are in the area they're gonna they're gonna find where we are going to kill us so he was living under that type of fear\nAnd they came they destroyed his church and you know a pastor John he's got a great sense of all this with all the spirit and are they lost their church but they found a a mess tent their media inside that ten now as we're not going to let the full any stop us from meeting together\nAnd that churches continuing to this day and John continues to speak out as a threat of his life\nOn the threat of his own life threatening his own family's life their church burned down yeah for any of us at any one of those things would have a stop us in our track say we're not going to do this we're ... we're not do the same war that's why his church is now they're meeting in a tent\nThe maybe the ... and John is one of our partners helping deliver the eight in the region so he's not just like holding his ground he's ... he's helping others is a phenomenal don't\nYou know I mean and you know this speak to this this is this is we're feeling the tank for for Christians to be able to have the boldness to say\nThis is our ground this is our territory we love we're going to forgive but we're also going to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ regardless of what happened and we're keeping that\nKendall of that whole nests there are we not\nExactly like in the book of acts of believers in prey take away the ... persecution they said look in the midst of the threats let you serve and speak to your word with great boldness\nAnd that's what's happening on to a church leaders there that there are those that are standing up and say we will not give up we will not give it we will stand in the kingdom established you're sharing with me too and I know we we\nTold the stories um pass broadcast to in the campaign we had the the the ... some Muslims Islamic members are seeing the boldness and they're converting\nThere have been yeah there have been stories there's I've met people that were boldly witnessing to philosophy\nOf Muslims and imagine the youth if you're if you're growing up in the ... the Muslim community and you see your four or five you see this type of these acts of violence taking place but then on the up on the other side do you see acts of love forgiveness\nUm people that are completely vulnerable that are only responding with acts of kindness back to the philosophy what would you choose as a young person [laughter] you the way of love with the way of hatred and that's why this Dave in this campaign though where we have right now is a way of showing\nThat Christian love is so much more powerful than the hatred of Islamists and this is not just happening I jury this is this is a ideological global warfare that we're participating in on one level or another\nThat we are standing up with their brothers and sisters and say love will defeat this form of evil\nPhone number is Tripoli to five three thirty five to two we're inviting you to invest in this restored hope\nI'm Christian solidarity international in the plight of the persecuted Christian Nigerian families\nThe safe refuge and what that means there's a roof over their head after these fellow brothers sisters of ours have had their village their churches there there are there\nTo burn down completely destroyed their land taken so that refuge means not only do they have a roof over their head but dignity to be able to have a a a toilet to use I mean that\nGuys this is what we're talking about ladies and gentleman that safe refuge is that the food of course water yes medical treatment so much of a jaw you're talking about the the children that were in the hospital and continue to be in the hospital recovering from their ma Shadi injuries are\nBeing shot so that medical treatment the counseling their crime why are they shot why are they machetes why other ... other moms and dads are being decapitated by machines because they love Jesus and they are not giving up the Christ\nThis is our investment providing the store at home so what's your best guess now two hundred and twenty five dollar gift provides a full package of eight eight eight eight to five three three five to to Tripoli\nTo five three three five to two\nWhat's your best guess now does she ten families care for at eight eight eight to five three three five to two Joel what do the uh when you talk to 'em you know we we talk to our our our brothers sisters they're on the ground I'm a partner Franco what if I\nAm a seminary the answer family could stand in the same\nRoom or look I'd either one of our fellow brothers or sisters who've had their whole world up ended loved ones killed what would the Nigerian Christian family what have they said what would\nThey say what would you say do I am a seminary the answer family\nA day but when I was there I was so impressed by the attitude of these ah brothers sisters of ours they weren't coming they weren't begging and they weren't dreaming of going to America and starting to live there they love their lives they love their families and communities that the established they just want their they want their lives back again\nThey want the dignity reestablished and I think they would say thank you for praying for us thank you for standing with us thank you for giving so that we can and that we can get back up on our feet during this difficult time third dignified people hardworking people are beautiful people\nAnd um I I Hope of some of you have the privilege of meeting some of them on this side of eternity as well because they're they're precious I enjoy the time with them so much we were other parts of Nigeria where we met at church leaders and enjoy the fellowship\nAnd the type of um [noise] church services they have the music and the dancing in the library and get very much so and we have a lot to learn from them because they are um their faith is strong in the midst of these type of trials even so when you talk about\nPast your John yeah church burned down ... family being threatened and he says I'm not giving up on the name of Jesus and he's writing his church in a tent\nYep yep and helping bring aid to others I mean it's phenomenal that type of fate that's being you know I'm demonstrated during during this difficult time the phone number\nIs Tripoli to five three three five two to eight eight eight to five three three five to too many there's been painted the urgency I trust you hear\nTime is of the essence we have fellow brothers sisters or bars who are\nIn need of medical treatment even now as we were showing a joy showing me pictures of\nFranco sending pictures of of of Christians were attacked on our way to work this morning from ... in that\nHorrible atrocity cars being burned with families inside churches being destroyed lives being taken all because they believe in Jesus Christ\nWhat is your best guess now two hundred and twenty five dollars provides that safe refuge in the food or water the counseling\nTriple eight to five three three five two to eight eight eight to five three three five to two thirty families are critical need we get ten families here for right now what's your best guess\nJoe thank you for\nLetting us know about this need\nSlowly and thank you day for\nGiven a voice of the Nigerian church for being generous and and helping out our brothers or sisters during this time\nOf persecution
