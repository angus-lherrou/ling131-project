{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "And then you go over to Glendale in Burbank I have no idea how much uh uh their taxes or their sales tax increases going to generate but it should be substantial\nA a\nGood deals are very large city and so was Burbank so if anybody out there knows anything about those two cities\nBe sure to coalition with some uh some information in the meanwhile you you need to know about some uh some propositions we're getting down a do just about the uh the end\nOf October first we're now down to what thirty five days what what day is the election I should note that by heart November six November section cornered thirty eight or something ... All right so we're thirty eight thirty nine and counting down and those are absentee ballots\nWill go out and about three weeks\nBefore the election day so you can expect\nTo see those absentee ballots drop\nA I think he would do three\nOf the weekend of the twelfth\nNo no later than the weaker the fifteenth of October so that's when when you're going to see your ballots coming in into your homes and so forth so you really need you you should be getting sample ballot here pretty soon\nUh for the have you got your statewide ballot yet no okay so the county of Los Angeles usually says ah ah some some information\nAh it in the sample ballot before you get the actual ballot [noise]\nUh I I'm not sure you know ... where the where the rat but a ... you know that there is a huge enterprise to give out a large election a Kennedy of Los Angeles has had some problems but you want to make sure\nThat you're registered to vote you still have time make sure that if you move that you have a a correctly identified a your address and made the changes\nAh ah with the county and uh I was going to say to make sure that you have proper ID but then again they don't require id or in the states so I guess or anybody give vote if they want to just show up a\nRegister it's the whole thing's a joke but we'll see I strongly suspect ladies and gentleman that voter turnout is going to be low ball\nRight which means that uh those of you who agree with us or conservatives are on the fiscal issues or who believe in free man free markets limited constitutional government if you agree with us you could probably lead read your vote now\nWhat am I talking about four years ago\nWhen Jerry Brown was re elected for the second time or if you will the third time [noise]\nUh yeah the voter turnout was only twenty five percent state wide and what that meant was\nTwo things number one it lower the threshold for qualifying initiatives that had a really huge effect and resulted in a number of initiatives being qualified state wide but in addition what it also meant was that those who voted\nTheir their votes counted for for for\nBecause you're voting for yourself and three other people who did\nThat so important and leverage your vote is so get out and vote a properly in these municipal elections\nTeach them a lesson told them that there is a limit on taxation and and they have just reached it and you need to tell these people know and they view the voters don't tell them no well who's going to\nSee that's really where we're at our democracy a here ladies and gentlemen you and I have to take ownership of this problem and it's not a sufficient answer does say that uh you're too busy or don't make the difference that's alive I just told you\nThat your vote will count likely four times you vote was for yourself and that'll count like for cars is three of the people that very likely will not vote\nAnd you're going to find a high degree I think of apathy over on a you know the liberal side for example we've guy gathered nuisance here my impression is that there's not a lot of excitement about this guy\nA ... and ... and I think is running closer with Cox than we know Ed Koch shoot I just read tonight Jonathan er Cox had contributed the original two hundred fifty thousand dollars\nTo the repeal gas tax\nAh effort with a run by Carl DeMaio yeah that and he's so he's putting his money where his mouth as he is it it you know a ... Cox\nUh may not be to everybody's expectations but I can tell you right now he's going to be a hell of a lot better than gathered nuisance or who will Jakob taxes you don't the taxes give be our would just wait\n... you know people were saying this last year the year before one the meantime they passed a a gas tax this take an eight hundred dollars more per year out of the average family for a for those of you are conservatives\nOr Republicans who think that we can have an impact bear in mind\nThat that average family out there as a younger family might even be a Latino family that tends to vote Democrat here is a wonderful opportunity for us to vote and help make their lives easier we vote against this tax because it makes their life harder\nAnd family Shriver hard enough time in the state and one of the areas where families have a huge problem is in the area of rent is a major major\nUh a factor for them and putting it rank control under the guise of trying to help them as a cold for if proposition ten is just a disaster for the small family well we have a couple of callers here and uh you know we we have somebody\nWho would like to talk very briefly about judge Kavanaugh we have bread from Los Angeles Brett how are you tonight\nHow are you in mind our I pray on\nHow's it going Brett how I just wanted to bring up that situation even though it might not be considered local ... the idea of what I think the rate of America and the ... the United States Constitution as a result of what's going on with judge Brett Kavanaugh that's\nUnbelievable that because I Believe in the constitution are just trying to destroy him yes and I don't I don't think we ... about the judge for about ...\nDan is calling a rape case about the complete\nA distortion corruption and ruin nation of civil discourse by it and indeed should point out uh that that there is you know this is a normal disagreement there isn't any area for compromise\nNow uh we we try to ah ah\nAh we we try to keep our focus here a on a state local issues and what I Would like to point out here brand\nIs why do the and these are mostly liberals including flake here\nUh you know why do they behave like they behave what is the countenance a these late hits in this kind of saying well it's very simple because there are no consequences from them yes I Know there are no consequences from the press corps in on the deal with them\nBut there are no electoral ... uh consequences and that's because we can trace it all back to the public employees union who channel eighty or Ninety percent or more of their contributions to the same people who trashed\nThe judicial a nomination proceeding you're even have to agree with the guy but you can't tear up the Congress she can't tear up a our constitutional arrangements in in the fashion it which they did it's absolutely outrageous\nAnd that's why we decided to start to California taxpayers union because we need a union of our own must be an organization and a and I'm hoping that you've already joined us whether it's two dollars a week\nTwenty dollars a month or preferably thousand dollars a year just like a show called Teachers Association of whatever it is when we have on our side uh uh a hundred thousand two hundred thousand five hundred thousand of our own union members kicking in\nA a a a five hundred thousand dollars a year do you think that the electoral situation would look like it does right now Brent absolutely no professor I Do\nAre going back to Greece particularly by including the democracies and in Western Europe at our own we are of course constitutionally a republic that is that the federal level or we govern ourselves\nA a a through a state system\nWithin the states are you it'd be interesting I I I've never stopped to think about it\nBut as the state of California ... public I don't think that we are we have all if we have our where people were oh [laughter] well said Eric yeah but uh but I think we're within our [noise]\nExcuse me I get a little bit of a cold or within\nOur um [noise] uh uh within that definition here in the state of California we democratically elected congressmen or city councilman legislative members\nAnd and if we do of course a elect our elect tours who in turn choose the president\nOr to that extent our president is not directly chosen by the people but indirectly chosen by the lake doors\nOr get in our Republic of course works blended Lee which is why we were able to avoid being overwhelmed by the by half a dozen cities you know in New York Boston San Francisco LA especially\nA a a Chicago your point is well taken and in a ... and you're you're pretty buddy out there wants to know we are of course it costs ... republic\nWell um I I hear what you're saying I Would just add that the more democratic and I'm not referring to the Democrats\n... out and party here I don't regret it ... ... mark democratic way machine and they\nSpent a lot of kind of work and and the last century said that they can read the army manuals and everything about the real ... nation of these types of government more democratic we seem to get the less tranche parents or our state governments are state governments the same debate\nBecause a bonding father is recognized democracy especially pure democracy at one of the worst forms of government\n... yeah there's no question about ... and I think that the long term trend what what what has happened is that it is it's not so much that we become less transparent but at some point it became possible\nOf four four to ah people devote away the property\nCat and muddy and and ... and the state of of the third guy wears they say go socialism is too will soon as she decided you know what's for dinner\nAnd that's that's what we're dealing with here in a in this the disappearance of constitutional restraints and any idea that there's a fundamental limitation on taxation a fundamental limitation on what government can spin wedded to do\nThat's our problem it is just so much democracy itself but the disappearance of any limits to what a democratic but what can be accomplished through that vote\nI think we've probably are said much the same thing it in a little bit different way but a very ...\n... ah of course but there's a lot of history there anyway I sure is you're discussing this with me I\nAlways enjoy having you out there and be sure to go to Radio Free law she just started that sign up for citizens note if there's anything you like to talk about particular we tried to pick it up some time next we have Dave from Orange County he says California needs as Scott Walker revolution is that\nRight absolutely I wake up it's going well great great or anything like that\nIt's always good out here you have you join a union that David\nI just had a major things come up that way but I'm going to get to that they're all like to ask an ad in the morning I'm up to\nTwo dollars a week could you do two dollars a week\nI Can't allow to dollars ... okay and and you know the reason I keep talking about that is because we were defeated in have been defeated ah I I gave a presentation a week ago and the topic of it was how do we go from Ronald Reagan\nBy January twenty as it was still president January twenty of Nineteen eighty nine do the afternoon to January twenty\nTwo thousand in line with Brock Obama become president how did we go from one place to the other that is a serious question that demands a series answer and I was ... that answer will be found in this we were defeated by revenue model\nBecause no matter what conservatives or Republicans did over on the left side of the equation mostly Democratic Party they funded it\nEvery year with money what has to receive Scott market Scott Walker here in the state is an adequate a revenue model was an organization that can actually get this guy elected you see what I mean\nYes sir and the unions are controlling things in California and um I Want to make a couple of points\nIn a college book on American government I opened it up for it in college the bookstore back around ... five years ago and that which kind of government a year for special interests or by the people\nSo you see like that's what it is and the dry in California and I'm so glad that the Supreme Court ruled against the governor and apply if that was that great progress but we need to go further because\nBecause the unit they're allowed to do it I think candidates have to work like dogs and PACs after work like the independent nature raise money how it how is it fair that age they're allowed to take money from their memories and use it for political purposes completely unfair so I Hope we get some progress on that\nWell there will you know hey hey hey hey you know you know you're jumping off you you swerved\nInto the oncoming lame All right and I wanted to make this point it's not one ... what what government employees are you you are doing is what you're not doing this what we're not doing\nBad settled point we\nFocus on the wrong thing and so uh you know conservatives and Republicans very often run around\nA for example proposition dirty to hear back in two thousand and ten or twelve wanted to restrict a government employee a it was basically campaign finance reform for government employee unions will they lost well that's defense forget that\nCreate your own you begin everybody needs to be kicking in a yeah money no I actually did this ... this is the question we got one minute to go here Dave\nUh so uh do you respond to your question and thank you for your call be sure to cold again let me finish up by saying this does anybody think that ah that the state would look the same\nIf we had five million a of five million conservatives Republicans whatever you want to call them kicking in one hundred dollars a year [noise]\nHey oh I'm fine by\nYeah well here why don't

I'll tell you well she's\nShe's a PHD she's published you know she notes and things are there's ... thinks that stood out to me she kept calling him Brett\nLike they really knew each other right he did this to when he when he brats\nYou guys like know each other that well you're hoping for I don't think so and that ... sort of play it seemed to me but I don't know ... to create operate an inner personally I was I was acting a I don't think she's Meryl Streep I mean it would have been an amazing performance if she was ... yeah but\nBut I mean what does this therapy I mean she may really believe this because of all this came up with a therapy I Can't do that but twenty five years ...\nMentioned ... any any words ... didn't know who it was you didn't say a word for Thirty years a lot happens you have a lot of dreams you have a lot of experience thing happened in ...

V. a success story you're someone who's gone on and a built up a phenomenal personal career\nBut but you have at least in in recent years you have a biography that's been woven in and out with our chief executive of our country now with our president Donald J truck I Want to just kind of start with your assessment of the man and then we can we even into today's political headlines but\n... now where you sit\nHaving spent the time you spent with than around Donald Trump what's your assessment of the man\nWell he's he's amazing he he changed my life for the better and and actually um I went on his show Fifteen Years ago the White House I lied to I've known him for over a decade\nSo I Know this man and in our story is absolutely phenomenal how it all happened but in a nutshell I saw him on The Apprentice wanted to learn from America's business icon you know Donald Trump at the time so I applied to be on the show and went on the show and I learned so much from him\nUm being on you know national television with him for Eighteen leaks did that so much for for my career\nUm but really I learned so much from him that I took all that knowledge and and may presentations and having Donald Trump's out of the great present are kind of just propelled me right out to corporate America you know getting\nHigher to speak about what what I learned and so that was really the beginning of a my experience with them and I was so grateful\nFor what he taught me you know what he taught me in the board room and what he taught me about being a an entrepreneur and what he taught me a just\nReally about you know business and then I got to know them\nAnd I got to see his heart and he when we would have conversations he was so impressed that I was a female entrepreneur or [noise] and then it was so impressed that I was a mother and in a contestant on his show like you know how your competitive and and he liked that and me\nThe other party takes you loose staff there and and it's significant and it's a close relative that you don't even get invited to the New York times Christmas Party yeah you guys are too good I'm not taking Jack's call in San Antonio because it says get these two guys are on TALK show\nAll I gave me jacks numbers the producer yeah could be who knows [noise]\nHave the Democrats so overplay their hand oh gosh yeah look the party the Democratic party's been completely taken over by the not clash and the more extreme it you know what when Maxine Waters who's been backed venture entire life has kind of a mainstream Democrat you know they got serious problems\nAnd the irony is that with all of a sexual misconduct cases most of them are Democrats you got Keith Ellison who still running for attorney general is a mental\nChair Democrat this is why you do when I have some conservative talk about the ... it's all a conspiracy and so uh uh against or conservative and they said it a few victims there but when you look because the Democrats are largely in power with of public broadcasting in public radio and CBS and ABC when it's on their\n... whether it's Charlie would look at the whole Johnny rose right and you probably have Ninety five percent of the other people have lost their jobs or been demoted law are for urban kicked out are liberal Democrats there because they were in power just like Sacramento here in California for those who ... could be the same in your state capital if you have a capital where the Democrats are in control\nThan the sexual harassment by going to be angry Democrats\nWell not only that we lost free hardworking Democrats for those very charges on what is in jail for another reason as well as in ... for the Democrats keep getting up\nAnd you know let me say this is going to surprise a lot of people there are a well I Can't stand Al Franken the personally at us and its politics there he probably shouldn't have left the Senate because he was groping so woman's behind not not saying what he did was right or whatever the ups but but if they want to have that standard find because let's decapitated a whole bunch of Democrats there at that threshold there so\nThat gets to my point and everybody's part what happens to the presumption of innocence will this road they've gone down well not so I just this whole\nProcess you if you had true traditional liberals and civil libertarians over the years here\nIncluding Democrats or what a couple of words that you know there's a reason why we have the actual imitation this evening is even prosecutorial now in in Maryland there and it's from the high school in a at a than a Senator Feinstein was it was a person of of of principle she would have dismissed us things that I Can't do you think something happened in high school and and you know what what do we have nowadays is\nEverything is considered the same level as rape or a you know and and but\nIt's you know you you have a a a workplace where somebody calls but somebody in her hair or whatever and this makes it an unwelcome workplace so we in effect had the effect of trivialize the real serious stuff of rape and all these are putting everything on the same class\nWhat about Senator Feinstein that this is the way she wants to go out at the end of her career at L. are so well remember how she got in in Nineteen Ninety two she was watch along with Barbara Boxer and so called year the one woman there were a boxer defeated\nBruce surfaced in ... and our dear old friend of mine there and Sean mentioned Feinstein was seen as water only by comparison to a colleague Barbara Boxer all your national leaders of the national scene these two people typically boxer was most pernicious are there\nAnd so uh you know Senator Feinstein should be ... ... ... ... retirees you sing I remember as a six year term or are there and so these people just never want to leave a national stage that Sean I wanted to ask both of you will Kevin uh yet be confirmed do we agree\nNow I ... no doubt Ninety eight percent sure uh and and that's been largely depending what called the FBI finds look there's another finding too I welcome the FBI or a asking people questions ... all one big reason most people that are going to be asking her accusers\nAnd if the accusers liked to the FBI Senator Grassley and Lindsey Graham of both said they need to be prosecuted and I think I think for herself was going to be under serious scrutiny when she has a statement in decades makes great inconsistencies I'm that suggests strongly that a U.S federal prosecutor actually ... anybody\nI mean one thing your listeners may not realize when they see the ... century FBI stuck with\nThe way an FBI close works at that level you feel it form I forget the number of cars I filled out\nAnd I suddenly had three hundred dollars you know it but yeah and you felt the form and you lift people suppose I listed Sean steals a friend of mine there which I Would have the bad judgment of doing to me it was they were called valley but then they go to Sean and he says all these nice things about me but then they say well you know anybody else who knows\nA Artie and well I Know Sam and they take then they go to those people and they say some nice things about me\nAnd they say well you know anybody else and they keep going till they finally find somebody who is this something negative I still had six FBI clearances where they've gone through this redundancy there all these levels there and still did come up with something there he's probably ... you can get ...\nYou know I think we've
