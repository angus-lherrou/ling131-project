you do great job with miniscule resources and you are correct thing to that point I mean you were of course lawyers and you have a legal perspective\nBut we can't let the legal dimension of this overshadow the strategic dimension sure preservation of this alliance with Saudi Arabia between Americans indispensable to Israel right\nNow I don't disagree look I think there was an extrajudicial killing here\nMeans it was not authorized by a court of law and action has to be taken but\nI understand believe me that's what I've been saying for the last fifty five minutes that we do not\nWe cannot draw all of our alliances on this uh as if there is not going to be consequences for that happening I think it would be significant consequences you can't approve the behavior and if the crown prince was involved they'll have to be held accountable\nBut this isn't this was an awful situation and I think when you look at it we have to look at it through the geo political lenses again nine dimensional you're west I mean that's what you have to do\nThat to live there you don't ever want to sacrifice you know the strategic interest of the United states which\nHave been you know goes interests have been a part of that region for decades or national security or our intelligence intelligence gathering and order you know to to take a stand against this awful thing that apparently has happened there are multiple options that the United states has to take\nA strong stand about this killing\nWon't even punish the people involved without sacrificing our national security interest I think the president will secretary of state or setting the right tone there knowing the glamour of the crowds on both sides of this ...\nUh and and I applaud him for that because I think they realize more than any one exactly what is at stake and that we have to make a statement but on the other hand we have to protect the vital interests of our own country\nShe's calling from Atlanta Georgia in line to Steve go ahead you're on the air\nAnd yet many personality now and I don't want to get a special like they'll be fine things though my question is this\nTaking them military alliance out of their wage and you know a lot about ... and the airplanes and all that they're taking that\nOut of the equation can you explain it plainly what actions we have a bailout assuming that MBBS has some responsibility\nWell there's individual sanctions under the images the act\nThat can be devastating not allowed to come with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and the heir apparent to the throne but you can't travel in the United states that would be a pretty big one so I think that it's it's a diplomatic response in that sense but again the evidence has to be shown which tablets that but that's I think I think that's where this is the focus of this is going to be found\nYeah and then look again Saudi Arabia needs the United states more than we need them even outside the military brown which is where we focus Jay you not only the Magnitsky Act but forty five billion dollars in trade between the United states and Saudi Arabia access to the U.S banking system without which you really cannot participate in the world economic markets gay so look\nI'm you know I I think the question behind the question is if the determination is that the crown prince cannot be the next leader of Saudi Arabia how would the United states facilitate that\nA look at the United states that uh we're we're not going to a recognized the crown prince or that will fracture our alliance guess what would happen he would not be the next king of Saudi Arabia us has that much in the ass\nLinda on Facebook that's a good question what would the world look like without a strong relationship between the Americans and the Saudis ah this would not be helpful just for our relationship but it would be difficult for the whole relationship uh and the whole region I gave\nYou the history or the United states has had a\nHistory going back with Saudi Arabia since Nineteen thirty three that's when official ties began and it's continued until today so I look at this Colonel Schmitt than say you've got to keep all of that in mind as you talk about whether it's sanctions or individual sanctions or what actually move forward here all of that has to be kept in mind\nYes all of that has to be taken into account and the congressional act allows financial sanctions against you know the people involved in this as well as forbidding answer to the United states you know the thing that that we also don't want to sacrifice and it's just been in the last few years\nThat Saudi Arabia has allied itself with us and our support of Israel yes and in taking a stand against the uh the the Hamas and Hezbollah at all but then I just\nAnd ISIS they are allies and this and so we can't willy nilly sacrifice that relationship but we do have multiple options and I think fans right we have enough influence with
