I mean you just mentioned it but what they're obviously traveling crew rather you know Mexico depending on where they're coming from but it's like what your what your diplomatically and what can we do eat it\nOK well first of all Mexico has not been terrible on this and even President Trump has agreed that the new the new president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\nHas um I agree to some levels of cooperation they want to discourage these people from going through Mexico and the numbers of apparently declined recently have been cut in half\nWhich means that maybe half of these people have uh gone in another direction or split off from the caravan or or finding some places to stay in Mexico\nIt seems to me this was an area where government can cooperate with and work closely with private charities\nAnd they're all kinds of private charities\nThat could take it among themselves to greet these people on the Mexican side of the border before they get into the United states and say hey we're going to help you get back home and when you get back home we're going to help put your feet on the ground and we're going to help work with you I I Know that the charities that we

to help the local law enforcement\nSo that it's not a situation where people are shot in the street all the time\nAnd it's it's much better to invest money in that it seems to me\nThen invest money in the process of simply a letting people into the United states and then processing them and then sending them back and\nTaking some try to dry up the\nAttraction of coming here and the other aspect and and this has to happen with immigration for must his workplace enforcement so that people don't think I can just come in the United states and whether I'm legally accepted or not I'll find work\nWe

therefore I should have access to their\nFinances which is of you may be the law passed but at the end of the day\nThey have to come to the conclusion that there is no rational side of the argument that they often fail to see or understand and I think you know even if you look into it a little further you would simply\nRelate to the point that there's this emotional side of them or for whatever reason they fill it got to solve all the world's product\nOr you know what it is I think it's a lot of it as guilt his in other words people look at themselves and I think look here I Am in America

[noise]\nThere's so many stories like this there's a friend of mine good friend who's actually going on in Israel trip with us coming up named George guilder\nWho is one of the leading intellectuals of our time and a a great writer and a great man and Georgia never knew his dad because when George was a baby his dad was killed in action in in World War two\nOther submarine or the movie stars or our butler and the Oscar winner Gary Oldman Oscar winner for his great role is Winston Churchill\nIn darkest hours the new movie is called hunter killer\nWe will be a revealing that coming up and it's um if you like a film and you do get some of them celebrating or the valor and heroism and and technical achievements of the American military\nThis might be a film that you will want to see uh I Do not know what kind of film they're going to make about Caesar say are who suddenly as one of the most famous people in the country\nHe of course is the fifty six year old a Florida resident\nWho was just arrested earlier today and is being interrogated and being charged with the series of fourteen bomb packages that he dispatched to all kinds of famous liberal folks\nAnd I'd Jeff Sessions the attorney general of the United states announced the arrest or just a couple of hours ago listen\nEmployees to participate in this announcement that a suspect is in the custody of the FBI I Want to remind everyone to defend it in this case as in every case is innocent until proven guilty he's been charged to die\nWith five federal crimes including interstate transportation I'm an explosive\nLegal mailing of explosive threats against former presidents him certain other person's threatening interstate communications and assaulting current and former federal officers for these charges or defend faces up to fifty eight years in prison\nOkay and the the details are just coming in\nOn shaver say occupy this individual who has been arrested who apparently first of all his DNA has been identified his fingerprints had been identified those are two separate but both very compelling bits of evidence tying him to the mailing of these packages and here's part of what\nWe know about him or his criminal record which is very extensive I'll share it with you comes from a Florida department of law enforcement\nAnd the time of his last arrest which was in two thousand Fifteen he was five eleven and two hundred and Fifteen pounds he has brown eyes black hair and a scar on his left arm he was born in New York\nThe records list of Mr Sachs occupation as manager\nIt's not clear what he managed or has ever managed she certainly didn't manage his own affairs very well\nAccording to a a two thousand twelve bankruptcy petition that he filed in Miami\nMr ... ah reside at the time it his mom's home a handwritten note on the petition said lives with mom has no furniture\nAnd this is two thousand twelve so he was fifty at the time\n\nThat some residents of aventura Florida\nReported seeing is very distinctive white van and the photographs of his by white van show that that the windows not the windshield enough to rear windshield but the windows on the side of the van are entirely covered with various bumper stickers and messages\nAnd images of various liberal icons including Van Jones and Michael Moore and Hillary Clinton was crosshairs on them\nAnd he has a another image of uh illegal immigrants as they're supposed to be with crosshairs on them and it says I have a dream liberal melt down a\nIt says are lured here by liberals are millions of illegals are forced to cross the border by fear of a Trump presidency\nThan a ... there's a other indications and pictures of President Trump now I Know it it looks like this is some kind of stunned to try to discourage\nTrump supporters from supporting and because nobody wants to be associated with somebody like this set by the way if there ever though those of you out there who who really think yeah this is my guy I'm I'm Glad to be associated with him uh\nI don't think you even want to call the call it's critical to show but you can one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\n[noise] I think the idea that this was some kind of set up by some level and forces that this guy is not a sincere Trump supporter\nIs bogus it's ridiculous they've gone back to look at his\nEntire Facebook history and his Facebook history going back until two thousand Fifteen\nIs all about Trump and lots and lots of Trump for president he's posted big excerpts of Trump's speech at a rally and he has this van he may have been living in ... in it\nSome residents of aventura reported\nOr seeing a similar white van covered in pro Trump stickers\nOften parked in a lot of local strip mall\nAnd somebody who saw that van who's a documentary film producer and editor\nNamed David ... can set it struck me because of the crazy conspiratorial stickers covering the windows it was unsettling and also it seemed to be occupied in other words on a living there sometimes the door would be a jar or window would be open which indicated to me that maybe someone was living in the event\nPresident Trump has spoken very appropriately he said these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country we must never allow political violence take root in America he was just outside the White House moments ago\nAnd they shouted a question of the president would you yourself pledge Mr President the tone down the rhetoric for the next few days and here's what the president said he said I think I've been tone down if you want to know the truth\nThat is the truth is he has been toned down in the last few days but then he added this he said I could really tone it up because as you know the media has been extremely unfair to me and to the Republican Party\nUm you know can we play because we should for President Trump my a grand daughter's favorite song which is let it go she doesn't really know the lyrics she just knows that and she knows let it\nSnow let it go let it go let it go\nOkay she doesn't sing as she's not to yet but President Trump should get the message of between now and election day\n[noise] I I don't think that winning in these clothes districts that we have to win because otherwise the Democrats are going to take control of the house of representatives\nOr I don't think it helps to continually go after media and to suggest that they are deliberately lying\nAnd now they get stories wrong all the time they show by us all the time but the idea of deliberately making things up and lying\nThe president tweeted a very big part\nOf the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely falls and inaccurate reporting the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news it has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act fast\nThey do try to clean up their act when they get things wrong I Am very very often they will apologize I there was an outrageous story early in the Trump Administration I'm sure many of you remember\nWhere they were reporting in time magazine that the president of the United states had ordered to remove all of a bust of Martin Luther king that never happened it didn't exist and within four hours after posting that story they apologize and took it down\nAnd it's outrageous that they made the mistake in the first place and there's no excuse for it but at least you respond the same way when you move back\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six I actually believe that politically this thing should buy writes benefit the president of the United states I'll tell you what because people\nSaid they were so worried about Trump weakening the FBI people are worried about it they should build backup confidence about the FBI\nAbout the proper functioning of government it is Trump's attorney general is Trump's director of the FBI he appointed both of them who are responsible for this and you did very well with the press conference today\nWhy would the apprehension of this suspect so very quickly and it's coming prosecution not be properly viewed as a triumph of success for this administration one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six we'll be right back\nYou also has a history of financial troubles can't imagine why\nA two bedroom two bath house he owned in\nFort Lauderdale was for closed in two thousand nine three years after he purchased that say are filed for bankruptcy in two thousand twelve now all of this is terribly sad\nIt's it's very very sad but it I think just speech the\nFrankly top Khamenei narrative that this is somehow a democratic stunt and the the best proof to me that it's not a democratic stunt\nWill be the fact that it will have no impact on the polls and will have no impact on the election what will have an impact on the election of President Trump and his administration performing well in protecting us\nAnd identifying this guy and apprehending him and\nNow bringing him to some kind of justice let's go to Matt Mesa, Arizona Matt you're on the man that show\nMichael thanks for having me on your um look hey I I totally understand how it can sound caulk and made it can sound crazy but the way the world is right now it's I think it's a little bit of insulting when we say that things like CNN fake news\nBut they don't operate from a place of 'em just irrationality sometimes when they called people like the Southern Poverty Law Center and and there are ... members for doing a you know where justice work social justice work\nI wait wait I've never I've never heard CNN describe antifa as doing social justice work and try to describe themselves as social justice warriors and that you joke there sucks but I've never heard I've never heard CNN or MSNBC or any major mainstream media source\nSave that ... was good guys\nWell at least the the point that I'm trying to make is they're not out clearly making them out to be the bad guy and the people who are the the voice that they have on their network at least sold them to a higher regard and they're not shutting down and and I totally understand that but\nThat that you look I think what you're saying is true I think there is profound buyers throughout media news at its it's very very biased and they they certainly treat neo Nazis\nA much more harshly or Proud Boys much more harshly isn't they train antifa anti deserves just the same kind of contempt injustice and kind of criticism [noise]\nBut that's different from making things up [noise]\nAnd they are and and to say that people are deliberately fabricating stories is in very different charge we'll be right back on the ... that show\nGot missing teeth or
