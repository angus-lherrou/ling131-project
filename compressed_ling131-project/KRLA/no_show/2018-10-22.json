about how taxes are cut one way Andy how are you sir\nSo fine fair for Europe I Want you're paying you know our president with both being so doing so much good yes of cutting taxes for why he cut both ways but what do you mean cut both ways I heard you mention about cutting taxes both ways\nWill know when I say cutting taxes he is cut tax rates but overall taxes remainder done a very very high levels now ... okay so I ... in other words it this is sometimes\nA characterize as a positive aspect of what a what President Reagan did in the eighties\nAnd what other governors have done with Donald Trump is done which is to lower tax rates which you've had the effect of producing more tax revenue okay so far so good\nBut I don't necessarily see they're generating more taxes for the government is a virtue ended in of itself that government and the amount that his fans must be brought down so I can\nRestore the private sector they get way up in the private sector we don't need all that money go into the government and wouldn't you know Andy\nUh that uh that it at the same time that these revenues have gone up these people live actually spent another seven hundred and eighty billion dollars more than they are coming in\nAnd this is a show called ... this is the so called Republican administrator and\nRight yeah oh my gosh you're so high so the President Trump and certainly doing his part but you and I and ... and Republicans and Democrats believe me there was one of the thing I wanted to say about our previous caller Mike\nAnd uh his lovely friend who happens to be a Democrat we have a lot of Democrats that are coming around you know you say you know they're they're not\nA a you know once you get past the propaganda and you start looking at what's coming our way I mean we've got five thousand more and more people\nOther than the care of it on the way to the United states should do what do you do take your money\nAway praying now than they do not think that they bring nothing to build America right nothing nothing to be that when they come to get the right take they come to destroy its right oh if than than\nIt is a mixed in with them a lot of great America and we can sort out\nAnd we could bring 'em in the legal way and we train them properly and we can a is a a a a simulate the property they made sure that they're on the same wavelength the you know that uh that we are by ... or\nDo you know what what are the best way to like yesterday we got enough we got enough good bad and ugly Americans you\nBut I've also been lavish should my praise and recognition of they're really great work\nThat they've done on the pension situation here over the last couple three years they you know they've been committing random acts of journalism over their head they're really fabulous in one of them was dug by Matt styles that I you know we we need to reach out to some of these people\nAnd try to get them on the show Jonathan because some of these folks are are good honest brokers ... during this wonderful article year\nAnd it it is the lead paragraph as this overtime costs at the Los Angeles county fire department surged thirty six percent in the last five years\nPlacing some firefighters among the highest compensated workers in local government help make that hires compensated uh workers in state government or federal government\nMore than six hundred forty fire department workers last year received at least one hundred thousand dollars in overtime and the two thousand Seventeen Kelvin do year\nBy comparison there were twenty eight such employees at the other county sheriff's department which is twice the number of workers and forty eight and public medical hospital jobs no employee in civilian department said the counter of the county recorded overtime that high\nTwo dozen of those firefighters made in excess of two hundred thousand dollars in overtime they just over time\n[noise] um\nDepartment the boys represent a third of the counties\nIt's also the highest employees which includes surgeons and the ... just and pediatricians who worked in public hospitals\nThese guys to be paid up to it or leave level a few made more than the fire chief\nAnd the county's top executives well I Hope you and I tell you that county executive doesn't deserve to make more that's why we call him Mr managers you you have these guys should or should get on top of it\nUh overtime accounted for about a third of the average fire departments employees' annual pay last year now you go into that uh uh do you do some of the critics there says well somebody's not doing scheduling and the right way\nYou figure that out and he's absolutely\nUh you know these high levels match styles continues\nThese high levels of overtime which is paid to one and a half times the normal rate were driven last year by ... number of major emergencies okay fine but we know we have emergencies there in the emergency a business they should know that but

to our family and brothers or sisters in Christ\nOne part of suffering\nEvery parts for with\nAnd I I just want to say thank you on the half of the person can be Christian families that we walk side by side with over the course of the last few months there's been two hundred plus families\nWho have been cared for in Nigeria and I don't know if you're aware of this but the salon is a militant terrorist group\nUm I mean there were really I cannot they they they just Rome and their terrorizing promoting hate destroying entire villages and stealing the land of Christians who inhabited that land for hundreds of years\nAnd recently in June\nMy newfound friend and brother Dr Joel ...\nChristian solidarity international CSI as has already been on the ground all around the world and and what that may name stands for Christians solidarity international standing up side by side with persecuted brothers or sisters or bars around the world and in Nigeria for Loni have a tactic\nContinue to attack this militant Islamic group\nAnd Christians who boys girls\nYoungest three four five six seven years old watching parents be killed their crime they love Jesus these precious little boys and girls to\nHave what they call ... outlet gutless markings are being hit by a car let's face play that's their word for a machete and they've been shot\nThey've been maimed Christian solidarity international on the ground partnering with the church to provide restored hope and dignity safe refuge food water medical treatment counseling\nToilets simply be able to have the dignity of being able to have\nA toilet to use after their whole village has been ripped apart we have thirty families in critical need now\nTurning twenty five dollars provides a full package of aid which are best gifted eight eight eight to five three three five to to how many families will you care if I were given a phone number again and look at just drawn he invited I'm here to join us and\nWhat a privilege it is to have\nMy fellow brother here and the Dave cave here with me as we discussed to the plight of our brothers or sisters but eight eight eight to five thirty three five to two uh two hundred and twenty five\nDollar gift provides that full package of eight and Andrew you were there in June the side of that massacre I welcome your brother thank you for being here man I'm new to say for him but what did it\nHow did it impact you when you were there standing on us soil that these fellow brothers just of ours were were killed just knowing that crime if they love Jesus that was it what\nYeah well I mean first of all I felt like I was on the ground I mean imagine how many martyrs they're we're in just a four day period there were over two hundred and thirty five martyrs people who died because they love Jesus [laughter]\nSo there was this sense of awe that this this is a this is the new forefront of Christian persecution and\nAt the same time there were so many people to help Franco suicide a project manager in Nigeria and I were there to bring aid to assess the situation um to come back to the United states so surely stories with people that that can offer help\nBut to be honest the there were so many people that needed immediate attention and we were listening to their stories we were taking notes we were assessed me what the needs are [noise]\nAnd it didn't affect me until I left later I didn't realize how much sort of associated trauma would go along with\nJust witnessing that sort of a vent firsthand thrice and um as I as I went away from the situation there was just a lot of emotion\nUm a lot that I had to work through 'em on a personal level just to sort of the thinking about those stories and thinking like I met Ruth for example who has a six year old son and a four year old daughter I have a six year old son and a four year old daughter and the\nThe challenge of so you know relating my life and all the blessings that God given me and the safety that I feel here in this country\nTo someone in a very similar situation with the family but\nBut ... reality day to day their their\nTheir lives are threatened I mean she is prepared to any particular time and the ... a night with her family to hide under the bed when the ... come to attack\nNow we're talking Naomi just now Joel and um yeah the most vulnerable her yeah her husband's legally blind she has eight children and to to know that God had a miracle take place there Naomi life because she was praying\nAnd pleading with the father and he had it in his in his heart say okay well now that Seventeen year old kid take that canister and go elsewhere but yeah the ... the most vulnerable are being attacked him and not\nBack to me as a Christian man it angers me brother it it angers me the the the most helpless mhm are being attacked by cowards\nAnd we're standing up and saying you know what in Jesus' name these Christian Brothers sisters of ours are not forgotten Naomi her blind her blind has been there eight children\nUm\nYou're talking about pastor John to me just a bit ago he had a really ... what we had to he had to had his whole church burned down is that we're telling a Davis\nIs one of the things is just an outrage when the flooding come through there specifically finding the churches or the burning the churches doubt raising the churches out that's according churches and they take over the ... they take over the land and they'll rebuild the from the foundations of the church that will tend to rebuild a mosque\nThat's why we can't let this happen they have to stand up for our brothers and sisters so John pastor John also from the Anglican Church was one of these pastors who was threatened he did a CNN interview some months ago and when the ... found out that he was speaking out against the persecution\nThey targeted him specifically he told his family his wife has kids when you go to the marketplace don't use your last name\nBecause when they find out that we are in the area they're gonna they're gonna find where we are going to kill us so he was living under that type of fear\nAnd they came they destroyed his church and you know a pastor John he's got a great sense of all this with all the spirit and uh they lost their church but they found a a massive ten third media inside that ten now as we're not going to let the full any stop us from any together\nAnd that churches continuing to this day and John continues to speak out at threat of his own life\nOkay threat of his own life threatening his own family's life their church burned down yet for any of us at any one of those things would have a stop us in our track say we're not going to do this we're ... we're not do the same work as his church is now they're meeting in a tent\nThe meeting attack and John is one of our partners helping deliver the eight in the region so he's not just like holding his ground he's ... he's helping others it's just phenomenal\nDon't you know I mean you know this speak to this this is this is we're feeling the tank for for Christians to be able to have the boldness to say\nThis is our ground this is our territory we love going to forgive but we're also going to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ regardless of what happened and we're\nKeeping that handled of that whole nests there are we not\nExactly like in the book of acts believers in prey take away the persecution they said look in the midst of the threats let your serve and speak to your word with great boldness and that's what's happening on church leaders there that there are those that are standing up and say we will not give up we will not give it we will stand in ... kingdom establish\nYour sharing with me too and I know we we told the stories um pass broadcast to in the campaign we had the the the philosophy some Muslims Islamic members are seeing the boldness and they're converting\nThere have been yeah there have been stories there's but I met people that were boldly witnessing to philosophy\nOf Muslims and imagine the youth if you're if you're growing up above the ... the Muslim community and you see your four or five you see this type of these acts of violence taking place but then on the ... on the other side you see acts of love forgiveness\nUm people that are completely vulnerable that are only are responding with acts of kindness back to the philosophy what would you choose as a young person [laughter] you the way of love of the way the hatred that's why this Dave in this campaign that we're we have right now is a way of showing\nThat Christian love is so much more powerful than the hatred of Islamists and this is not just happening I during this is this is a ideological global warfare that we're participating at one level or another\nThat we are standing up what their brothers and sisters and say love will defeat this form of evil\nThe phone number is triple eight to five thirty thirty five to two we're inviting you to invest in this restored I Hope\nI'm Christian solidarity international and the plight of the persecuted Christian Nigerian families\nThe safe refuge and what that means is a roof over their head after these fellow brothers sisters of ours have had their village their churches their their their\nHot burned down completely destroyed their land taken so that refugee means not only to have a roof over their head but dignity to be able to have a a toilet to use I mean that\nGuys this is what we're talking about ladies and gentleman that safe refuge is that the food of course water yes medical treatment so much of a Joel if you're talking about the the children that were in the hospital and continue to be in the hospital recovering from their midst Shadi injuries are\nBeing shot so that medical treatment the counseling their crime why are the shot why are they machetes wire bra their moms and dads are being decapitated by machines because they love Jesus and they are not giving up the Christ\nThis is our investment providing the store at home so what's your best guess now two hundred and twenty five dollar gift provides a full package of eight eight eight eight to five three three five to to Tripoli to five three three five to two\nWhat's your best guess now does she ten families care for at eight eight eight to five three three five to two Joel what do the\n... you talk to 'em you know we we talk to our our uh brothers and sisters they're on the ground I'm a partner Franco what what would\nShow what what do the if if if our family could stand in the same room or look either one of our fellow brothers or sisters who have had the whole world up ended ... loved ones killed what would the Nigerian Christian family what have they said that you would say to our family\nA day but when I was there I was so impressed by the attitude of these ah brothers sisters of ours they weren't coming they weren't begging and they weren't a dream you know going to America and starting to live there they love their lives they love their families and the communities that the established they just want their they want their lives back again\nThey want the dignity reestablished and I think they would say thank you for praying for us thank you for standing with us thank you for giving so that we can and that that we can get back up on our feet during this difficult time third dignified people hardworking people are beautiful people\nAnd um I I Hope of some of you have the privilege of meeting some of them on this side of eternity as well because they're they're precious I enjoy the time with them so much we were other parts of Nigeria where we met at church leaders and enjoy the fellowship\nAnd the type of um [noise] church services they have the music and the dancing in the lively yeah very much so and we have a lot to learn from them because they are um their faith is strong in the midst of these type of trials even so when you\nTalk about pastor John yeah church burned down ... family being threatened and he says I'm not giving up on the name of Jesus and he's meeting his church in a tent yep\nYep and helping bring aid to others I mean it's phenomenal the type of fate that's being you know I'm demonstrated during during this difficult time the phone number\nIs Tripoli to five three three five two to eight eight eight to five three three five to to the need has been painted the urgency I trust you hear time is of the essence we have\nFellow brothers sisters or bars who are in need of medical treatment even now as we were showing a joy showing me pictures of Franco sending pictures of of\nOf Christians who are attacked on our way to poor this morning from ... in the oh\nHorrible atrocity cars being burned with families

years ... he's the enemy to women what can we need to I mean who knows what he did not want to know about what he wants to know that was it ... uh uh we gotta quit it was before and how many times did you vote for Ted Kennedy is\nA ... Chappaquiddick and and fifty Mitch mistresses drunk for forty seven years I mean\nMy my response to um I mean this week it was all\nKanye West shock it was a it was a ... to the dignity of the White House um Bill Clinton yeah no I I don't think he can top the indignity that ... that room a savvy you know I think ... would have asked about that yeah\nTo to go and see the the little room [laughter] you know a little room with ... out the little ones the little room the little room that uh that uh Mr President Bill Clinton or made use of did he went a little room there was a ... at the ... there is a little out of\nA off the oval office that that ought to people who know well our President Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky uh and I think I think from what I've\nRead from what I understand I wrote my deep study a house of cards and Madame secretary in West wing or one door goes to the secretary's office the other ... the cheapest ... so there's a third door and there's a there's a there's a client or that goes out to the walk well now there's a there to get away so there is a little\nGet away that I think ah JFK uh originally made great youth again Kennedy's and Clinton had not reached to the right or when you're when you're vote for Kennedy and so now I I've been watching TV the last couple of days I've got a big flashback\nBig big flash flashbacks all day long big flash back to kind of pre November eight twenty sixteen because I'm seeing a lot of Hillary\nOh I'm going through the channels on the scene like Hillary lived\nShe is out but she's back and ready to party what did she say she is saying that she's got serious issues with this theory of questions about its competent\nYeah\nWell whoever her\nBut the Hillary Bob Hope that the Trump bump has been lasting two years well with a little pick up\nThis week right but we're going to fulfill from boom for the drone economic really point seven four point zero\nThese are what are you know whether you've got to earn ... great numbers friends neighbors or phone lines are open eight six six eight seven zero five seven five to otherwise known as eight six six eight seven zero K. R. LA\nOh and the whole have you been seeing the polling that there was some question about whether or not the the the the Brett Kavanaugh incident would affect a voters and you know it takes a couple of days for the polls to be finished and it takes about a week for them to be processed so they're starting to come out now\nThe Senate races three states have just gone they just oh Tennessee Arizona Nevada just like\nWent Republican yeah they were all closed down it was like there had been nuts some ... eh not so much the house races will say they don't they don't post so much of the house but he [noise] I don't know about the blue wave 'em I don't know\nI think when you go through what we all had to live through with the cabinet ... nation you find people just get more resolved into their positions they just they just set more in their extremes share of\nPeople out there who are not like obsessed with the news to like figure you know the second amendment and reverse its way to like who cares I Want a government that works in as an insane right and then you see you know the cabinet confirmation and like okay\nThat that kind of insane is not good enough [laughter] I'm I I'm going to make an effort to vote against that we can do better than that\nBut on the other side you do get hash tag winning [laughter]\nI mean let's not underestimate ideas winning\nEvery day Trump while you're at a situation where he put his card on the table he played his cards first which was kept at all\nAnd it was me entering its way through a somewhat mildly conditions proceeding and then your Senator Dianne Feinstein [laughter]\nDecided to play for ... decided to go out and actually tell Ira was playing for blood from the top she was she was out with and then it became really not just a procedural issue but a reputational issue\nAnd who won who won the hash tag winning who won whether we like the results or not\nI don't I Can't believe anyone in the country will see Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court and not see this as a win for Trump whether you agree with it or not it wasn't just a win for Trump is when for Trump by way\nOf the Democrats just um\nOh well he did this happen he did this well he lied under oath about his beer drinking oh well his attitude was you know unworthy of judge oh there was just one thing after another they were not going to let it go there we're going to cry or\nUgly river going to try to turn Susan Collins who also is is a traitor to her her up identity politics\nYou can't be a woman vote for Brett Kavanaugh can be a black man now ... you are not allowed\nWe cannot have defections right from our identity groups ... one of the biggest misconceptions you can make in modern Americans is to think that every possible a ideological position or any position on any particular topic\nIs open to you they're not\nThey're not you you don't get to go to the sizzler buffet\nJust salad bar and be able to pick whatever opinions you want if you or other particular background you have a somewhat constrained list of options that you're able to advocate for and I think that sad I think that lets us all down in in some degree\nThat we should be able to have this wider range of debate but you see in these highly emotional situations which I said for the last several weeks and I'll say it\nEither side of the aisle whether you look in the mirror and see Republican or you look in the mirror and see Democrat\n[laughter] not our finest hour both sides of the aisle massively let us down as far as what this country is about and it just goes to show that you're talking about the the Supreme Court the cabinet nominations to Kevin on the images we didn't show on either of our\nDifferent narratives whether you're on the Democratic narrative or the Republican or neither side came out well and that's the thing you give the point\nTo Trump you give the point to team Republicans because they want and that matters they got their boy over the line but neither side came across as being the kind of party that we aspire to and why and you know whose vote nobody ever\nTalks about her and all that the Kennedys that\nBecause he knew who the president was he knows rise to the Senate was wrong with the timing of the midterms what he decided to retire when he decided to retire he created the ticking clock [noise]\nUm when when they said\nWell you don't know but we have a question about his temperament and we're not really sure\nHow well he's going to work out\nFor life baby while she get now\nNow I mean come on come on ... yeah I thought I thought the Supreme Court was supposed to be non political\nThat's what I learned about when I when I was taking this class in ninth grade about like civic institutions in court that was living on that was ninth grade it was also Ninety you waited until\nNinth grade and take that question I don't ... I was I was in a very slow track at my California public settles Brett Kavanaugh had a\nVery judicial temperament for twelve years on the circuit court for DC and and for you know a lot of his confirmation until they accused him of\nGang rape yeah I mean I've got a little upset about that now I I find that issue and and I know it's an imperfect comparison but it's like the older brother\nPinning the younger brother to the floor where you hitting yourself and lights just hitting in like in the war has repeatedly called him a cry baby ... and saying you know you're reacting poorly [laughter] why why why or why this I\nHave concerns about your temperament as you repeatedly slapped him in the face with his arm mistake that you\nKnow it it's like [noise] make sure they're hard as we ship they showed that they were just part of an hack sitting in a black will we weren't\nTrue here and it it's not about lack of judicial temperament and they were really you really should I mean once he's in and you got to work with them for the next you know\nI mean they just want to read ... clearance\nThey they've integrated him in pretty well and and now is a pretty ... says anything ever ever ever I Want to thank you so much Michael from Los Angeles for calling and we've got time for one more caller and let's go to Dave from the great city of Anaheim day for men on how are you\nGuys talk about a big picture and now I Want to clarify this by by point by point and everybody will soon just the the big picture on this one I okay I hear it and you already know about some of it\nOne way or the Democrat legislature is a very dangerous dangerous body of people who are impacting our lives very dangerous manner and and like I Want to preface this by saying what Rush Limbaugh said\nNot too long at all is said the reason why the Democrats are winning in California is because there is no pushback but let me tell you\nOrange County is that rare is the rear of the battle baby and we are going to win this or keep our threat check that out but top forty seven eighty one guy right Governor Brown find it very bad deal\nAnd that shows you how are you confident they are forty seven was written by Democrats it was it was created by Democrats it was it was filed by Democrats and the one on line and both\nWell it's a California yeah it's a long California of course it was hard on when it's directed by Democrats necessarily so\nIt's true uh George got stone a district attorney San Francisco filed it it was ... it was written by the justice to the office of Stanford University and so both are widely acknowledged even get to\nStudy on Deborah it's called the other question I don't know how they talk about it it's August for two or three years but now eight has broken out in San Diego cabinet down there in LA habitat\nI'm Sorry type it in LA because of the homeless and who who\nNow that the Democrats and they haven't spoken out against it because they didn't want the blowback\nAnd so you guys they're dangerous yeah we have is be Thirteen Ninety One which a talk show host this week his guys that shows how incompetent proud and the legislature are asking anyone allowed fourteen year old and Fifteen year old\nIt prevents them at this allows them from being tried\nAs adults no matter what kind of crime they commit rape murder and allow that to be released from prison by age twenty five and normal won before that they stand twenty five to life right flat guys it violates the cost of tuition ... forty fifty seven which we don't like in general but\nTop fifty seven said when a fourteen year old ... year old country for the judge well we don't want to be tried as adults and so we're gonna wait we want to try to adults by ... you know we don't want to be tried as adults but it will be at the jets are just scratching will get killed it passed in August\nAnd the legislature signed it they tested\nIt out it's great that you're going to be released fourteen Fifteen year old a few created committed murder you know you get released judge discretion and said hey you\nKnow and and that's something that I think a lot of the voters in the state of California are not going to react very well sue considering all the other issues that they are considering in these midterm elections only thank you so much day per man Hans\nFor being such a big fan of the show and calling and I never quite understood these things easier and his old you're not\nIf you're an adult you should be an adult and you know so if we want to drop the you know all the rights and responsibilities of being an adult down to twelve\nAnd let's just do that [laughter] I live in you know but if you're if you're an adult when your Thirteen and you're drinking
