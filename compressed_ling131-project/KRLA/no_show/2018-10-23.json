{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "Moment he made those comments did the first thing that came to mind was your book because that was one of the reasons I Know that motivated you to ride it is the actions that we saw the United nations and we did not want our bureaucracy to follow suit but\nYou know it is a hundred and eighty degrees from the foreign policy of the last administration that I think it or that policy was fair to describe it as one of appeasement where now it's a policy of strength it's not metal lean but it's American leadership through strength\nAnd the other thing that struck me I think when the American president took the lectern in many administrations in the past the rest of the world didn't pay that much attention because they didn't think there would be followed through but this president whether it's the Jerusalem embassy or ruin removing the United states from ... or or withdrawing from the Iran deal or or pulling back Palestinian funds\nYeah he has told the world in advance what he will do and then what does he done he's followed through suit to Jordan's point about anticipating the American presidents speech I think more than ever before because those in that chamber know the words that come out of his mouth are going to be followed up by actions\nYeah the tariffs the renegotiate trade deals sanctions I mean uh the targeted sanctions the end of the the the more a widespread say should the upcoming sanctions on Iran to kick it or how we have treated China but at the same time the trade deal we decide with South Korea\nOr that increased a lot of things that was a big surprise was that increased us or auto\nExports in South Korea that was not necessarily something that a lot of experts thought it was on the table even the up and it was more focused on farm and kind of the foods and things like that um and it said also included a doubling of the number of us cars that can go and purr manufacture\nInto the the three of the economy so are there are positives steps that they've taken a a renegotiating trade deals\n... there are the the again approaches that you take a the punishments\nAnd if you see your tariffs on China\nFighting to get China to the table these are real these are happening as we speak it is not a threat\nSo when the president speaks about stuff that he is considering [noise] he has a record now\nOf when he says that acting on [noise]\nSo now everyone knows with these words he uses it for you and you know our our our action items that will be acted on it and then\nWhy don't you saw that with the with the Kim Jong un saving the beginning and from last year than where we are today you saw that with\nIsrael and then moved to the Capitol

then something networks we ... you get a delayed\nBut we think long and hard about what topics they hid and we decided today you know there'll be plenty of time talking about some of the other issues but I thought today was worthwhile to to to really focus on the U.S which I think it was a major speech that the president gave\n... will go with the order now who is called ... who's been old dodge John in Minnesota on line three John welcome to Jay sexual alive how John\n... program\nAnd go ahead with your comment\nI saw I have a choice the says the present and see what you think of it um I've been around a lot of getting old past middle age but I really believe that but anyway\nI'm mentally also which means I'm sixty two so I guess I Lived ... and was like I'm a book about a hundred and four yeah that'd be good okay oh\nI see a lot of presidents color and go though is the quiet and they ... or all these interesting combinations of or that has persisted messed a lot of great writing about Donald Trump I just wanted to ask you what you\nThink of this I built in two years left in two wars dot halfway through as to what he's done so many great things that you got to put him on the list of what other great presidents already so I just want to hear your comment\nThat I Want to play something I think sums it right up I think you're you're absolutely correct but let me play this for your number sixty two\nMoving forward we're only going to give foreign aid to those who respect us and frankly\nAre our friends\nAnd we expect [noise]\nOther countries to pay their fair share [noise]\nFor the cost of their defense\nI think that says it all I think that sums it all up I think that's exactly the right approach and that's exactly another doctrine that the president's laid out here All right yeah back\nTo the phones we go pat in Florida on line to pat welcome to Jay Sekulow live like that [noise]\nThe guys thing to do everything is a great show as always thanks um my question is for say there is still there he is just wandering but I'm just wondering if there's any reaction to that he wanted her to the president's speech show up on the hill go ahead [noise] [noise]\nYeah I think there's going to be some handwringing in some accounts is not just going to be on the left because the president did something that they had been unwilling to do for a number of years\nAnd that is hold these un programs accountable for what is required them under us that you'd look we have long called on Congress to pull funding back from some some of these accounts that are not following statutory authority or the president has taken that into his own hands as he has the authority to do or the J\nCongress should have done it long ago so I suspect\nThere might be silence from some quarters where you would normally expect support but just because they've been sitting on their hands and not doing with the president you know what's\nAlso interesting on this John is that if you look at the commentary that's come out since the speech believe me if there was one line they could have jumped on and taken all the way home and say I can't believe the president said this they would have done it so far I have not seen that\nNo no in fact the media has again they covered the speech but they've shifted back to the other more salacious do they get they can do in that I Do think that's a testament to the speech itself yeah\nBecause uh I get this was a speech primarily to the international audience\nRecovery or few because it does impact the United states obviously but you're talking to the entire world this is not a rally speech or at the debt targeted for the U.S\nA un American voter it's targeted to the world and world leaders more specifically um and very broadly the entire world so I think that they they have nothing to seize on here\nThere's no mobility of serious disagreement and so because of that instead of spending like we've done at a time actually analyzing the speech they're moving on to the media because it's just there's nothing there's nothing to debate heritage of either like this like this\nYou know what do you think it tells us that the reaction so far has been buried tap it I mean I Would say that but I mean they're not usually they're attacking and you don't see it right now\nAbsolutely so I think part of their ... action or lack of reaction is a reflection of the fact that President Trump gave a very principled speech\nRespect our interest that's number one number two fairness in international affairs including a trade is require\nA and number three disrespect of American interests comes with a cost\nThat was a clear an unmistakable message that was delivered by the president there were no missteps and clearly I think the president of ... achieved his objective in offering this speech\nAt the United nations and as Jordan said earlier the president's rhetoric now has more weight why because the president has followed up prior rhetoric with what\nAction and that counts for locked\nWhy this is Greg box for mine that's been answers heard Saturday is at three PM I'll give you the good the bad the ugly about
