the state department deserves a lot of credit in that regard look we've had success with previous administrations inside State Department's on various cases\nBut human rights cases tend to upset the apple courtroom when it comes to issues of priority inside the state department we never encountered that on this case Jordan they were always open to taking this case and find that in fact they took the information from us\nAnd then actually took the lead on it from all the way from the White House the president set the tone and gave a directive down through the vice president you specifically engaged over the course of two secretaries of state down through the state department officials and then back\nOut to a bipartisan members of Congress Jordan I Will tell you this I have never seen a unified voice on a human rights case inside the apparatus in the United states government as I have seen on this what's with a team effort and it does start on that grassroots but this administration

sent me the broadcasts a day and\nA great way to the week on the friday broadcast\nNews like this pastor Andrew Brunson after two years being in prison to then under house arrest in Turkey because of his Christian faith\nAfter a working as a Christian pastor in Turkey for twenty three years I think the issue at all raising his family their three children who are weight or their father as fathers return to the United states um he has been released after this two year a horrible ordeal\nI and I know it's been in the news a lot of today but I always want to make sure people tune in and out of radio broadcasts that they know or the American ... justice represented the Bronx and saying we continue to do so there's a lot worse they're raised to be done\nUm at as we air right now he's not yet left turkey I'm a for somebody you hear the broadcast at different times that may have changed uh but uh but again a he has been freed by the court a and a and these past four returned ankle bracelet being taken off because it was under house arrest\nAnd uh and ultimately I Will return to the United states may uh will likely stopped a it at a military US military base in Germany I'm a which she could be on his way to as early as this evening I'm with his wife\nWe are going to take more your phone calls or what a hundred and sixty four\nThirty one to that one eight hundred sixty four thirty what we've been taking throughout the show so we do have some foe large open for you right now if you want to talk to us on the air if you've got a key questions about this matter a about how helpful the White House has been members of Congress debated fact let me play\nSenator Lindsey Graham ah who is on I just saw a on a TV this morning about a pastor Brunson he's played a key role listen to what he\nDid on behalf of pastor Brunson\nThat's been too long years is it the kill I taught a course to wind up about it directly affected our relationship\nStay improved and this would be a great step forward\nPerson ... first of all over this and satellites and tell us and she is pushing very hard for a long time\nWhen he gets home I'll feel better\nAnd I think again that is that everybody obviously you feel that way too is that you want to alternately see this a hundred percent completed\nAnd that is that to me that's kind of leaving Turkish airspace you're at that military base or whether that's Germany it's a U.S military base I stand these members of Congress like Lindsey Graham said they they played a key role even go so far as uh not just using their contacts to me with\nThe president of turkey but also to go right into the prison to meet with pastor Brunson\nYeah far more than just issued a statement or giving his speech tournament several members of the house and Senate went over to turkey\nOr to visit with the pastor Brunson also to visit with officials I mean you think about senator kill US Senator she he knew\nHow to use their seats in the Senate Armed Services Committee or to raise this issue Jordan's so you know they they injected it into a conversation about defense programs that they cared an awful lot about and we're willing to take a human rights case like pastor Brunson into that debate\nAnd it really did put a leverage into the situation and again I Want to cast it in this lady was not you know leverage that we're looking to push turkey away in fact\nI think Senator Graham said it very well he wants a strong relationship with turkey he wants turkey in the United states to have a positive relationship\nAnd he was very careful and directing communicating to his Turkish colleagues or this this release a pastor Brunson was going to be necessary for that relationship to be as healthy as he would like it to be so again\nA senator Lankford senator tell US Senator Shaheen senator grant and many others Gordon do way more than ... speak out about this they made it a priority for them and they spent hours and hours and hours are working on the case\nUh let me go to pay it was called Oklahoma on line one and I think it's important called the take right now Pam welcome to Jay Sekulow live\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... and I\nWant to thank everybody and I are going to pay that night having salon not gonna stop prey that you tell it literally\nI just you know I think you heard what Senator Graham says they'll feel a whole lot better you continue to pray\nI you know you do you prefer this family even after you back to the United states because of the process how horrible a process this has been on for the family this is tough\nUm it takes a mental toll it takes a physical toll as health has been an issue and that's why he was ultimately allowed\nHouse arrest was because of his health so it takes all the different kinds of physical mental emotional\nAnd psychological tolls or speak to teeter prefer the family obviously you could celebrate what is a tremendous victory and a great moment to see pastor Brunson are in prison because of his Christian faith and ultimately released today in Turkey you take a listen this is\nOn Timothy ... Amy Seventy ... live ... being in the news reports the chaos and confusion around the world often lead me thinking what does it don't mean vans fortunately we're live every Sunday night from ten to Yuma midnight to help you sort of all that out\nOf the world is a funny place will help\nYou see the bigger picture Sunday night ten pm\nCalling and let us know when you were thinking about the world\nWe live in today we're here to show you the bigger picture on AMA sent me an\nIs an object to what you are in exile here from the pet show\nAnd more ... guardians not consider their dogs and cats part of the family rather than just a family but if you really want to understand how they can do what they do to to show Saturday mornings at eleven am I Am eight Seventy the answer\n[noise] morning\nAmerica here to us from inside the beltway praise God Francis has accepted the resignation Donald Wuerl has gone from the city that's good news that is great news for a day to just see the devastation up\nAnd down the panhandle of Florida that you just can't believe until you see the video and courage to go visit ... usa dot org and be generous Jim rubber cutting usa dot org yesterday at eleven o'clock I went to the White House kind of crazy Kanye and Jay Brown where they're at the same time but I was over in the oldie obey I\nSat down with our national security advisor bachelor John Bolton and here's the conversation we had\n... thanks for documents ... so you're glad we went to a use for your entire life for this job and you've arrived with the most disruptive presidents whole Saturn Jackson in the world or to that is collapsing the job ... wouldn't be given all the years that you've studied the ad I say\nWell I think it's a it's a it's a job that really gives you an opportunity to serve the president or who's who's in office and every president has a different style or I think a job at the national security advisor really is to make sure that whatever the style of the president that he gets the information he needs to make decisions\nOr that he has the range of options that he needs and then that those decisions are carried out so that's my job I think it's fine\nThat we've got a disruptive president even a kind of chaotic world because there are a lot of changes that need to be made\nA we're seeing a lot to do bills come do from the Obama administration so it's very fast paced uh but uh I wouldn't trade it for anything else\nLet me ask you about your own job so it's now in the United nations ambassador your recommendation president twofold what kind of personality and should this be a job in the cabinet or should it be sub cabinet\nWell you know on the second one it's really up to the president or he can make any job a cabinet rank a then he'll make his decision or as he sees as best I I did not have cabinet rank uh when I was ... I don't think it affected me in any way either up to the UN or in my dealings within the administration\nI think it's a job where you have to be\nPrepared to get deep into the substance of issues I think it's very important in implementing policy and mostly what you do with the UN is implement policy that you\nUnderstand the significance of the actions you're taking a and it'd be part of a team I I felt very privileged when I was there I help make policy but I have a mostly to carry policy out\nSome national is a good advisors travel a lot so stay close to the oval office what's your travel schedule like looking forward especially between now and they're like\nWell I've spent most of my time in Washington or or traveling with the president when he travels overseas\nOr I have done some travel I've got a trip coming up to Moscow in the Caucasus countries are in about ten days\nReason for that is to continue to carry through on the conversation that President Trump and present pollutant hadn't Helsinki during the summer to talk about\nU.S Russian relations and where we can make progress where we still have issues and disagreement or and then in the caucuses to see the very significant geographical a role that they have dealing with Iran dealing with Russia dealing with turkey\nSo it's selected I work very closely with Jim Madison\nI pump a oh we had breakfast this morning as we do once a week to kick all these issues around and I think that's very important that the national security advisor I think under any presidential style has to be an honest broker and I I work\nHard at that when you sit down with your kind of hurt Russia next week are you going to tell them hands off our election I may say three or four times loudly\nWell every time I've met with the Russians in this job including with President putting himself when I went to Russia to prepare for the Helsinki meeting I made that point as has the president is a message\nWe've there were street well so far we don't see the kind of Russian meddling we did in twenty sixteen Chris Wray the director the FBI said a couple of weeks ago that that could change with the stroke of a key we are very worried about the question of Chinese interference not just in individual elections\nBut more broadly trying to influence the American political discussion with an influence campaign that uh I I think could well be unprecedented we heard vice president Pence speak\nTo this issue or last week it was a very important speech I think people need to read it and consider it a and I think the United states needs to stand up frankly to any foreign government\nThinks it's going to interfere in our politics we are a self governing people\nWe will govern ourselves we don't need international institutions to tell us how to do it and we particularly don't need foreigners\nAre trying to exert undue influence over as\nWell that was issued to the story of the day ... we're trying to influence the response of the Saudi Government or the world at noon or Thursday are you satisfied with what the Saudis have told us about the disappearance of Mr ...\nWell I don't think we've we've known enough or I spoke with the crown prince yesterday along with Jared crushed or a secretary of state Mike Pompeo spoke to the crown prince says well the the president has spoken to this issue or it is something we need to get resolved and uh we need to do it as soon as possible\nIn the aftermath of the Annapolis newsroom shooting some people criticize the president or has the enemy of the people that are in the aftermath of the shocking disappear and some people have said the president is turning a blind guy to violence against journalists\nAre across the world particularly in Russia where do you make a critic for the president trying to tie him to the show as\nWell I think this is ridiculous I mean I think this is a he has spoken out about it uh he's directed a secretary said palm patio\nOr to speak with a ... fiance and that'll happen as soon as they can get that scheduled a we're taking a number of other steps\nOr that I really can't get into at the moment but I think that uh it's just a hypocritical to say that somehow the president's not concerned about these things when manifestly his words in his actions are to the contrary\nA western mass or Saudi Arabia and political structures at best convoluted is it possible to Henry the second situation will get rid of this metal Supreme spiraling out of control or even something more malevolent that someone intended to undermine the crowd at Princeton looking beyond this action\nYou know honestly we just don't know what the facts are and that was one of the points that are that I made to the crown prince or we need to find out what the facts are and we need to get this resolved quickly because if it is a a a a another operation\nA people need to understand that I I think the the Saudis themselves are being damaged\nBecause we don't have the facts out there is obviously been historical animosity between turkey and Saudi Arabia or we have our own difficulties with turkey at the moment with they're keeping pastor Brunson effectively under house arrest for no good reason whatever ah so this is a this is not that anybody's benefit and it needs to\nBe cleared up is it possible that if the operation happen it could have happened without the knowledge of the credit for\nIt I think a lot of things are possible in the middle East I'm at the United states does not have information that is not revealing or if we had information we'd we'd know better exactly how to handle this we've made it clear we want to know what the facts are we are going to continue to do that\nLet me turn from our allies who are animate um the commander the Iranian Revolutionary guard so I'm On a new social media to threaten the White House there are reports that there are sleeper cells in the United states given those sorts of threats and those sorts of reports are American shouldn't we be alarmed about ... reach into the United states\nI think we should be I think the Iranian regime as an enemy of the United states are we just had a within the past ... up the arrest of two Iranian agents in the United states uh scoping out Jewish and Israeli targets for a possible attack\nUh we've seen France and other European countries arresting a agents of the Iranian intelligence service for planning an attack when a rally of dissident Iranians in Paris this summer\nWe've seen ... for example now impose sanctions against Iran because of this behavior so we see Iran or not a conforming to western norms because of the Iran nuclear deal they've not done anything to try to\nModify are concerned about their continued support for terrorism around the world they are accelerating this this regime is a threat that's why the president\nOr the international norms way expected them to comply with they've gained substantial economic strength and on the basis of that economic strength they built military strike I think what the president's doing because of his business background\nOr among other things seems challenging on the economic grounds and if they're put back in the proper place they would be if they weren't allowed to steal our technology or their military capabilities would be substantially reduce out a lot of the tensions we see caused by China would be reduced\nThey have a lot of business partners as they should Google should Facebook we helping the People's Republic of China develop tools of information filtering and basically control when this is a nation that has admitted that a million cars in concentration camps\nYeah I think vice president Pence spoke very eloquently on that point or at his speech at the Hudson Institute last week and I think the biggest applause line he got was when he said that the information technology sector don't cooperate with the Chinese in in this effort I Would say the shareholders of these\nCompanies that portray themselves as the open Internet transparent future\nReally you want to make money off of repression I if I were shareholder

I'm OK I rent cat they're Thirteen and fourteen one of them doesn't eat enough yet I Want to eat too much I Want to hear that ... ... where her cake I guess you'd always cold so she doesn't wear clothes\nShe likes to give Jay okay\nOh yeah he loved it and now learning is a problem though he's a cancer survivor and acting as I said it's our homeland which he might want to talk about where people are going to get into a vaccine sometime\nBut he had his leg amputated a three and a half years ago what she's doing really well but you always been incredibly written and I found him on the burning street opera aunt trying ... paper on the sidewalk so it always starving\nAnd he's on a ridge drinking diet you have a weight problem and now we need to keep them around Fifteen pounds\nAnd he bank for food we eat at my schedule and no matter what we do it how many times a day he started begging to three hours\nHow many times many times neighbors are going to complain how many times a day do you feed him three times a day okay have you tried feeding him more than that four or five times a day\nWell we we have to keep them on a regular schedule and\nYeah but the regular schedule was working there is no there's no physical reason there's no tape for him no physical reason that he's that hung around the time\nOkay but it's very possible for behavioral snap on them you approach it behaviorally when you have a cat or a dog it's been on the streets and has not getting enough food and the starving\nWhen they see food and they feel even a little bit hungry and they know the U.S food around they want it right now right then right there because they have to wait in past for so long to get their food what are we do ... case you know I Would take each feeding that you're doing and if you feed him three times a day I like to see four or five times they but instead of feeding out of one dish\nWould like to fool him a little bit for her a little oh\nWhat we're going to start doing is feeding the cat out of two or three dishes not more food just two or three dishes gets up from one walk to another because they assume if they have more dishes down that they're getting more food even though they're not so that's one of the things I Would recommend that you do is more freedom hating throughout the day\nWith the food into three or four balls I think that's going to make a major difference for you in terms of the cat\nHalloween are crying for food you have to ignore that because if you don't ignore it you're just reinforcing every turn the cat cries if you will yeah\nIf you ultimately react I understand you do if you open to react to catch is gonna\nContinue doing it so I Would back off on that are willing to go into another room close the door turn on the TV but if you start feeding her more frequently at several different dishes you'll start noticing a big difference many the dogs and cats are rescued over the years have very similar problems there always
