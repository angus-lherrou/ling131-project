these pipe bombs that have been sent to politicians are called acts of terror you know there's nothing else to call in London and acts\nOf terror ah the these are there's been a it's a ... reports now that a second suspicious package was sent to a Delaware postal facility or a ... designated for former vice president Joe Biden you have to take that situation take the situation that you have also and I think this is again\nThese are we don't know who's responsible for it but they're trying to send some kind of\nMessage and that message is Tara but it's a violation of state and federal law make no mistake about it and then the United states of America we do not have political discourse by pipe bomb\nThis is not the way we do it you could have vigorous disagreements we should not be screaming at people it restaurants we should not be yelling but we should be doing is exercising our constitutional rights\nIn a in a in in civil discourse and can be listen First Amendment free speech says it can be robust uninhibited that's where the language of the Supreme Court but this is not free speech bigger acts of terror pure and simple\nThat's what it is yes and and and so this needs to be completely condemned as as having no place\nIn America or the American political discourse and I think that the uh this is a blame game that the media is trying to do oh let's be honest there's been a lot of rhetoric on both sides of the aisle here including amongst the media and I think with the president said\nUm everyone together he said everyone at the speech um included him included a politician is the other party but also included some media outlets to say you don't call that down um and then at things should improve and we shouldn't have\nSituations like this now we live in a country where we do have freedom of speech and these are politicians can say they've got that same freedom of speech you know they've got to hope it died at some of the bigger than others and they may say things you don't like they may say things that make your blood boil\nThat's fine in American politics you get to respond and ultimately a we the people as voters or decide who represents us in each of these government positions whether it's\nThe White House whether it's the U.S Senate the Congress state government local government school boards and there's all up to us we vote and there's an election coming up\nVery soon that will impact our Congress and will likely impact a lot of your state government\nUh as well we don't get into all that on the national broadcast like this but a lot of governors races in a state houses state Senate races simply racist all goes on you need to get out there exercising a right to vote Tracy on Facebook said Jordan you mentioned solving at the border solving these with the border what does that look like\nI think that looks like the U.S than having to go through each of these people which is what happened in April so April twenty ... ended up started with about Fifteen hundred that was considered big\nThis what are the smallest estimate is thirty six hundred the largest estimate is over two thousand the un estimate is seven thousand so this is much bigger than will be dealt with in April in April the Fifteen hundred dwindled down to about five hundred when they reach the border\nThose who were were apprehended at the border one hundred and twenty or so a were arrested immediately for illegal entry so they they had no a right to to enter and no good claimed to make a for asylum or another about Ninety percent of that remaining group\nIs in the asylum process now so a few hundred\nAre the asylum process I think this organization likely if they do make it to the border with those down that way too where the people who actually get to the border yeah go through the process may actually have a claim that can be made and by the way that that process takes a long time so that means they got through an initial step\nSo out of five hundred over a hundred were arrested and are about three hundred so got that through the first asylum process step\nBut imagine that tenfold for us to deal with that is something that I Would get we have time to prepare for like President Trump said but we should we should get this\nFixed before we're on the border Texas or the border California\nAll right we're taking your calls at one hundred sixty four thirty one ten other comments are coming in as well a house on Facebook says this is such a tough thing to deal with balancing compassion with keeping our border secure
