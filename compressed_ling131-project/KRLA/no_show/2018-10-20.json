we not many millions or listening each day and all that but\nI think that the fact is is what David just said that you literally had the world praying for you know you felt lonely at times and we do we talked about that I hear on air but the world praying for you um ... made a huge difference in your life and and you release I Believe\nThat they they did and I as I said and I keep thinking again and again\nHow does that make any sense on a human level that so many people were praying for me and I think that God was doing this putting us on people's hearts\nAnd it's because there's a much greater purpose behind this than he is going to use these bears to bring harvest not only in Turkey but in the countries around it so it's a very much a God thing we don't feel worthy of all of this prayer I many I feel very humbled by it\nAnd are not at all but incredibly grateful for it\nLet me go right to the phones John Mark in North Carolina on line three John Mark welcome you're talking to

care\n...\nShe's one of God's Children he was brutally murdered and chopped up and a little bit it's terrible\nAs an American how much am I supposed to twist off about this exact bleed\nIs a question I'm asking maybe you're asking yourself to let's try to cobble some answers together at one eight hundred and five two oh one C. three four when movies coming out this weekend we'll talk about that with sunny but I just I just got to commiserate with my buddy I'm going to be\nSunny I mean I Love to commiserate with you by about what I went to war with this uh with my Gallagher because ... it's the knee jerk reaction of of of the decade\nThere is no such thing as I say there's one time and then then I'll pick it up with funny if necessary there is no such thing\nAs a human being who has seen first man and thinks the American flag was slighted no such thing I'll just leave it at that\nIt is a magnificent film it drips with American achievement I walked out of it as proud to be an American as I've ever been and uh so just if you're sitting there thinking\nYou know global is Hollywood pitiful by the way there's plenty of global is Hollywood pedal illicit if you're looking for ways in which Hollywood dishonor is America you will not have to look far but don't look at a movie 'cause it does not happen is magnificent ... Oscars for director Damien ...\nAnd Ryan Gosling who is no and Claire foie as Mrs Armstrong key is no perfect as Neal\nSaid well you're talking about the the ears of main job even bigger than Ted Cruz ready in ten years ago\nI had a chance to hang with Neil Armstrong I Know how to that apple will this gig is helpful and living in this town is out but we have a wonderful um\n[noise] jewel in the crowd and VFW called the frontiers of flight museum and ten years ago we did a fortieth anniversary of the beginning of the Apollo program 'cause obviously if you do the math that means the fiftieth anniversary is now and you are correct\nAbout that [noise] uh and Apollo seven a crewman won't Cunningham knows a lot of other astronauts and so I'm looking to Neil and buzz and bill Anders from Apollo ... and Alan ... the leader now late Alan Bean walked on the moon Apollo twelve of Fort Worth guy\nAnd I I I Am seat a panel with all these guys I'm pinching myself because believe you me I Am a ... in what takes you\nAnd his feelings about the Cleveland Browns that is me and a manned space flight center which is probably a horribly clumsy analogy but uh but but that that was me I mean I'm sixty right now\nSo in in my pre adolescent years through my adolescent years we're all the Apollo missions I live with them I read them\nAnd uh it it simply must be a God saying it where it through through a set of circumstances that I scarcely deserve that I was able to meet and hang out and speak\nWith these folks and Neil was very unassuming he was very much the American hero very much a big the the uh [noise]\nThe enthusiast for his country but he was also very aware that he was representing him and he was representing humanity and it's the thing that made me probably the most nuts about the whole first name controversy [noise] it's like we had to pick sides it's either an American achievement\nFor a human achievement guys it's both they are not mutually exclusive okay\nEnough about that enough enough enough enough enough [noise] ah what's the best thing that I can share with you about Ted Cruz and a beta or four months and months and months and months you know maybe not so much lately but for many millions of all the stories were pouring out of my state of Texas\nIt's a close race oh Ted Cruz's in trouble who'd Texas is gonna turn purple and the weight of turning blue who there's never been a candidate like may do Ted Cruz is running\nScared every single one of those stories work crap\nJust to use the vernacular by it was ridiculous it is ridiculous this was never a close race on paper now were there a couple of polls that there was one that had a beta with like a one or two point lead well we know the kind of recent history that polling organizations have had no don't wait\nBut in fairness to that industry\nPolls are a snapshot\nOf enthusiasm\nOf the ... that are taken in the blink of an eye\nSo if you go back when was that ... by one or two of the month and a half ago company or something like that the saga September [noise]\nIt is possible that he did a survey with a sample size of acts might have run into a vein of Democrat enthusiasm because let me tell you a Democrat enthusiasm in my state is higher than it has been in a long time now what does that mean what does that mean\nIt means that Ted Cruz is not going to beat beta by sixteen points as he did Paul Sadler six years ago to get to the Senate it's not going to be a sixteen points when\nIn fact it could be made as much as ten points closer\nI Believe that the ... and it's kind of a wide range but hey it's an election who knows these days predicting is a very sketchy game I consider the range of possibilities\nFor the Ted Cruz Beto O'Rourke race when we wake up on November seventh or go to bed really late have been my case on the sex I Believe the range of possibility is Ted Cruz winning by four to Ted Cruz winning by twelve\nTo eight points but hey I bet if if he wins by for that means that Cruz voters were lazy it means that Texas Republicans were complacent it means that we sat on our ... and we thought we got this\nAnd and in that capacity I never want to be part of the problem because I'm here I live here my show is here\nAnd I know and I was I was hanging out with my buddies in the Ted Cruz campaign last night to the Facebook Live with that I it's it's still posted ... we had a good time is about forty minutes or so talking about stuff pulling back the curtain on a few things it's all in the Ted Cruz Facebook page\nAt that as we get down to election day\nIf it's for points or five\nOr God Forbid free or something like that it'll be like beta one and we'll never be rid of these people [laughter] I mean we have Democrats in Texas we just don't let them run the place and uh at at the they'll go gunning for John Cornyn\nIn twenty twenty\nAnd a and we have a very important house race with house rules chairman Pete Sessions and district thirty two which is a

a fan of the show and I appreciate you taking my call thank you what can I Do for you\nOn a good thing for my old shepherd mix and he what he sees dogs out on the street or what he's actually on a walk it goes absolutely berserk\nAnd it's out of character very loving dog people you know the strangers and their dog it's just crazy\nDoes he do this with his guardian as well or just you know the guardian as well\nOkay well in other words here's what happens when a dog is on a six foot leash\nAnd they're being walked when they see another dog or another person with a dog it immediately sets up a challenge for them because they're on a six foot leash and that six foot area now becomes just as important to protect as their house or their yard that white dogs react that way so what happens\nIs when the dog started barking or or sounding aggressive or core lunging of pulling towards another dog our reaction as they are gone and it's the pulling back say no no no bad dog fully what did you do knock it off\nAnd that's not going to accomplish anything because of the dog is already excited and by yelling correcting polling you're actually creating more excitement negative beside excitement on the dogs bark actually causing more of a reaction so what's the best way to do it\nThe best way to resolve this issue and let me tell you over forty thousand animals I've worked with this is probably one of the more common problems that dog guardian fat is when you take the dog out for a walk and the dog is reacting to another dog\nEveryone reacts no no no whatever they do not Warren Warren says don't react\nJust keep walking straight ahead you can save the dog is concerned it's like the cat question I got her earlier what often happens Joe is when we have a dog or a cat that has a certain behavior issue and response in a certain way we tend to react to that or overreacted that with our human tendencies yell scream pull away put bitter stuff on our hands\nIf we don't react to it if we consistently walk passing it's none of your concern and not over or who are correcting the ... what happened is the dog realize you know what the other dog on the other side of the street with that person really presented no threat\nAnd because dogs to the associated memory continuity if they're both on your part and his guardians part you start noticing\nThat that type of behavior will dissipate obviously good basic training is also critical to have some positive way to control the dark but more important than reacting when the dog is showing that type of behavior is not reacting and just keep on moving\nThat's how I promise resolves not going to happen overnight but once it resolved it's we saw for good I promise you ...\nOkay yeah he um he also her sister ... college tied at sister with her and it's it's so out of character 'cause he's a very loving dog\nBut when I was where where where the where was he when he grounded the sister\nOr instead of the couch they were all sitting on the\nGossip about that we're both in his house right I hadn't seen each other for a while right let me ask you a question do you work with tools by any chance\nOf you know that too oh\nOkay well let's let's assume that you did let's say let's assume that you went out to your garage and you had the most expensive chainsaw and the most expensive sores all in the world and all of a sudden someone showed up at your house and started using your toes how would you feel\nLike\nWe exactly but if you met the guy outside you became good friends that you met him on a neutral tone attorney came

do what you want and follow the chapter on that first pet psychology but also remember that when the dog is misbehaving sometimes the worst thing you can do is try to overly correct a dog it creates more the dog is actually getting more attention\nThan he would normally get there for reinforcing that negative behavior phone number eight six six eight Seventy Carol lay a friend Bernie daisy Wilma
