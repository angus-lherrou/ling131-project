{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "Republicans are now engaged in this political ... they recognize the unfairness of the protests that it's gone on with respect to judge Kavanaugh's nomination and hence they can take out their anger on someone\nAnd I think one of the the best things that they could do is to take it out at the ballot box All right let's\nLet's try grandmother call before the break remember our last segment the broadcast that is what we do we take your phone calls we try to answer the question so everybody understands the process where we're

you're on the air\nThank you so much and thanks for every day to day and all that they do but the question of having a having a what is he still working and if he does get confirmed it takes his place\nOkay so I get it sets it automatically someone takes his place it to be another vacancy on the D.C court those are the odds that means that someone else can be nominated I'm there may already be vacancies there and they said so there's constantly nominations moving people retiring\nFrom the circuit courts so it's not just like an automatic there is a lot of of seniority so there may be something that takes a seniority place but it's it's not like they're it's not a vacancy like Supreme Court that somehow the the lower\nCourts work I'm a those nominations\nCan be contentious at times usually moves through a much quicker with much less fanfare has is the nation's attention doesn't usually a focus in on on those not here you sit on the Supreme Court even though most cases Ninety nine percent are settled by they are the final courts in most cases the federal\nSystem we come back we'll take your phone calls at one hundred sixty four thirty one ten it's one eight hundred six a four three one two one zero one eight hundred sixty four\nTo talk to us on the air [noise]\nKavanaugh's nomination\n... that would lead to a successful they vote on his nomination\nBy this week is

[noise]\nWe're here to help you find out why you're stuck on the\nRegular traffic reports needles and they said the answer\n\nHas been received by the U.S went to the White House first because the executive branch agency they didn't have similar to the U.S Senate sitters or going through it just so you're clear a series on both sides the I'll say there's nothing new there that's the best case there for Brett Kavanaugh after I wasn't going to clear him and this is the same\nDoctor for it as a liar these other people are liars but what they have said is it not a single other person will corroborate their their their accounts against their allegations are an accusations against capital\nThat's the best case there by Kevin ... ... where the Democrats go next it's temperament so that's where we are there there's been cloture motion filed that means the first vote\nOr a would occur tomorrow or that is not a final vote or if that is too successful that would open up a ... does it the final floor debate in the U.S Senate and they had a set up a vote for Saturday\nOn bread counts a cabinet that would actually be the confirmation\nVote that would put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court now they're all caught up\nAnd we have a date insight now and then they had very quick very soon has all coming to have very quickly let's go and take your phone calls what we do in the final say one of the broadcast Sarah is calling from Maryland on line three Sarah welcome to Jay secular life\nFrom Fort Bragg am cabinet persevering very porous at backbone and American aid for about ... get the check their country\nAnd their families as well as the morals of our country and he went on believe of interrogation Democrat\nAnd I really feel this is the topic is said to have a pet bowl standing up for our country and it's really making compounds like angry they feel like he had to go through with the Democrats\nWell that is the big points there's this how angry or the America is the American public by what has been done to Brett Kavanaugh and there's an angry enough to a pushback against what may be a blue wave in the house uh even though the house has no role in this but you know it's people vote or\nOn on just a to Z as that is a big question that remains or is it something that is kind of habits\nAnd though for many of us who are very engaged in the process most of our listeners I Would say you would fall that Kay or will not forget this\nOr that that many Americans will move forward\nUm and will this be a deciding factor not\nThat also race we see we have a couple of times if you call right now you may have time to get on the broadcast still one eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten let me go to to Harry Harry ... the the ID here though now is I think we've reached the point I'm\nAs we were just discussing that even those Republicans who have tried\nLike Lindsey Graham to be the types who say people deserve not even just up or down vote but a yes vote if they're qualified even if I disagree with their entire philosophy of looking at the law that has may have changed significantly because Lindsey Graham\nHas decided he's he could start voting no a odd nominees because they're just a philosophy things have really shifted Republicans maybe starting to get it back or they will take time to a lot of these uh somebody's Republicans like Jeff Flake of some of the ones that are the middle are not going to be there\nA next time around others probably will like Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins [noise] I I think you're\nAbsolutely correct recent events suggest that Republicans have to grow a backbone because the failure to do so will do what it will simply encourage the Democrats so you have a democratic Senator Feinstein\nWho sought an FBI investigation with how a be in for information from the accuser for something like two months she is now crying wolf\nShe is responding to the death clean roar of missing corroboration and the basic lead the war that comes from the American people because of her own misconduct she is now saying Dr Ford deserves better\nWell perhaps she's right in one sense a doctor for needs a better senator\nSenator who is on us to the American people and so I think Republicans need to respond to recent events they need to grow a backbone they need to stand up to the misconduct by the Democrats or they should move on with their lives\nLeases color for Texas online for Lisa welcome to Jay sexual alive [noise]\nThank you for taking my question is that the three senators and just basically trying to\nTurn around at the end\nI mean that they're not going to have ... Democrats voted yes I mean I think that that's the point they may have tried to get gifts of favor I think that they were used by those Democrats if he has a better way to look at it I I kind of turn it on his head if they were pressured\nBy people who may have a good personal relationships with ah like Jeff Flake and Chris Coons it'd take this action but they're not ultimately if you're a yes vote on this you're going to ... Democrats are at all on the ... and ... they're going to all you know for the most part the no votes except for a couple\nWhich are which may come over after a break Kavanaugh reaches a fifty one votes\nIt's abundantly clear during that no matter what Senate Republicans do it's not going to satisfy the Democratic caucus inside the United States Senate I Would say this though even within the three Republicans that we've been talking about\nI think there's a difference I mean I think if you look at senator Collins\nStatements from the very beginning frankly uh she has been very sober she's been very deliberate she's been very thorough and she has consistently said she wants to see as much information as possible and today she said\nA very good man I don't know Brett Kavanaugh but I was at dinner last night to honor Mrs Nino Scalia Justice Antonin Scalia\nMaureen McCarthy Scully\nLast by George Mason lost go which is the Antonin Scalia school of law\nAnnounced and raise money\nTo establish reading room name for Justice Scalia's wife Maureen McCarthy school here\nAnd there are gathered there there were three or four Supreme Court justices there were judges there were terrorists that were lawyers I was sitting next to my old boss spread feeling it was credited by judge wedding from the stage [noise] along with attorney general me so I saw and greeted with nominating Nino Scalia\nThere was just a great night\nOf the way that Washington used to function\nJustice prior was there a liberal Democrat Justice Kennedy who is a retired [noise] all the various people who come together men and women all different colors all different judicial philosophies understanding the law's the law\nAnd we talked about Michael ... talked about what a brilliant brilliant jurist Justice Scalia was Neil Gorsuch is pray it but it will take Thirty years for him to come close to Justice Scalia that we need another really interesting Brett Kavanaugh is a brilliant trust\nHe's a judge the judge and everyone knew that until two weeks ago when the slamming began that I think they know it now so it's not fair to the court we shouldn't be denied the brilliant mind that Brett Kavanaugh they would also risk up for for court for four years and beyond\nBecause the polling is pretty definite right now Republicans have served their up everywhere\nThey're crushing Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota I suspect I suspect that the same as happened now were you poll numbers later that are taking mid mid course of the cabinet explosion Joe Donnelly isn't a tie Claire McCaskill's type but they're both going to lose Joe Manchin is going to lose if they turned down\nBrett Kavanaugh or if he votes against the law I think Rick Scott is going to win in Florida and bill Nelson's got all those cars are going to vote against the\nWomen across the United states are activated for judge Kavanaugh and against Democrats [noise] but if for some reason\nWe did not confirming\nThe numbers are dire\nThe Republican Party will collapse\nThere will lose the house they will lose the Senate\nKitten you lose the Senator Chuck Schumer and these extremists there will be no one to fill the Justice Scalia vacancy there will be a four four court for four years and be on\nThe Senate will then switch back and it just they just won't be of at least two and I suspect for years and be on a forum for court\nI think about the impact on the family the impact on future nominees who's going to put forward their their name that's why the McCarthyism that is going to course through the country with\nUnsubstantiated allegations like the Rolling Stone story at the University of Virginia like the Duke lacrosse story we should have understood them as foreshocks\nThere will destroy comedy in the lower courts as they realize there is no five four decision that will review them they will go their own way\nOf course the Republicans will lose the gab all in the house in the Senate\nThat means in the house you I'm Jerry Nablus running the Judiciary Committee\nHe will impeach President Trump said it was the Murkowski will lose the energy committee gravel\nSusan Collins will lose the transportation committee gavel James and often and will lose the defense department gamble Lindsey Graham or will not be the incoming cherub judiciary Chuck Grassley spoke to go to finance the all be in the minority if they do come from Brett Kavanaugh\nSo here's what I Want you to do\nFor things first of all call your senators and especially call and being very polite plays bag Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake to save the court and save the country\nAnd to deter McCarthyism and to protect judge Kavanaugh's family and his daughters\nThe Senate's number two two two to four three one\nTwo on the left to jamming the phones but you can call two two two to four three one two one and ask for the office of Senate Lisa Murkowski or\nSusan Collins for\nJoe mansion\nA Heidi Heitkamp
