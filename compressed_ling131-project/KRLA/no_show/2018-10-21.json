{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "All oh don't worry Zucker Burke said it's not you know we're not listening okay I guess since she said it shut it under oath way that was Jim\nClapper that lied there was a brand and one of them was talking in Congress I remember they had to come back\nMight have been oh wait no no that was clever that lied about that I remember he was in Congress had to come back to your I Need to come back and set the record straight yesterday I lied and uh yes we do listen to a casually Americans conversations\nYeah there was bread and that was lying about Dianne Feinstein computer right yeah that was the CIA saying we were not monitoring computers or the Senate intelligence committee\nAnd in fact they did the CIA was monitoring and bugging the officers\nDo you understand are not supposed to be in the United states doing that stuff either way I mean it just just enough why they're not supposed to be doing that so\nWhen I say you got to take care of yourself and your family folks I'm telling you you got to take care of yourself and your family nobody else\nIs going to they're just not I mean they love you they're good people your friends and family but at the end who's going to watch you and your family I think you have to take care of yourself\nFight I Want to switch gears a little bit here because I think part of the challenge years we've got to look to see what's going to happen\nWhen your family is trying to save\nFor retirement between now and then let's say you're still got a few more years working what are some of the biggest issues that you're going to have\nWell number one that\nWe've talked in the past about making sure you don't sign on her co signed for debt it's serious it isn't just a car or helping your grandchild to get into an apartment or buy a house coast side because they don't have the income of the assets of the history I get it\nBut I think part of what you have to do is look at two or three areas of debt you you know some rules okay maybe that's the right way to look at it\nOn the way the retirement keep in mind rule number one rule number one if you can't write a check and pay it off don't sign for it\nYou might have two hundred and fifty thousand sitting in your your brokerage account that's fine coast side of her twenty thousand dollar car loan for your child grandchild niece and nephew\nAnd if they don't pay it and you go oh my credit's going to go upside down you don't want to but you can and you may have to\nSell twenty thousand of of your stock bond mutual funds whatever it is and it would ease and write that check and paid off that's a good barometer to say our co sign and if all heck breaks loose I Know my exposure is no more than twenty thousand I'm willing to pay it off\nSorry five\nIs what if in this filled up towards retirement I have a choice of a hundred dollars should I take the hundred dollars and use it towards debt or should I build my retirement savings account\nI think you have to make a decision and say where is it going to earn or cost me the most money and it's just a math formula\nThat means all you're going to do is sit down and say\nShould I spend money on on paying down the debt what is what is it costs me per month per year and how much do I get on this side\nIt didn't interest rate right what do I make I save and taxes\nAnd then you just do the math and you say wherever it is going to give me more of a discount that's great now don't forget I always want you to be out of debt at least bad debt in retirement as you're going towards your retirement world stay away from the crummy debt stay away from the times when you're going to be a in a position right\nOf of having to make a monthly payment even though you're not working overtime you can't you're not going to receive a bonus you can't get a second job because by definition of retired\nBut that goes back to my Social Security if you're retired if you're in that position\nFor getting closer to retirement are still working and the the smaller the to Social Security is nine hundred a month Fifteen hundred about whatever the number is you start bringing in\nEach and every month to use that to pay down your debt pap your house pay off your car pay off that student loan that you've co signed for were not happy that\nYou might have to pay it off\nNow you might go to your grandchild and say listen\nSuzie I cosigned for this you did great you graduated in four years I understand you can't find a job as an art history major in twenty century or African art with a Portuguese influence for women between the ages of twenty and sixty\nI I get it but nobody wants to hire you for that that major\nBut didn't exist before five years ago but I understand\nYour two hundred thousand dollars in student loan debt you better start paying back something maybe you can write a check for that but what you want to do is take a look on the other side and say how are you going to pay me back Suzie\nI don't care if it's fifty dollars a month she has to pay back\nBecause there has to be a sense of responsibility we've talked about that morals and ethics\nBeing involved with the the formula right of building your life\nWith natural purpose\nWe'll talk about that again in the future but financial purposes much different than when you're talking about where\nAnd if and how and when you're going to retire\n\nBecause the expenses don't go down they don't go away\nIf you can leave a legacy\nI was I don't want you to talk about leaving a bunch of money we talked about that before we'll get into that in the future that's nice that you want to leave a big chunk of dollars for your children or grandchildren but you realize they couldn't handle the money that they worked for so how much little respect are they going to have for the money that you work for\nHow much less of it any thought respect deference to the dollars that you sacrifice to build your retirement account your savings your investments your rental property whatever it is\nI don't\nThink most people get to the place where they realize that that the money that their parents or grandparents earned has the same value is for them here's a good example recently we had a client and he had heard it about three hundred and fifty thousand dollars a lot of money and it was in a retirement account", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Glendale", "day": "21"}
