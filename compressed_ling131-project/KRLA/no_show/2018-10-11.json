K. L. A. eight Seventy the answer and then he nine point five gay kale I\n\nGuess every one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten hour being joined on the phone by a very good friend of ours\nIsraeli ambassador to the United nations Danny ... talking about we're talking about bragging about Nikki Haley's role at the un I'll brag about daddy knows role as well what a fantastic job he's done and you continue to do a ... for the state of Israel um embroiled freedom loving people but again I Want to get your reaction to up\nNikki Haley's announcement that she's going to be leaving at the end of the year I Know she's been a very good friend of yours and\nA very good friend of Israel\nA couple of land back to the early ... or ... or ... or ... if you're a lot of weight with other fake ... so that will accompany which I have the experience and they I think we were all the way that you can go to court here dropped the ball\nOr President Trump or they knew him back to do it we're going to be on the opposite of what we do that by put away your what are the only about protecting either the security ... like ... or the ... about passing shows going on I mean come on in the general assembly\nPutting out your window I comical all over the weight and according to within that ambassador would step in\nThe you mentioned something ambassador I think it's important for people understand that says you know what it's like being the only person in the room and so does she want to explain that a little bit for audience\n\nDid we lose the ambassador\nI think we have All right so one of the things he did say was that this idea of alone in a room and you know this was your world kind of the nation and get\nYou there in the U.S really unwilling to take a stand uh to speak\nClearly for Israel I mean yeah they were reluctantly do it and honestly the Obama administration's we send those final days was going to be very a dangerous and they were they allowed those resolutions to move forward Israel was Standing Alone at the un and the Obama administration's final day\nThat you did we talked about Harry this shift that took place between the the way it was in the way it is now um this was a major shift that it really in a cabinet in record time when you think about it\nYes it happened very quickly and very expeditiously or an inch of proves one thing that Nikki Haley will indeed be a tough act to follow\nUm she was a leader in withdrawing a U.S funding from UN agencies that were indeed corrupt\nAh we also with drew for for instance from the un human rights Council on her watch and so we must continue to push such agencies to either change or they're too or alternatively collapse from a lack of funds\nAmbassador let me ask you this ... ... when you think of the legacy of Nikki Haley as a U.S ambassador bass or the United nations what do you think was the most significant or there but you were going to go through a couple of what do you think the most significant achievements were [noise]\nWhat I think we signed up for just sitting there Dave at all when you look at the fence against North Korea or the way that you\nNever lose or losing revel a technical problem I'm getting ambassador noted but now the UN didn't North Korea was another when we talk about the middle east but the north Korea was another one yeah I mean\nAgain a very key very see that there that are ... even the best or from Israel's the always talking about how real is three who said it wasn't just about Israel um and obviously there's your seat which he represents\nBut what the US was doing it on the on on other issues as well\nVery significant ... we played it before they get since we had trouble ah getting an investor lived with his he's moving around us response but he had this to say about Nikki Haley set aside the record take a listen\nPresident you got that then you will to be clean up after the standing on the U.S in a different place\nPeople respect the U.S today in the UN because a lot of the early ... to ... stand firmly even when he won that she was in that may know with the even when the votes she was afraid and I think too that you had that respect for many counties duty counsel in the general assembly\nAnd that the important because if you want to be relevant when people don't respect you at the un and the international community and today I mean more respect so that by the end of the United states so that when the station and they make a stronger today\nSo thin looking at let's look ahead here because you have to look ahead I mean you know ... will stay for basically ten more weeks\nAnd then work and in that time period we're going to have a new nominee I expect there's going to be a fight no matter who it is a because they're going to be supporting the president's position and there's forty eight senators that won't yeah the the president\nIs taking a very aggressive position in foreign policy was needed Jamie we needed a dramatic shift in foreign policy specifically at the United nations and look at is going to generate a lot of opposition inside the United States Senate and it will be a fight I suspect it's a fight\nThat President Trump in the new nominee will win but I Do think it will be a fight and J I I think it was so important that ambassador to known mention North Korea 'cause he's the Israeli ambassador and yet he sees that\nAs one of the main agenda items and I also love the fact that he references sometimes the new ambassadors going to have to be the only voice in the room would tell you a couple of things first of all sometimes that's absolutely literally I mean it takes a single detail on the Security Council you've got to be willing to stand alone and\nThen sometimes while it might not be the only voice the new ambassadors going to have to be prepared when mass countries a stand up and walked out there they had man Steve proper ... they do the next in Bastrop has to be willing to stand for him and that type of situation\nWell she had a certain boldness Harry that I'm a ... and I would say grab a toss\nUp when we were with her and and and watch you are an action I mean I met her both on a large sitting at the U.N General assembly we're both made an address uh but I've also been ... you know at the at the White House from time to time I've seen her and uh she just has a tremendous residence\nAbsolutely and so I Would add she also was a clear and direct speaker you knew where the United states stood on a particular issue when Nikki Haley spoke\nHorrible event get out I don't care for the traffic is bad get out you got twelve hours sitting on the road take some water and get going and or do not\nYou're not hang around because there's
