{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "But the key question is how will their tactics play out in so called fly over a country in my view is that the approach taken by democratic leaders will indeed backfire\nAnd likely backfire big time or at least if we look at current polling results\nI think there is a pre Kavanaugh house race calculus they post Kevin ... house race calculus\nYes it was so politically charged regardless of what side of the issue you are it was galvanizing\nAnd so it's just everything up nothing politically was the same\nWhen they had the second hearing these accusations if he would've just gone through a which will look likely that either on judicial philosophy kind of normal hearings yes most Democrats would have voted no but probably a few more would have voted yes um I don't think it would have changed the political calculus so much in fact that the\nPeople like Claire McCaskill who voted yes it may be tougher\nTo to to to further Republican or how they took to win\nBut instead I'm instead you had the second round of of of series of all this uncorroborated junk we can now say after the FBI second report\nUncorroborated junk Alex ... serious criminal allegations against Brett Kavanaugh and everything has changed now so every political calculation must change\nOnce you look at once you have a moment like this in history twenty nine days that we're ... we're talking to you now twenty nine days before the election that was all happening within about a month of the election then what do you think\nThe other reason midterms are historically good for the party that is out of power is because of an enthusiasm gap it's hard to motivate voters who their parties in power to get out to the polls\nAre J I think what we just saw was about the best infusion of enthusiasm to a party that already has power that you could possibly get so how will play out I don't know but I'll tell you this is a Republican majority in the house is far more likely today than it was a month ago I think you're right\nWe're taking your calls coming into the last thing that one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to an eight hundred six eight ... three one one year remember tomorrow special programming on the case\nOf a sea of baby big developments there we'll talk about that a little bit after the break but we'll get into it tomorrow [noise]\nStuck in traffic we looked like in seal beach there's a stalled cars on the bull by itself abort seventh street it's in the right leg\nAnd in the city of history stalled car redlines luck there as well sixty west ... and then the crash in downtown LA once and passed in ... south third street let planes lock yourself from above Sunset Boulevard Ahmed McKay AM eight Seventy the answer [noise]\nDid you know that there are safe and secure ways to have a steady income for all the years have your retirement Hi this is David Ortiz from David Ortiz advisors I talked to a gentleman the other day and his question was I Need to make at least forty five hundred dollars a month\nAnd he goes I have about seven hundred thousand dollars I think I can do that but I'm not sure so what's the numbers it turned out that he had a pension and the Social Security check that was going to be coming in\nAnd he was going to be able to get fifty four hundred dollars on just those two things he wouldn't need any money from his portfolio until his wife retired and she wasn't planning on returning for a couple more years after that\nSo in his case it was very realistic so what's your situation comedy at\nAge four four five eight four plan that's eight for four five eight four plan plan smarter live better hate for four five eight four plan that's eight for four five eight four plan I'm David Ortiz and I work for you\nYou have a choice you already know the top conservative talk shows are right here on a um a seven easy answer for music with a spiritual emphasis move\nIs any five point nine eight seven and\nThen he went to the fish\n[noise]\nHad a great question gave me my Facebook from Johnson saying do the Democratic party to cross was around the ...\nThe consensus that we've had here in our studio was yes because you've got this um when I called mainstream democratic thought the scent more centrist and then you have this progressive to the right to the left to Bernie Sanders almost a approach going up and how to you you're up there what do you what are you saying\nWell the only thing I Would add to the conversation James I think there's a struggle even inside the elected members of the party and I mean Jordan talked about how Nancy Pelosi would be the new speaker likely if the Democrats retain power I mean\nThat's actually an open question because if they're going to get a majority Jay it's going to have to involve Democrats who actually campaigning opposed to Nancy Pelosi both from the left in the right so I think there's kind of two questions for House Democrats one can we get the majority back into\nWho can unite around they can get two hundred and Eighteen votes on the floor of the house\nOr to be the speaker of the house so I think there is a a really are there are a lot of fractions inside the party right now are left I Would say less center and then far far left and they're having their own fight on it\nAbsolutely All right let's go right back to the phones yeah Linda calling from Georgia on line for Linda welcome to chase you'll live Linda go ahead\nThank you for taking my call it or I was listening and I just you know I Am a independent conservative you grew up as\nAn African American badly Democrat you know we knew what our parents Dale and half of the two thousand election I came out of the parties I think uh this they said I'm senator Collins gay\nI think it'll galvanize ... and I gave that extra pet for people to get out to vote 'em\nYou know I mean talking to different people I just feel that um\n[noise] you know people are tired of what they're saying we you know I'm a mom with three adopt the kids out of this as well and I want to say good things happen sure and I'm not a spring chicken steak way than grand kids\nWant to say good things happen for our children and what I see or hear happening is at one time that we wake up we had bigger fish to fry\nAnd I vote if the President Trump\nBecause I think the energy that he brings this is what we need to move America forward I'm just wondering what you think about the party with this that we've seen going on\nWhile I think what you said is ... what part of Georgia you live at\nI'm In ... ... ... you know no harm\nSo look I mean I I think your your what you said eloquently is the kind of where things are\nI think that the American people you could take a much broader than Georgia the American people are looking at how does this impact my children and grandchildren\nAnd you've got a situation now you look at the stability global stability which you have global civility right now in a way we haven't seen in ... in a decade or you have a sense of momentum I think on in the economy a low on employment\nThan even though the historically that it's still tells you that there's a switch in the in the house leadership or in midterms there's this this this presidency has not gone by the norms\nYeah I mean that that their historical data is political data I mean it's a data this is the heads of difficult for a political party that is in power to get the enthusiasm gap up but J\nUh the the economic data and the other sort of facts to base data really all is flowing in the direction of the GOP right now so you know it's going to be a fascinating political study to see which of those two carries\nA because if you took just the one who would say the Democrats are going to win if you take just the other would say the Republicans are going to I think both are going to be very close but I'll be honest with you if I was going to be one party or the other heading into these midterms there's no question I'd rather be the Republican Party you think the momentum shift as men that significant\nAbsolutely and I don't think that I don't think the Democrats ever really had a real path in the Senate it was only in the house and they saw that passed in the house narrowed significantly over the last month\nDrew reserves in college not usually a conservative hero\nAnd who she spoke to yesterday conservatives were very excited about what she did appreciate what she did for judge Kavanaugh in that speech her remarks\nBut I think it was broader than that so conservatives appreciate what she did even though they don't always agree with her a politically it does show the big tent Republican Party but independence and more moderate Republicans who may not have been as enthusiastic about getting out to vote this election cycle and never are in mid term election cycles\nI think that's where she was speaking to Susan Collins if you could start as we said uniting the party that way with twenty nine days out well who cares about what happened fifty sixty days out\nWe don't care about what's happening now you know what what is it in the president that's what affects the term elections not how they were doing Democrats two months ago or even three weeks ago when we were on the show talking about how now the ... it might be a play\nUnless they change again yeah three weeks no doubt that there's not going to be probably political of it as big as the Supreme Court confirmation though\nIn the next day or not I mean the next twenty days\nOh darn it looks like a let's take another call yeah this is an easy one to answer from Larry and then Indiana on line one Larry welcome to Jay ...\n\nAre all getting past so I don't know what I asked all the stuff with this stuff out permission but what do you see it as far as as oh let's say that he was\nThere'll be there'll be a nomination put forward by the president and they will go through the process within the same thing in a house buy technically there may be other vacancies ... I don't feel pretty quickly MDC yeah uh but yeah it opens up one of these don't get as much attention usually sometimes there's some fighting in the Senate\nOnly Nineteen Ninety five to a hundred per cent drug free and the majority of people order it going to or the more let's see if we can get you out to pay to go to release factor dot com\n[noise] am HMO ... everywhere on the air is so I Am somebody on your fan made some of the march on the advantage of modern technology now on Amazon and Google have speakers just ask for I Am a Seventy the answers are you listening\nMorning\nAmerica or high handed age on this October hey twenty came on Monday one weekend late last I spoke with you on friday [noise] thirty nine color all of them first time caller is all of them are women all of them supporting\nBrett Kavanaugh had ... decisively entered a long weekend to their private culture about virtues and Collins magnificent speech at three o'clock to the final vote on Saturday and Sunday shows Brett Kavanaugh dominated\nAnd his confirmation justice cabinet are is great news and we spend a lot of time talking about that with our guests today and whether you what eight hundred and five two oh\nOne two three four from the relief factor dot com studios I Am prepared to spend all day talking about cabinet are necessary but I've got to tell you the news person takes a lot of breaking news putting a horrific story out of New York I mean her Rafik limousine accident here Cooperstown New York\nOr took twenty lives almost didn't like\nIt devastated families sibling left a lot of young kids without parents the victim of our friends and relatives including\nAn awful four sisters from one family two brothers from another family they were all traveling to a brewery in Cooperstown to celebrate at thirtieth birthday\nTo the names will emerge but he can say a prayer for all of these families because a limo crashed into her being took out to protest friends as well\nUm it's a dangerous intersection ... all Eighteen people including the driver inside the limo\nAnd two people outside of it were killed\nAnd uh they said a couple of ... customers at the apple barrel country store were also hit\n... driver was probably doing sixty miles an hour when he lost control of the really whenever you get a limo and you think well I got a limo driver I say and they were doing the responsible thing that we're there we're celebrating thirtieth birthday [noise] brothers killed in a crash ... rich thing burg\nAnd many many children it's just a terrible story from turkey comes the story of ... who has disappeared in his beard dad turkey has said the Saudi Arabian government ordered his assassination this measurement inside the Saudi ... in Turkey it's going to be an international story for weeks\nHard to believe NBS the new Saudi crown prince would do something [noise] that still advised shaggy well regarded in Washington DC I ... yes but it would be a\nBig human and ill advised\nWe'll wait and see China has arrested they had to Interpol is the first time China ever got one of its own from the PR see the lead an international aid in the end up all the international police able the hunger we\nWent back to China and was arrested as part of the\nPresident in ... crackdown\nPeople are worried about that however the good news ... try to as we speak having stopped and South Korea after going to North Korea after being trip in Japan and the secretary Pompeo reported good meeting with Kim Jong on Sunday\nThe most important development quote both the leaders believe there's real progress that can be made substantial progress at their next summit\nUs and North Korea will be having more frequent and higher level of working group discussions than we've had in some time the state department said Mr is Pompeo and Kim Jong un agreed Sunday to instruct working level team from each country to meet soon to intensify discussion to resolve remaining issues from the ... summit\nAnd uh the inspections will occur as soon as we get it would just take we worked out [noise]\nWe will wait and see the wall Street Journal news ah that surging yields raise the threat of a tipping point for stock I'll cover the market reporting the second or third our but they are the ten years that\nAnd that gives me through what two three and that's when people start taking money out of stocks and put it into bonds and then get three percent\nBut we'll wait and see in Brazil the right wing or almost one right out and uh he's going to have a\nRunoff on October the twenty eighth Mr ...
