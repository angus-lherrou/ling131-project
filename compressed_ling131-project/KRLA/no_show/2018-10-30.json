are already voting are preparing to vote this midterm elections are officially eight days away that count down the river back interview fifty days away sixty something there's ways just eight days away down\nThere was a lot of because of what's happened uh the the the uncertainties around that that those are those devices that were being sent last week and that personal to really be captured thankfully in that situation no and getting injured but then that horrendous attack Saturday in Pittsburgh there's not been as much focus really the last ten days\nOn what's going on in the mid term elections sometimes with the president is that a rally there's been a renewed focus and then the news goes back to uh what else is happening but that we're only eight days out now so I Want to get

feel justified and if this is how you get into these issues that are affected is why I appreciate these phone calls\nWas affecting races that we may not all these secrets just national issues but remember where the ... tax cuts were coming through there was this idea of the blue states where the ... you had much heavier property taxes\nAnd you were able to ... you write that off you're no

talked about how this will impact specifically there's New York congressional races\nAnd I looked at it just real real clear politics of the toss ups just in New York New Jersey and I I'm counting up there for their uh right down to the top category that's that are critical to\nHow the house of representatives ultimately whether it remains Republican or not um and then if you look at leading one way or the other or you could add another ah three are actually the other five\nSeats in New York and New Jersey that are up just in the house of representatives so I Do believe it's important that we
