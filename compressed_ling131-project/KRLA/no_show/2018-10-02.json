{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "Jeff Flake was able to be in control this is a senator who's not even not even running for reelection retiring and he's a he's going out and making this\nAfter he made a statement saying it was a nomination he gets frustrated by the Democrats that's why I don't trust anyone in the situation right now I'm the longer it goes on I think the tougher gifts and less this FBI report just goes back and makes them look foolish but now what we're going to see for them is that wasn't enough\nTo really look into enough so it don't matter would be another project like ... it should it should be but it less he's he has to sit there for ten more hours and have people yelling at his face I'm someone who has no political\nA bone to enter this he's done he's retired so I'm he decided to put himself out there this role which is kind of weird for someone retiring but he also I think a a has faces on slot for Democrats I mean you're headed what if it comes to withdrawing the nomination or to be defeated\nWhat happens in well the president would ... the way it would work is exactly what everybody said Mitch McConnell\nWould make a call the president saying I don't have the votes and that does not appear to be the case right now who say I don't have the votes at that point normally would withdraw the nomination\nOr they could make a go forward on political grounds but if it's enough that they couldn't get the Republicans are I don't think they would and then he president makes and listen to another constitutionally makes another nomination if they will then have another role of advice and consent you'll have been an eighth justice Supreme Court term for a while\nTo never great but that's just the just the nature of what it is we're going to the last segment of broadcast we've got a couple of lines coming open here and there give us a call at one eight hundred sixty four thirty went to an even if you get a ... keep prying back\nWe'll try to get to calls on we've opened up a couple of lines for you at one eight hundred six eight for three one one zero went through some questions on Facebook will get some new ones in the\nIn the hopper here some of them were were back on we're also going to get some information on the time when we come back in ...\nStuck in traffic we very quiet this time around they don't have any cracks installed parts or trucks to tell you about a no slowing anywhere that I can see at least things along pretty well so if it goes highway the nice ride right now so it was the one I think\nUh the one that ... through the ballet and heading into Hollywood is a nice ride no problems on the to attend\nThe to a Fifteen that's look at night and so is the one standing in the seventh and Ahmed McKay I Am a Seventy the answer or\nThey love the heat and they love the dry we've got hot and we've got lots and lots of those twenty four seven wouldn't munching termites stop all that destruction in its tracks\nMake that easy call the Dewey pest control I've known the family for over Twenty years I'm Talking integrity and dependability yet they're free inspection now cause doing knock them down and keeps them I Know sweet smelling perfume treatments here just affective and time proven local or whole house treatments only\nStill got answer these fleas cockroaches or those disgusting disease carrying rodents yet eighty nine dollars off with a regular maintenance program\nHurry offer ends and just days called eight hundred two oh nine ... nine hundred right now that's eight hundred two oh nine o nine hundred get them out now and I mean right now called eight hundred two oh nine o nine hundred or to get your free inspection just Google do we radio dot com\nThat's doing D. E. W. E. why do we radio dot com\nWe're here to help you find out why you're stuck on the\nRegular traffic reports for years and he noticed a a Mason is the answer\n[noise]\nAlright where's the last segment of broadcast for taking your calls at one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one tent we will take the calls in the order that they've come in let's go ahead and take one next yeah Matt calling from California on line one Matt welcome to Jay Sekulow alive I met\nAt night so I had a comment and that is not something I've seen the Republicans really organized well around but I\nActually think that a genius but by the Republicans I'm you know flake aside not running for reelection and everything like that but the thing the Dems are screaming for it that all that friday here and what they wanted an FBI investigation and they did it really kind of quick at the end flight cutting came up\nGrassley said OK and flake said I'll take a week or maybe less and that's what\nAnd you're hurting Democrats or Democrat it we thought that spoke say this is exactly what we want yeah throughout the FBI thing and then they closed the hearing and I moved out and and now it's going to go to a boat and we all know that no one's going to change their mind regardless back because you it's so hard to prove a negative so this is the one thing you are going to do is you're going to get all\nThe that cloud that would have been over\nA cabinet if he got in front of me like the Republicans just push it through they didn't care it's like\nWell they did it they let the FBI and they came\nIn and say that well not off that the problem here is they're going to say that's not enough Mary and parents go right was flight more free to make these moves since he isn't running for Senate again answer yes\nHere to answer to the Republican primary or a base in the end he was going to lose the primary that's why he's retiring let's be honest it's kind of was gone and he was going to be primary it out of the U.S Senate or so he decided to retire instead of a face that loss um show I I Do believe listen I I agree with Michael to an extent I think that the American people\nWhich can certainly influence or how the skills I mean these are elected officials either politicians that's that's the point the American people may agree if this report comes back super clean that the Democrats look foolish\nIf ... if they're going to keep complaining so it may be enough\nFor the American people that's what we've said if this report because back clean Democrats lose likely rent probably look foolish if they continue to pound their their fist uh it's not enough of an FBI investigation of the seventh this this evidence now\nThat Brett Kavanaugh has gone through a they've got specific names to go for they've got specific individuals to look to time periods to look at um especially those that this allegation Abigail or they know when it was where it was supposed to have occurred who is alleging and ah and then who would have been in the building I mean they could have gone they could go through so\nUh if there's nothing there\nMay be the the American people say enough you know this and I think that's the best case for for Brett Kavanaugh and for Republicans to get their majority together All right let's go ahead and take calls one eight hundred sixty four thirty one tent who's next Jodie in Kansas online for Joni welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nI generally all yep\nWhere in the eye and then they go in and yeah there is not more evidence or the evidence will there be only recourse to Dr Ford\nNo here's what I think it's going to happen I think they're going to say they're not going to call Dr Ford Andy a liar or that she said there was no evidence cooperating Dr Ford's allegations that's all they're going to say\nThat's right if you look at the report that this is Rachel ... who was\nHired by the Republicans did the case she says is incredibly difficult to prove is even weaker because she identified\nA other witnesses to the event and they either refuted or allegations or didn't corroborate them a reasonable prosecutor would not bring she said this is Mitchell says it is a reasonable prosecutor would not bring this case\nUh to trial based on the evidence before the committee and she said that you couldn't even get a preponderance of the evidence standard which is the civil standard much less beyond a reasonable doubt\nSo and I tend to agree with her she was not the most uh you know colorful prosecutor or exuberant prosecutor I've ever seen\nThose it probably was set up it was not goes cracked\nUp and broken up into in statements made but but I understand what she's saying\nAll right let's take another call you have a large from Texas on line three law welcome to Jay Sekulow live by law\nThank you thank you very much a guy from God and I really appreciate you think real quick payment and fat I think what we saw some cabinet of anger with a little bit more than what everybody saying\nI Believe that he felt the weight of the whole ... oh yeah he knew that what's going on now to not just him tell from not just you know good and bad he said she said that the weight of the whole system\nWill look this is his career I mean this man that was a he said sign thought those two things that he said that we're meaningful and pointed to me said listen to things that he loves doing coaching and teaching and based on these allegations you wouldn't be doing either in that area is a pretty strong statement for someone that's pretty sterling reputation for the last twenty five years\nAbsolutely so judge Kavanaugh has been the subject of a sustained and relentless attack\nFor months it's important to realize that Senator Feinstein withheld this allegation this accusation four months before bringing it forward just for the nomination was going to be voted on\n... and yet there is no credible evidence at least to this point in support of the specific allegation made at the hearing last week\nA and as I understand it there's no support for the allegation made with respect to the nominees alleged conduct at Yale\nBees well that's what they are investigating absolutely but it's also important to remember that however the FBI investigation comes out\nA particularly if the nominee is cleared this will not be enough for the Democrats no see cause they're afraid of\n... a judge Kavanaugh's judicial philosophy which does not accord with their preferences there particularly afraid that he might limit for instance access to abortion in the future\nA modern American politics will the new McCarthyism work will Sanders and the seat analyzed directed at judge Brett Kavanaugh succeed for well enough decent men and women in the United States Senate step up and say no moss\nThis is not acceptable I understand the motivation of Jeff Flake\nHe just did not seem to understand that the left would not in good faith undertake additional inquiry into the credible allegations against judge Kavanaugh as they were termed by Democrats I don't think there are any credible\nAllegations against judge Kavanaugh but Democrats do they believe that\nCharge barzee forward as a credible allegation\nIn my world of belied it not credible to be an arm corroborated accusation from thirty plus years ago that as many internal inconsistency that have been teased out over the weekend that anyone who is focused on it would agree simply falls apart under close scrutiny\nAnd the allegation ms Ramirez don't even rise the level of allegation they are a simple smear\nSo the FBI will be busy with the remarriage allegations are nothing more to be done with Dr Ford she testified under oath at great length and her testimony has no to the Senate there are no other witnesses as she has admitted they can't talk to Richard Judge\nTook up all the other boys from Georgetown Prep should be done today\nI fully expect shut up majority leader McConnell to acquire file for cloture tonight which sets in motion thirty hours of debate [noise] so that on Wednesday they would vote on the motion to\nCause debate\nThen if it passes with fifty one votes to fifty three votes or we may mansion and hike camp [noise] are left but under the match in standard that you need more than accusation I expect him to vote to proceed it will go to the Senate for ... on Thursday that's what I'm hoping for\nAll we get along I watched them used\nThat Democrats attempt to change\nThe focus from the FBI's investigation as to whether they're or anything\nElse to the credible allegations that Democrats they are credible but which I I reject\n[noise] and that means the Yale allegation and the doctor blogs he poured allegation there's nothing else by the way they have referred for prosecution one of the hits on Capitol Betty rapes someone on a boat in Rhode Island that person's going to jail because they called Sheldon Whitehouse and that idiot people Rhode Island you have an\nIdiot representing you in the sense that idiot bleak that to the press and they put that out there again Brett Kavanaugh has two daughters turned fourteen [noise] had they switched over\nTo a week on a salt on the fact that he was angry at being accused of being a rapist Saturday Night live when all where despicable just despicable\nBrett Kavanaugh had been rated highly qualified fully qualify the highest rate and a BA has and the west has been working all we get wanted to get that back because the left to intervene in the personal practically it'd be a on friday without\nTalking to the idea ... they've got the highest qualification operating she taught forever at Harvard He is known by everybody in the legal community I don't know much of that from the beginning it wasn't my first choice but I Will not let any stove go on thrown against the McCarthy I\nKnow when McCarthyism died by the way it was directed over the weekend I'm not going to tell you the details\nAt a young left wing journalist\nOr young left wing journalist on Twitter came under assault\nWith just a few keystrokes find out what you did at ... go to this person\nAnd exploded that's McCarthyism\nYou move from the Rosenbergs who were tree has to Alger Hiss perjured himself because he was a a traitor genuine honest to God communist agents to accusing blacklisting people in Hollywood on the basis of mere accusation that tail gunner Joe stop you know it was set up a tail gunner Joe Margaret Chase Smith\nFirst woman senator senator from Maine stood up to Joe McCarthy than I Am hoping that every Republican follows the Margaret Chase Smith example and will have nothing to do with this I was disappointed when Jeff Flake\nFaster the FBI investigation I wanted to move forward but I Know he's a decent fair guy and he thought this would help but didn't\nJeff has continually disappointed by the people around them fame disappointed and Chris Coons and an Angus King for not now saying the smears I don't expect them to vote for judge Kavanaugh they they would prefer to have a liberal they would prefer to have it at our way to Kagan set up by our but they lost the election\nExpect every Republican to vote for him and I expect\nIt's in the Heidi Heitkamp to represent their state or they will be defeated I think they're going to lose any way but they will certainly be defeated you need to call your senator two two two to four three one two one two two two to four three one two what and tell them whatever way they are voting on Kavanaugh they need to denounce\nMalignant evil slander against him Tom Cotton was on face the nation yesterday cut number twenty three\nJudges having a hundred percent denies these allegations\nThere's not a single bit of corroborating evidence every evidence that we do have to include the people that mess for herself name either don't recall this instead or they'd the night that had happened did you find Mrs Ford or Dr Horton kind of\nMiss forward was sympathetic and she was sincere she'd been victimized by the Democrats in this process drawn they betrayed her request for confidentiality they leak this to the media the last minute because they were on a search and destroy mission for Kavanaugh said only last talked in November I think it's important that women feel they can come forward\nThat's a good change in the norms and the expectations of our society\nA woman came forward here uh and you're saying basically she said nothing credible how can women come forward if when they do they're they're told they're not credible\nShe came forward confidentially Dianne Feinstein time Feinstein did not share that with the proper authorities Chuck Grassley her counterpart with him she served for decades and the FBI that could have reviewed this matter confidentiality confidentially then they leave it to the media All right great rating the circus environment you're saying for the last two years\nNow he went on cutting timber twenty four\nOverall John first off what's understand why we have this hearing this for these allegations in a ... a letter to die by him sign on July shortly after ... Kavanaugh was nominated the very not he was nominated Chuck Schumer the Democratic leader\nSaid that he would do everything in his power to stop the nomination and that's what happened for three months and the Democrats have turned me advice and consent process into a search and the story mission these allegations are completely an supported by any evidence what evidence there is a thirty six year old climate\nAll support judge Kavanaugh's denial but then the Democrats have disgrace this process and the United States Senate and the orchestrated smear campaign of character assassination they've run against judge Kavanaugh their argument of course was that doctor for an ass to have this housing confidentiality and tried to do that\nAnd that's what it was what let me let me ... I don't know no no no no John let me talk to you about that when I talk to your listeners about your views about that there\nIs a well established process of confidentiality on the committee Dianne Feinstein could've showed that letter to Chuck Grassley and the two of them as the leaders of that committee could have shared it with the FBI who could have discreetly conducted\nThis inquiry in July and August without trying miss sports confident says and they have betrayed her they pointed her lawyers Who Lied to her and did not tell her that the committee staff was willing to go to California to interview her all that now all that water under the bridge\nThose lawyers to face a D.C more investigation and in the midst their misconduct Dianne Feinstein and her staff is going to face and investigation for why they leak that all this could have been done discreetly happens hundreds upon hundreds of times every year and then this year I mean he doesn't\nAnd then more done gotten ... twenty five is John any impact this empire episode his hat on women's willingness to come forward and report sexual assault Johnny Carson also do immediately after it happens\nIt's caused by the Democrats is caused by Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Schumer not respected her request for confidentiality now when you come forward with an accusation as serious as the U.S it has to be tested against the evidence and gets ... and we would have known that confidentially inside of this year committee aren't wasting its time\nI don't know what I don't know what the FBI got to find that the committee has not already found that the committee staff has already interviewed all the witnesses that mess for excited they interviewed miss forward and judge Kavanaugh for six hours to add on areas that are ... and she sent a letter that was an interview not right about that\nSo they've either interview them or they receive letters under penalty of perjury I sat for now these are actual interview so I'd be surprised if any of these people under penalty of perjury change\nTheir statements that they've already given an issue as well so ...\n... yeah one or cut from cotton because in the that is the bottom line you do not lie in a letter that subject to perjure you do not change your story when they arrived to talk to you in personal pet twenty six\nJohn we already know what everyone who's alleged to be at the party has said that committed statements or been interviewed under penalty of perjury I Would be shocked if any of them change her statement under penalty of perjury to the FBI but if this makes you senator is more comfortable about going forward and voting on judge Kavanaugh is\nVery highly qualified nomination\nIn in the face of an orchestrated democratic smear campaign then was that may end up as a good thing is just cannot truthful and everything he said in his testimony I found him to be hurtful throughout his testimony I found them to be turned out he he was and I found him to be appropriately indignant ... at the smear campaign and I I'm disappointed in what Chris ... sat on a video leading hand it reminds me of the old proverb\nThen right now all this
