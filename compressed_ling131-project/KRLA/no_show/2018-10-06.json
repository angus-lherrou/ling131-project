I Believe the allegations against him were not since they were all totally uncorroborated but picking sides there that either way he just doesn't have the temperate as a uh\nThat's what's come out from Washington Post New York times uh Heidi Heitkamp a senator from North Dakota Democrat a Democrat Senator Feinstein Democrat Senator Schumer Durban Doug Jones or a lay he and there are there are certainly more\n[noise] but Janice on Facebook rights and that they keep talking about judicial temperament\nBut capital wasn't being attacked as a judge he was being attacked as a person so he reacted like a person and he says that it is often a this was so when he was doing this uh uh primarily for his parents for his\nWife and primarily for his uh his children as well as daughters as well so let's go right to the phones a lot of calls to get through was going to go right to her by order of those who have been holding the longest surely and Michigan on line one surely walk the J sexual lives\nRight focus room for um I think we all need a lot of like being fair for just ... you know\nThat for those that are taking a vote for an awful awful the courage that they're going to pay it forward for the little tree lumber to pray for him but my question is if\nHe is voted on what the swearing in ceremony Sunday so he can immediately start at the court on Monday or what they have to wait for any length of time to swear in ...\nSaid it can happen just as quickly as as a I mean you get to vote and you can have the swearing in um the uh you could kind of have the formal or a swearing in done very quickly what was it that you know immediate time period on Sunday and then there can be more and more formal kind of ceremony even after that\nYeah I think it would happen virtually immediately Jordan I mean I think he would be over at the court on Sunday whether or not the swearing in ... or Monday morning I if he's confirmed by the Senate Jordan he's going to go to work immediately\nSo yeah so just to answer your question very quickly sure it happens immediately what you would likely be a kind of a small quick of it\nAnd then there would be a kind of a larger of it we're friends and family go um uh that's been the case for other nominees ... up but they start to work immediately states it back to the phones we go Stewart in New York on line three Stewart welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nHigh um thank you for a while you do as your support of Israel my question is in the audience Brett Kavanaugh has been a judge has his temperament that they've been in this you\nKnow I mean he got the highest rating you can get stored from a BA the American bar association which is very far to the left politically by the way but when they they they look at these judges they look at the kind of ... what ... how they conduct themselves it's not really supposed to be about it's not supposed to be about judicial philosophy um and he got the highest\nRanking you can from uh the American bar association well qualified so uh that get there'd been no issues about judicial\nTemperament if you disagree with his judicial philosophy but no issues about judge Kavanaugh's temperament at all\nUh brought up personal on the bench at work or throughout his career before being a judge or the twelve years he served on the bitch back to the phones or we go mark is in California on line to Marcus welcome to Jay secular life\nThanks for taking my call these were the current\nGovernment there is they talk and he said basically\nThat is that is that basically it was it was at least a attempted rape eh eh eh assault mean series he's serious crimes he was accused of mark is\nWith no core operation or even after another FBI airport no core operation no one will lead to even say you know say that they they even heard about this ever occurred\n\nYeah well it's I mean this is this is it's politics um as a temperament issue again is it was just there next line of attack see he's too angry to be out of the court I mean they actually say that\nIt's too angry too much aggression to be on the court but that was not him as I get the city it was ... judicial philosophy there who defending himself there's a big difference uh back to the phones we go stand in Nevada on live for staying welcome to Jay secular life [noise]\nI I maybe I met this earlier but I guess I Need to let you know I'm represented a form of government I cannot in my mind that magic number like Heidi Heitkamp or a man who have overwhelming preference is but one one direction [noise]\nTo even consider the other I mean are we sending people to Washington [noise] do what they want to do on their own are they what we do\nHave regrets red state Democrats get through with talk\nThat never really became an action that was catching up to ... to this vote a than I think that at a the race was getting a just a is getting a bit too tight and the Democratic party moving a bit too far to the left\nSo that he couldn't the talk with no action just didn't really work but it is worth it been okay for them to Heidi Heitkamp types of North Dakota of all places I think she's given up\nBy this I mean what I think that she's dead now I don't think that's right because she does represent constituents like a standard set but uh but but than that I think for the job ancient ties are likely the party has moved so far to the left\nThat ah he's tried to talk like a moderate but not actually vote like a modern didn't work and now we're seeing potentially am starting to vote or like the moderate he says he is\nI I think this is one of the main reasons that Heidi Hi Keith race is basically lost for her Jordan I mean look the numbers for judge Kavanaugh in North Dakota in
