ah that the the high school students were were protesting\nAgainst uh yeah the the the article is that I have a grab for that was actually from gateway pundit which is Jim hops great sight out of\nA St Louis said it was posted today still seeing Sunday he'll be probably just below the fold the headline Beverly Hills high school students surround the LA Times reporter with Trump flag tell her LA Times is fake news and you'll see that doesn't\nThat doesn't help the article it doesn't mention that the incorrect reports supposedly I other border up thing and I I haven't seen any of the LA Times reporting has been pretty straightforward and even the gate where ... is there a doesn't have that uh ... anything about the LA Times\nOr the incorrectly reporting on students are protesting term so I don't know whether this red from\nAll the new all and I saw over the days was the local news in LA um I'll admit I didn't see in ... in LA Times column my point about the article that I cited was the behavior of the students visa v the mainstream news media regulations of action\nYeah that was interesting but he but I found it interesting that the LA Times reported that straightforward so I'd really watch that 'cause I think the LA Times is pretty straightforward I wouldn't call it say\nWell what's their new owners some interesting things that happened I remember a few weeks ago with the Kavanaugh hearings say we're actually not as terrible as I would've expected and so I have a lot it might be something that went on at the uh the times here\nHere I think it's a I think they are getting better too and it just you know I really watch a really watch using the word snipers and comparing a political protests\nThat was John innocent not me I Know a lot of people yeah sorry I mean yeah I use that word here I Am not a lot of crazies out\nThere yeah I Know in a better Andrew claiming was just using the revolutionary war analogy a on how the how the ... calling us fought\nYeah Johnson with his connection to the Pasadena patriots the Tea Party people gets a little Concord and Lexington on that sometimes that's\nThat that's fair enough Don thank you for that I didn't even realize that when I settled all avoid all read too yeah yeah well thank you for calling in good call All right so we got another caller uh we're getting ready to go to a break but a Brent in Los Angeles are good friend Brent are you there\nUm hello hey Brent how's it going to have you been listening tonight if I have just wants to\nAri and John and I'm an unjust I was nervous when I heard that Mike wasn't speaking tonight and then I heard the way you would just grabbed my mom do started laying down at the caliber communicating by her like I Can't believe [laughter]\nSo well so I think we chose a good guest host tonight didn't weigh outstanding good I'm flattered thank you [laughter] can you call every every time we have you on the whole uh you know show [laughter] keep talking there\nIn ... but what I wanted to ask about with his take on the money and the ... were behind the monsters which is the the argue and state and national teachers' unions and their support and backing foreign people occupied yell at the school sex child abuse scandals and one thing after another\nOh you mean the big goal was single party conglomeration of wrongness activism that goes by several names was really just the same people showing up over and over again in different masks like\nShacks that's she's doing most of the quilting I'm just going I'm just looking at going are you sure that goes there\nI'm doing well next so you had a big weekend this weekend or your movie came out I was actually at the premier on Tuesday and was blown away uh it's it's one of those it's one of those movies that are sticks with you and you you just can't just stop thinking about it\nUm but yeah yeah did you get a lot of that response from people\nYes I've been hearing from people all of the country saying this but it's a\nPowerful experience and then it stays with them and that they're very moved by it and they think about it for a long time afterwards yeah it's been very very gratifying and you know\nMore and more people are writing in I think I think we're ranked wealth than the nation right now this weekend nice ... with a number of what movie and we were number than for the day Sunday our receipts today we're we're the greatest movie today ... percent\nSo that's a good sign it's going up Friday Saturday Sunday isn't it\nYeah yeah people are telling other people you know they're they're sort of ... there was a lot of fear about the movie because of the subject matter you know they were people were afraid that it might be too gory or too disturbing or or too much like our movie and\nYou know it's not it's not that at all it's more of a thriller and that's a really informative and you know I think an emotionally power obese people killing each other that way more people come and see the movie\nYeah you can you talk about the the the costs are the dynamic of this issue people like me who are generation X. and I think a Johnson as as well we grow up in such a sanitizing\nWorld of ... with the abortion issue where it was just I was just a choice in there is no shame about it and\nAt the high end very rarely even considered the issue very much I mean I grew up in West LA and it's just a given this a woman's right to choose and that's it and you just hope this isn't happening you kind of thing\nAnd when I heard the ... story in the news I was stunned I I couldn't sleep I I was I was amazed if there was this entire area of of of this\nHorrible aspect of political a dialogue\nDid is completely sanitize ignored and it was quite a cathartic moment for me to have to make the real moral choice about this issue to talk about that and how that relates to the movie and those things\nWell one thing that happened when they first approached me to uh to direct a movie and I said well let me see script obviously and so\nI when I was reading the script I'd just be allies there was so much information about abortion that I didn't have that I didn't know\nBut that never know you know and it's like you said the idea of abortion is so sanitized that you don't really know what it is you know I think a lot of people\nDon't really know what constitutes an abortion and what the procedure actually is and that there's a scene in the movie where I'm a ... a defense attorney her doctor guys now take another a doctor who runs a women's clinic through all the steps of the second trimester\nI'm ... and evacuation abortion and it's it's gripping stuff I mean it's just like wow when I read that I said I don't care what started the issue you're on you need to know this because this is what we're talking about\nYeah I'll tell you that scene was powerful a ... you played the defense attorney and I guess Janine Turner played the abortion doctor right yeah I I was blown away when she admitted that she had performed thirty thousand of them\nRight well it's not even like it's not really even admission she sent him you know it she not ashamed of it at All right you know it's just what she does but that's her a speech experience to what she does [laughter]\nYeah but then was sort of a matter of fact scene where documentary like a ... worth a hundred thousand hours right hand building would boats or something right yeah yeah right\nRight yeah that that's kind of the the way came out and you know I think that what the diagnosis defense attorney in that scene and he's basically trying to\nFind a way to defend his clients whose basically indefensible but one of the way he's he's trying to do it is to say what my client is not any different than what Barry abortion bucks the rent so you know in in trying to make the point that helped his own client these kind of\nMaking a very strong argument and that and that the cross examination\nYeah if it was a wonderful movie and the performances were amazing who who's the girl that played the prosecutor\nYeah Sarah Jane Maurice she was she was a terrific mind that I I Love her performance suits she's very honest and you know the reactor the horror of the situation and and having it slowly gone on her what's been going on for many many years is that it's very powerful\nYeah because she she started the movie out as as pro choice right and then she sort of had a had a journey throughout the movie and I think we all are on\nIt it's not like she had her conversion I mean we didn't go for that right where do we didn't want to do the conversion story but it it's I mean basically what I thought when we did the movie was that this was something both sides can see even if you're pro choice you got to be against what this guy was doing\nYeah and so in some way like I never set out to really set out to make a movie that both sides could watch it and learn from not necessarily to make a a you know a quote from light shaped by unquote\nRight the ... the movie is not really about abortion I mean ... was a murder yeah\nYeah but in the course of telling the story of course you have to look at what an abortion is and what what makes one legal and what makes another when illegal\nYeah and I think a a huge salient point about the situation is out because no one was protected from on high by forces within the pro choice movement because of their fear that he would expose\nThe unsanitary and a a an end to this antiseptic aspects of this and yeah and I\nThink that that's that's really a big part of why it happened I mean ... and it goes back to what I was saying about abortion or something that nobody really wants to know anything about they wanted to take place somewhere dark where nobody knows about it and nobody sees it\nAnd I think that's the thing that that sort of attitude is propped up guys now for all those years and allow them to continue murdering\nYeah because that's the argument you constantly hear we don't want women to go to ... we don't want them to use coat hangers and then because it was so legal and so protected they wind up going to the ultimate ... to the ultimate coat hanger kinds of ...\n... ... ... did not protect women from gods now because they didn't treat it you know they didn't treated seriously they didn't\nThey inspect the clinic for Seventeen years the governor said I don't want to be seen as anti reproductive rights or anti woman's right to choose so we're just going to lead these clinics alone\nWhich is just think of all when it's a disaster\nYeah we'll next thank you for being with us I just wanted to tell you I've just done do rather than international movies so are you are now inter galactic movie star\nAnd thank you so

himself he'll think you're all and then thank you Christie it's so good to sit in the studio with both of you and I feel like I'm coming home every week\nAnd I have some more things to say and I am so excited because the thing is I look outside it's a glorious day a little bit on the outside but it's okay no problem and I was thinking today that I have to tell you people\nDon't ever stop believing dumped Adler stump taking a deep breath look at the blue sky and do things you like to do if you like fishing go fishing if you like ride motorcycle ride motorcycle if you like to play golf\nPlaying golf because the thing is if you concentrate on the news\nYou want to just to wrap yourself up in the white she didn't grow slowly to the cemetery and I don't want you to do that and I don't want you to think that because I Am happy and you know what made me so happy such a small simple thing\nI spend a whole day with my granddaughter and you know now and she's a little bit older than she can understand what I'm Talking about and all that we have such a great great time together we have fun and we play games we eat we do and I feel like Greely life continues despite the fact\nOf last week here and the news and there is no escape by now you'll know that for the whole week\nWe bombed ISIS and you know I don't know I I kind of different conflicting thoughts about what we do that I understand\nFrom the history of war from old battles that we always wanted to know what our enemies are doing you know we would sense cows we would sense price we would try to intercept communications\nAnd then not let them do anything about what we are doing you know in the before Normandy we actually have completely phony staging area\nSo Hitler's generals would think that we can they invade from there and they brought some divisions there and that's why it was possible for us to be more successful\nOn the D Day and here we are\nWe announcing that today at eight Fifteen we're going to bomb you\nSo ISIS people can have a nice dinner finish everything then go to a public baths\nAnd then disperse among the civilian population and leave all the buildings and the great success America is rich we can send them a hawk missiles forty seven no problem because the only one million the first shot but we can do this endlessly\nAnd you know what ...\nWhat a great tool if you want to win the war\nYou have to destroy you any me not the buildings that actual people who are killers for shooting at us caught trying to kill us and I'm so happy that our\nGovernment was able to bring in some\nArab nations to help us you know how important these so nobody can cause crusaders because now we have some the nation from Qatar\nWho is polishing the bombs and we have some cleaning lady from Jordan who is cleaning the barracks so the Arab nations very involved and we are using them to help us to defeat these terrible terrible and\nIt's all for show it's so politicking if you want to know when you do what needs to be done to win and not to have explanation of what we do how we do when we do it but this is of course my personal opinion [laughter] yeah yeah\nI mean it's almost like he's [noise] yeah there's a part of it that makes me think that that they're trying to write the history book\nIn his hands yes very good point you know it's it's kind of seems to me that it's more important to have a right political story than actually do a real true military action\nAnd I feel bad for our own military people for our generals for everybody because it's very difficult to be involved in the military activity was so much political burden hanging over\nYou but you've noticed that on the news or just in the past few years that the president has turned out what the strategy you were doing to our enemy which is strange to me like you were saying earlier it's that okay I if I'm the enemy now I can calendar that out and make sure I've already plant\nSays in the moment most of the time yes yes now who are the Shiites in the early ... comic history this year where political affection you know do it three she had a lead the party of early as we discussed earlier a leader who has a son in law of profit from it [noise]\nThey share claimed that rite of Eli this son in law of the prophet Mohammed and his descendants to lead the Islamic committed [noise]\nBut here's what's interesting happening I leave was killed as a result of intrigues violence and civil wars which merit she's colored fate\nShe sounds hot sun and Hussein\nIs where the ... they were denied what they thought was that legitimate right to a session to kind of effect\nComic faith is that again it's like a country it's like a regime okay ... college forced the head of the caliphate caliphate was that regime of this certain territories certain ... and that's what ISIS is trying to do now they created a collie fat cat okay\nNow what's interesting cut some is believed to have been poisoned by more at the first to leave leave college as I said before is the leader of the Muslim ray\nOf their ... dynasty so basically that that's what she I think that her son who was supposed to be a leader of a Muslim was actually poisoned by not the ... [noise]\nHis brother who's saying that's also very interesting story his brother Hussein was killed on the battlefield along with the members of his family after being invited by supporters to ... hopefully it's like the seat of a caliphate thrillers\nThe coup for I Believe so he was invited there\nBecause they promised that Davis swear allegiance sticky and instead they killed him and all his family why it's very important because these events specifically they serve ads gave rise to this she a concept of most of them\nAnd the rituals of grieving remember I told you they go in they they very much yeah they have them so they both yeah deletion ... yes because the monitor them is very very important in the Shia part of Islam\nTo I think that he went into that and the end was murdered willingly like gave himself as a sacrifice no no no he wasn't deceive he was being trade fashion she was invited to like see in the\nGovernance of these ... instead they killed him and killed though his family and all the followers and he was invited under the pretense that they will swear allegiance to him and he will truly become the leader of the translator murdered and that\nThat's interesting these followers he's killed my so they're more than ... are they mourn him not have more on somebody but they want to hear from ... because it was betrayed and kill mhm and so more to them and not only him remember we talked about the grandchild that everybody\nWe killed and betrayed so most of them became very important part of it because all they're perceived leaders\nWere killed okay so they they\nFeel that they mourn their more of them comes out from morning then\nThat's why I became so important to them okay Shia Muslims or even the majority in Iran Iraq but rain I said by John and some believe even in Yemen of course there are some\nShia communities pretty large ones in Afghanistan in India in Kuwait\nIn Lebanon in Pakistan Qatar Syria Turkey United Arab Emirates and even in Saudi Arabia there are some shit leave their but here's the interesting thing\nMy that's my personal interpretation has nothing to do with his colors my personal interpretation was that she had ... people\nThat followed she felt like there were insulted\nThen not respected and by Sudanese and so they have this grief again soon is because not only they killed like betray them and killed them but they also not very other than the respected because what happened is that even countries governed by Sunnis Shia\nTend to make up the poorest and most uneducated parts of the society\nIn the state and it's interesting they like under glass in some other country now in addition to that some extremist Sunnis preach hatred of she is like assembled\nBin Laden and said that they infidels everything and and had nothing to do with them but of course\nAll of this has been changed since Nineteen Seventy nine\nWhen it happened in ... in Iran and Iran became biggest most powerful sheer country and that's why it's very very interesting that why they're fighting to get nuclear bomb because they call it the sort of Allah\nThey want to be now not only powerful against the infidels but also the powerful gains Sudanese so they don't have to come to them and to follow them not to be abused by them\nNow I don't know how much time I have left oh you can you give me a few more seconds I just wanted to tell you and the funny side I was looking at something and I thought holy moly people have so many excuses for the not successful\nCareer or something and I looked up and there are some very very successful people who are really really tiny dining this that you\nYou know like we all love Bruno Mars who is a great cast nice just five five\nYou know the thing is it Kevin Hart who is now the biggest star and in other words it's five to\nMichael J.

R. LA\nOh and the whole have you been seeing the polling that there was some question about whether or not the the the the Brett Kavanaugh\nIncident would affect a voter ... and you know it takes a couple of days the polls to be finished and it takes about a week for them to be process so they're starting to come out now the Senate races three states have just gone they just oh Tennessee Arizona Nevada just like\nWhat Republicans yeah they were all close now that it's like there had been not some cash eh not so much for the house races will say they don't they don't post so much in the house but he [noise] I don't know about the blue wave 'em I don't know\nI think when you go through what we all had to live through with the cabinet nominations you find people just get more resolved into their positions they just they just set more\nIn their extreme share of people out there who are not like obsessed with the news to like figure you know the second amendment and reverse this weight like who cares I didn't want a government that works in as an insane right and then you see you know the cabinet confirmation and like okay\nThat that kind of insane is not good enough [laughter] I I'm I I'm going to make an effort to vote against that we can do better than that\nBut on the other side you do get hash tag winning [laughter]\nI mean let's not underestimate tag is winning ha Trump where you're at a situation where he put his card on the table he played his cards first which was capital and it was me entering its way through a somewhat mildly contagious proceeding\nAnd then your Senator Dianne Feinstein [laughter]\nDecided to play for blood decided to go out and actually challenge for us was playing for blood from the top she was she was out with and then it became really not just a procedural issue but a reputational issue and who won\nWho won hash tag winning who won whether we like the results or not\nI don't I I Can't believe anyone in the country will see Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court and not see this as a win for Trump for the ... with it or not I wasn't just a win for Trump is when for Trump by way\nOf the Democrats just um\nOh well he did that snow happens he did this well he lied under oath about his beer drinking oh well his attitude was you know unworthy of jobs out there was just one thing after another they were not going to let it go they were going to try to ... her\nUgly we're going to try to turn Susan Collins who also is is a traitor to her her up identity politics\nGrew you can't be a woman vote for Brett Kavanaugh can't be a black man now Donald Trump you are not allowed we cannot have defection right from our identity groups\n... one of the biggest misconceptions you can make in modern Americans is to think that every possible a ideological position or any position on any particular topic is open to you they're not\nThey're not you you don't get to go to the sizzler buffet\nSalad bar and be able to pick whatever opinions you want if you or other particular background you have a somewhat constrained list of options that you're able to advocate for and I think that sad I think that lets us all down in in some degree\nThat we should be able to have this wider range of debate but you see in these highly emotional situations which I've said for the last several weeks and I'll say\nEither side of the aisle whether you look in the mirror and see Republican or you look in the mirror and see Democrats\nJust was not our finest hour both sides of the aisle passively let us down as far as what this country is about and it just goes to show that you're talking about the Supreme Court the cabinet nominations to count on ammunitions we didn't show on either of our\nDifferent narratives where they are you on the Democratic narrative or the Republican or neither side came out well and that's the thing you give the point to Trump you give the point to team Republicans 'cause they want and that matters they got their boy over the line but\nNeither side came across as being the kind of party that we aspire to when why and you know who's ... nobody ever talks about it all at the Kennedy that\nBecause he knew who the president was he knows right at the center was wrong with the timing of the midterms was he decided to retire when he decided to retire he created the ticking clock\nFor life baby wow she get\nNow now I mean come on come on ... yeah I thought I thought the Supreme Court was supposed to be non political\nThat's what I learned about when I when I was taking this class in ninth grade about like civic institution yeah if I were in court that we're living on that was ninth grade it was also ninth you waited until ninth grade class don't ... I was I was a very slow track at my California public school Brett Kavanaugh had a\nVery judicial temperament for twelve years on the circuit court for DC and and for you know a lot of his confirmation until they accused him of gang rape yeah I mean\nA little upset about that now I I find that issue and and I know it's an imperfect comparison but it's like the older brother\nPinning the younger brother to the floor where you hitting yourself ... and like just hitting in like in the war has repeatedly called him a cry baby ... and saying you know you're reacting poorly [laughter] why why why or why this I\nI have concerns about your temperament as you repeatedly slapped him in the face with his arm dictate that you know it it's\nLike [noise] make sure they're part of who share made sure that they were just part of an hack sitting in a black will we weren't true\nHere and it it's not about lack of judicial temperament\nAnd they were really you really should I mean once he's in and you go to work with them for the next you know he doesn't want to read it aloud with Clarence\n... they they integrated him in pretty well and now is a pretty just says anything ever ever ever I Want to thank you so much Michael from Los Angeles for calling and we've got time for one more caller and let's go to Dave from the great city of Anaheim day for men on how are you\nGuys are talking about a big picture now clarified this by point by point by point and everybody was just the the big picture on this one I okay so here's any that's already know about some of the\nOne way or the Democrat legislature is a very dangerous drifts body of people who are impacting our lives and I very dangerous matter and and like I Want to preface this by saying what Rush Limbaugh\nNot too long ago oh he said the reason why the Democrats are winning in California is because there is no pushback but let me tell you Orange County is the rear is the fact of the battle baby and we are going\nTo win this or keep orange rent check that out but forty seven eighty one online and you die right Governor Brown find it very bad deal\nAnd that shows you how are you confident they are forty seven was written by Democrat it was it was created by Democrats [noise] it it was filed by Democrats eighty one online and both\nWell it's a California yeah it's a long California of course directed by Democrats ... their release so\nIt's true George gets thrown a district attorney of San Francisco filed it it was created it was written by the justice at the office of Stanford University and so both are widely knowledge even get to\nSteady on September it's quite an only child they talking about it it's obvious for two or three years but now that has broken out in San Diego cabinet down there in LA hepatitis\nI'm Sorry type in LA\nBecause of the homeless and who who now that the Democrats and they haven't spoken out against it because they didn't want the blowback\nAnd so you guys are dangerous yeah we have S.
