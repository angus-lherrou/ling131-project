bring up the mob or Don Lemon and Matt Louis got into it famously now on CNN about\nWhat a mob as I Want to play that cut number two I got out before you answer and keep that wants to kick that fashion but your party won\nRight where the White House and got the Congress have to hand picked up as the last year people who don't agree with it or exercising one of their options which is protesters calling them a mob is that a bit much\nI think is that a lot [noise]\nI don't know I I Know you got to be that feel like we're at war\nFor thought okay I've got to get to the break and we'll answer your question the U.S or is it my behavior no it's not ... but people who are in there and the way the ... the way the country's going and policy\nWe now have before you jump in okay I may go why I Can't make it interesting that you know you're you're making a point are you the moderator or the host or are you\nArguing that liberal moderator and the host of tell you that you're giving up until it gets that I'm like look up the mob and the dictionary yeah I definitely look up the word ... in the dictionary\nAnd you should also as a Republican look at the council and look at the ... or whatever it is you are whatever it is you are look at the constitution of the United states and it gives people the right to protest\nYeah it it doesn't say where you will you please\nTell us okay okay I have a drink so you can do whatever you want and you can leave the show if you want but let me finish I'm not well maybe my point okay well then shut up and let me do it All right thank you very much\nIn the constitution you can protest whenever and wherever you want it doesn't tell you that you can't do it at a restaurant it doesn't tell you that you can't do it on a football field tell you that you can't do it on the cable news show you can do it wherever you want them to call people mobs because they are exercising their constitutional right it's just beyond the pale\nWill pass by the way and correct Don Lemon was one hundred percent wrong I've been teaching constitutional law for twenty two years time place and manner of restrictions\nAre imbedded in the first amendment you cannot do it wherever you want whenever you want that was mob rule breaking through barriers his mob rule it the definition of mob rule\nMob on the left right now and we are dealing with the mob meanwhile CNN doesn't seem to want to deal with mobs Brooke Baldwin hat on Mary Catherine him and they're adoptable Matt Lewis cut number one\n... and Mary Catherine I lego and to have more poll data and just out on the ... a little bit because obviously yes Republicans got a huge win and cabinet\nBut we've seen poll numbers today showing the syringe and gender gap for Republican Party in that they knew and Paul says sixty three percent of women say they will be voting for Democrats [noise] so\nWhat part of a woman ... this is not new that just seems that works how do they fix it by November ... yeah I mean\nI think this is the most potent potential problem that has brought to the mid term that tension Harlem I let her I said my friend I look I think he has taken a group of maybe swing flash slightly right leaning white college educated ex urban women and mom and\nShipping them to more fully swing voters or even folks who will lean left in the future and that is a problem particularly in these vulnerable healthy\nI Will say also though because this cabin off by it I think people are potentially underestimating how much did energize\nRepublicans on the other side including Republican women um and the issue for Democrats I think that their enthusiasm was already here\nThat was already way up here and art and the Republican Party is that is to bring parity and so I think they actually do have a chance to gain a bed and it will matter more in Senate races than it does and he's vulnerable house races where those women really matters I'm wearing a switching left ...\nPointed out energizing at Republicans and then your thing Republican women that you think that that really a trauma Saturday the Republican strategy I gave a weaponize ing Brett Kavanaugh you know they just do this for the next four week do you think that that's a winning strategy\nI definitely think it's a winning strategy for the midterms there could be a long term consequences that we look back at this moment that this was you know one moment on our way to Republicans having a demographic problem but in terms in the mid term I think Mary Catherine exactly why Democrats are already motivated\nDonald Trump like nothing that happened last week\nIs going to matter who the person who's already upset about all the other thing Donald Trump is on Democrats were motivated passionate\nAngry Saturday are either going to turn out or they are not\nPublic in there that theme that needed the excitement the path and the energy they didn't have it\nIn mid term that's what matters for turnout and now I think they do and it's because\nI Believe it's the overreaction of a lap when you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out or restaurants by a mob or you're not going to use the word totally a mop it is without a\nDoubt that I don't know whether we're now\nIt's up to put a stop on the mob\nIn what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August to go it's not what we saw chain thing I don't think we've All right\nWhat about the people who were at the Supreme Court banging on the wall that\nCivil protest or that a mob I think he is the way a mob\nYeah and if there was a party or as we call it a mob pressure come up with the area [noise] let me let me let me\nLet me move past the N. word because I Do feel like that in part of the the weaponization of of what's happening now on the right but at the same time I think you do make a really interesting point in the piece I write in your day that while the whole issue with cap and on for it has been incredibly businesses in this country it has been unifying\nLong Republican like Republican that are Republican problem you had the Trump or isn't the never Trump or in your whole point is that this is what\nCauses Republican to be one big one side of the family again\n[noise] yeah look I think that that\nThe Brett Kavanaugh okay so there are never proper prominent never cropper who aren't and several lists and intellectuals that this was very ... the capital case really split the never Trump movement and you had about half of them the era era ends of the world who are basically they hated Donald Trump but now they feel\nPushed into Donald Trump camp I think it's a backlash against the law um and then you with other people like the Max Boot of the world the Jennifer ribbons of the world that were pushed the other way but in terms of the rank and file average\nRepublican voter a lot of people out there around the country they don't really like Donald Trump what they saw Brett have it all it's just a regular\nKind of conservative that Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio with a picker George W. Bush has the attack on him what's the baby was totally bogus as an attack on them so this really had a unifying effect a lot of people who don't like Donald\nCertainly I thought they could\nGo back to
