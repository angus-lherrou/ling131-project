I've got Dave on line one from Orange County are you there Dave\nMine hello hey how are you do you have a question or comment on on south Pasadena tonight otherwise we'll hold job until after the

you where they can't because they are going to be outraged by telling them straighten it last yes ... land or just over the top then maybe you have to hold me over the break out and all that way like\nWell why don't we hold you to after the break\nBecause let's say I was like you you've got to brainstorm and I've got these wonderful people here I Want to keep the focus a on\nA south Pasadena in the pension issues right now because we're laying the bear here one by one let's go to line two I've got brave from St George sprint good to hear from you again how are you tonight\nBread tell you they're\nAll right well about brain what are you there sure\nYep I'm here right now as you do you have a comment or question for the ... well\nI had some comments and yeah it was about\nThe situation with FBI knew not advising employees on locally and state wide that they don't have to be paying into their the due to the the union\nAnd offered the situation with the total corruption of the state and national teachers' union they're involved right\nNow when we come back after nine o'clock hour\nI'm going to connect up everything this happening at the local and the national level so you can either hang up and call back or you can hold on to allow all okay uh we we love to have you on will pick that up because what you have to say about the sci you and everything else is very important\nI Want to go back to what's going on down to south Pasadena so they would I I read the ballot statements and you'll see them there were up there in California taxpayers ... dot org\n... if you want we put it all up there there's no these da di da ... and\nWhen you go to the ballot the devil statement ah by the city\nBut I find remarkable about it it is what blather radios hole where workers who are just nothing but the ... budget a public unions are talking points they're not working hard on these numbers and they just say well we're we're we're no more\nNo more or less competent more diligent and managing our finances than other cities\nAnd it's the same in every city yeah same exact playbook right here they basically you know in the sales tax increase in Pasadena here\nThey have the formula for all the cities and they have use uh in the past there have use professional uh Tyson in companies that specialize in a in ... helping the city's race revenue\nIn the really is no doubt that the city and the school districts and everybody else are actually electioneering aren't they they make claim as legal but the city is putting out so called voter information packages and and the other guy humidity cases that are designed to defeat the measure\nGrab cause it and this companies are not cheap ... they charge a lot of money uh so ... you know where's the money coming from the unions or from the city\nUh you know and they pay for this um they did they do surveys unlike some relation yeah yeah yeah so they do all this thing that costs a lot of money right and who's paying for that\nYou you are you know we are that you're you know we we\nThe taxpayers are basically being ... uh are paying to have themselves manipulate\nCorrect and I and I and I got to pick this up after nine o'clock without one of the nation in the five six seven minutes we have available here I Want everybody to take out their pans and pencil and take notes because what I'm about to say is of overwhelming\nAnd compelling importance so why is it down there in South Pasadena that they will really come to grips with these two huge numbers\nThat we put up that we we we've stated that the city is basically insolvent my guide your ... ... even ... phony number\nIs twenty nine to thirty five million dollars in the real number maybe as much as a hundred million dollars well whether it's is dirty fifty Seventy five eighty million or a hundred billion hardly matters that is a great big huge number but yet\nThey they don't focus on it and why don't they focus on let me tell you the reasons why it's\nNumber one if they focus attention on that number than the con will be over\nIf the ... and I'm sure that when they got together they say do not focus on that number do not debate that number draw no attention to either one of those numbers because if we do that it will communicate to the people just how big this problem is\nAnd we can say all day long that we're as good as anybody else all were very efficient and we don't pay our people as much as the surrounding uh people uh uh pay you know but that number with people we can't repeat it often enough\nTwenty nine million thirty five million one hundred million dollars when they see that the ... if the popular if the citizens focus on that number they will know that they've been hustled Condon scammed that's number one number two reasons why they don't focus on that number\nIf they focus on that number if they'd have to do something about that number instead they say it reminds me this is this a judge I used to know down to ... flour who used to say oh the court's hands are tied every time you wanted to do something so\nThe court's hands are tied well they tied their own hands up in a in Sacramento a long time ago to make sure that these are these pension arrangements could not be be change should the local level as a matter of fact the\nSame city of south Pasadena has spent millions of dollars of posing\nThere's the seven ten freeway going through their wonderful city I'm not going to get involved in that or whether it's right or wrong or different but they claim that the that the city's best interests required it and they haven't spent a nickel to have lifted a finger their goal to ... to to uh\nSacramento and to get this plan change they haven't joined the new law suits even today there not agreeing with you that it's a problem\nThey should be condemning this system equally as we are because they should be saying not me not chew they're the ones that are in charge of that place down there they should be saying today hey look\nAnd you know this is a a you know this this reminds me of you know of their model never dropped the con bowl thing ... even when you get caught and especially when they get caught never dropped the card should keep it in the car going now just to wrap up the one thing\nA part of the con is that if the three point six million dollars or goes away they're going to have to fire fire\n... you're a police and fire and this or that now there's several\nLies all all all wrapped into one but the the single ... ... number one they always talk about cutting positions never salaries are benefits if they cut salaries your benefits are brought 'em in the line\nThey could maintain police and fire and safety services and in fact they could buy more of them if they wanted but you just can't do it when you're paying these people more than the governor\nBad you can't do it when you've got people do another stupid things in the cities including senior services or whatever sorted non says that the busy themselves with down there but the biggest ally of all and everybody keep those pets and pencils up there you've been taking notes this city cities\nArguments are actually factually correct\nIf that three point six million dollars goes away\nWith their existing business model their revenue model and they're spending model if three point six million dollars goes away yes they will have to make these very significant even potentially devastating cuts there's no question about that\nAnd ladies and gentlemen the whole point\nBut these patriots or make you down in South Pasadena the whole point we're making here on the show every week is that that day is coming because that twenty nine million dollars are starting to Jack up\nThe contributions every year as soon as they are going to need another two three four million dollars of additional revenue this year and then the next year they're cooking up another tax and I'm telling you they can't tax their way out of this problem\nHell is coming to breakfast they're going to have to face this as they're just hoping to generate enough political will across the state to get the settlement that they want the California Supreme Court will be dealing with this issue\nSo they are quite correct that there are only one paycheck away from disaster and that's our point they can't sit there pretend to run the city have the fiduciary responsibility to run the city and then ignoring these numbers like they didn't exist there's they all I didn't know and this is hey\nYou know you can't say that yes Marcy\nWell we are arguing that they have to make these cats until you factor and touching back and back to the point where trying to make that that revenue ... keep going up so much if they just stop increasing standing and um and left the revenue increases ...\nThey won't have to make that's all I\nDisagree I told you know and it's as if we didn't have this conversation for the last hour that number seven thirty five million dollar number is so big that is a bus\nAt that time that's what we're saying when you put the pension debt in ... it ... if that's why we're at the end you have things like that yeah well get out of the counter\nI Know I Know when I was doing OK delighted to pay my bills please okay so do you know we've worked our way through that we still have I Want to come back to some of this other stuff but I've got our old friend Brent does on line to branch are you there and my friend\nYes I'm here and Hi John where male and mark\nThe hey I rent a good good people you wanted to comment on the sci you and I wonder your comment because I wanted to use that to lead into a broader discussion of what's actually going on in the south Pasadena and at the national level go ahead\n... ... what what I was thinking about I Know somebody that works for court and he always send me FBI you now that are going out\nAnd ... ... um the state and national teachers' unions and FBI you are not advising their employees that they don't have to be home and the view and do it on their mute on all the death and there are hundreds of millions of dollars\nThat they're desperate receiving yeah and and the and these people where you're ... you're referring to all the federal and the financial corruption and I was listening to a woman named I'm Rebecca offering direct if\nYou're oh yeah sure she would lead plaintiff\nAre you in the first teacher case that there are a should say the the first public employee decision the ones the Supreme Court but Scalia died so they didn't review it because there was only four four and then the next case up was Janice in of course of one\nExactly and coming out with a new book called me up to a Goliath how\nWe're ... we're so much of this money when whenever we see a left wing protests within two for occupy black lives matter fact the second amendment or now with the judge ... they have the organizing scale power and money and they're behind all of the try\nNot to mention the incredible abuse of sexual education classes in programs that are forced upon our children\nAnd try and these public employee unions particularly the so called Teachers Association ours the root of all most all leave all in the United states man thank you for that for the common brand of or being part of our show now I'd like to take that point\nAnd it and move on ... and and taking broader\nHere in this uh this last week\nWe saw something truly amazing\nAh we saw the false witness born or against or a judge Kavanaugh absolutely outrageous we've heard of a herd of all these things and I don't want to rehash re litigate ... went on over the last two weeks but I Do want to make the primary point about what happened\nYou know when we go back into the history of western civilization as we look at the concerns expressed first by the Greeks later by the Romans they had a deep deep distrust of democracy\nDemocracy was a small D which they interpreted as the mob and the entire history of self governance is that the entire history of constitutional government the rule of law\nWas an effort to keep the mob outside that's what the Roman Senate was that's what we modeled the American centered on was this Roman idea of the Senate where where are the leadership of a society would meet\nAnd reflective Lee arrive at judgments which we are best for the country now\nI Know that that's a lot that's you know that's not what happens there even on the best of circumstances\nBut what they what they did what the left did particularly Democrats here in this case what they did was to actually bring the mob into the Senate chambers that is so symbolic they brought the mob that was in the streets [noise]\nThey brought them in there and they became part of the mob they became the leaders of the mob the very end tip the ... of of of\nConstitutional government they're very at ... civilized self government it is absolutely outrageous and these people are evil beyond the district description of the word\nOr you will be back in a minute here continue this rent Mike Alexander

you to have a great day in paradise\nBut unfortunately there is no escape from all the news around there and before we get to the news I have to get a little bit some kind of a small peach full California deluxe windows because after all they sponsoring this show and you know what\nIt's amazing maybe you remember some a couple of months ago with incredible projects on the high high rise buildings where we took her room that was a storage for cardboard boxes that's it and by changing the ceiling and the windows with us specially curved beautiful\nVery well insulated lonely glass everything and put it together\nAnd now they made it into a great great living space that a bad there there is stable and chairs and you can see it if you go in on our website WWW city windows that come\nYou will see the pictures right down the home page on the front and you don't need to go anywhere just save patient and the pictures will come to you you will see this incredible place and you know what why I'm telling you that\nBecause now we've been contacted by age ... and they said all the other two hundred residents of this skyscraper also want to have the same windows and I started praying thank thank God thank you that's really amazing and you know\nI'm not proud that we selling windows I'm proud that we make any difference that we're making huge difference in this in this day and do bad too that the committee for Marconi word doesn't consider making windows excellence broadcast\nBut enough above that I'm Glad you have fun with that because I felt that you know what I listen to and I and I always listen great broadcast there's\nA great talent and I see them around here and I see all the time and I admire them and it's you know I can on this fire to be one hundreds of one percent as good as their however I brought you some information today and you know what\nI Am not going to pretend to be a scholar of Islam but I Know enough to tell you some of the information that perhaps it will be interesting for you to learn you know\nPeople now here all the time she had since Sudanese and otherwise and they drive and they said then this port and everybody's fighting with everybody and nobody knows what is what so I decided to go back a little bit and tell you a few things about what it's actually own means first\nYou know it's about one point six billion Muslims in the world to a lot of people but\nDo you know that eighty seven percent\nMost one point ... billion of them are Sunnis\nIf I didn't know that and the only two hundred eight million only only two hundred million Shiites and you know how it's all came about ... about one thousand four hundred years ago my son's got divided into two groups\nOne group believe that the prophet Mohammed ... son in law are leaving a beat to leave should be their rightful successor to the leader\nAnd now Syria you know it's it's very interesting Bashar al Assad is member I mean other sect of Islam cold otherwise\nThey came out of she is branch over a thousand years ago and they are at odds with a mainstream Sunni all she it's teaching for example like extended roster of profits that including Greek philosophers\nWho believes in some tendency of Christianity or ancient ancient Persia teachings how am I is very very strict Katz thanks very sick\nBoth parents must be other whites for children to be all over our heads\nA sub is very close to the ... powers such as Iran or Hezbollah there are many many more Sunnis in the world the largest country within most soon his on the planet\nYou guess ... you know your guess what the largest Muslim country with a mostly so Nice France no you know Indonesia and says imagine more than two hundred comedian Sunni Muslims leave there\nAnd she adds that tiny small minority now imagine how different the east to find someone to be in our side if you are an infidel and so they have only five minutes left and I have so many more things to say [noise] now\nShe has the break down the country who can help us the most turkey is not going to move a finger why because they are afraid\nAfraid to give Kurds more power because Kurdistan is the area fighting for independence from turkey for long long periods of time\nSaudi Arabia that's not want to fight Sunni uprising because that to make you Ron she it's country stronger\nThe only country that steps forward to help United States of America in the fight against ISIS you'll never guess who it is the only committed country at this point is Syria\nThis is the same country that we said a son has to go he's a red line we're going to change the regime was going to do all that\nNow today and a half years later into a conflict in two hundred thousand serious skilled serious only one that step forward and said okay we'll fight with you to destroy ISIS imagined that\nHe thinks I'm most mind boggling situation\nThat could possibly happen and that's why I Want people to know one thing yes there is a way to fight ISIS\nIt's being very strong decisive and smart if we are going into the middle east\n[noise] never count on other Arab countries to help you and the most important thing I just read it in the article in New York Times which you know you know my opinion but New York times but they made one very very good sink point\nThat there is the biggest the trust of United States of America now in the middle east than ever existed in history just short time ago when Iraq invaded Kuwait\nThey're Herbert Walker Bush organized a coalition of almost thirty three countries many Arab countries including Syria\nBecause they all believe they better go in step with America or else they will suffer the consequences now not only nobody believes\nThat they should walk together with the United states they try to stay away as far as possible because nobody trusts the current regime we follow any of the problem is is well any of the goals do anything to the end so for them they just hedging their bets\nDoes it mean that we're not participating yes we have to and we'd go and we do it\nThat states above that part of the other thing I Want to if any of your listeners are in business there is something remarkable happened this week\nThat oh Ninth Circuit appeals court in San Francisco voted that it is okay for Yelp to manipulate the reviews in exchange for money\nThat they said that it's only part negotiation tactic number one he's confirmed what I was saying for several years the jail does manipulate the reviews for money otherwise it wouldn't be a decision of this kind\nThat makes sense so if they manipulate the reviews for money how could you trust them\nBecause the only reason people go through reviews is because it's objective review [noise]\nNow I Would swear by angels least as the most honorable and write fool and great great review site\nHowever you see her Angie on TV every single day they decided to spend twenty to thirty million dollars on advertising campaign and do you know who they squeezing for this money\nBusiness owners they not asking you who signs in the review to pay anything but they go off to business owners telling them you want a better exposure you want a better position you want a better ... on our side shell out some bucks or else it will be pushed to the back of their own imagined that\nThat's a view that's what you count this whole thing became so insane such a big business that nothing throws full is left there don't get don't get put into that and like ... always stay curious stay informed state interest and stay liquid\nWell Aaron once again you drop some serious inside knowledge on the\nHistory of Islam especially with the food and the Shiites and as well as Yelp which you talked about a couple of months ago

and and really take a moment when I say this just reflect you know what they're not talking about Russian hacking sir I haven't heard anyone talk about Russian hacking about three weeks put bury that it's done that's old news now that's a whole new you know\nNo one's talking about a guy called Muller he he was he talking about him yeah he mark I can't get arrested down he can't get a job that I Know what I'm saying is heavily\nMentions a is what the doctor Blasey Ford showed up and she had the story I don't want to be here I'm afraid I Want it to testify I didn't want to be identified\nYou know a poor her but what she wanted she sent that letter to a story to her congresswoman and the Washington Post and what she was hoping was that it would find its way into the record\nAnd that the White House seeing that there was this accusation out there would just move on Kavanaugh [noise] yeah so what she wanted was a secret accusation right an anonymous just like guilt without anybody hearing about it are finding out about it just move on to somebody else that scary\nMaybe defend the way it works ... was it didn't work that you know for her area that in the record in someone like for her oh I just wanted to knock him off the bench ... like politically on\nIt I mean if what her accusations are are are true I mean you can understand her act why wait we said three important words there\nIf and our true if and our children should ever arose you would have heard of accusations were heard\nAnd process and ultimately they did not make the difference he was confirmed if she got what she wanted he would've been bypassed just to avoid the trouble just silent which is which is stolen ask I mean it's like\nIt's just a moment ... below ... as what happened in the system worked in his favor\n... is this an example of that after the Supreme Court justices that my right he is so he is what I'm saying is that ... you know and fortunately or unfortunately for others\nIn the system works you miss way\nAs a victim\nIt didn't matter what she said if she was ... that said that she was sick\nBut this is too important points you know issued a victim and I think you heard her story I think a lot of people who said that she had a credible story resonated that it does seem if you piece it all together and you give some deference to the passage of time it\nDoes seem that something's happened right but but the fact that something happened and the fact that someone committed something that was unforgivable and possibly illegal ... that that's\nAn important point about being able to tie it back to Kevin especially when the ... for individuals that gene named\nAll said weren't there didn't happen\nEven harder to get half of whom went so far as to say I am inclined to believe her and if she says it happened it happened so some of these sympathetic firmly sympathetic but it wasn't me I don't know Brett Kavanaugh from anyone I I don't know what else they did which just\nJust not widely reported she has this sort of vague somewhat changeable description of the house\nInvestigators went to the house that every suppose that witness grew up in check for ... match anyhow so her her friends Brett Kavanaugh anybody anywhere and so the house doesn't match anything that exists she doesn't know how she got there or how she left or what day of the week it was or whether it was a week a day or a weekend\nAnd the year was even getting a higher resolution under the hard\nPart with these types of attacks and these cases it if you know a traumatic event for the victim and a lot of things do worse off for a ... I mean I Can't ... myself like go into details of how it now like who\nReally kind of other than that ... or who had no matter but what I've heard at least ... over the last few days I mean it's incredibly traumatic event\nThat you know memories get changed ... ... like a lot on the line there's yet that limitation a lot of things get blah and that's why what it is hard to it's it's hard it's hard to come to terms\nWith someone completely forgetting who their attacker was I mean and and and and that's the reason why a lot of folks that when they are attacked\nAnd they see something like that are like this happened they they if they don't if some some of these cases go unreported because of the black\nAnd bring change that trend is changing more and more people are reporting and I think that is a good thing I think the fact that we have much more support out there both with an official channels and outside official channels that is clearly a good ... and I\nBelieve that they I mean because of these ... do this footage and I think there's a big swelled up support coming from ... most of the women in the ... really are you don't get the reporter\nEnough right away so that that information out there and the problem with this this confirmation process is that it it became a trial but it's not a trial this is a bunch of senators they're not judges\nThey've all got massive and obvious ulterior motives they've got political considerations rotted got an election coming up right they're judging a judge to put him on a court that has\nReally far more power than it should I mean it it it has the power to legislate from the bench and they all know that and ... you know it's an impossibly stupid situation where everybody's worst instincts are encouraged and you know at least it's not a trial but at least there was an insistence on\nA procedure that we don't want that counted ... a preponderance of the evidence or beyond a shadow of and that we need some evidence of some kind other than one person saying one thing for thirty six years ago\nAnd this is where the conversation around the process I think put us in a very very bad place with whatever sounded the on all that you have to sit on\nI kept hearing in those last couple of days corroborated evidence we've got Robert of evidence it's not being heard why aren't the FBI interviewing these people with cooperative evidence one of them I heard was that yes there is a witness\nWho couldn't corroborate her story ... and I'm I'm curious so I I read more what what what is this witness Crump this man can corroborate that in two thousand twelve [laughter] she told him about the attack\nThat's not evidence there is another word for the act here say here say here say\nAnd this idea that it's enough for someone to say something that's enough for something to have heard something being said but no one to tie it back down I think who ever\nOrchestrated this I think did Dr Ford huge huge service and something that is incredibly serious in something that is incredibly important that actually took over this process enforced or into that position my I think at about area very sad they talk\nAbout an FBI investigation like it was going to be you know David Caruso in the CSI team come in with lasers and DNA swabs and you know the amazing things were going to be discovered she provided so little to investigate she ... you know there was like no time or place or anything there were four names\nOr a couple of names beyond that act where else do you go and they worked it out and they worked at the other thing that someone was saying in the last twenty four hours before it became clear which way the boat was going to go\nThe FBI's and interviewing doctors in there and they're not interview she was on camera for hours [laughter] that was ... she actually said I have nothing more to say there's nothing more I can contribute that's why\nThere is nothing more to be putting in print the neighbors are phone lines were up in eight six six eight seven zero\nFive seven five to otherwise known as eight six six eight seven zero chaos really we're here live and local for you each and every one of you out here every Sunday night we want to get as many voices on the radio as we can are big talking point this week is it in fact\nI Want to thank you so much Mike calling in from LA for five back now with this this Kavanaugh you know cataclysm got started I was going to predict now this is the first midterm election after Trump's election\nThink the man is good for an October surprise really well I mean the the Republican Party is is poised to do is in North Korea yeah uh and I don't think he'd stand for that so\nI think he's probably got something up his sleep although got a big map in the ... the confirmation fight seems to have mostly done it for him because there's there's a real uh there's so much backlash out there that no one there's a lot more enthusiasm among the ...\n... ... it's funny they went in some way not rallies the GOP if you want to get every registered Republican rally together in a room there's so much disparate belief\nSupreme Court you start talking Supreme Court everyone puts their differences aside wait for the week before the election I I I think he's good for something is going to happen I we got time for one more caller let's hit Rick from Santa Monica we're talking cabin Iraq what are your thoughts\nAre cabinet all the time and let's let's crack open a beer keg where's that attacks so you're happy that Kavanaugh got over the line\nOh you better believe it as a matter of fact I'm going to start drinking beer in his\nHonor and I don't drink absolutely twenty four bears in a case twenty four hours a day here producers like think Kavanaugh for his like little or ... or ... at his confirmation hearing to be a commemorative can of ... for him\nYou know how should we should have a beer after yeah there should\nBe remembered Billie beer or something I have actually ... some special unique Miller time it's not it's they have in our time so where do you think he goes from here Rick he's now is sitting Supreme Court justice what do you see you look at a year or two or five or ten where do you see the country because the cabinet what's his contribution gonna be\nI'll tell you what I think it I think it's a positive effect okay there's a tactic everybody in family law divorce attorneys know if you throw allegations out to hurt the man\nThe judge airs on the side of caution and then the man doesn't get to see the kids and then you go in court ask for more money because my husband isn't seeing the kids and there's a lot of ethics that go on this was a tactic that just got blown up everybody knows it and I think the tactic is not going to be used as wildly\nAs it has been added went forward\nI wrote I have a boilerplate everybody has a boiler plate and boilerplate start used and what you do you sit down with somebody and you say never never to doesn't apply you cross it out number three is exactly what you're talking about you discuss it and you either leave it exactly the same or\nHe you know tweak it a little bit and this is outlaw works the boilerplate that she uses a declaration is almost exactly what I teach the seminars the people doing family live like wow\nI run domestic violence restraining order clinics and I work with we are women that have been abused some men but mostly women a lot of its drug and alcohol of\nRye ever lost their jobs right I'd I've done my own poll cause I'm writing a book but I've done my own poll up all the people at work but none of the women that had serious issues women that have been\nIn the hospital women that have really been abused women have been kidnapped and this kind of stuff\nNone of them believe this woman ... none of them and there are so many issues going on in here I really think she should be investigated because what you're going to find out is I Believe this was created the boilerplate she use what came from a seminar\nThat I did for the Democratic party because what they want to do a show that they're only good the women\nAnd you know there's a lot of a um [noise] you know county and city things that are done or clinics are paid for subsidized by ... system\nSo you know this came right out of what am I seminars other domestic ... clinic providers used similar ones this was which was not a heartfelt a ... you know woman that was coming forward\nWell I have a question for you but what why why would she opened herself to such like ... we were ridiculing and expect to be called ... and all he wanted to she wanted to put a letter in she wanted as Dave said in the last time and she just wanted them passed over glide peaks is the way I had ... witnesses ... like that too I mean why would you open a millionaire\nNow she's got a girl funding page and pulled and a half a million dollars she put her in her pocket she Cindy she had of the Democratic party I think she thought she was going to be a hero and you set it exactly she thought that she could do this you know just\nA ... ... ... light like flying
