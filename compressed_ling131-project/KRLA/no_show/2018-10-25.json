very targeted\nTowards maybe CNN by the Clintons a a George Soros the Obamas in Washington potentially Debbie Wasserman Schultz is a Florida State office\nAs well uh safely none of these devices exploded no one has been injured\nA security measures that have been put in place have been have worked so far we pray that they continue to do so and let me just say if it's the final time we address it on air today uh we can dip in the fullest extent this kind of activity especially it appears some somehow motivated just by putting these leaks together\nIdeologically there's no place for that the United states we can have vigorous discourse\nWe do not do this to each other and whoever or if it's a group of people who is behind this should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law be put behind bars for very serious violations of crime\nIn the United states uh back to the phones we go we're talking about this issue with the caravan only Thirteen Days after the midterm elections you cannot again you just can't\nAh\nI Try to say that well you know tried to divide a I guess divorce the issue of the midterm elections\nAnd the care of an issue and the immigration issue it's all coming to a head at the same time by the way NBC News reporter used a suspicious package was also intercepted it was addressed a former attorney general holder this is unacceptable folks\nAh I don't care what kind of politics you have\nThis is unacceptable as an organization that also has received these kinds of packages before\nI'm a ... it's it's always not acceptable regardless of what side of the ... at all it's criminal you should be prosecuted er and er and they get thanks to our law enforcement officials and those officials who who intercept these packages or before they make it a two are there to did\nTargets and thankfully that so far has been what is happening today let's talk about the caravan a lot of calls can we get about that\nLet's go to Chris did California online for crystal welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nAnd well thank you for taking my call I my comment is I I don't see any ... by\nGetting our cable sent to the border and I think the hippie my question is I read him for about a state governors type ... and you know\n... ... what can it anything Jerry Brown do here in California to keep my temple ... hit reading these people\nCome across that border [noise]\nI have to stay out of the way maybe let his as state guard assist the national guard or any other U.S forces of border patrol that were necessary\nUh instead of letting politics or a dominate his decision making unfortunately I think there are two days out from mid term elections\nI'm at a very liberal a governor is likely not going to to make those decisions so I think at best he could stay out of the way\nLet a local law enforcement there in California do the right thing where she would the federal government or who is there to provide the maid support when it comes to our border it's the federal government\nOr is it that a defense our border and also deals with situations at the border but but yeah I could I I see what you're going with is what could California's governor do\nAt some of the state government officials there who are very liberal do to try and help a ... and even encourage these kind of care of ads in the future and I think that's a serious problem\nLet me go to a Andy On that and they just they had been an anti first the idea that politicians we looked up the group behind this they're based in Oakland, California does surprise there and it's a village Without Borders is what it translates to take your do they should they organized these caravans right out of California\nRight now I agree with what you said your and the governor of California needs to stay out of this right now he is\nA very left leaning political a person in the in the country as\nA and behind the California sanctuary state ideas sanctuary cities let everybody come in open borders no restrictions whatsoever on immigration come on come all that is not the attitude of the administration nor should it be\nA and I think that the best thing for a brown and and those who support his position is to stay out of this and allow the president the United states who is really the chief protector of the borders of the United states the executive branch of government or do what it has to do right now in the face of this tidal wave of humanity that's coming in\nWe're taking calls at one hundred and sixty four thirty one ten but I Do want to go to say a minute because than I think we're just too close to election day\nOr two the bitter of election and people are voting all over the country already right now a casting votes were see higher turnout than before of early voting or what do you think the impact this has all the midterm elections I mean this is a top issue for President Trump and a congressional Republicans\nWill join I already think it played a major role in the election of President Trump's he ran on a on securing the border on building a wall on having a proper system for which to admit people legally and also keep people out who are trying to cross illegally so\nJordan that happened without this caravan being you know in the news on election day I think it is going to be one of the primary deciding factor is uh you know all races and Senate races in in house races\nBob is doing panic because if he got in mind that there may feel really hadn't been such a Sam Darnell family wouldn't be too far more right now\nBlaming Bob for that but if you can turn around and get the Senate back in jail Vance richer the house stays under control Kevin McCarthy all will be forgiven for ma serious job thank you [noise]\nYou know I'm not a pastor I'm not a preacher I'm not a ... I'm not a rabbi I'm not a holy man so I I Can't divine all of God's intentions but\nPart of me really does wonder if this isn't punishment for for bearing false witness Hugh Hewitt ... what happened to you that's that's where we are here I think God was watching\nHe's listening to bear false witness about Sam Darnell bear false witness about Becker may feel and yes there is penance being had here when it's in the form of your voice right now or good morning do\nThank you for joining us by France or as you heard the great here's you at a order and stumble and grumble through through that horrific laryngitis and the uh the rest of what he was dealing with I uncovered the lie from Cleveland, Ohio\nNumber one the rock and roll capital of the world and number two the home\nOf my pain free really factor dot com studios of am fourteen twenty the answer will be with you this morning ticking through the latest news of the day and there is a a lot of it as you were at rest and recuperate from his Pennsylvania tour of Pittsburgh in Philadelphia a\nLot to get to today the president of the United states case you missed this the president of the United states says he is a nationalist and he says this proudly\nAnd the left is calling him a racist for my goodness gracious I don't know exactly how it all turned this way\nBut here we are where you can't even express simple um feelings of patriotism and putting America before putting people of other countries first\nBut that's where the president is the president proudly and loudly declared edits Houston rally a couple of nights ago that he is a national is not a global list very simple comparing globalism to nationalism you can be globe first in your country takes a backseat\nOr you can be ... first your country in the driver's seat I put the concerns of Americans first that's nationalism\nBut that's not what the American Left wants you to believe the American laughed personified I think in some ways by CNN's glory a grabbing a grandstanding attention hound Jemma Costa actually saying to the president of the United states\nRather than just a follow up on your comments about being a nationalist there is a concern that you are sending coded language for a dog whistle to some Americans out there that what you really mean is that you're a white\nNational I've never heard that I cannot imagine that your main nationalist I never heard that theory about being a nationalist I've heard them all but I'm somebody that loves our country\n[noise] I'm somebody that loves our country what a horrific thing to be an to express it a such a such a thing so vocally and so proudly in front of thousands and thousands of people at Toyota Center in Houston with millions more watching around the country\nWhat a terrible thing to present myself as a national as someone who is nation first\nSomeone who is not globe first [noise]\nYou know it's it's one thing for the American left and the American left is in the media to try and use President Trump's slips of the tongue against him\nTo use his you know ... and let's look especially when the president start speaking ... a lotta time she'll just go a little too far he'll be a little exaggerated he'll he'll be use a little hyperbole\nHe'll use the ... the form of words in a virtually you know in in far too many situations I almost did it myself I almost every situation that's what the president and they'll take those things a little twist them to try to make it means something that it doesn't mean it's one thing when he slips but when he makes a very direct statement\nSuch as I Am a national us to think that the president is dumb enough to be sending a quote unquote coded message to all of the white nationalist that may exist in the United states\nIn whatever form there are and by the way I don't have any idea how I don't think there's that many\nNow are there white racist white nationalists in the United states yeah\nJust like there are black I don't recall the nationalist but just like there are a black Americans are African Americans who are racist against white people\nAnd who use ah you know that your whatever whatever positions of power that come from a groups and numbers and strength in order to try to intimidate I mean all we have to do is really go back to presidential elections and you know twenty twelve with\nA Black Panther leaders intimidating voters at polling places in Philadelphia and then being excuse for it by the Eric Holder department of justice\nYes there are people have various races in the United states who are\nRacist but to\nTake the president's words and to think that he's dumb enough and I know they don't think too highly those who hate the president I don't I don't think too highly of the president's ah intelligence quotient\nHis IQ or they think he's done but to think that he's dumb enough to send a message to white nationalist that I'm One of view wink wink\nWith him I or watching but that's what they want you to believe\nAnd this is the kind of conversation they have on CNN\n[noise] that's right and it's and I think that's why the the question about why the president keeps labeling himself a nationalist is so important I pressed him on this in the oval office asked him who are you trying to say that you're a white nationalist what about these concerns out there that your dog whistling to your base that you're sending the what I\nWould I Would I wouldn't really like before I play the rest of that clip from Jim Acosta bond with Anderson Cooper [noise] I I Would like to know how that comes out of the blue what well then I asked her I directly do you mean to say you're a white\nNationalist that ... the least suggestive of the power of that is just it's it's in comprehensible I mean honestly I\nMean if someone says I don't know and I'm and I'm kind of spit balling here but it but if someone says I'm a I don't know I like trees\nOr do they do you mean that you are a lot to do mean that you are at a vegan because you said you liked trees ah no I don't I just like trees there pretty\nOh does that mean that you are some sort of I literally making something up as I go here if you if you say anything about you can just make a suggestive\nLead into something else because you said you are this does is also mean your that well because he said you're a nationalist what you mean by the way the president was not ambiguous in Houston He said clearly compared to global ...\nIs a global as a means people put the globe first nationalism it means I put my country first I put my country for there is no ambiguity there to then say well when you said the word nationalist did you mean white nationalist\nIt's just such a rich and a stretch and and and embarrassing quite frankly even for Jim Acosta even for Jim Acosta to do that at that point in time in front of the president and then to go on a Anderson Cooper in double downloaded\nMessages to your base and he says well I haven't heard a theory about that ah and then he went on to say well you know there are trade issues and and so on as to why he he uh is attaching this label to himself they understand when you're demonizing immigrants migrants coming up\nHere we go now let's get added to get to see again people want you know I I ... I I'm not a fan of the president's tweeting a lot of the time and I know you kind of likes to really shine a spotlight on it every time he tweets we will announce the president of the United states has tweeted and will play a little jingle I'm a reader that will get a\nKick out of it sometimes it'll be great for analysis sometimes it'll be just you know kind of an eye roll I'm not a huge fan of the president's tweeting in a lot of cases I'm really not but I have to tell you I Am really really growing more and more supportive of his tweets about the dishonest bake media\nI really am now you have Jim Acosta saying you said you're a national is did you mean white nationalist\nHe said no I'm Talking about trade deals I put America First trade deals but but hard demonizing the big migrant caravan that's coming here you mean be thousands and thousands of people marching under a foreign flag and pledging to invade the United states in violation of our laws yeah I kind of don't like that\nBut you're demonizing them as criminals well that's because there are some criminals in that hoard some of the migrants who are walking along in that caravan habit admitted yes there are criminals among us\nBut they use everything they can to try to demonize is president I'm going to say this is the fact that President Trump now sits with the forty seven percent approval rating\nAccording to the last ah NBC washing or Wall Street journal poll the fact that he is at forty seven percent which which is actually two points higher than we're Brock Obama was at the mid term in twenty ten of his first term\nDespite this incessant non stop criticism from the left and the fabricated imagined I'm wrong doings that the left tries to attached to him and when I say the left I mean the media I don't mean just from Tom presidency and see\nHonestly\nCrazy Hirono you can't make statements like that and it can lead to a little thing in the first care ... any of these ... these are not to talk\nWith us by phone line it's racism\nBasically if I may add ... ... like the family the ferry wow what he's talking about\nEven if an anti Semitic and it's white supremacists to say

the United states as president of the United states is fighting for you as an American first why\nBecause as he said and I talked to yesterday I spoke on my local show in Cleveland to a\nDoctor Sebastian Gorka and I brought up the president's nationalist comment and talked about how proud I was with him for saying that that I Am ... I Am a nationalist rather than a global is and I asked Sebastian Gorka would have thought about that and he said you know one of the proudest moments that I had from the time that I served as an advisor to the president last year\nWas when he was discussing the Paris climate accord which he so wisely pulled us out of and he said I was elected by the people of Pittsburgh not the people of Paris\nAnd and that's the point that is exactly correct he's going to represent the people of Pittsburgh and he's going to represent the people of the United states before he concerns himself with the with the issues of people around the globe and that is exactly what he was elected to do\nNow as a senator or a Mazie crazy a crazy Mazie Hirono aye wants to continue to say he's demonizing immigrants he's demonizing these people want to come to the United states for a better life in violation by the way of American immigration law while he demonize them\nBut she ... the pastor's being was being very sensitive and to his great credit but there's also a function of our time\nAnd the Megan Kelly situation while obviously very very different is related in my opinion we have become ... walkers on egg shells in our society\n\nIt is it is a wonderful thing I I have always try to walk around with my wife say anything that that offends this person and uh it's a monitor built into me\n\nBut every good things can go too far it's one thing not to gratuitously insults somebody and it's another to have to walk on eggshells with with members of every other group that in your own\n\n... it's it it makes for on the natural relationships\n\nIf you can't joke around and if you if you can't say what's on your mind\nIt's that's not that's not an achievement against racism or anti Semitism or other forms of bigotry some the cheap and\nIt's it's a form of\nHyper sensitivity bordering on nonsense and an unnatural miss if I Can't talk to you a member of a different group than me\nNaturally when I mean no malice and that's key if I mean malice then it ends of the issue if you think I mean malice than do listen than I should be I should be extradited from your wife and I don't mean identity anybody\n\nBut if there isn't malice intended to them then what is the ... ... what is the hyper sensitivity it's it just means I Can't talk to you naturally\n\nThen that's what that's what the left because it's always me to cause you see it's it's it's that they've got to be fighting some some new evil why they're micro aggressions because they acknowledge there's so little real racism in society they have to make it up\nOh you didn't mean it but you really are are you really are racist\n\nSo all it does is make it harder to talk men to women women to man well especially men to women 'cause ... you know you can insult the Mad Men are insulted constantly there on a daily basis men or men or men or men or men or if you want say women are then it's it's over\n\nYou were a hater you were big if you're ... but you could say men are till till the cows come home\n\nSo we're we're breathing on natural this is not this is not a an advance in relations between different groups it's it's a deterioration the issue is too\nAs I wrote in my column a couple of weeks ago that was that a lot of people seem to enjoy than they should I spoke of my time at the Rotary Club and will how a New America was exceptional in my in my mid twenties when I joined the ...
