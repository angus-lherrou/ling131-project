M Ms ... and uh the the client of a a sweat Nick missed what Nick declined uh Michael ... they come forward\nSo now you're saying that it's not just allegations of what's their sexual assault which will be serious and another itself obviously\nBut now it's also a judicial temperament credibility did he make false statements under oath about his activities in college this is where I assume you're never going to get those that are opposed to his nomination\nOn board with him what you're trying here to do with the Republicans are trying to do is can they hold three senators flake\nBeing one of them a senator Collins and Murkowski that's what they that's where the focus is right now yeah absolutely\nIt's you're talking about a handful of senators if this is going to move forward that too is important um because it's either I think it's it very clear those those those handful vote over and then I think you get maybe a couple of Democrats yeah or the nomination goes down\nAnd the question also would be is while we're talking about this let's be honest or will there ever be a vote\n'em or will the nomination would be pulled that's also a political calculation right now it appears I'll go say a bit of Washington that it appears that we're heading towards the vote\nEven if it's even if it's like the health care I compared to like that situation if they like the health care vote where um we didn't know until the late Senator John McCain voted where it was going I mean but they decided to have the vote\nAnd and uh and things change I Would imagine though unlike that than this is somewhat different I Can't imagine a college or Murkowski not putting out their statement before they voted 'cause this is so serious what do you think\nThat I I think I think that's a great comparison to her and I think there are a bunch of senators and the Democrat side of the aisle probably senator Manchin center high camp and senator Donnelly who don't want to take this vote so you know you have to ask the question to the very end whether or not it's called I agree with you and senator Collins and Murkowski Senator Flake as well by the way because remember before consideration\nIn committee he did put out a statement so I think they will make a statement one way or another\nBut I come back to this bottom line there's more information coming out the president's imported more information coming out at the end of the day the constitution gives the Senate the duty to vote yes or a yes or no on a nominee I think they need to take that but you're going to have that information they should take\nThe vote well here's what but here's what I go back to I think this was you've seen this in three phases here Harry this is what I'm looking at you gotta repay scenario first was judicial philosophy they couldn't really\nThey they disagreed with it those left of center but they knew that that was not a disqualify her right right so they that that didn't work then you had delayed allegations regarding the sexual assaults serious they have a hearing on that reopen the hearing that ... that space to of this I Would say and that goes and ... and it's kind of a drawl last week I mean it was\nThere were allegations\nThere is no credible cooperating evidence of that time but Senator Flake then says I Want the FBI to investigate the the\nFBI investigation that is the president now says should be a comprehensive\nNow I'm starting to see it's not so much and not that it's not about the allegations on sexual assault\nBut now it's about veracity under oath of what he did in college or didn't do in college and how we're perceived as issues so now you're moving into what I call the three of this and the problem is time in Washington is never you know the longer it goes the better it gets is not usually how Washington works\nAbsolutely knew lived up to northern Virginia for a long time you know that absolutely so\nIf you look at the latest round of attacks on judge count as a judge Kavanaugh essentially they're grounded in his performance or the last week in defending himself and defending his family\nAnd so now some Democrats including professor Larry tribe are arguing\nThat judge Kavanaugh has this qualifies himself even if he were to be confirmed yeah why because he attempted to defend his family against arguably scoreless attacks\nOn and so uh Larry tribe argues judge ... dress just Kavanaugh if confirmed could not operate as a justice\nOf the United the clinical fate that's a phase for attack yes his pay more for attack is if he gets in what can they do to cabin him whether it's\nYour course the recusing is completely up to the justice there's no standard that the judge justice of the Supreme Court they decide if they should recuse or not not some panel not some judicial ... ethics charges\nBut they're trying to cap it this way they got this it's a multi prong attack now with a strategy of what you got to give them credit they're they're they're not they're not smart enough to go ahead and you know I mean they're doing a great job of doing what they set out to do and that's to resist\nBecause for Kavanaugh's nomination delay means defeat\nYeah yeah I Would just remind people that Elena Kagan came straight out of the Obama administration on to the Supreme Court\nAnd and did not recused herself on the health care case say right and so uh that does that and it was handled by her office suggested her for her up to her it's up to her so they can they can complain all they want\nA but guess what if it's the highest court in the land ... you've lost your place um art that's it I mean there's nowhere else to go now I I Do think that I don't like to use the word I think that would be\nA level five impeach if but they would have to have again they'd have to super majorities they're not there yet but I think that the question is\nLike for most Supreme Court justices even controversial let's say justice Kavanaugh is confirmed\nCase could further they try to look this up for a little bit longer in two years from now like is this going to be what people were electing a president over where we have another presidential election\nAre ... most people can't name a district court a Supreme Court justice not alone picked him out of a group of pictures now they might be able to pick Brett Kavanaugh for a few years yeah but ask them for three years from now if they can question\nNo probably not so let me as saying give us the ... under best case scenario what's the timeframe there which and the realistic timeframe or is that I should say what is it realistic it well the Senate\nDebating unrelated bill right now Jay and they cannot get off of that bill until tomorrow night so the earliest the leader McConnell can file cloture would be tomorrow night which would mean it would set up the cloture vote for friday more down that we knew that we report by tonight\nWell by tomorrow night Mara nights when they get down to the ... other bell right so then you have to have the intervening day according to rule twenty two you get the cloture vote on friday morning and then you have to have that that thirty hours of debate that we all know about food set up a final confirmation vote Jay for\nAs early as Saturday Night so friday morning for cloture Saturday Night for final confirmation that's really the fastest timeline you could have here\nIs a Saturday Night the earliest now and there's a ... than Blumenthal is already saying delayed delayed or else go ahead and take a phone call one eight hundred sixty\nFour thirty one time we get some call yeah right to the phones or we go a Christ is calling from California all live three crystal welcome to Jay ...\nGuy let let every all that and ... thanks I quit for like ... ... since the president already ... ... ... ... ... ... go longer\nFor like ... and ... says judge Kaplan I had only play again for it whether or not he get the ... or ...\nWell on the on the question on timeframe so the FBI's got at the president said he wants to return than a week they are capable of doing that Andy that I have the resources available to do something that's not a criminal investigation oh they're not interview and and but they're not trying to recreate the crime scene there trying to find you know the truth here as to what allegations are\nCorrect that well that's why I think it's moved that's why I think\nA thin is has moved into ... looking at worst phase one was again when we were just reach database one judicial qualifications judicial philosophy he pass the test reluctantly by the Democrats buddy pass it then they go on the attack\nThey attack when it comes to sexual assault serious hearings open up that goes forward\nInconclusive no cooperating evidence so kind of been inconclusive so what do they go face three now statements he said under oath may not have been through there is a veracity issue that and I think we're faced three their space for it it gets worse than that but we're basically right now but how do you see it and do you think that both after all you said you think the boats going to happen is he going to be confirmed\nI I think the vote will happen I think there's a greater chance than not that he will be confirmed David look just underscore the point you just made I think if it goes past this week you have crystal clear evidence\nThat what is being pursued here is not the truth I mean because you were just a matter of days ago that Chris Coons and Jeff Flake made this deal that said look we're ready to make our decision if you get the FBI one week\nTo look at these allegations then we'll have the information that we need to make a vote or J. if that goalpost it's changed again I Will tell you a certain due to the United States Senate does the detractors of Brett Kavanaugh are not looking for truth or evidence on which to base their decision\nThey just never want to take the vote so I Do think the voters going to happen and I will tell you that if it doesn't happen I think there is a commitment inside the United States Senate to just delaying until the nominee has withdrawn and frankly I think that's an affront to the constitution\nYou think that as an ... you think that's a possibility here\nYeah yes it's a possibility but I did the scheduling to the voters up to one person and that's leader McConnell I think\nHe knew we had that you sent over time you know we don't because we don't have culture\nWe don't you will know the answer to that tomorrow night Jay when the FAA builds finished if leader McConnell files cloture tomorrow night I think\nYou can do they will close up without a vi investigation complete without the three oh Tucson beard\nHe could but I don't think he will but basically you need three days after finally closure before\nYou hear the Bahamas or you can go right into next week yeah I mean they just look at it this I\nMean everything has to line up perfectly for this to go to be done this week you\nYou're absolutely correct I mean that's really where we are ... meantime of course the Democrats are coming up with more and more fresh allegations which may not necessarily be grounded in any fact\nSorry we're taking a break up you don't get the full hour the program governor ACL Jay dot org or any of our multiple

lie\nBut here's Rafael out for\nOn your own travel at all here on this or this week\nHere on this for us we\nHad no chief counsel for the American Center for Law Justice secular\nSo let me give you a sense of where it is a as you on the second half hour of the broadcast I I'm looking to see now in phases and I this is something I've worked on last night in this morning but I think this is where it is\nPhase one of his um the confirmation was judicial philosophy and he passed it reluctantly by the Democrats they're not going to vote for maybe a few on the floor will\nBut he you could argue with the judicial philosophy as judicial capability his qualifications to be a judge that did not work then you get the last minute eleventh hour base to\nAttacks on allegations of sexual of salt it starts with Dr Ford it ends up to others so you have faced too and that expands out at base to as ... all these other\nAllegations against him so there are serious allegations they've got to be investigated president authorizes an FBI check after three Republican said no\nI'm we're not going to vote on him until you have a full FBI investigation he authorizes like but his words president's word comprehensive a investigation\nBackground that's background check not a criminal case that space to\nThen you're starting to see now I think we're in a phase three based or he's a little bit different they're not so much going to find it looks like cooperating evidence on the sexual assault or at least so far they haven't so what do they go to where their statements that judge Kavanaugh made under oath that maybe were false misconstrued basically a a what we would call it a thousand one violation if it was a federal case\nA a false statement to me that's where it is their space three and then there's a face for we're not at base for yet but we're clearly and phase three and delay his defeat I think that is what any kind of I said earlier and that fits right in with the scenario that I'm putting together and that's exactly where I think there's cases right now if I was looking at this was a lawyer in charge of this\nI Would say you're in the story\nAnd the way you respond to phrase space three is getting his FBI investigation over with\nRapidly put thoroughly making do what they have the capabilities and vote yes or no if it's no it's no if it's just a jets get the process over with now they're telling me that he's up there right now dealing with the staff that it's not like it there's a chance it's this my friday but that's not a guaranteed by any stretch of anyone's\nImagination yeah I think the sense that I'm getting Jay is the Senate Republicans believe that Senate Democrats have as many phases if we want to call them that as they will allow them to have so I think leader McConnell has decided this is the last one senator tuned in Senator Flake made a deal for this FBI investigation and when that runs its course there will be a vote I Do think that's accurate Jay\nBut look if Senate Republicans decide not to to force it through and I think Senate Democrats will bring as many of these stages forward as they allow\nThey get into phase for I think they form becomes very difficult phase for becomes not only it's it's ... it's a ... that's what happens in pays for here it becomes a pile on an ... you know face so if the Republicans are trying to get the nominee confirmed and if they're willing to wait for the FBI investigates which is supposed to be done expeditiously get it done in both because we go to face for I don't see how this goes forward\nI think that's correct so it's important to know too much violence\nThere is really only an audience of about five individual that are really important\nFree moderate Republicans to moderate Democrats and I think all five are wavering at this particular point and so if we go to face for a that may be enough to cause the collapse what are you a nomination\nPolitically here was the FBI airport will will come out this was the deadline is friday the votes so that would trigger the time to have thirty hours and all this a procedure that must go on\nA that will be very telling it itself it should be enough for us to to know um if the votes are going to be there or not I mean that that's it I mean that they're going to be there or not based off this I don't believe there should be any more uh\nFBI investigation pass this of I don't think that there should be any more testimony [noise]\nUh there should not be for me if I were just hearing or anything like that it is they gave it over to the FBI Congress\nAnd but we can only afford the Republicans to lose one\nAnd I do think that the sands analysis that the that the senator Collins is the most likely to vote for the nomination is is accurate but don't count on Jeff Flake and don't count on Murkowski\nI mean this is someone who says uh\nUh now he keeps getting rattled all these reporters say he's read all these routes even when they tried to get his confirmation and what did you mean that yeah we can't have that kind of parts of the ship out of the court and he tried to say rushed away by handlers being rattled his house reported um I wasn't referring to him I mean\nYeah this is again this is why some of the air this is where I can throw a heads up his your watch on Facebook and parents go because you cannot figure out a these shows will take another call before we get to the brakes people but hold on a Robert calling from New Jersey on line three Robert welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\n[laughter] thank you for taking my call question we knew there would be more allegations ... my question is the FBI or they fail to investigate or interview all of them or can they draw the line\nYou know the ... and the FBI does not have to investigate every single name that is put forward I mean you could give a two hundred names and to go out and do that that doesn't make sense what they need to do what they do is their supervisors say these are the most viable the most critical persons that need to be investigated because of their allegations are there are potential knowledge\nOf what Kavanaugh's did or didn't do while he was at Yale or other places and this is what and then they cut it off and then because there was a time constrained here I Hope\nUh by tomorrow night Wednesday so it's not an open ended let's just go on and investigated for the next you know nine months and see what happens so the there are constraints on the FBI based on the rule of reason\nAll right um we've only got a
