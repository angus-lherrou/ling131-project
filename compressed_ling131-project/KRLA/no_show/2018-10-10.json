we radio dot com\nAM eight Seventy the actor\n[noise]\nWe decided to stay away from domestic politics for a day stay away from the Supreme Court and focus on a case in another Supreme Court and that's the Supreme\nCourt or Pakistan that we've been involved in the American Center for Law Justice for a long time we have an officer lower Pakistan and there is a case involving a Christian Woman named uh she a baby and she has been charged and sentenced to death\nFor blasphemy let me go first to skip past year senior counsel international expert bless me every one of these cases we've been involved in skip there's always something like a blast recharge that's made or level\nAbsolutely and this was a a a charge that is leveled very often as a way of getting back at somebody so we have a situation where if you have an enmity to somebody especially a Christian which are second class citizens in Pakistan\nIf you have a route with them some argument very often they will allege bless me and blasphemy is a death penalty case if you're convicted last but you're supposed to get the death penalty so what that does that intimidates people and they normally\nAre are so afraid of that that they will give the Muslims what they want so this is exactly the situation we're in countering here and let's remember this poor woman has been in jail since two thousand nine south twenty eight teams or she's been in jail waiting through the appellate process for nine years\nCharged again would last me for offering a cup of water to Muslim co workers the person that made the charge against ... was considered a prayer leader and the mom from this particular village he doesn't actually appear at the hearings and did not give evidence that\nIf judge pointed that issue out on now these pressure these judges are under our it's just a mess we are going to answer your questions by the way up your own pace looking parents could you could either call us at one eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten\nOr get your comments in will answer him or social media team is monitoring those right now we'll take your calls at one eight hundred sixty four three one one photograph and been in office in Washington DC we have raised this case Pakistan as an ally of the United states what's been the Washington response here\nWell this has been a multi year effort for us Jay both internationally in here domestically domestically the lead in this effort in the United States Congress is being led by Senator Rand Paul who has a resolution called asked Raz one o seven it demands Pakistan release a sea of BBN reform its blasphemy laws\nOr the important thing here about this resolution is a bipartisan nature Sen Paul has eight cosponsors on a\nFour of them are Democrats and they really range across the spectrum Sen Cruz senator bald with an dinner Durban in senator Manchin had joined with him in that effort\nYou know all through the day we would love the United States Senate to move this piece or as a this resolution of course the United states can't end in itself a mandate that Pakistan release her though that's why we've taken the human rights council I Know we'll talk about that in a minute but here in Washington the tip of the sphere is this resolution from Senator Rand Paul\nHere's what's interesting go back to the facts on this for a moment to hurry are\nIt says one of the chief justice said the witness testimony did not state that she had used blasphemous language for the holy Koran he said no black black was words were used at all or seeing her statement said that she could not even conceive of committing blast I mean that's what the lawyer said the chief justice seems was wondering where all the so called evidence was Jerry are\nRight and and and that's one of the most important thing that I think what happened today was the justices were looking for evidence and the other side's attorney actually started when when he saw that the justices weren't convinced\nBy the allegations he started courting the chronic versus and the justice is stopped him and he they told him they said look that we understand that that's the sanctity of the prophet is it is important but that's not what what's going on here we need evidence we're looking for evidence you have to prove that she's guilty of a crime\nSo it's interesting we got a a a Roseanne on Facebook by the way if you've got comments get them into our social media team looking at those uh we're taking your calls as well and eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten and if you're praying for a sea of baby let us know that pray for those judges to\nVery very important to pray for the judges involved in this having the sharing was high risk in the international community step in\nOr is this really a Pakistani governing issues is Rosanna well there there's both the there is international\nPressure being put on both or going to get to the un ... in a moment with a ... Bennett who is are are designated representative to the United nations for the European Central injustice our European affiliate uh bought a international community pressure is the reason to see a bb is alive\nWe have found it time and time again with these cases professor Hutchinson that keeping international pressure off is what keeps these people live\nAbsolutely so international community pressure is absolutely necessary absolutely essential to maintain the life of a ... a bb\nUh it's clear beyond question that there are many people within the Pakistani community who are prepared to allow these blasphemy charges to go forward with out evidence as a way of course in the minority Christian population within their country\nAnd I think it's absolutely essential for westerners for people from all over the world to mobilize against this effort if we're going to sustain a sea it'd be nice life and sustain the lives of Christians where ever they are throughout the world\n... let me ask you this is our international law expert here and the ... runs or international legal group give me your sense of the nature scope and the importance of the state obviously we're fighting for this woman's life so you there's nothing more important but this blasphemy issue is he really serious problem on a global scale\nIt really is for instance even in Pakistan we have determined that when you can get a fair trial in Pakistan provide that the issue is not one of these very sensitive\nIssues like last Sunday so this is a problem we have to recall the twenty eleven the former governor of one of the states came out in support about see a baby and he was assassinated because he just took the sand saying that she wasn't getting a fair trial so the pressure on the judge has this amazing\nNow what they are what the international Islamic community though is concerned about is that this type of thing can bring discredit upon his law and I and I think they're as concerned about that as anything else and therefore the outside world needs to race and keep the pressure on so that we say this is not what you claim Islam to be\nBut look why as we look and see what happens in Pakistan we see this law being misused of being applied primarily either as to to get a vendetta against somebody or to keep down the minority populations so we have to keep pressure on them so that uh her name as possibly\nA before the government of Pakistan and before the courts of Pakistan so they will operate in the correct way\nAs I said we're taking comments coming in from Facebooking periscope as well as your number of calls at one hundred sixty four thirty one and maybe it on Facebook wrote this can the u._s. put pressure on Pakistan withholding international aid than [noise]\nUh yes the answer is yes and we've asked for that on this case in a number of others Pakistan actually gay as one of the largest recipients of us\nForeign aid make humid a right to have long been something to the United States Congress has done a poor job of of of drawing money down on for Jay we have consistently said if you want to be an ally the United states human rights especially agree just violations like this one\nShould be one of the criteria to continue seeing those dollars Jay we will make that request again next year we think that this should be something that should cost Pakistan ah USA\nJerry I'm feeling a lot of people I'm looking at some of the Facebooking periscope feed is coming up before me a lot of people saying they're going to pray for the judges let's skip mentioned that the governor that came out in favor of a C a baby was assassinated what's the pressure like on these judges\nWell just by looking at today's hearing there were a lot of Muslim clerics present in the court I just received an email from a from our office there in which they have told me that\nA Pakistani Muslim group has released a video in which they have noticed this uh this hearing and they are saying that ...\nThat these judges are are open to releasing her and and listening to even listening to the appeal was horrendous for them and they have released that video asking for death penalty for her and even against the judges or that they are very angry at the job just to even hear the appeal\nI don't know if we have the hash tag ... we do I want to show people what's going on on on the social media platforms right now by Muslim radicals that are trying to make this case um they want to see the death penalty look take a look on on the screen I mean this is this tells you what's going on\nAnd uh I mean ... that's called\nI mean there you have a nice started showing up on my feet over the weekend as we were starting to promote the case\nOr we'd been involved in this case for many many years and I ... it's there's always been some of this but I think it's fair to say well it's never been at this this is the highest level of\nSocial media interaction coming out of it looks like Pakistan or certainly um they're they're using Arabic uh and sometimes in English sometimes appropriately the English sometimes not but clearly they're trying to make a point here so what what's your what's your hair ER is saying\nA ... is it the judges are under incredible amount of stress\nAbsolutely and I looked like they want to do the right thing\nI think they do and I think what they're trying to do the ... the lay of the verdict or decision is to give time for things to cool down and then they may not just like our politicians very often release in ... on a reform friday will weekend work as\nA very important force than to utilize it international as you said international leverage you are going to be very important\nWell I think there's a reason to be frustrated and frankly those frustrations were the reason to the United states officially left the human rights council we've talked about this many times shape you put the wrong members in the human rights council their effectiveness to officially stand in the way of actions like this is very much uh to the detriment so I thought the United states leaving was the right call there\nBut we as the ISI L. J. engaging through formal intervention sometimes they're written sometimes they're oral Jay is one of the blessed platforms that we have uncovered for keeping a case like this in in the in the visibility of the international community and look I I'm I'm at a ... if there wasn't visibility on this case aren't convinced you to see me and he would not be\nAlive today say she'd be dead I mean ... she would be without an international attention that sense would have been executed\nAbsolutely so if you look at this from the context of the domestic\nPolitical atmosphere in Pakistan this would be an easy case for the justice in other words they could throw out the presumption of innocence they could throw out the rule of law because they're under intense pressure\nFrom clerics and activists or to execute someone for a crying she did not commit so it's absolutely essential to maintain international political pressure uh so that the outcome of this case can be reversed\nIn her paper All right we've got thirty more minutes of this broadcast so if you want to stay with us we appreciate that and pay for the birth of you know how to do it you're listening on radio just go over to a C. O. J. dot org or Facebooking periscope broadcasting it there wouldn't be back with more than just a minute but again\nPray for these ... of course her family pray for these judges that are making that decision could come out of any literally\nAt any moment and it's that important that we hear from you on this really critical that we hear from you on this and that you're praying for a sea of baby and pray for the judges will make the decisions we get more information of course we will get a two year will be back with more than just a moment\n\nStuck in traffic we had to headed by north of former fed an avenue there's ... clearing along the right shoulder or as Baltimore's who is a little bit of looking back against their fifty seven so that that's what happened it was actually there the right so the three cars involved in this\nSo we are seeing a bit of the fact that I met him on the west and the highway to where they did read can lay that is causing some sort of ...

I'm ... this call for what section of surreal all to do it under a as we said the death penalty case\nAnd are these are Pakistan primarily or a Muslim Pakistanis who are calling for her to be executed ... so its hang her executed or kill her punish her\nAnd uh and again this makes it so a dangerous for the judiciary there because they've judges have died in the past that the court as well as other cabinet members who expressed support for a sea of babies now than in prison or eight years how difficult\nTo you I mean I'm going to we'll we'll do this in the moment but we'll get back to the top of a bond that CBP cases for a moment here this was I'd miss is the hearing this was the hearing ... yeah so we thought because we talked to sharia are Gail from our office right he said this is it I mean this is yeah it's just that they X comes a verdict and\nNo timeline on that most cases in Pakistan even the Supreme Court so very unlike cars\nAt the highest court in their language this three judge panel or the chief justice did sit on this one we know that\nUm that's a pretty ... Ninety percent come that day yeah yeah um this is it important cases or the other ten percent they do take time but I don't it's not usually the time like here where it could be months and months and months from our Supreme Court\nThis this could happen at any moment there's probably a lot of security concerns that risk\nThere's geo political issues at risk here um and I get nervous because of what these judges face so I'm a what we saw before is is even like you get to this point and judges start leaving so you don't have a core um so you can't have a verdict\nYou got to go through it again I get nervous about all of that because you know they're under something like that here in one very well the hearings have gone well for her is that the judges have either been killed or have quit\nAnd ah and again I think that's what we get people more and more update on his the news comes at a movie that we are going to give you a full ... hour on that tomorrow after the case I Would prefer the judge is\nIn a situation I mean that's the only ... and even the prosecutors\n... the government officials at the police um her attorneys as well of course her family but I Know you're doing that uh but but especially for those judges not not on the decision a but but John ah their safety um even while they're\nUm they're deciding a because what we know the other side has tried to harass or kill them\nBefore they got into a decision point\nSo I think that is the fundamental question here and that is the concern over the judges\nAnd the impact of all that aren't we're taking a break um [noise]\nWe come back from the break we're going to take a more common sky and some calls are coming in one eight hundred sixty four thirty one baseball can parents go get your comments in as well [noise]\nCase has been argued [noise]\nWe wait we're hoping we're waiting because they're going to set the right security apparatus in place\nFor that case later the week [noise]\nAndrew Brunson trial starts again October twelve I mean there is a lot going on on the international see that's why we want to take a break on this\nUh today to to focus on some of these other cases will be back with more when you come and get those in again just put him up with the comments or social media team is reviewing those as you you've got to pray for those judges as they make a decision to get rid of his death sentence\nOversee a baby or crime give me a couple of water to Muslim women and ends up becoming a blasphemy charge more in a moment we'll\nFix up your home in time for the holidays Larry Elder here with my friend ... owner of southwest construction\nTom are you and I've known each other a long time that's right over Fifteen Years now and your company southwest construction they've designed installed my new master bathroom guest bathroom pain in my house putting new flooring patio doors a new driveway\nAnd more absolutely we almost readers under your entire house will now with the holidays coming up you can remodel a kitchen or bathroom in as little as two week that's incredible\nThat's good planning and folks let me tell you something I trust Homer in southwest construction southwest construction will come to you show you how they can turn your dreams into reality so get it done before the holidays and make your neighbors jealous calls southwest construction and tell him Larry Elder sent you\nSo the caller's infringe I think is very very astute that it's very very possible that this is a made up charge\nThis type of charge a actually empowers the oh crafts and it empowers mob rule that's board ...

the ladder road this will simply empower the feel crouch this will empower mob rule\nAnd this will increase the level of subordinate should of Christians so I Hope uh the Pakistani Justice Department stands up for the rule of law and for the presumption of innocence at the end of the day\nAny impartial observers looking at the evidence will find that there is indeed no evidence in support of this conviction so I Hope the justices will do the right thing and they will find the C a bb\nIs what you're looking at the trial transcript released the aspects that have been reporting the press gives you an indication that the judges think that this would what we call put up charges the witnesses aren't there that\nWere the ones that were the accusing witnesses the mom who wrote the accusation out
