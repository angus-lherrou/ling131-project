{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "The eight year old told me that he didn't know where their mother was and their father didn't give it bleep\nSo that woke me up and I did some research and I discovered that while LA is one of the wealthiest the most glamorous cities in the world we have one of the highest poverty rates in the country we have a forty five thousand gang members\nWe have more foster children and the homeless children than anywhere else in the United states\nAnd we also have more incarcerated youth than anywhere else in the world twenty thousand kids are locked up every year in Los Angeles\nSo uh I'm also a screenwriter and I felt compelled to make a difference and so I uh after much a struggle I was able to finally teach a screen writing workshop to thirty teenage boys who were incarcerated for all kinds of serious crimes\nAnd at the end of my program most of his kids learn how to read and write others wanted to go back to school and apply to college and one tough gang leader even had a tattoo removed from his neck in his hand\nSo based on that success I launched the second screen writing workshops this time at a coed detention center and I got the same results\nSo I met another writer and I shared my experiences and she caught me the next week to tell me that her professor Leslie statements that the American Film Institute was going to give me five thousand dollars to start a nonprofit organization and that was Twenty years ago and we have served thirty seven thousand you since then\nSo what did you feel like to go back and it uses a sense of accomplishment or do you get assumes through so much more\nI think the latter I guess there's a sense of accomplishment and we've had some amazing success stories\nBut when I see the need not only in Los Angeles but throughout the country every city has this issue of\nFifty percent of our inner city youth are dropping out of school a these are our future system sees it this is our world that we live in and we need to educate and give these kids motivation and hope\nOn the arts have unfortunately been cut from most budgets\nAre as being considered unnecessary and yet research has proven that not only do the arts and encourage you to stay in school and improve their academic test results\nBut they also alleviate tension and a bill self confidence and steam and for the trouble of children that create now serves as really essential and science has proven that arts on increased the brain neurons and do all kinds of amazing\nThings such as uh we discovered that if it's a young child can learn how to keep the steady beat through music\nIt's Scientifically Proven that it accelerates they're reading\nAnd when the um language skills so we're using these techniques to educate our children and to motivate them to become positive productive citizen\nHas the learning about create now described as giving use in need opportunities to find their voices to arts mentoring in education walk us through give us an example paint a picture of what one of these ... or ... events ... how does that work\nWhat we operate in three ways the first wave volunteer driven so uh it's almost like a dating service where Los Angeles county is one of them is the largest county in the country and it's very broad so we're able to not falling tears in their own neighborhoods with kids they're in trouble\nSo we have a network of about a hundred agencies such as emergency shelters foster group homes rehab facility and schools and we are able to refer volunteers to the agency said they want to work with\nSomebody may want to work with little children Newark domestic violence victims others may want to work with teen moms\nWe get them training on how to work with these children we get them all the materials and equipment that they need and then we also help them to develop their curriculum and then we come and ate all of our programs with workshops for the children were they get parties and get bags with lasting souvenirs\nSo some volunteers may say look I'm really busy I can only volunteer once a week for a month\nWe set that up others may say I want to do this long term we set that up\nThe second way that we operate is through schools on most many schools and uh are not getting any arts education so we are able to to provide them with a longer term programs that were able to measure and show the impact of the work that we're doing\nAnd then the third way that we operate is in community based project where we might get funding to a larger project to an art art festival or a mural program in a in a park or in a community center\nSo those are the three ways that we operate and they're they're all kinds of stories in ways that I can tell you how that works but it really has an impact on that very lasting and widespread\nWill tell us about the impact anecdotally one have you seen someone who comes through this at risk youth who participates in the program how do you see new lives changed\nWell one of my favorite examples is tacit Caulfield toss it grew up in a very poor neighborhood with an abusive family she started running away from home between the ages of twelve and Fifteen and she was nine different detention facilities during that time\nShe took a TV writing workshop that one of our volunteers taught um this woman had written on the shows for a married with children and fresh print for ballet aren't she wanted to get back\nTo us it took her class she bonded with a mentor and I also mentor and gave her additional resources such as the computer and I and others are support\n... was able to receive a scholarship from Warner Brothers she graduated from USC film school she actually took her first year of law school in Chicago\nShe performs stand up comedy all around the country she produced and directed a feature documentary on how comedians to break into stand up she's working on her second documentary on teaching abused children how to use their tragedy to form comedy she's published three books written a number of threats and she got her real estate license\nSo this was a young woman who was headed for a lifetime of being incarcerated or worse and now she's an incredible a community citizen who's giving back\nHow is the program received by schools by communities by individuals do they knew about it do they respond you have a track record the ease so strong that it's pretty well no no\nWell yes we're getting requests from all over our reputation has spread we've received a national media attention and international wars for work\nBut there's so much lead and not enough money to provide all of the port that's needed um but we we do what we can where we're working with LA you at the end and charter schools and other schools to provide programs for their students on a volunteers hear about it through their friends and through the Internet\nUm and I'm an agency that says shelters and I'm detention facilities rehab centers are begging for for programs\nSo we do what we can but we're a small grassroots kind of organization but this year we're really going to where we're growing tremendously in terms of\nResources and support and in terms and each time we grow we were able to reach more children so we basically doubled our revenue every year for the last few years and we've doubled our outreach an ex financially so\nLast year we reached twenty five hundred kids and our goal is to reach on a you know for ... a four thousand kids and a and more each year to grow more and more\nYou know do you create now and we're talking with Joe ... Joe what is the motivation for you is is that you see how willing words in your you see how many are not yet\n[noise] yes that's a large part of it on I don't have children of my own so I feel that all of the children and our world are my children and I think that if everybody gave back and help children than we would have a much better world because these children are our future\nAnd while many people may disregard them because they don't identify with them where they come from a different background\nUm these are the kids that are going to be your\nYour neighbors and your fans that hopefully and and and do good for our world [noise]\nSo if we don't help them now that we're going to be paying dearly through our taxes and social welfare to keep them in prison in jail for instance\nUm there there are thousands of foster children there is an estimated half million foster children in our country when they age out when they turn Eighteen they're left to fend for themselves and an average foster child has Fifteen to twenty placements before they turn Eighteen\nSo here's a child who has no family no support no life skills or social skills they're going to turn Eighteen and be kicked out to fend for themselves\nAnd sixty percent that these kids within one year will become homeless incarcerated or dead\nSo unless we do something to intervene and to give them life skills and job training and support mentoring is the real key then we're going to be paying for it with our taxes to incarcerate them so as an example I'm an average and a child who was incarcerated in Los Angeles\nWe have to pay two hundred and thirty thousand a year to keep that child incarcerated now that money went towards prevention programs such as creating what create now is doing we prevent them from ever going to jail and they would go into college instead\n\nMissouri Hi Canada\nFrom\nBradley Cooper when he got quiet because it rocked the box office\nFirst manned plot [noise]\nAnd there is nothing more predictable\nAnd the loss of a movie about going to the moon does not include Neil Armstrong planting a flag on the moon\nShallow is one\nThat I think people are just had\nWith anti Americanism subtle for in bird\nAnd I know the flag is all over the astronauts I Know they show the flag on the moon but they they cut it out I told you are going to happen and first man flocked expected to twenty million and that was a low ball number sixteen million and it's got a flop\nNo one's going to go I I told you this I thought it was so obvious sometimes so why do I begin with that because the reaction that Donald Trump interview on CBS was also a ... people who like Trump loved being interviewed people hate Trump hated the interview and Trump in it\nEver say some things are predictable and obvious\nSo let me do that predictable obvious stuff about the elections that are coming up I was on Al Sharpton show yesterday and got out and I and I listen to\nUm meet the press yesterday wasn't on the panel buys watch it and I'm Stacey Abrams is running for governor George it started to complain about voter suppression I said okay she's lost that's over\nOr if you're complaining about voter suppression you're conceding that you're going to lose the election\nCannot read on jobs education or something like Scott Walker is up in Wisconsin round the fact that three percent unemployment in Wisconsin the really want to screw around with that\nAt all across the United states Republican candidates are surging\nKevin Cramer has basically defeated Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota already Josh ... has already basically defeated Claire McCaskill but surging and we want them to win by a lot we need a repudiation\nOf what happened to justice Kavanaugh Michael Braun is surging in India that Rick Scott the governor of Florida is surging ... even though he's\nRepairing it devastated coasted more on that and the second president's going to Montana for Matt Rosendale against John tester\nI wouldn't write off John James Jimmer nature we are a bit more either\nLooks like Marsha Blackburn is going to hold her Senate seat and tendency Martha McSally a surging in Arizona and voting is underway in Arizona by the way that this is going to win by double digits ... I don't think it's going to be closed Christian send them has been exposed as a hard left wing radical\nAs recently as eight years ago her do over is not going to work and Dean Heller of Nevada\nCould add the Republicans win four or five net plus seats\nThat'd be a fifty six Republicans because they are that the country is rejecting\nVomiting out actually\nThe be angry nuts [noise]\nThe despicable politics of personal destruction and the attacks on Trump it just makes them crazy now to turn on Morning Joe and see the hand wringing about sixty minutes there'll be a which it was frankly very entertaining and interesting in a real glimpse of the president as I as he thinks\nWhat story has got to be talked about today\nAfter twenty twos are\nThe greatest fighter in the world ever created they're very expensive I Believe it's a hundred and fifty million dollars per point\nBill may have two hundred of them to like that\nThe greatest they're stopping that could be anything they can be the shipper where they can be any Russian and Chinese jet the F play to our best and we should made six hundred of them but we shut the wind down prematurely\nObama of course or\nFor whatever reason ... to me\nSeventeen to twenty twos weren't left Kendall airfare space\nTheir condition as I Know\nWhich says to me likely badly damaged that is the equivalent of losing eight cruisers at a naval engage with\nThe cost of that is staggering\nThan the accountability of it is going to be severe\nBy bringing that up because last night the president was talking about general secretary of defense Mattis\nHere's what he said number three what about a general matter is he going to leave I don't know he hasn't told me that I didn't want her relationship with him it could be that he is I think it's sort of a Democrat if he wanted another trip\nBut General Mattis is a good guy we get along very well may leave I mean at some point everybody everybody people leave\nThat's Washington that is right away completely true even during the early days of the war\nWhen and by the early days of the war the war has been going on since two thousand and one is now two thousand they think that's a Seventeen year war now\nIn Afghanistan and Iraq and in Syria\nIslamist extremism around the world for Seventeen years early in the war six years in the war W doesn't get to leave\nBut people left W\nThat I always I always shook my head is like George Marshall walking off\nThe fire Don Rumsfeld he had to replace them after the two thousand and six election that's not\nThat's not leaving but somebody voluntarily left in the middle of the war I thought what George Marshall up during World War two really got started in thirty nine\nTen Marshall just stayed and stayed in state never complain I got the professionals in the military never leave but\nEverybody does leave and now I'm thinking [noise]\nGeneral Mattis ... defense matters and it's important to refer to ... because he was a civilian job\nHave to look at losing Seventeen twenty twos\nWho is responsible for that that is a ... that is a strategic why is\nThat the idea of Seventeen F twenty two fighters they are not stop all\nThey are not they are our front line of defense it's it's just a natural that they left the air force base\nAnd service culture and accountability or the navy fired five senior admirals last year over three collisions in grounding\nIn your animals that the Navy's\nA culture of a kind of do at the airport says but I think secretary of defense Mattis has to be looking in the mirror of this for anything so I got all that money I got\nSeventeen\nReplaceable have twenty two\nWere left at times it can do I I I just can't\nI Can't even describe what that means\nWhat did the president say about\nThe show gate a this is a brutal story it's a horrible probable murder I have no idea who did it on whose orders\nI have no idea if it actually occurred at the Turkish embassy the Turks say dead at the Saturday council and turkey and the Turks said did such a thing that they can spy but air to one is a bad guy to understand that\nA here's what the president said cutting every night\nAnd Marcus Chanay\nJournalists and journalists\nOnce he murdered by the Saudis and the prince can order for nobody knows yet but we'll probably be able to find out it's investigating is being looked at very very strongly\nThat we wouldn't be very upset and angry if that were the case as at this moment they deny it ended that tonight the mentally\nCould it be them yes challenger ... got on the phone and asked\nWhen can I\nYou deny it they denied every way you can imagine and not too distant future I think we'll know an answer what are your options let's say they did what are your options would

I don't want to hurt jobs\nI don't want to lose in order to like that there are other ways of a shame to use a word that's a pretty harsh words on your show buddy what's at stake here you know there's a lot of ... there's a lot of sick and [noise]\nMaybe especially so because this man was a reporter\nTo something you'll be surprised me say that it's something really terrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we're gonna have to say we're going to get to the bottom of it and it will be severe punishment\nDark so that is exactly the right thing to say we don't know we're going to get to the bottom of it is disgusting that it's a reporter a terrific and so the president is learning how to do these things he was interrupted like a thousand times by Leslie stall but we'll come back to that\nToday we begin week three of my campaign urging you to support the alliance defending freedom\nThis is the mobs versus jobs elections also the judges election it's a justice cabin I'll watch the premier religious freedom organization the United states as alliance defending freedom senior counsel Jim Campbell tells us\nA it was started by people like James Dobson and Marlin medics and it was really just a response as these gentlemen and others like them looked out and saw there were a lot of challenges to religious freedom and they didn't see anyone out there to defend it so they said we're going to address this problem by putting together this new organization\nDon't touch my Medicare dot com\nIs run by a Mac there's ... return American citizens which you should be a member or\nA Mac it's a million plus a strong they are up a potent adversary of A.

only to ask questions to find out whatever you know whatever it is you want to find out more so in ...\nRight I mean and you do that not just with politicians that you do that with people to people

mind it at MSNBC in a regular guest Robert good morning or what do you make of the news from Britain I just announced that a magazine that are not Maggie Theresa May is coming to address the parliament\nStriking news is just another example out of this\nBalance that Theresa May has tried to strike a beam someone who can be both in the ... camp but also work with and then they go she ate or try to have some kind of agreement\nWith the Europeans just not working as an appetite against globalization and the ranks of the conservative party they want those are the harder it I mean the barrage\nWalk of the Tory party is really the heart and soul the Tory party and there's still a lot of anxious about Theresa May what she's trying to do to maybe salvage the relationship with Europe rather than moving away\nThe I Will watch that story very closely on to another story and I I think this has implications for last night's interview when the president brought up secretary of defense Mattis suggested maybe he's not long for the administration\nRobert I Am stunned there were Seventeen twenty choose left behind and Kendall air force base their presumed damage at least and perhaps destroyed they can't get into the hangar\nAt eight percent of our strategic weapon our number one the greatest fighter ever made we only have two hundred of them or something like that [noise] there will be accountability here is this going to be the occasion for the secretary of defense to fall in the short and say\nThe buck stops with me if I run the department of defense those planes were my watch Mr President here's my resignation\nSecretary Mattis has signaled to a lot of people inside of the Pentagon and the administration that he's probably going to eat after the terms that this is someone who's on his way out though\nThis whole situation with with the planes\nIt could be sooner but if he's always been really heading for the exit and the president kind of like a Democrat on sixty minutes was revealing it as a secretary of defense is really worn out is welcome highly respected by the president and others ... but not the one who's going\nFor a year secretary of defense\nWho's also a huge proponent of accountability and they they fired five senior admirals last year over collisions and grounding and I think this is a way for him to send a message about accountability that it's just a huge strategic blow to the United states if that is the early reporting is correct\nMe move to Maggie Haberman you and Maggie no the president about as well as anyone and she interviewed a bunch of rally a tenders a four story yesterday\nAbout why they loved Trump and then there are four things quote he wins regardless of how punishable the definition of winning maybe he takes the tie directly to Democrats unlike previous Republican presidential candidate you prefer comedy ever controversy\nHe does not about a politically correct culture and he does not

surrounding that film and\nThe American flag and different things that led to it not being successful at the box office\nBut I think you're right Maggie ... story is strong in that it shows that I was just on on the trail with the president last week I was on air force one in Pennsylvania and at the rallies you see the crowds are still there and he is an aspect now they see him for all the problems and controversies that he has been gone for a walk\nIn their eyes and he's still the Warren decided establishment and that really more than any ideology is what seems to attract them than President
