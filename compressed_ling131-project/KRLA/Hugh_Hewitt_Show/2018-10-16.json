{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "The unity of what this country is all about is it not\nOh great I mean I was a political scientist teaching for twenty eight yeah can you can find a lot of things any pain right the politics we had to stay and America ... an hour outside of dying by the reaction that Trump\nElection that we in America what such as strongly as low meant everything back\nOn our drawing the line itself as the election I mean that we we almost if I'm On a political ... in the U.S exactly\nI mean and really in a lot of respects we've we've had won a in a sense I mean you know we don't want to talk about it in those terms because it's so foreign you know you you think in terms of\nYou know third world countries not here in the United states but uh the very thing um you know they came from the Democrats in particularly from their candidate Hillary Clinton or suggesting that Donald Trump would a base\nThe whole process even a ... at the time President Obama a suggested the same thing that Donald Trump was it was a danger that he was threatening the very foundations of the electoral process\nAnd it's been them than his his cause more problems and you know along this way as you say with the resistance and you know and the sad thing about this a doctor ... and\nWe the people were paying for this [laughter] it's like how insane is is\nYou know what connects at all is mark ... yes exactly\nAnd you know I was a challenge and I can fix it but I Want the protests and they and are taking place and in some ways we're we live we live in that mhm what difference is that the radicals are in our institutions they're running at university that's where\nI'm at the media every night institution right\nAnd they know hungry and again I'm at the CIA that they have really been able to infiltrate those off my face and I in a way that I Would think that the unimaginable\nAnd the quote that have that in a communist them and let it document based they kill him accommodate what's correct but you have you ever met when he was wanting to buy a ticket to play\nOut in that in some ways he with Fallon right you know some of the same tactics that it is today but he was asked they write about what was taking place\nIn our government and they're not used to patient\nWell here we are I mean you got to Trevor loud and\nWho is a researcher out of New Zealand and he's reported on this extensively Dr Swain that we've got a over a hundred elected officials in our government or that have declared themselves as democratic socialist and I go well how do you put your hand on the Bible\nTake a vow to defend the U.S constitution when the very thing you believe in is an typical to what our constitution represents\nYes I agree\nSo so what are we going to you know what are we going to do about it I mean I I think that uh the political process fired when I'm Sorry I made\nThat band to after mistake but actually I Do believe that the political there that they have overplay its hand and watch it the ah in some ways a easy admit can victory for them I don't think it's going to be so easy\nMhm no I I I think so too I think we're we're coming along the same thing as we did in the twenties sixteen election or somebody some was on the scale repeatedly a bad Hillary Clinton Ninety percent she was going to win there was no doubt it but she was going to be our first female president that and the story\nAnd then uh you know then we the people got involved I guess we should [laughter] and uh our votes counted and they have been in shock ever since and instead of you know ... analyzing\nWhat what they got wrong they just have convinced themselves that somehow the election was stolen from them no I I think the election was reclaimed or by the white full body that belong to and that is we the people was it not\nActually I don't believe that they're convinced that the sales operate right now is that right you know what happened to have the American system is supposed to operate what they have done it to do that followers to create all this political unrest among they are people\nWho are low information are voters in some cases they're low information paper and other cases mhm uh that just so radically\nMind that that they have no ... men are we spent a lot of this country and even today I see that that's not bad taste in New York Times or that is\nThat we need to care for 'em they could to Puerto Rico and watched and they said because then it is affirmative action but white people\nAnd that goes on and on that we have to bring violence ah because then it discriminates against by now it is\nKnow that at the time that the constitution was framed ratified that Wright was not an issue you know the crime rates have any idea any clue that would be where things aren't racialized face in politics doesn't level we had stay mhm\nIs really held his back I'm no doubt about it a by you know kind of chasing windmills like Don Quixote a and I and I say this with all due respect I'm sure there are some people did feel\nThat uh you know this has taken place but the fact that matter is is by continuing to follow it you know that false narrative\nWe're really not solving anything here we're becoming more and more divided\nUh this is all you know we've talked about this before in the show Dr Swain to this is rules for radicals you know you you say it's communism is Marxism you know this is what ... has brought to the American body politic or through a his ... like a Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama\nDoes that mean he made it the ... he made it simple enough that average people could understand it and so it has become like for people and you say it is a repeat it again and again and again and um\nI mean we ...\nNeed to pay for what it was a radical as a political ... yes and when their arm\nTactics that we can use that down a run contrary to value and principles and I think we have to use them not President Trump is a very effect it will use and ridicule exposed to political last\nExactly well and it was quite a bit of exposure last night on sixty minutes with Leslie stall who had to remind that had a reminder that she wasn't president that he was\nAnd now I thought that was hilarious [laughter]\n[laughter] you know and and I got to tell you a doctor's way and you know your book on debating immigration my thought was\nAbout your book is that it would be great if we get debate immigration but when we have all this noise that we got to Wade through easy this is all the problem with resistance so we have serious issues in our country right now some of this has been mitigated because we have a robust economy and things are\nSo much better compared to what they were you know a two years ago\nA but we've got serious business to be about which is a for every man which is for every American and we can do a lot of great things for a unified but if we're back biting and divided\nA then ... you know it it's a drain on a A R creativity it's a drain on the solutions that we could bring to the table to really address or these critical issues like ... you know like your book which you you've given us the second EDITION on a debating immigration\nYes and I'm a couple of nights ago when the president was speaking at a rally in tech he said quite a bit about immigration so I Believe after the midterm elections he turned his attention the immigration and it it is sad that the political lab\nThat doesn't want to get resolved named believe that he kept them to leave a million people in limbo and so I think the president I'm just like he's widely enable it to accomplish much of the Internet\nThat he will be able to reform immigration they will have to do it because he has a desire to do so I'm not sure that other presidents have had that same desire\nExactly well um what happens if a [noise]\nYou know if a red wave doesn't happen to offset the blue wave\nOf Democrats take over one of the houses let's just say I'm you know what happens to that agenda [noise]\nI mean everybody more difficult but I think that a president [noise]\nTalk understands their mark and people\nThat he built in Port said political lab kit stepping record\nAnd then the hip repeatedly and I think that they are adopted strategies that are driving away that banks because I was at the end of the day members of Congress wants to be reelected and they say the political will in Berlin in the direction of the president and\nReal one one\nOne one thousand Shelley was all her nomination\nPersonally\nNot something I enjoy your\nMore than a morning glory America balls are high Canada do early factor dot coms thirty out\nOf the concept of our own goal\nFortunately we've heard Dwayne\nThan the spider bet I'm only goal is when you score on yourself and soccer by mistake getting knocked the ball and and your that's your own goal and it's really a bad thing to do it was a bit worn own gold herself so bad yes [laughter]\nI just watched Twitter amazement and then the specter ac one thirty gunship of Twitter Iowa ...

you know I knew and we all knew him he was he was a hard guy not to like\nThat that is what I had been told by many people I've talked to about this about a half an hour ago Muhammad ... posted this

be died what do you see happening day but\nWell the music the mood music for a while has indicated that Saudi Arabia would pin the blame on some scapegoat in their security services\nThat turkey was likely to accept that explanation or as long as Saudi Arabia acknowledged that your mouth show he had been killed inside the confidence in Istanbul\nAnd that seems like the way things are headed at this hour or last night of a well informed source or who knows what the courts up to a told me that Saudi Arabia\nHad identified the person they're going to say is responsible he put it more honestly and said the person that is responsible or someone in the intelligence services who knows crown prince Mohammed bin Salman personally and felt like he he this person and intelligence\nHad the authorization to carry out some kind of rendition and that went horribly wrong um if you've been following Saudi Arabia or you've been following this story that does seem terrifically plausible but it's convenient for Saudi Arabia or for turkey and for the United states to find a way to move on\nAnd this is the Henry the second defense from when the English King said ... will no one read me of

to you by a good source as likely to be\nPointed to as the prime mover rendition gone bad\nUm implicates NBS in ordering the rendition does that input do you do think the royal court changes in succession\nA two elements there first of all I think this person this ah intelligence official who's going to take the blame if that person has tried that person will be tried in that Saudi court so that's not the kind of court we're used to wear the defendant might have an opportunity to blame the ground perhaps\nA second of all\nA you know in the past a crown prince who came under this kind of a cloud might have trouble with the succession\nA Saturday and it has changed crown prince ... consolidated power like no figure in the kingdom in decades he holds all the key levers are and so the

anywhere you\nKnow you know it to be honest a cynical as I Am I expected that's what they would go I expected we would hear that there's rogue operative was associated with some old regime but in fact what I'm told we're going to hear is that the rogue operative is someone who actually was a friend of of Brits had been Solomon\nWho felt like he had the okay from the crown prince to do this rendition and who was trying to make a name for himself who was trying to impress everybody with his daring do and be a quote unquote James Bond and it went horribly wrong\nThat is the Henry the second is pure Henry the second term is back at a parallel will that be enough for the United states John Bolton that I talked about this at that point he said we don't have the facts of the middle east anything is possible that was last Thursday would the better the second offends me six a sufficient for the United states\nWell a key question here is it has turkey shared its intelligence red turkey Turkish officials have leaked many people including me that they are in possession of audio and maybe video of from inside the conflict showing who did what in the ... you know they've got they've got the goods\nIf they've shared that wish there U.S intelligence got her pies who often work very closely with the Turks then that's one thing and if they haven't if they've only briefed about it that's another that that diminishes the degree of seriousness for the U.S diminishes the pressure on the U.S\nTo try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared really\nRight now does that impact for example the war in Yemen and this is actually word comes home this is the anti Iran alliance being stresses who's a Jordan and Egypt in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel and America\nTrying to confront the who teach who are sending rockets into Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran does this break that anti Iranian alliance which many of us have welcome a as being a necessary course correction in the middle east\nOr I'm not sure they had any impact on the Iranian allies I I'm not I I don't see the United Arab Emirates or Israel or Egypt showing any squeamish this whatsoever about what's been done here\nAnd so far it looks like President Trump is very willing to accept this explanation he was even yesterday you know getting ahead of the Saudis and already suggesting that this was a rogue operator before the Saudis had begun to float that explanation\nThemselves so I think the geopolitics are likely to remain unchanged so long as the succession a inside Saudi Arabia is an change\nCan therefore arms sales on interrupted the American public accepts it moves on because it is an exotic story and read like a thriller I'm a ... has a lot of friends but it is it is very difficult to keep a story like this\nAbove the fold for very long ... Patrick\nYeah I think we're trying to say before where it's going to hit a the crown prince is with elite opinion\nYou know the wall street and Silicon Valley uh he's enjoy the company of those people he's worked hard to get them to invest in Saudi Arabia to bring their businesses and the insights and they know how to help diversify the Saudi economy he's going to find it very hard to be\nA front man for that sort of effort and that's not trivial because Saudi Arabia over the not too long term has got some real issues\nIn terms of being able to support their economy on their oil revenue\nLast question David ...
