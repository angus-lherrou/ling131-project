they're having trouble getting jobs and in trouble paying their college bills and there were allies saying that all the doctor nation I thank God it's providing for themselves or their families\nAnd I think are waking up in marginalized at the moms and burns you know we've been marginalized for some time and I as I traveled the country\nI'm literally blown away in the last few years sharing number\nOf guidelines and conservative went and had an army don't don't register I developed now that reason why the the things like what happened when the cat or not debacle and they're like politics and I don't want to have anything like that and they claim they're though with that and now they're starting to realize no\nNot loaning as like Taj or is that right now and they're starting to realize this is our voice for our values and we can't keep count march you know we can't leave our families to fight for our families\nThat we can go to our neighbor I call about these people out\nIn Kimberly Ina to your point here traditionally uh people of faith uh about fifty percent I mean if you go to church and and you you just think fifty percent says he\nWill actually bother to register to vote now these are people who are people of faith they say they believe in the Bible many read the Bible\nAnd his real clear got closest to be an agent of change we are to be that bastion of truth for society and when you look back two years ago at twenty sixteen record numbers of evangelicals and people are fake Catholics came out and really and I believe save the country\nAnd but they cannot think that this is a one and done deal this is a process it took many years for the elites to take over our country and to convince many that this is not a government of for by the way by the people I mean to listen to Hillary Clinton\nUm you know if he wants civility to return to this country and then you need to give her the keys to the car and let them drive again then of course we know what they did in the previous eight years under Brock Obama and yes I Want to tell you a Virginia\nOf the economy that we're experiencing in no way is the bronco Obama economy okay let's get that straight 'cause that's another light is being perpetrated on you right now\n[laughter] you know one of the big problems with those who are fighting for freedom and liberty as we focus on our families and our home waiting for them and we want it but we've forgotten to protect and preserve it and so we want everything to just come back to normal right you know just something that they will it will work and we can go back to our families\nOne or destroy our country doing this by small little do and I mean just you know ... is a great example it had ten years ago\nHad this national announced that there aren't going to have um the girls and girls boys to everybody whatever what are you crazy on all sides of the aisle when he spent\nEight years slowly introducing these little doses of craziness and then now you know John become chair and can become Johnny ... and being shown on heritage and their kindergarten they're being er being talked back and and parents are freaking out mom just ...\nYou know I mean how do you explain to your daughter that to Johnny now is in the bathroom but suddenly suddenly\nI mean and the wrong crowd out and then you're sent to the principal's office talk about confusion and terrorizing our little kids just writing\nWell it's happening on all fronts I mean what's happening to our kids happening to us if you're not politically correct and falling into a the line that the left a hard left would want you to say whether it's pronouns or whatever uh then yes I'm you're going to be cited and this is this is the America\nThat we have right now I I think it is fitting that we're looking at another in a sense a a a revolution of sorts for the berries souls because\nThe thing what you're talking about your Kimberly is beyond our family says we have our neighbors we we have neighbors that are lost right now they're confused and they need direction and consistently when you look back in the history of this country\nWho have been the people to save the day for this country\nIt has been people have states because we know better we understand\nThe nuances and uh the virtue of the U.S constitution we really do I mean that speaks to our heart and our soul in such a way it lifted up it gets us excited that when we hear I mean it was like I'm On on the world series or if they were playing the national anthem and like I was telling a friend of mine I go\nIn and it was so special I mean it really it it it it ... it gave me chicken skin I was just so proud of a you know our national anthem\n... you know the uh ... will be the major league baseball players the teams the Dodgers and uh the Boston Red Sox\nStanding in reference a respecting our flag honoring a the tradition of this country is so rich and so precious how can we just allow a fewer number of people to take us hard left abandoned those principles\nMen are fathers our sons daughters uh grandparents or great great grandparents over the years who have paid the ultimate price for our freedoms how do we how do we just throw that away\nI I Am I have to say just devastated when I see people not realizing what it is that we have and before you throw it all the way let's figure out what it is that we have been dumbed down for generations and I'm telling you the most powerful the two most powerful places where our voice has the greatest and\nIt's in our homes and with our vote and if we teach our children why they stand they will never questioned whether or not they should\nWrite the exactly excellent point well um I got I got to tell you I Am I'm encouraged in our audience is a Kimberly\nTo hear your passion and to see that you've got to you know ... you know women are and I actually only women but demand has got to come out of their homes for just a bit and understand that what we're fighting for us we're finding for families but you\nKnow God fearing people ... we always ... it's more than our families got closest to you know ... you know to deal with the un lovable as well you know we kind of like for ... you know they're they're like heading into a brick wall and we just can't sit there and just let them crash and burn\nA now you know and and we've maintained there's that uh you know in this in this show that it's not a Republican or democratic thing\nIt it's a we the people thing it's an American thing and that's what we need to apprehend once again is the greater calling and cause of what being an American is all about\nAnd that's nice that's a declaration of independence has our birth certificate that Campbell is our mission statement and the constitution ice ages aren't by wash those are the three things that should unite us that the people\nAnd we're what we're doing right now we're in ... and we're literal fighting for the salvation of the republic and our families and our freedoms and everything we hold dear\nAnd and just like you know the ... story took every hill and Dale\nTo have that feeling and you know it's going to take a marine died herring Americana shaved every public and\nWhite now we got to get out to the polls I cannot extract enough there is a blue wave coming these people I think it's women these radical feminist that made that mess in Washington DC three weeks ago\nThey're going to walk on glass to go to the polls to protect that right now their own children that is not what the majority of people in America want\nThey want their freedom they want and what is actually one more time to react shelter [laughter] well well well what we have to realize that we can put up a big wall\nAnd that's what I made a huge movement of mama bears are doing they're getting registered to vote and they haven't been there already early voting and then it's going to be a nail biter to the end and we're going to have to to fight with everything we had it will take every good\nAmerican Love country a lot of their family and loved their freedom and said that your public and when the next election\nKimberly Fletcher a president amongst for America the moms march movements um it is time we need the mama bears and I'm Kimberley thank you so much gosh I really appreciate and I know many are grateful for

what happened was\nGot a break but I think Trump is worse than the situation but I think in all fairness this predates Donald Trump and you know and I said correctly that up for it and have a high tolerance for the sort of thing I don't think it's confined to Florida I think most American voters to assume that politicians are not totally clean\nI mean they assume that they hang out with some people who make it favors from and that sort of thing and in the context of that honesty I don't think a single Hamilton ticket is going to ruin Andrew Gillum campaign I also think\nThis new information is not does not resolve and solve everything I mean he's correct\nThat test just sort of ambiguous you can say that that text does not prove that the ticket was from the FBI agents are from the guy trying to buy influence that the reference to the crew gives Andrew Gillum enough wiggle room to kind of say what he's saying I think a lot of this is just noise to voters guy tickets\nIn

revolution\nGlobalization of done today it really echoes in some ways and I keep thinking how we handled all that is what could be a model for us now I mean think of where we were at the turn of the twentieth century\nUm gap between the rich and the poor had first appeared really it was a sense of immigrants coming in abroad as scapegoats for the fact that the working class felt that they had been hurt by this changing colors changing ...\nMuch like lovers action today and there was a sense that um of anxiety that all the new inventions that were there were bombings and the street it was a

morning your reaction to the a suspicious package is the most recent one of which was delivered to Robert De Niro what do you make of this\nUh you know I agree with Trump's about what what the president said it's it's despicable I mean there there is no place for this I'm Glad they're vigorously investigating hope they catch you did it and uh catch them quickly and respond quickly that would be very appropriate\nAnd it ought to be condemned uh these kinds of tactics you I I wrote a column was about the violence of violent protests they have to be stepped on right away and um I I I I really liked the response that ice levels of our government\nNo the um there's a new emphasis on a facility in Newcastle county Delaware I got a question Jeff it will not take the FBI very long to give them eight or nine or ten\nInvestigatory leads and that's what each of these packages is neither neither candidate they'll find whoever did this unless it's a hostile foreign power messing with our elections again and I'm not ruling out until I get a name and number whoever is doing this what do you make of that\nNo I ... nothing what surprised me I mean I ... we need to\nBut I think we should be able to figure that out to know how much of this there'll be able to reveal if that's what it is is a different question you or I wouldn't rule anything out at this stage um and and they're doing exactly the right thing and investigated very vigorously condemning it I'm not I don't\nGive me your assessment of the caravan what are we going to do when Twenty one thousand people show up at the border of the United states\nWell I think we have to force the laws of the United states and we do it in a way to insist that what the values of the United states that uh VHS has had a long time to plans and I assume that they have plans in place it does to me\nShow why be nice to have a wall um because it's a humane way of of protecting the border and enforcing the laws so\nUh you know they're going to respond or they can and appropriate way and it shows also how the catch and release policies of a few years ago have incentivized people to try this\nYear I keep telling people that which gets rewarded gets repeated yes if if it Fifteen to twenty thousand people show up at the border and some our allowed in that will have forty or fifty thousand march I mean if you're out there\nIt's the it's the magnet effect and it's real and a number Romney talking about it you can do and the two thousand twelve and a um it's an issue by the way that Josh how is used here in
