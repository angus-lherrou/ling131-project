see him on CNN David Early voting begins in Tennessee next week next week in Tennessee you just filed a story Marsha Blackburn got a big bounce because of the cabinet hearings why\nWild because it's sort of awake and they ... well but the more than that especially in Tennessee with the rather than just kind of a unicorn Democrat who public is really do like in Tennessee and really get at a record of than president is that it it it sort of brought out in the election which is\nIf you're voting for blood and you're voting or you know possibly a Democratic Senate so Marsha Blackburn had I had a hard time\nMaking that case a for all sorts of reasons and the issue because basically make the case for her and it helps Tennessee revert to its standard partisanship that we would expect to see in a presidential election\nAnd that's what it's been such a big deal and the Senate races which are taking place than Republican states like Trump and that's why it it has been such a problem or Senate Democrats and why it has probably take in the Senate off the table to them so they know us does that\nDoes the atmosphere in about ten days or so avert back to the need for what it is and the term cycle has been and I would lose that from happening definitely because just seen it before and twenty six they have the Access Hollywood tape and mid October and three weeks later Trump was elected so\n[noise] I don't like the blanket predictions but right now this is why it's looking really good what or\nIn Tennessee and Republicans in other than it is\nI think when you're able to make the argument that vote for ... is a vote for Schumer is a vote for Dianne Feinstein is a vote for Cory Booker is a vote for Sheldon Whitehouse and it is a vote for Mazie Hirono that it's very easy to remind people that\nFor thirty days it's hard to do that for a year but it's very easy to do that for thirty days and I don't think it's just Tennessee I think North Dakota is locked up\nI think Donald he's having trouble Holly had a big surge and now we ever\nOr came down in Florida Rick Scott is going to be all over doing the Rick Scott thing he's very good at this I think it's going to help him to am I missing any places where it's helping\nWell look I I'm helping Ted Cruz in taxes it's helping\nRepublican Senate candidates anywhere where the state is inclined to vote for a Republican but where you know for atmosphere reasons and for a candidate raised in\nThe states will flirting with Democrats I look I I was in Indiana and North Dakota in August that I thought that those two candidates are those two Democratic it's almost Donnelly and hike airport trouble the Dali and hanging around the high camp I think it's been hot list they just really is a duck punch a\nDonnelly those hanging around this in theory should help on\nA creates a distance we'll see if it does I'm Jon Tester in Montana the other ones who have managed to\nMe is always a very good candidate to sway people underestimate him he had kept distance between human Rosendale an outlook is caught him and I think that this has helped so anywhere where the playing field is designed to elect Republicans Arlen elect than easily especially I think this is going to help in swing states like Florida\nI think it's an open question because the atmosphere of a spill generally favor Democrats and this is a state that swings with the wind is one of the reasons why I think when you look at Ohio and Pennsylvania the Senate races are still off the table\nYou know there is a\nA a lead allegation that Democrats were using as of the talking point but the mob rule if not I was angry about that before I was I was shocked when they broke through the barricades at the Supreme Court the videos at the at the mob in Portland went viral yesterday I just think people have had it\nWith the intimidation politics of the left they really had just had it and they're going to vote Republican as a rebuke to that more than they were going to vote against Donald Trump for his occasional cruelty and his bowl and the China shop stuff they're really angry at those politics on the hill am I right am I wrong\nWell I think it depends on where the voters are I think you're right where the voters are inclined to vote Republican and where the partisanship is designed that way I think you still have a lot of house district and you have some of these swing states where the president's they'll get a dollar a day and and I think that you know for for for\nDemocrats that the danger in this the last thing is that they lose the ads they have had with independent too of what the Republicans and President Trump and says all parties and\nWe've had enough of you and that's just been the view\nAnd it's replaced by looking at Democrats saying basically there's no difference between you and them so maybe I vote for him maybe I don't maybe I vote for Republicans may be a stay at home for that and that's that's the danger for Democrats I don't think that in a midterm cycle that we've gotten this far along that the the\nThe apple cards than it could be completely reverse and you're just going to have the review switch the other way but I think it's been a ... they couldn't model\nUm the battlefield and it could reduce the number of seats Democrats to pick up possibly enough but they don't win the house to Jordan or they end up winning the house majority but by just a few seats are definitely going I think\nAmerica will literally back it comes to inside of the beltway urging you
