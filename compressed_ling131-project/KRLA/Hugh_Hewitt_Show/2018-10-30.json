{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "Um but yeah we have adversaries overseas that have every intention of destroying this country and they and they are moving closer all the time to having those capabilities\nYou know as you said in the end the breakaway moments ago bill\nAnd I didn't fight sixteen yes ah indicators\nAnd I see those you know like flashing lights every day and the news you know I I think this past week and what you heard about the U.S pulling out of the INS treaty now which is a nuclear treaty signed a between Reagan and Gorbachev\nAnd our corporate ... um yeah between the ... the Russians no that was part of a sharp and it was going to have enough yes and that was to limit a cruise missiles basically\nSo that they couldn't be used against here in targets now more state near now have submarines and the Mediterranean that can reach out but we know about this the bomb of people complain about you know their violations\nWhat our real concern bill is with the Chinese are not part and parcel to this treaty and you have to every one of the Chinese missiles violate on this particular treaty so\nA war saying well you know the Russians have already violated it really makes no sense I think the larger threat though is the two thousand and ten new start strategic arms reduction treaty which of course kept us to Fifteen hundred warheads\nPicking fifty and then about seven hundred platforms that stuck for renegotiation now and we'll hear unless we find some accommodation now that that it's going to be thrown out as well this is a red flashing light\nYou know we went through old Cold War I Wish there were tens and tens of thousands of nuclear weapons pointed at us but those are my age group called vividly\nAbout warnings about the feeling in the army but related with the Nineteen sixty two Cuban missile crisis and other crises we weren't sure if we were going to be annihilated and and you know turn into nuclear dust at any moment\nExactly yeah I remember we were all diving under desk during that time [noise] uh you know in the in the practice runs so yes and and here it is Robert to ... as you mentioned with the ... the sixteen indicators uh what else are you saying let's let's let's go down a list as much as we can hear\nYeah the terrorists that the trade war is there any question that we're in a trade war with China of course not right you know we are you know they have the surplus on their side I guess because we're a major consumer or their major market ...\nYeah back and forth they don't allow our business is to have the same rights privileges and access to their economy and still pregnant she has every ambition of making his nation but global economic leader he\nIs a launch what's called\nA belt and road initiative spinning well and that that's almost two trillion dollars around the world buying up you know pork\nBut still it he's buying country leverage and of course every where the Chinese government economic arm is\nBehind the bail is the People's Liberation army in other words they're armed forces do when they bought up the Suez Canal when they bought up the Panama Canal when they purchased a Western European ports in there a number of um Central America horse\nThey always have a front behind it that gives the access to the People's Liberation navy in most cases and we're not seeing this cross football this is an economic manipulation coercion\nAnd it it's very very serious if there's if there's not a place in the world is free of it is eight week\nNice this competition I think President Trump does\nA but it's going to take a lot more than what we've done up to them so that is a major issue you know the whole issue of espionage\nYou know clearly the president says is national security strategy that on an average we lose about three hundred billion with a B ... dog intellectual property on an annual basis you know our\nOur Internet systems are\nYou know networks are packed constantly that's because there's an organization\nThat the Chinese stood up just a few years ago overseas electronic warfare in cyber space and so forth it works directly for the national government not necessarily under but people separation army they are constantly\nTrying to sabotage steel and whatever and then of course\nYou know depending on who you believe a there may be awkward to twenty five thousand you know we were suspected of spies in this country but then there's a large expatriate populations in which the Chinese government through its\nIts student programs than through its work a green card programs in this country where you sat up they soak up vacuum up by all this\nIntelligence about who we are not incredibly dangerous and yet now I and other people on the hill are aware of it but it it is really a war you know Cho in lie back in Nineteen Ninety One it was the leader of China but he said look you know\nOn Christmas Day when the hammer and sickle was lowered at the Kremlin\nHate it cleared the war between the U.S and the Soviets is over the war with China in the U.S is just gone right back went to war in Nineteen Ninety One against that we need to recognize that across\nAll sorts of domains may have been at war with us and the evidence is overwhelming and that's what concerns me every day I see this in the newspapers and yet I don't see us being serious about this\nUh what is it about it is I mean here it is you've got the expansion of\nMilitary islands ah they've been rather aggressive as you mentioned\nInvesting some two trillion dollars to uh do favors for country but it's ... ... for other countries but his quid pro quo and it is um you know to ... is all with the endgame of enlarging their footprint I mean it's not out of the goodness of their heart they're doing this ... of\nCourse not and and those those ... those leaf which then expanded to thirty four hundred acres\nAcross many islands torture claimed interestingly by the Philippines Taiwan and Vietnam ... which are almost seven hundred miles south of mainland China so it's not as if it's right on the coastline\nA they have armed him up they put\nThe runways for this so they say of cruise missiles they air defense missiles or they have flown strategic bombers out of there and they say protests just like the defense minister did over the weekend or that\nYou know we're doing our stuff in other words we're trying to maintain freedom of navigation through the south China Sea which is a main\nArtery right transportation from India I'm from South East Asia to the United states west coast\nThat's something we've been doing forever and yet the Chinese of course want to control that now we're saying that's not going to happen and yet the confrontations yeah just a week ago the U.S had a Decatur\nWas almost ran\nBy a Chinese warship top forty five feet away and then the open seas that's incredibly dangerous\nMhm yeah exactly I mean these are ... provocative moves and as we mentioned uh you know the thing we're not even talking about here Robert is you know what what kind of uh what kind of meddling into our democratic system are they doing I mean we\nWe put a lot of focus on Russia and but even you know President Trump brought up says hey don't forget China here\nWell of course and there was you know it's it's the Chinese but Russians the Iranians the north Koreans and others that are using a variety of social media outlets\nAnd you know they're hacking skills which they have throngs of people that do this ... they have every intention of creating hey off within our society and of course social media is a great sense because you can put fake news out there you can insight one side or another\nAre now we do about enough job internally but right now we have all the help from the outside world which is trying to create\nTurmoil with in our democratic system so you know that's one of the things that John Bolton was talking to his counterpart in Russia or the other day because we know who's doing it and then the Chinese we've been talking to them as well\nAnd of course the mainstream media is not helping us because this is a more fodder for their cannons are and they're happy to pick up on this and bring any kind of legitimacy to the snake news that's why it's being called out for what it is um robbers we wrap things up here are the take away for your book and of course we're going to have you back because\nWe need to do um you know more in depth to understanding of the lines of evil but right now what he wants to take a wants him to take away and where can they get their hands on your book\nWhile I get the book on Amazon or Barnes Noble or defender publishing these are these are dire times worse than the old Cold War bill and it's something that people have got to wake up and be careful about it because our leaders but they need God and guiding\nWithout a doubt lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis on Bill Maher tennis like Arnold thank you as always an honor to have you with us appreciate that take care\nAmerica walls your high Canada

I. L. M. in Wilmington have joined the board but is it gives you a show about\nNinety percent of my voice back after another day of rest I'm so glad that I got it back in time for the last year we got from the election and the Republicans are looking very very good in the Senate and they have a fighting chance in the house this is not the blue wave that had been forecast\nLater in the program we'll be joined by Senator Tom cotton to talk about outlooks on the Senate map and Marsha Blackburn who's going to be elected to the Senate in Tennessee she pulled away from Phil Bredesen pretty significantly [noise]\nI don't think the Republicans are going to lose any seats I think Martha McSally is going to hold on to Jeff Flake seat fairly easily in Arizona it's all split her way and I've been looking at the internal models down there\nAnd I I Would expect her to win by six seven points or Marsha Blackburn is pulled away double digit went in Tennessee Dean Heller it's much much closer and uh it's dog fight but he can do it he's very very likeable there in Nevada so they hold on to their fifty one to start with\nBen Kevin Cramer beach\nHeidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and nobody even argues that that's a double digit when Josh Hawley has pulled away from Claire McCaskill in Missouri Mike Braun has established a significant a statistically significant lead in Indiana that's three pickups then we get to the debt each Rick Scott in Florida against income and Bill Nelson\nBut I think Governor Scott as helping himself and read it by just being a great governor Matt Rosendale the auditor or Montana Jon Tester and that's one that's very very difficult to guess because of the polling has been so elusive\nVery difficult to pull Montana the president's going back there and of course John tester voted against Brett Kavanaugh and most of Montana likes the second Amendment rights\nJohn James is surging and Michigan Mike Pence was there yesterday Bob Hugin has pulled within five in New Jersey which is extraordinary impact Morsi who was on the show yesterday competitive in West Virginia though by it's going to be great and the Senate and then what happened yesterday a gift\nAgain because I had been under the weather I've spent a lot of time just watching and reading on my back every ... new book the corrosion of conservatism I'm reading for later in the show today Jim ... new book I'm just reading lots of different stuff but I watch a lot of cable keep my eye on MSNBC boxing and\nThen yesterday when fall on\nThe left wing media went forward\nAnd it's in the Washington Post this morning if you want to know a summary of what the left thinks about you if you're a center right voter if you're an independent or Republican\nCapital ramble mycologist opposed for I write a column as well wrote a call and tell you the title of which as Trump isn't to blame his entire party it begins\nThe White House says it's unfair to blame President Trump for our poisonous increasingly violent political atmosphere and you know what rights Catherine Rampell their rights Trump isn't to boy his entire party is because it never had the reckoning it needed\nAfter the twenty sixteen election do you understand what that means that means Catherine Rampell writing on behalf of the entire left wing media establishment and the Democratic party thanks you are a murderer neo Nazi pipe bomb sending scum\nThat's what it means that is what they think of you that that's why I think they're going to get the surprise of their life again on Tuesday night because Americans are not neo Nazi pipe bomb sending people they are deeply wounded\nGrieving with their friends in Pittsburgh but they do not know they may not be cover religion is but they are co citizens and they are rallying to them and they reject pipe bombs and they were jak attacking senators and restaurants and they reject firing the shots in the Republican\nHeadquarters in ... County Florida they reject it all and the idea of attempting to assign that that\nCrazy action of a tiny infant that's a little sliver of the three hundred thirty million Americans to ordinary Americans is repulsive\nAnd they are going to vote that repulsion that revulsion\nAt the polls meanwhile and by the way you can watch the clip them about the play over here you are at dot com we have a live stream from the studio and we have the clips ready for you\nIn the meantime President Trump went on Laura Ingraham show last night on Fox News to talk about some of the recent rhetoric here's what he first had to say about the mainstream media ... number one\nAnd it was a woman who was just kind of CNN a short while ago saying that you have a radicalized more painful than I that was ...\nWell that must be some kind of a sick woman when I say the enemy of the people I'm Talking about the fake news and you know better than anybody he let news out there that shows fake\nAnd I can do the greatest thing have or North Korea as an example we would have been going to war normally would have been going to war with North Korea I think President Obama would have gone to war very he had an extra year he would be in right now a war with North Korea he told me it was by far and I'm not knocking them for this he said is by far the biggest problem\nLook at what we've done and yet when they talk about North Korea they say what's taking so long line of the other day you know what I mean anyone to Seventy ... some odd years\nAnd they say ... I left I left Singapore where we had our meeting where we really had a very good meeting and a good relationship [noise] like what four months ago they said in ... seconds so long I say we\nPlay help

Marine Corps marathon I Want to see where David I'm director finishes in the ... because\nAh they're a thousand possible points and thousands of people were playing mentor mad as over your ... name in there somewhere but any of that the um [noise] I get I Want to walk people through I think that as a blow out first of all David ... has collapsed and there isn't much of a governor's campaign dah du she's gonna win by more than double digits\nSecondly the early voting is our plus ten ... ten\nThat is not necessarily going to hold up I cannot imagine a Republican voter voting for Christian send them a over mark the ... like you might for example\nIn a in West Virginia right maybe they like Joe Manchin because they've known Joe for a hundred years but\nA Republican voter an Arizona David ... is not going to vote for Chris incentive agree or disagree\nNo look I disagree I think it's very possible that you're going to find a moderate Republican woman in the Phoenix suburbs it's going to vote for us to shut the door just are hurting quaint against Donald Trump but I think that's very possible so\nI didn't agree I I think that is the most beltway the invention checking I talked about the tide and I talked about this last week the invention in the beltway mind of a moderate Republican woman who was going to throw away their vote on a senator because they don't like Donald Trump I mean have you met such a\nYes I Know lots of that list serves the argument that there weren't such people that were gonna vote for Donald Trump he was crazy and set up a bunch of weird things I've you know but\nThat's different from that argument if the argument is I I haven't seen anyone yet and maybe a report their name and we can get them on the air of a moderate Republican woman who is going to vote against Martha ... Sally the first female combat pilot because she doesn't like Donald Trump it doesn't make any sense it's irrational\nIt makes it makes it yeah well voting is not always what everybody thinks it's rational but these sorts of things happen all the time I think Martha McSally\nA very likely could when I Am just saying that it is not incredulous that there are Republican women out there or some people they consider themselves Republicans that usually votes Republican for Congress that are going to go into the booth\nLooked for Doug juicy because Garcia is completely out of whack but that was on a federal issue they're going to take a different mindset into the booth and they're going to say to themselves but I'm going to vote this way on this race I think it's possible\nI think I I think we see this all the time where on on federal or state or federal issues voters make different calculations and so I just said don't rule it out\nAnd when you have polling that's anywhere from you know a few points this way to a few points that way it indicates that there's a close race but I think Martha mix Sally very well could win I like the crowds sentiment has had a horrible few weeks and so I'm not going to try and look for the Charlie way they're just telling\nYou mean by going to win by ... which she wins by more than five points favorite director let's look back at this conversation because they close it isn't even close that's why I I have a problem with I don't know Manhattan audio late\nI don't think that's just dealt women have media elite look I talked to people in Arizona note ... who are known Sally want her to win and they are the ones telling me this is a close race they're the ones that are not only do big blowout everybody's getting this wrong so so\nLow I five percent plus and I talked to the Republican pollsters that you talk to and and and when I see an NBC poll that is a hundred percent off I think to myself the media is trying to resuscitate a dead our parents\nAmerica is your high Canada on the release acted on com studio and got about Ninety percent of my voice back after fighting the bug for two weeks and so great to be able to finally talked without wheezing\nJoined by Loni Chen die David and dance Seventy thousand over institution always someone what am I go to analysts as we get close to an election which is a week out line here look at the numbers and I'm very very very optimistic about the Republicans in the Senate and I'm not resigned are losing their houses I was a month ago what say you\nKnow I'm In the exact same places you are I think Republicans look very very good in the Senate fight this is something that we always thought would happen as we got closer to the race that some of these races would settle out and I think we're seeing that for sure\nYou know the house is really a toss up I I I think it's one of those things where it's very difficult to predict exactly what the margin is going to be\nWhere I think Republicans are going to be competitive coming into the stretch run here on the house side but the Senate does look very good question about it\nNow what are the things that ah that I Want to always report objective way my audience ... NBC and mirrors put out a poll this morning that shows Kristin cinema up five points over Martha McSally now I have seen the internal polling from a Republican pollsters in Arizona the early voting was ten plots are\nThey use a five plus our model for the electorate and Martha McSally wins by five and a half percent under that model and so they're under estimating the actual Republican turnout\nThan I Do not believe Arizona is going to vote for radical and you know Arizona pretty well what do you think\nYou're right I think there's a few factors you're the first of all absolutely the data I've seen as well from Arizona suggest that the early vote has come in I had to pay for Republicans in other words if you compare early vote in things in two thousand any team rushes early vote in two thousand sixteen\nThings are looking favorable in two thousand Eighteen even as opposed to twenty sixteen cycle which was a ... which was a good cycle for Republicans Arizona\nThe second point is is just the fact that it's just in cinema\nI mean not only is this someone who has seen fit to criticize Arizona and Arizona ends\nBut someone who's record is is really from the far left and I think when people really sit down and they think about what the choices are you a market next Sally decorated combat veteran somebody who has represent the people of Arizona well\nVersus someone like his cinema who who's record is really quite out of touch\nI tend to think that even the late breaking voters will settle in favor of marketing Sally don't get me wrong it's going to be a close race I think five it's a little bit dramatic margins from Sally I think she when she was more in that two to three point range\nBut I just have a very difficult time seeing the people of Arizona voting for kids to the cinema someone who's so fundamentally is out of touch with the values of the people of\nArizona along the I don't know if you've played our mid term madness game yet but I'm hoping that you will go over to Europe dot com and play it because I well I I I Believe the margin of victory two people have to pick the winners and twenty five racist but they also have to pick margin of victory\nAnd I'm going to do plus for for Martha McSally which we have you know under one one to three and plus for a margin of victory and I think it's going to be so much easier than people believe ... but that there is a built in desire in the media\nI mean deeply ingrained almost subconscious to make racist competitive when they are not when they hit the wall and it's sort of like Todd Akin hitting the wall in St Louis Christian cinema is the Democrats topic and she just absolutely ran her boss right into our offer the Grand Canyon cliff and and there is no way\nTo recover from that it's like Todd Akin talking about voluntary rape or six years ago and you just can't come back from that let me talk to you though about the met a thing that's going on here Democrats were panicked or a week ago because of the cabinet in fact Israel and by the way it continues to be real\nAh people were disgusted by what they did to Brett Kavanaugh along comes the crazy bomber David French calls him a super fan I call him a during psychopath oceans Thirteen would be bombs and there were bombs to targets and then comes the neo Nazi Trump hating massacre of Pittsburgh Jews\nI think Democrats are hoping that the jar to the country will somehow jar the election\nAnd Catherine Rampell writes in the Washington Post today this almost ... to me\nThe White House says it's unfair to blame President Trump for poisonous increasingly violent political atmosphere and you know what their rights Trump isn't to blame his entire party is because it never had the reckoning it needed after the twenty sixteen election\nNow I Believe she sincere and I believe most of the elite media believes that but I think that absolutely is repulsive to the ordinary American what do you think Loni jet\nI not only is it is it repulsive but it it it just defies reason this notion that somehow\nBecause you've got Republicans that have tried to work together with President Trump in advancing an agenda for the American people that somehow or because they their responsibility for what is clearly fundamentally the responsibility of at the range the man\nWho set pipe bombs through the through the u._s. mail and and and they and they of course and filled with hatred\nWho committed in my mind it I forgive black and so I look this is part of the media narrative you get it you understand it at some point it was always going to get here how is it that the folks in the media are going to figure out a way to try and blame Republicans to turn the election\nAnd I think you're I think you're seeing that now the question is whether it's going to work or not and I'm just I'm I'm not sure that will ... I mean I see the narrative out there I see a lot of people trying to make this case\nUh but I but I just don't see it I think at the end of the day it's election particularly on the house side it's just going to be a whole lot closer than people think\nAnd you know we'll see what the outcome is but I I I I just think the American people are going to come back to the fundamentals here which are strong economy\nA lot of accomplishment that Republicans can rest their record on ... and you've got a lot of Democrats running that are fundamentally out of touch\nAnd and I also believe always in the fundamental common sense of the American voter they realize if they don't like Donald Trump\nVoting for example for Christian sentiment is not the response\nYou empower the responsible Republican Senate led by Mitch McConnell you don't empower radical left us and I think there is um a I'll call it the bounce back in fact people notice when they use aspirin for example in their nasal congestion the more you use of the worse it gets\nThe more crazy rhetoric the crazier gets this is Julie I off with Jake Tapper last night's among Sanders David Urban onset as well\nGive a listen to this cut number six\n... I think you know the fact that at one of the things that school where they launched his presidential run on it talking about Islamic radicals radicalization and\nHow can it has radicalized Sal many more people than I did I mean the way he talks the wasteful waste that says it is to stop\nRight there that was David Urban looking just amazed and perplexed as I did now she later apologized they stopped the show they let her come back and do a clean up on Iowa will be but none have when you get stuff like that you realize the Democrats are unhinged\nYeah I mean this is the problem with with where we are now is that you know look we saw a special about whether we were we could like president\nAt times to take take a different time I think that's entirely appropriate critique but for some reason I think people on the left believe that it allows them to to just say things that are completely ridiculous and by the way she thought the only one who's been saying you know things like this notion that somehow\nOr you know we we we we ought to pay or what's happening\nWith his lot Islamic terrorism abroad\nTo to some of what we see here the act you're a despicable make no mistake but trying to draw these comparisons trying to get to use these parallels to attack\nThe president of the Republican Party is it is just off base that I have to say I do think it is a function of the time we find ourselves in his rhetoric become acceptable\nLet me play for you I'm Marsha Blackburn had a rally yesterday but she began with a moment of silence for the victims in Pittsburgh this is what happened cut number eight\n\nA radical left is interrupted a moment of silence for a for victims to do that and Marsha Blackburn was done she took to Twitter last night I think Tennessee will be revolted by this is why I think that\nThat crazy woman who did that destroyed Bill Bryson any chance of his coming back because it's it's scary it's actually kind of their unhinged\n[laughter] yeah I mean in in in that race in particular Phil Bredesen was already a cook you know if if he could be any more cooked after that I you know I mean you certainly is I think I think I think people see that and they\nWant it does is it makes clear for them what what the face of liberalism is like it makes clear to them what the alternative is edited and it is scary look I think people people like checks and balances in general we seen this over and over again\nTo get money out of it you want to buy a house you're a senior citizen you want to reverse mortgage or a veteran you want one hundred percent financing Andrew and Todd dot com there was fear Pacific mortgage lenders are 'cause it's not a call center\nCalled limit of electrical at eleven Seventy two I think they're going to Andrew and Todd dot com after a couple of questions\nThere'll be right back to the dog got slammed again down two hundred and forty five points the NASDAQ down a hundred and Seventeen\nAnd ... market it's alright again there will be as off twenty but as that goes off hundred and fifty four and the ... off another two hundred and Seventy seven the corruption continues I'll be right back America stay tuned Andrew and Todd dot com during the break it's your your child [noise]\nYou're in the middle of a nonstop action packed information ... coming right back [noise]\n...

Washington Post by Catherine Rampell Trump isn't to blame his entire party as this represents the left actually the White House says it's unfair to blame President Trump were poisonous increasingly violent political atmosphere and you know what their rights\nTrump isn't to blame she writes his entire party is because it never had the reckoning it needed after the twenty sixteen election\nI think she accurately represents the left and the media is point of view and that that is a Republican to most Americans what do you think senator\nHere that that kind of rhetoric is what part of the most Americans I don't know who described her as a but the only person to blame for that kind of horrific shooting we saw\nIn Pittsburgh on Saturday as shooter ... anti Semite um who should be locked up for the rest of his life not put a ... uh the person that sent those suspicious packages last week or the blame there just as hot as a former Bernie Sanders volunteers person the blame\nFor all the killings elites and who knows how many other Republican congressman he would've killed if it hadn't been for two you're brave Capitol Hill police officers\nLet me play for you the height of Trump's arrangements syndrome is Julia Ioffe off last night with Jake Tapper on CNN cut number six\nTo agree with you there I think you know that's pack and at one of the things that hole where they launched his presidential run on a ... of radicalization and the president has radicalized sell them any more people than I anticipated signs up\nRight there she would later come back and apologize for that remark I Want to be fair to wear because they got hammered on the air when she said that but Tom Cotton that anyone could even give voice to that without stopping to show immediately in and said dismissing someone from the sec is amazing to me [noise]\nThat you remember this is the same woman who accused Donald Trump of sleeping with his daughter a couple of years ago\nUm I Can't imagine that in a respectable journalistic outlet would want to be associated with someone like that are like these authors who met you I think sometimes they view themselves as heroes and there are internal morality play\n'em there Saturday inside the beltway New York buffalo like stuff like that and understand that a lot of Americans uh for the president's agenda they believe the economy is growing stronger because we want our tax code and reform of regulatory system that are healthier as strong as ever that Americans are expected again in the world I understand that\nA very well in the Upper East side of Manhattan or in the airline but there are millions and millions of Americans across the country and places like Arkansas that actually do believe that they support the president or the Republican Party and it's ... like the campaign against us kind of went back to the white or for that kind of writer is really a cult\nOr and and I wonder how do we fix the media I think media is poisoning America and I I Try and bring on left right and center and try to be civil with everybody and you're always civil and all the Republicans and John Kerry a civil and people are civil but\nI
