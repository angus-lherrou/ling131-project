{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "Now that's very true uh West Nile virus as you pointed out is very popular in the news right now a lot of people are hearing about it um there's a spectrum of how the disease can affect people a large portion of people who get bit by mosquitoes that have the west Nile virus contained in their saliva\nActually don't contract any symptoms um the next step up would be people experiencing something like a mild fever body aches a little bit of nausea some upset stomach\nAlmost like a flu like syndrome but on the far end of the spectrum as the more serious presentation of West Nile virus which would include things like\nHigh fever next if mass confusion and these people often are so sick that they need to be hospitalized\nI Will get into all that let's back up a bit to these mosquitoes they're out there and they tend to I guess a are more active at dawn in dusk\nSuit who's kind of a time angle and some advice for folks on kind of minimizing exposure right\nExactly so the first thing and the name of the game Israeli prevention or when it comes to us now you want to avoid the mosquito bite to begin with and then you can track disease or as you pointed out there more active in the early morning and the early evening hours I sort of that\nTransition time that they become more active and they start to feed\nSo what you want to do is take extra precautions against mosquitoes and that includes things like avoiding areas that standing water if you have standing water on your property\nThan clearing that out so that it's not a unknown breeding ground for mosquitoes are wearing long sleeves long pants and especially using mosquito repellent if you're going to be outdoors in those areas\nAnd those mosquito repellents I've heard the word deep inside of chemical in their\nFeet is a chemical that is a tried and true it's been proven to be the gold standard and the most effective way of preventing mosquitoes\nAnd what I advise my patients in my clinic is to look for a a deep containing repellent that contains at least ten percent to eat\nI ten percent you're just joining us to talk of the young is with us internal medicine specialist in Long Beach with monarch healthcare we're talking about ways to avoid West Nile virus but there are some people more at risk\nThan others people who may have what compromised immune systems take us into the the group that seems to get this\nAbsolutely so the populations that are most at risk I have a very young and the very old so when I say very young\nAnd infants I'm just brand new babies are at risk and then as an internal medicine doctor I don't see children but the other end of the spectrum which are the patients over the age of fifty or sixty are also at risk for developing the more serious form of West Nile virus or West Nile and federal light us\nUm and also patients who have compromised immune systems that would include people with cancer people with things like HIV or people with\nHistory of organ transplant who are on him you know suppressing medication\nAnd generally people over the age of sixty five or with diabetes\nEasy pretty rare in your in your practice anecdotally have you seen someone who is to use the technical term presented with these symptoms and did you do any testing to turn out to be West Nile virus what what's the practical the numbers are they actually very small\n[noise] that's a good question so I have anecdotally seen cases of West Nile virus I practice in a clinic in Long Beach but I also see patients in the hospital and the way that you can find really the only way you can test and confirmed West Nile virus is to take a sample of patients\nCerebral spinal fluid now that's the fluid that's in the spinal cord and you run it through an analysis a laboratory test checks for the west Nile antibody that's really the the gold standard and the only way to absolutely can from the\nThat disease but you have a clinical suspicion you wonder if they have the disease if they have the symptoms I mentioned a fever next fifth mass confusion or even going into the point of being comatose and if you have a history of being in those areas with mosquitoes hiking things like that\nBut the interesting thing I understand is so once you do this tested if somebody tests positive for it and they have these symptoms what exactly is the treatment do we actually have some sort of anecdote\nThat's another good question so there is no absolute antidote for the virus there is no anti viral medication that specifically for West Nile at this time or the milder forms of the disease can be treated with\nOver the counter pain relievers a Tylenol mode trend things like that which can reduce the fever body aches but if you have the more severe form it can lead to a [noise]\nA disease process called sepsis and back can involve your other organ systems can be severely dehydrated and need intravenous fluid replacement at which would require hospital and then supportive care and close observation under a doctor and nurse in a hospital setting\nSo when do we know when to go to a doctor or not because I mean people don't really like going in and list they have to I guess you're going to feel pretty lousy if you come in\n[noise] yes that is that is true I buy my patience to reach out to our office if really if they have any question our concern but what you're really looking for is if you have the more severe symptoms severe headache\nHigh fever next deafness are sometimes you may not noticed is that your loved ones are those around you may notice that you're more confused agitated especially somewhat over the age of sixty five major start to act\nDifferently and you're not sure why they're acting sort of odd or off that's when I Would really advised to call your health care provider or if it's really concerning an error very worried I Would advise you to go to the emergency room that's really the main point I Want to get across the today\nShow some of the symptoms sounded like flu symptoms things that people might get others sound different you've got to kind of analyze what he's ... he's probably the case there\nAbsolutely and sometimes even for the doctor it's difficult to differentiate between\nAn actual flu and the case of West Nile are the only way that you're really going to find out is by doing that test we talked about what the cerebral spinal fluid but people who have mild cases of West Nile\nWe usually don't get to that point because the good news with West Nile in these milder cases is it will go away on I found you may feel fatigue for an extra week or two it may take a little while to get back to a hundred percent\nBut at the good news is that it does work its way out of your system for most people are just naturally\nThat's good to hear that in terms of the young is with us empty and internal medicine specialist in Long Beach with the monarch healthcare graduated from us She's kicked school of medicine Tony fourteen so voice is always the best thing here and we're here in Southern California with great whether\nWe like to wear shorts and short sleeved shirts that may not be the best pulled into where right\nAbsolutely when it comes to West Nile if you're going to be in areas wooded areas areas with standing water like lakes ponds there's a lagoon not far from our office\nI advise my patients that if you're going to be wearing those kind of close you should absolutely have their talent on but the the gold standard and the best way to prevent is to have those long sleeve long path to avoid the by altogether and that's how you're absolutely got prevent that disease of West Nile\nSandy Springs with the deep the different chemicals that you can get to protect yourself a pliable and a young children to\n[noise] yeah they have been shown to be safe and young children so what you want to do as\nA cover their mouth and nose especially in little kids they can't participate as well but at the most common reaction if you get any reaction to those types of ... pounds it'd be a mild skin irritation but they're generally very safe and the population\nAnd put it on pretty heavy I mean ... how many seconds would you be applying the spray if you were putting it on yourself\nThat would say if I'm doing it myself probably three or four seconds are applying to any given area\nOh okay so it's not just one little spray it's a good one to three next through one two three and it's got to be on two levels were maybe you can smell it kind of like yeah you\nWill smell it it does have a classic older\nLet's recap here should people be concerned we were seeing these see tell these usually they involve somebody would older compromised immune system and they should the rest of his not worry for younger or be concerned how do you how do you set your worry level\nThat's a good question I I never want to instigate panic in my patients and so I don't want people to hear me saying that everyone should be worried about West Nile virus but I Do want the public to know that it is a potentially serious disease and while it does affect\nMore indoor Air America\nVoice challenge to us from Pittsburgh today\nFrom the studios of am twelve fifty the answer I'm On the battlefield soccer

that you\nWell this is this reminds me of the late Jimmy Roosevelt\nAh came to the defense of Social Security Thirty years ago I started don't touch my Social Security and it took off and I think don't touch my Medicare dot com it's going to take up the same way because most senior Israeli they pay for this band wherever they've actually paid for this the idea of expanding it to every American is just not\nGoing to take money away from seniors and give it to everybody else and the way they're going to do it is they're going to ration care just like in Canada just like in Great Britain\nThan it is not a minority position there are Seventy Democrats who have put their name on Medicare for all bill a there is Bernie and I think he's got one third of the Democrats in the Senate I think he's going to run for president on this a Mac is kind of I had a best what's the response spin that don't touch my Medicare dot com\nAmazing we did a poll and it was like Ninety percent of the bus\nShow up

R. P. lettuce down during the Obamacare fight I don't even know of a A R P has has voiced opposition yet to the\n... river of it they know just that they didn't endorse Bernice plan but they suggested that it's something we should look at which is I think we the U.S hopefully that looked at it and now that they may turn around and be against it but right now they're saying it's something we should look at\nThem ever I have never understood I have never understood A. R. P. but I'm Glad that a Mac exist would you explain why you started the association which are American citizens\nWell I saw how a lot of things happening there was ruining our society it was really a shame and when I realized\nFor example a A R they supported Obama Care now why would they do that when there was going to hurt seniors their Memphis loved the plans if they had everyone loved their doctors and everyone lost their plans and lost their doctors and they they are paid like the Sierra Club\nHas been taken over by a bunch of ultra left is\n... and people like Medicare plus they like their Medicare Advantage plans I Know a lot of seniors I Will soon be there I'm a few years away after meeting a Medicare Advantage plan but all soon be there I don't want it destroyed I think most Americans are on the same page here Dan Weber\nIs and it's just up to folks like you and I to get it out to the public you know when the American people are presented with the facts they will make the right decision\nThat's absolute you know if you go over to don't touch my Medicare dot com and as I pledge to vote to save my Medicare and bring a senior to the polls and you're asked her name and email and then you will keep them informed on now to be effective as the election approaches and how's the response been good that\nUnbelievable it's terrific uh it and people are thanking us for letting them know that they said you know it's ... it's so good and then when you spell out what the consequences are now I'm rooting for him and now I'm definitely going to be against a Bernice Medicare for all\nOh ... dollars in costs you know our national debt which I talked to Alan Greenspan about last week it's the biggest problem he thinks we have one in ... and we have to service the debt at Nineteen trillion Bernie would double it it would it would have trouble with it\nAnd it's just again it's the way a lot of the results of liberal saying they think oh witness being nice and then they don't like how to do it\nAnd it just doesn't work that way you know like free food free housing free college free medicine free everything but certainly it's got to pay for it and they don't work that out they just ignore that step\nAnd in this case they'll pay for it by taking money that people have donated their entire life they paid into Medicare their entire life without a cap\nAnd it will be bankrupt if we go for the British program dead Weber good good work I think God don't touch my Medicare dot com has inspired I Want everyone to get involved in it I have long valued by association with a Mac they're great sponsor of the program but this is the most important thing they've ever done\nMorning glory America ...
