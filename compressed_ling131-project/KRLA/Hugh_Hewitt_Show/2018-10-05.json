{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "Um factor there was that was that scene with a Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan in the restaurant\nOr just to be a little bit off there for a minute how she was yeah a getting all exercised about stuff in a in fact was rub runners mom who says hey I Want with that grocery [laughter] so yeah he was you know but but you know ... you know people can act and seem very uh very believable\nBut what we've confused in our culture today is just because it's believable doesn't mean that is credible and I got real ... I was real concern when our president used the word credible\nUh it's something to say okay well somebody has a believable story\nBut credible means that it's backed by evidence I mean words matter and so the president says is credible so Cory Booker says there's credible eldest senator saves credible how can you say it's credible when you know there's no evidence there to back it up\nBut what our kids need to understand is that in the court of public opinion there's no due process you're guilty period I mean there's no guilty until presumed innocent because that\nIs you know that's what people need to understand that's why your reputation is so important\nYet and we see more and more lies separate thing and the whole reason behind what she's doing and the thing that that meant so many people who are victims of rape or a sexual attacks on whatever matter\nIt's like you have to believe every woman if you're lying then other people are going to question if someone else's really telling the truth or not when they are so it really really trashed at both sides of the situation is very sad situation ad just because her story to be believable by\nWomen were I don't understand the cat the women that are tacky different people on the street ... who is that guy that it's a Charlie Charlie\nWhat's his name that guy that's always been fun of all these different he goes right into where everybody's having a boycott and holding up signs and Kirk\nTurning point USA so I I mean I'm I'm not getting our meeting he's awesome he goes into all we're all these women are upset and holy fighting with a doctor for story he'll go in and say well what about what you just do ... what the managed to be innocent until proven guilty not the opposite you\nKnow and there there's like being in a base there people are ripping up science and I'm like you know what what if you guys are wrong what is he isn't it that because his story what very believable any mhm yeah\nAnd that's the thing that's and that's the thing see there's this isn't a you know and I and then this whole situation about well it's not it's not a quarter ... certainly it's not a quarter law that's why Senator Grassley you know to digress even a little bit further here a because there's lots of things to talk about from the ... counterculture mom\nBut is that um the Republican should never pick this up what should have happened is that look at you need to take that to the local court we can't adjudicate that we're not going to we're not going to open this up this job interview to the court of public opinion but\nSoon as Grassley and the Republicans picked it up I go oh my God we're in a bucket of gum here\nThey're they're not going to get out of this because this is he said she said and at the end of the day even with Jeff like trying to say well in the spirit of trying to unify our country let's go ahead and let's go ahead and have a seven to a investigation it's All right so it looks like he might be a little bit right\nBut the fact the matter is is that we're still tribe old\nAnd a you've got a distinct differences because people either believe judge Kavanaugh or they don't they hardly believe Dr Ford who now we find out may not even be a doctor after all the credentials are suspicious so I don't know I mean all this stuff is coming out and it just makes it makes me sick\nOr die and and and I'm thinking me you know and I'm In it and and everybody else you know this by this exactly exactly and\nBut the thing I always look at too is\nIf you if judge Kevin I set the first time that she came out with Iraqi they sent he immediately said let's go to trial right now\nNo an innocent person would say that a guilty person would never say that like I like watching crime so too because you look at the person that can be in a crime and I want to kill the the way they act\nAnd what they say and how they respond right away I mean it's it's pretty easy to see it but so the fact that you want to go to trial right away to prove it and it's been told me she then is that right\n[noise] well he knew he knew he had to put a fire out as quickly as possible that this was going to get other states his family his reputation everything he built up\nI mean already what Harvard says hey we don't want you back in ... when you're you know we don't want you here teaching you're not part of the talk of the faculty any longer so now based on an accusation this is what we've become\nForget about the rule of law it's now guilt by accusation and\nWrapping their arms around yeah I didn't even hear that knew that going oh can you know\nYeah yeah he's he's not gonna he's not he's no longer welcome to teach there so that ... anyway let's let's get on to some of these things last man standing a good debut a new network I loved him Alan hey I'm ... and even looks better on this new somewhere to lie and it was a great from a bit\nI think it's so funny I Know in Iraq like I'm like you guys are going to regret doing what and what can they do and the funny thing was going through all kinds of all I think what you mean by that they'll file that finally got transferred me for that like it's been a great at my addict\nAnd I was just looking at that time I met and now that he didn't work so like Fifteen Years ago and it when he talked to a cool guy look awesome but this guy the great actor\nConservative loved the marathon a lot of people and I think millions of fans got behind them and said hey that cannot calculate shell somehow got pick it up and they did because we ... than we the people talking about it'd be a big\nBig most smart move by Fox no doubt about it I'm I'm a little bit jealous here you had a chance to go to the premier Little Women I wanted to see this and I and I know Tim winter too so I'm a blessing I was at what happened and then I'll come you know you forgot about me here\nWell I got to connect back but I didn't know you get ... way back here and that might happen with them start well because we're already talking about having a barbeque and he he loved Franklin area came for a little bit talking about like oh yeah yes and that\nYeah you need to come out on the Internet because last time I had um a Hollywood in fired all parts so that gets and at the time than ours don't know five minutes interrupted and um\nThe movie I Can't say enough about it now we need positive down so that people are hungry in fact\nOne theater were on that they held for selling and then you wonder what happened about thirty minutes if I thought it was completely back to open another poll theater and that one was almost completely back oh well I'm a\nPeople want positive movies and it's such a good movie of course I don't want to go on strike hit no one watched the movie before or you know read the book\nBut give us a give us a quick quick summary of the movie Little Women because I've heard a lot about it\nAnd uh you know and in fact usually 'cause it's a new group that has been promoting this movie and I guess maybe that was a little bit of the breakdown because normally all these movies or they come on the show we interview a challenge and ah and promoted\nUm but ah I heard about it just right on the on the evidence so anyway so tell us really quickly a Little Women\nYeah well I don't want to blow the big story line but there is a force that grow up it's so cool how they\nAre by her side encourage each other for great and that sort of the ... the ... the battle it out because they don't want to do it on their life because she wants to be a mom and not be some big\nFamous person like the other ... there but they walk this tree to gather their modestly dressed as a couple of party scene that want to parents about yet you'll make it through you know they're not going to send you don't want your kids to see right out the situation because I got nervous at first by the way that one girl just or\nStuck in this scenario most young girls what can you tell go down the wrong cat and she stopped I got ... ... what ... what was going on with her all happening to her and got out that hard it's the way that I was like yeah\nBecause a lot of girls are going to learn from that when they see that movie rattling on making right places even when you're in the ... uh what could be the worst situation of your life\nWill this trend this transition to this next story Tina real quick only goes to try and make some time here we've got about a minute got up and that's the story of this high achiever chained to commit suicide or tell us about that\nYet and they're going to go to the theater Portland State in the theaters longer and look up for every girl campaign to parents called the council that for every campaign for all young girls it's\nAll about having a clean positive uplifting entertainment or women at that they're portrayed as amazing people in ... we have to do that we have to say exactly on the last thing\nI forgot to ask you about the high achiever chain that committed suicide\nOkay it's on my Facebook page counter culture not paid paid also download my ap I had the information that our culture mom\nAnd you look at all about the secret straight he didn't commit suicide her parents were stocked up the journal that was written up that they put a bunch of stuff in there that the ...
