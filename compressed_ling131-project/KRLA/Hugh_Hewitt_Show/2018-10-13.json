{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "[laughter] yeah that's true and I'm probably like we're going to talk about this morning it's not happening here in the U. S. but\nChristians are being accused here as not being extremist or um haters are bigots and um but certainly we're yeah we're not and and the place where they are overseas and other places where Christians are really being seriously persecuted\nWell I I mean on on some degree Jeff I agree with you it almost seems like a you know we are dealing with the hang nailed compared to what other questions that you see these\nOthers that had been persecuted that I mean are you you you read the voice of the martyr and you hear the stories that uh you know true martyrs they're the face they're going through and um you know when you go cash what do we complaining about\n'em and you know that's one thing but the other deal this most concerning right now is the lack of civility\nThe political environment is torching our culture and is creating a war and division amongst its people\nAre dead is very dangerous that puts us on a road\nTo a ... some of these countries have been doing where it just becomes so autocratic and I know it's hard for people to proceed that they were they said well this is America but you know ah here we are politically talking about socialism values\nAnd I'm just about every socialist country that I'm aware of a meal may say unintended but they ended up you know overpowering the people and try to get everybody to think the same way and forget about any kind of liberty\n[laughter] that's right we see um [noise] yeah we see that around the world where they're trying to I'm compelled speech to be a certain way and we have and I'm seeing that here in the U. S. I Know in California\nI'm ... ... right at the Supreme Court struck down just in June and was trying to compel I'm pro life centers to tell their clients about abortion and direct them to abortion centers and so here you have the government here trying to compel speech and thankfully that was struck down\n[noise] well and of course uh you know right before that you got Dave delight and who are videotapes a Planned Parenthood or officials selling baby parts which I'm In every understanding of the law that I have is illegal\nAnd nothing happened to them But Dave delight and is the one who's being persecuted now he he was um detained he was put in jail his legal fees are mounting and meanwhile the are the people associated with the sale of baby parts\nPlanned Parenthood at all um are roaming around free as if nothing happens so what does that tell ...\nWhat does that telling you know people here in this country and around the world is that you better you know toe up to the party line if not we're going to make it a living hell for you\n[laughter] yeah I I think you're right I mean we can name case after case like that um jak Philips bake in Denver a barren else that's men or the forest in Washington I'm\nEven chick fillet every time they try to build a new restaurant um they're attacked and people are reminded of that their president a few years ago came out in support of marriage between a man and a woman so\nAlong with along with almost eight well over eight million voters in California which by the way all those votes were vacated by the very uh ... ... you know Democratic Party that says well we got to make sure every vote counts\nExcept for the you know again just like the sinking in the speaking as long as it lines up with their politics it's okay but uh you know the heck with the first amendment and that we have any kind of contrary in you and want to exercise the\nLiberties or they were given to us by our U.S Constitution\nYeah I ... I think what it tells as one of the things that tells us is that um as businesses and government and the media um are more and more opposed to the Christian message on\nMy life and sexuality and relationships and marriage there are Christians need to be more and more on guard and um we do need to take a stand for\nA free speech and freedom of religion and those those values that have been such a part of the\nThe American um tradition and are you know what that caller American experiment here because we do need to be on guard for those things are so Christians need to be active and and of course we want to do it um kindly and graciously but we still want to stand up and speak the truth and and do it courageously as well right\nExactly and people of faith need to understand um\nForemost to all this is that you have to war you're up in my watering up you've got a warrior up with those tools that are not\nCornel but the ones that are mighty through God and that is of course a resembled a for us or you know in the full armor of God if you are not\nA armored up with a full armor of God or you're going to be insensitive or you're going to be a little bit of a cloud hopper here because after everything is all said and done you know what his pre eminent in our face is that we love one another and you know it's easy to love the lovable it's the young lovable that are the biggest you know the biggest challenge a chef you know\nNow to this to warn us about that and and called us too it didn't he yes he did all of those who persecute us and\nAnd and and I think people should be encouraged to because we have such\nGreat examples and people like Jack Philips and Baron Hill stats men have been gracious under pressure and they um you know you were talking about the and civility they have not resorted to that kind of in civil language but they've been gracious and kind\nAnd thoughtful and they've expressed their viewpoint and I think I'm there we can be encouraged because those are really really good models for us\nAnd Jeff uh especially encouraged not only by the owners but uh the employees you know when the chick fillet was attacked or the response of the employees were so godly I mean it was um you know I was really proud of the employees in how they came together and trusted in their face\nYou know to a lot of people I I mean the things that some of the customers were saying to the people in challenging them I mean it was like they went out of their way to just to go ahead and ruin somebody's day in torment them\nUp but the response of the employees was admirable and um and I and I drew great courage from watching a ... and I mean these aren't you know these were young girls being attacked Jeff\nI'm now so uh you know it's a sad commentary you know we talk about some of these businesses\nYou know here we simply um in fact I'm having to California tomorrow or and of course one of my favorite stops as soon as I get there is in and out burger and for those of you know ended up or you just comes with the west coast it goes with the west and uh you got to have it in and out burger and they were all upset because uh\nYou know in and out was supporting Republican causes right\nAnd and I had to laugh because I said gosh these knuckleheads looked at the bottom of the cup of their drink and saw a a Christian\nScriptural reference this wouldn't blow their heads up on this but\nI Know I Know there are you know per climbing the gospel and and large and small ways there but yeah and they make cook burgers\nTwo very good very good fries yeah exactly yeah we'll see there's a problem I tell people what ... what are their French fries taste so different I said well because you've been used to McDonald's 'cause they bleach their fries and a you know by the time you tasted it it's got it's got a unique taste I think on one hand marketing wise\nAnd you know quite innovative for McDonalds but on the other hand when you go and you actually have a real potatoes like to do it in and out you go well what is so different about well that's the way potatoes as opposed to taste it do you\nWatch and take those potatoes and split them up into fries and you know you're getting a real deal\nExactly exactly but you know to your point after all is said and done here Jeff is that\nYes Christians that need to understand um hey we're in a culture war we're call to be defenders of the faith to be ready and any season you know to tell your story you know what is that\nUm the ... makes you so joyful and so excited what is it that happened in your life or that uh you know causes me to think that I Want what you have right\nYeah yeah I think we can be um you know like our time at ... we can be gracious under that kind of pressure and display\nUm peace and joy in the midst of all the what seems to be chaos and instability around us and and a lot of that you know it's for mentored by the media and by different politicians and we don't necessarily experience it\nIn our daily lives right when it does hit you you talked about the weapons of our warfare and prayer um\nAnd and responding and love the way to this call this too I think those are all things Christians can do it\nAnd and to your point your Jeff it you know Jesus said if the world hates you keep in mind and hated me first and hate seems to be um you know the are the elements of the day it is intensifying so are you may have been able to avoid a you know attacks\nBy those that hate Christians and have what we stand for because they they don't want to believe in God they don't they don't want to be accountable uh and so ah get ready it's a it's going to intensify I see it getting worse not getting easier job what are you saying [noise]\nYeah I think I mean that's the trigger trajectory where certainly on route ... as well start getting greater and there are more and more of them\nWill just Johnson from focus on the family thank you so much for being with us appreciate a God Bless\nHey thanks so\nBut it was much worse than you I mean Susan Collins was getting death threats that her staff\nWere getting right Brett she

unveiled and by that I mean the leak of a doctor Ford's bladder I don't know who did it but I Believe it was part of a campaign that was set up to occur exactly when it did you agree with me\nTo you I I Believe the humor of political operation was climate they're getting a we learn last week um that a woman named Monica ...

violated the code of legal ethics the perhaps by their own investigation by the bar\nNow when we have a summing up of the consequences of this for weeks at the polls I don't believe Americans are going to forget I think they're going to vote to make sure Mitch McConnell remains the leader in the Senate and Kevin McCarthy the new speaker now do you agree with me that this last this left a mark on American politics\nYes you I think most American republic and uh but as well and and the temple Democrats like Arkansas are all ... ... talk to your mind that that can affect ripped up over the

I'm strongly recommend that you folks here if ... if nothing else it'll make you think and we have to think we just feel it makes you think so it's coming out and how many theaters\nIn at least six hundred theaters and we're adding theaters all the time we've had some problems with theaters too you know ... but you have to be over six hundred theaters and you're right exactly right what you said you know people need to know the need to stop feeling stuff and they need to know things and they actually need to feel things too by the way\nIt's interesting I I was in Ireland you know when they had the referendum there and I met a woman at a party and phone on abortion on the abortion which was two to three so in Catholic higher than two or three people voted for abortion and I met a woman next to you know it's really a shame if no one knows what they voted for it and she said what you mean like I said well they never described it abortion during the debates\nAnd she said but for the relevant so fast [laughter]\nYou know you can't make this stuff up you know I can tell you to pitch Steve I she asked me what the relevance laws of having a description of what you are voting for as part of the conversation and stuff that wasn't a great idea and it's one of the things that were most proud about in the movie than in the movie you know in the court case the jury\nHad to have an education about what the difference between a good abortion was and murder\nAnd it's a chilling section of the movie and it's taken verbatim from the transcripts of the trial and I can tell you that the jury members we spoke to were shocked and appalled by what's legal in America\nWill just for the record as well there were born babies will be killed I mean we're even I have to believe pro choice people would acknowledge it was murder yeah\nBut he didn't use will use women to to you know to to to deliver babies and then he\nWould kill them yes yes exactly yeah so you know it's very interesting you should just no and we have the same position my wife's position is very interesting she would like more than any other law passed\nA law that any woman going for an abortion\nSimply be told about the state of what she's carrying gets rice with just one over the baby a cold or the moon rocks and get sick she picked out of this drug that show yeah and the other words informed consent one hundred percent we tell people how many calories are on their menu oh\nYeah I'm really ... it's really important that when we walk into a hotel in California we find out that there might be some kind of trace

by the way she turns around and said by the way this is my own story a credible story about her what she was having an abortion in Houston and the nurse said to her ... I'm going to leave your for a minute if\nYou need to listen to your babies heartbeat if I'm going to come back to when I Want to start the procedure\nAnd you should have that I live and learn fighter left I tell you ... ... it's against the law it's against the rules I should say and the groceries I put my clothes on and I went out to I went out to the car and people can watch video clips of her life she and she was so much that she stays away for he's five years old now\nAnd she stays awake at night and watches them sleep and she can leave and she could have something so precious\nDespite your passion on the abortion issue and this incredible movie which by the way I Want to just tell you folks each it's not it's it's about a human being it is about by the way I'll tell you what I really think it's about the ... I think the press part in your movie yeah which is important to Seattle\nWash and I totally agree with you yeah and I think there'll be a lot of people who watch the film and be incredibly disturbed\nBy the fact that their immediate thing American media chose not to cover the trial so they'll forgive me I mean forget you know the ... the whole everyone but I mean if you think at the same time and everyone could remember the Jodi Arias with on trial at the same time everyone knew but Jody aureus if I'd like to say\nBut I Do remember that once high as a promotional blimp I got into a bar fight with a former friend and broke his students with a beer bottle\nBack\nWith my writing career was booming I got invited a couple of times to do readings in Amsterdam a bad gig for a plot addict\nOnes after ingesting a couple of THC pills I dumped a pitcher of water over my head and shoulders Iraqi representative to national poetry day Amsterdam\nAnother time I pulled down my pants and flashed a crowd of several hundred if I had any boundaries wheat or raise them thoroughly the boom and my writing career\nEnded fast my son was born in two thousand and two I didn't have an office job so I was around a lot to get high and enjoy the cartoons seat that's scary\nIs that that sounds scary to you I mean I I understand that he's taking care of his son and that's a nice thing I guess\nBut if you're sitting there watching cartoons with your kid and enjoying it because you're so stone that your mind is not functioning\nHe goes on I opened a packet of refers peanut butter cups okay this is a product Germany do you know anything about refers peanut butter cops I can only guess\nI opened a packet of Reefers peanut butter cup said his preschool fundraiser and stunk up the place but hot wasn't just an occasional funny thing for me to do on weekends\nI got stoned the day my son came home from a hospital and I stayed that way with few breaks for a decade and a half of course I put him in danger because I couldn't stop getting high\nI was a drug addict\nLook this is one of those things I mean\nThere's some things that are really really difficult to figure out in the world\nBut honestly if you think about it [noise] think about how much better\nIt is not to be addicted to some substance\nAfter all I Know this is amazing\nWe feel is a passion of [noise]\nI Know you you can't believe that because we're so much more civil for [noise] you don't really believe\nWe feel as passionately about the dentist burger flip the final segment of the tunnel review every moment [noise]\n\nTexture smelly deep fat cheap and easy we've heard those at your trust some assembly line and plant center when they're notorious for using inferior implants that can break can cause permanent damage to your job\nThe truth is that only ... far a great solution for missing teeth when they're done vice which is why even plant center Dennis adds to the doctor re for their own dental implant meet Dr right practices the latest advances and uses only the finest implant so you know your implants are done right\nAnd if you're a bit squeamish fear a lot this doctor a pioneer virtually pain free dentistry what products and techniques that make your dental visits well enjoy it\nAnd if you prefer to sleep during the procedure and awakened with perfect teeth Dr ... how'd you covered that two here first sleep said Asian it's free calling now for your free exam free X rays freeze it Asia and zero percent\nFinancing for twelve months AAA nine tonight smile eight eight eight nine tonight smile Tripoli nine to nine smile\nGo anywhere this morning in the morning after I think progressive stuff goes a little too much and if you have corporate boards and you force a corporation which is what this would do\nThe legislation would come down a corporation for public corporation to put a woman on their corporate board I don't think that that is false ...
