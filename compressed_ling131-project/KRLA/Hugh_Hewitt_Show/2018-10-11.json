Bush he got on the phone call that a church for his former secretary Brett Kavanaugh so that's part of the unity came from the personality\nOf Brett Kavanaugh ... this person that has served in the Bush White House but it's served admirably on the second most powerful chord for twelve years led and exemplary life\nAnd it happens to be someone that is a human being bad you know enjoys being with his friends and having a beer and writing about it and there's high school yearbook exactly so you know ... you know we've got to remember\nThat we already have prominent Democrats saying if they take over the house they want to launch an investigation on Kavanaugh any teacher\nSo if we think this battle is over we're all so we think we can be complacent or wrong and somebody would have to work ... phone banks or you have to walk the streets when you have to get our friends and family to vote we got to have a record turnout could be\n... um you know we have to describe the Democrats are wealthy may have the money they have an incredible amount of money major global as ... billionaires in this world wide George Soros for all on the left\nAnd their funding these various groups\nOr just to you know in California a stalwart member of the house painter were Barker is they actually\nIn trouble to some extent in a easy when district because so much outside money just pouring in to the district and they have one of these fake candidates or what you see all over who pretends to be conservative\nCan run as a Democrat then of course they're going to vote with fancy policy so people have to be aware that the battle why is it has been drawn and eat the you know we don't know which way the waves come and go until election day but we got to make it a red\nKnow without a doubt in that said you know conservatives realized that they didn't\nUh after the last two weeks is that the war is on and is Mitch McConnell said yeah you can be thankful for the Democrats for creating all this habit because it has um waking up or\nYou know the right to where they realize that look at you got to come out and that enthusiasm gap\nIs neck and neck right now is they might say is when it within the margin of error um but of course uh they had a big margin of error when it came to Donald Trump been twenty sixteen so ah got only knows if they're measuring it with any kind of legitimacy\nAll day exactly and there and look at where\nThe Democrats are we saying where they're fighting on every front and there were age ... there's no question the regime and the and actually the thing that made them a loser this battle with the public was the fact that they overplay their hand mhm\nAnd they and they pick up and I had said to you I think it was either a week or a couple of weeks ago one of the M.

I think it's a backlash against the law and then you and other people like the Max Boot of the world the Jennifer ribbons of the world that were put the other way but in terms of the rank and file average\nRepublican voter a lot of people out there around the country they don't really like Donald Trump what they saw Brett Kavanaugh as his do regular\nKind of conservative that Bush and Marco Rubio with a Pecker George W. Bush has the attack on ... what's the baby was totally bogus as an attack on them\nSo this really had a unifying effect a lot of people who don't like Donald Trump who might not bother to turn out in the mid term now very well back but I think the real question is can they keep it going for a lot that we have a month ago and that's a long time at all at the fighter apparently\nCertainly I thought they could\nGo back to the unemployment rate job numbers I mean every single\n\nWhere our writer you broke it up on a limb sorry about that buddy or the or the you guys are out of the road so much that you get into the cell areas where you need your patriot mobile cell but tax cuts work dot com America do get involved in the fight I Do mean that they'll get involved in the I don't want another day go by\nTax cuts work dot com 'cause the tax cuts are on the ballot sway off right on the job good or network as only rallies across the United states registering voters getting people involved twenty six days the election vote early if you can come and right back with major Garrett author of Mr Trump's wild ride stay tuned America\nIn the\nMiddle stop actually she was [noise]\nIf you are an unhappy timeshare owner and gosh knows there are lots of them out there getting out of your time shares probably at the top of your to do list and now that those annual maintenance fees are coming to you probably wish you had a way to get out of that burdensome inexpensive timeshare thankfully my friends at Lone Star transfer can't help\nBut then do for you what they've done for over seven thousand others in fifty states they're process was done legally and ethically and best of all quickly Lone Star transfer also as an a plus rating where the better Business Bureau Brian and care run a family or business\nThere will personally make sure your experience as pleasant what don't let one more year go by with your maintenance face it in you and your pocket book in my friends or copper no obligation\nSo patient ... for for three ten thirty one Seventy eight four four three one zero thirty one Seventeen eight four four three one zero thirty one Seventeen or online that loan star transfer dot com at Lone Star transferred DACA eight four four three one zero thirty one Seventeen\n[noise] this is a huge huge show\n[noise] traffic we've got [noise]\nNorth hills we've got a big break with the tire on fire south for all five ed Norton off this one partially blocking the lane lane just a little snowing there at the moment and we'd gone to an incident reported in Pasadena stone current parents lay on the west bound to ten and he'll he's blocking the carpool lane\nAs\nThe officials had been born Dana I'm city leaders that they're canceling plans for us ... boom luxury hotel to Disneyland Resort\nIn light of the city's decision described tax incentive deals for the project\nThe Anaheim city council voted last August to cancel the tax incentive deals because the project that changed over time including a move to a new location where some local businesses could have been shut down Disney called that cancellation disappointing\nHurricane Michael is devastated the Florida Panhandle Bradley shanks hunkered down in his home on dog island\nFrom what I considered behind my home [noise] ah the entire here in one area ah probably about a square mile of water a preview from the storm surge\nMichael's been downgraded to a tropical storm this morning with sixty five mile an hour winds as it moves over the Carolinas President Trump continues his get out the vote campaign this time in a rally for Republican candidates in Erie, Pennsylvania\nThis election is about keeping America safe keeping a strong keeping keeping America free Trump\nSaid that would have been wrong to cancel the rally as hurricane Michael was pummeling Florida Georgia buddy called in to Fox News saying he couldn't let down his supporters in Erie many of whom and waited hours to see him\nAnd astronauts on board a Soyuz rocket heading to the international space station\nHad survived an emergency landing following a booster failure\nThe Russian space agency says the crew landed all alive and well the rocket was taking NASA astronaut Nick Hagen ...

weaponized\nCommercial technology and the and I mean maybe there was an arms race we weren't even part of it that your choice where do you want to go first about either of these incredibly important stories\nAre we can do either one of the let's just arbitrarily pick a shocking\nAlright go ahead what do we what what are the stakes and what are we to be demanding and doing\nWell the stakes are huge and I think\nYou know where I went to with this you was the context\nOkay and the context is that Trump has done a pretty good job at this point of rebuilding the paradigm the the set of partnerships that we've all we used I mean since Camp David accords and the Iranian Revolution in Seventy nine that we used to protect our interests and that is a partnership with\nYou know Egypt Jordan Israel several of the Gulf states and often on Saudi Arabia so I yes we need to put pressure on the Saudis to make very clear that we don't like this but this is one of these instances where we got to remember\nYou know we're the friends of liberty everywhere but the custodian only of our own and we have to tend to America's interests and I tell my friends who and I share this you know who who want human rights to be\nAn object of our policy I Believe in that but I'm the I'm the ... the prospering of human rights around the world hands on the continued security and vitality of of the United states and so yes we have to pressure them but I think we also have to understand that right now we're working with him at a lot of areas\nDo you think that the market collapse some concern over this the Dow down eight hundred and thirty one point yesterday atop another two hundred and twenty and the free market there are some worry that there's a rupture I thought\nWell potentially although they are going to ask about the market either get Kudlow or somebody like me I you know I don't know we'll see if this continues I'm actually I'm I'm I always do these things as kind of a correction until something you know something emerges show different\nAll right let's move over to the fact of the Bloomberg report that the Chinese have been weaponized seeing the commercials say a commercial product stuff that everybody buys they had been weaponized thing that would be an arms race in which we were not participants 'cause we don't do that\nYeah and they do this and first of all\nThere's almost no civil military divide in China all the companies all the efforts are\nDirected towards the end state or they're producing a lot of the components that are used in information technology communications infrastructure around the world and there's been a concern for a long time about what they may be planting in those components and this is going to get\nThis is going to get bigger as five gee comes along and and and the number of those of those devices and the importance of them to every aspect of life you know multiplies geometrical it it's a real challenge and I'm I'm Glad the administration is focused so much in this national competition is long overdue\nWho has the lead on this\nIt's an interagency thing new and that's part of the problem is\nThat it's not good yeah\nWell I understand but we're not organized I mean Trump is Trump's rebuilt and had to do a lot of things at once one of them is to consider how we organize as a government to deal with this you know it's like\nTrying like when we built the architecture of the Cold War national security policy took a decade right so we got to do it quicker than that I Would say that the commerce trade representative deal do you have a lot to say about it because the court they have a lot of these\nDevices it's homeland\nUm it's a whole lot of\nDifferent agencies in organizations involved\nNow a center tally in terms of of sanctions against China do we concerning ourselves with for example the fact that they are relocating a million ... into concentration camps is that our business\nWell it's a it's a\nGood pressure point it's a yes it is our business because uh on one level\nOr the United states speaks for human rights around the world\nUm and and we should do it by the way with regard it as Audi I met Jeff sing that we are seeing them I mean what we need to call him out on it we just have to be sent to the broader context here I think it's a tremendously good pressure to get a cheese and not just the ... what they're doing in Hong Kong\nOr what they're doing generally just social credit system they're developing the minute we control the lives of their people\nYeah they're sensitive to that and we should use it as a pressure point that's one area I've not seen a lot out of the Trump Administration yet although the vice president's speech the other day and kudos to you for that interview a was a really good opening wedge in that\nI Hope it keeps it out Jim Talent always a pleasure by the way Claire McCaskill just wrote up the Boot Hill of of Missouri what kind of politics is that\nUh I don't think it's very good but I don't think the trend line the last couple of weeks in very good for Senator McCaskill so that\nKind of like holding up a tent and going to St

yeah and you know you got to remember this part of the state you know it's interesting we just didn't get hit\nWith with the mild hurricane the that this is for some reason the way that things turn they either make a you know go slightly south of that area and will you know across the state essentially just north of the act or a interstate or they fear a little farther to the west in it where I have family in Pensacola\nI mean this was so odd perhaps the panhandle in Pensacola basically all I got to understand um it's so this part of Florida see it's it's a double whammy here it's the most\nYou know one of the most powerful storms in the history to stay in an area that hasn't been hit very often so just at the devastation because you haven't had the clearing out of\nTrees with smaller storms in the same way you do in other parts of the state to just double the impact and the newest thing was just the only good news is that it moves fast\nThat the only good now I remember after the homestead the Indians were going to move spring training camps that ... that was gone I don't know that air force base is gone I Wonder if ten Dale isn't done what I'm hearing is true luckily they got all the people out there are thousands of military families and left\nAnd here's here's the thing you and I both know\nWe do but get the Pentagon think there are too many base within the country but there's no political will to close them but if any of them don't work they get close to half an inch that your luck I remember that was going to be a new airport\nYou know that was that was another idea to try to you know instead of trying to ... you know try to expand Miami international airport which is some argue too close to downtown as it is\nRight for flight paths and things like that and\nAnd you know what it just didn't happen\nUnfortunately homes that to to to sort of not wasn't with which is too far south for the rest of the population and that's my fear of
