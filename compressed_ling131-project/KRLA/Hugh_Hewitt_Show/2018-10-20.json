{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "And I thank you for having though I didn't hear\nWell are entering a we know 'em I say we know and I'm saying this from a father's side because you know fathers learned real quick ... and to a degree uh and it's quite shocking or when we learn really what moms do for the family and for kids\nAll it takes his mom kind of ... you know maybe taking a couple of extra hours it could be shopping in God Forbid that it's a weekend because then if you're going in the entire weekend\n... you know dads are in therapy for at least three months you know trying trying to realize going oh my God what am I doing here uh so moms have their hands full\nAnd uh we honor moms more than just one day here here I'm do Martinez every day that we on her mom's 'cause we love them and we're so grateful for um you know what they do for our families\n... thank you sound like that and I I yeah I agree wholeheartedly and lots of grateful every time I had that they will pay for health and get ours are sanity\nAnd but I yeah I I agree I think that had already died and that definitely damn on and he's challenging African exporting it challenging for me it really caught me\nOff ... I'm just not enough but I think to voice my husband and I have to raise a child then hopefully had bring out the lord and\nAlso for an awful lot possibility at something that and you get hired in white out like F get Ben on and it's something for the wire on whether they can\nActually then so wonderful in a way it's strange because it and that's not all that but the war has really we I certainly think that it's not really all that and I ...\nI mean even the that's not let my children he thought that they call it child again it to their child and it just seemed like kids like the I think that while there and show why in the comfort of comfort with ... ... you can't have now\nI just ask for help and courage and that sort of relationship with God third one\nYeah it really is when you stop and think about it um a friend of mine has written in one of her books are about um\nYou know about the spirit of a child I mean Jesus said unless you come as a child a wall and you know I mean when you think about the the ... of that perspective a did God wants you to come to him as as a child you know very ... you know it's\nUm you know very honest very direct\nA unassuming and um you know all the bravado which set aside 'cause and especially with two boys I mean yeah [laughter]\nI I had three boys so was my three sons for many years until I had another son and daughter as soon as I had a daughter I was done I mean I got reduced to my lowest common denominator [laughter] so uh but yes with the with boys especially but they're\nThey're just so honest and uh and and can be so much fun but also in the process as you mentioned um because it's so much about doing that you forget\nAbout being and in the process you forget who you are even as a mom or as a child has got\nAlso I Love that it I Love what you said about coming to God that sort of how like that but I think\nYes I just today that it it's like it's so wrapped up there what am I doing check you like to do list like I Do all the time like ... where am I may just how much they want to be with me I keep it up from school and I enjoy just why is that they're safe for a babysitter and Heather's mom you're home and\nI I just love that honesty about wanting to stay with me and I think that's what God cause us to as well and one thing like a like a lot of kids that just that deep desire to want to be I Would think that certainly don't have to have it all together in Delaware and whatever you know they look perfect or they say things perfectly they just want to be with their parents\nExactly their mom and dad and I I think I got it that is just as we are and who wants us to have to offer all of our audience motion even as a write so\nWell as you stated um you know after the boys were born you realize that your identity I mean because we all we don't travel or do you mean in in many cases\nIt's identified with what we do you know your work you were for a an attorney or professor um I mean you had a ... you know you have an educational pedigree\nAnd ah so ah I often admire women who were able to transition and uh and and sometimes it's the first season and uh and understood and sometimes I'm\n... you know 'cause uh I I don't know him and may maybe because young girls were diluted by uh\nYou know who who who was the one of the super heroines I'm a super woman and they think that they can convince me that way so they they try to do both which is amazing to me a bit you know so you go from your identity being with what you do and now you're a mom\nAnd you know and you talk about in your book about you know losing a sense of identity as God identifies you not as the world identifies you\nAbsolutely and and I'll just tell you're looking at it that kind of the show it's not pretty it was it was it difficult\nNot still sometimes is that I I you know a little bit of everything and that sort of hold town they realize that at least for me it's really easy to put my identity and whatever I Do a lot about whether it my job as a lawyer or whether it's my job at home with the kids\nOn all things are I think what God wants us to I was and and the gospel of Jesus has ties in with God it's so please introduce them to the world and what he's not you know this is the same here and that's what happened with the team or the sailor all of these things that are true that either\nBut whether he gets really simply and he says this is like a lot of fun as hell on well please\nAnd I just I Love that because I think that our identity to in the end of what we need to hear a lot of daughters and a part of our jobs are all even as long as we are his father daughter first and it's out of that knowledge that night Kennedy that we can't truly love our own children\nAnd when you talk about your background I mean it is impressive but I mean what you were doing is as an attorney or a professor of law I'm a ... especially ... when I\nWhen when when I hear an attorney who loves the constitution as much as I Do um you you can have you can have whatever you want to hear and I'm I'm On your side whenever I can do to help you out I'm not I mean you have a\n... in your career I mean I'm you worked as a department of justice has counseled attorney general Michael ... uh so you have you've paid your dues you also a former clerk to chief justice John Roberts\nAnd I got to imagine in light of a you know the recent or a hearings for justice Kevin all that that had to be quite painful for you\nIt was it was difficult to the end of the I Am no jackpot not well I'm a work in the same building in the end we actually\nI played basketball together it is there's this great tradition that Supreme Court first play the DC circuit court of eternal and um I have a lot and\nI Try to work so hard for him and or\nOr plants in our day so and I think it just shows\nWill divisiveness that our country and also in the center standing on the role of a judge a roll of the judges as you are now is to interpret the law that Congress has written an actual fighting has that you said it's not to make a new thing open it and if we can just kind of strange at those roles\nOn and they don't have a lot more comfort and and that's one thing is that why because we know they're not going to post their on policy preferences are by their own way of how they think they should have laid out by the\nDemocratic process so that people that we all ... ... ...\nYeah exactly which like an empire I mean it's not like I go to say well are you a Republican or Democrat no we don't even think about that we just know they're there to call balls and strikes\nRight and that that that kind of social but unfortunately um it it has been aberrations you this you know with activists judges and also a a the political forces that want to circumvent the process of the legislation\nAnd going through the process there's a reason are fought founding fathers\nAre said hey slow down take your time let's let's debate this let's talk about it and uh and when it's appropriate if we need to amend something will amend as we need to create a law will create a law\nOr but there is a way in which to do it but don't go to the bench and are expected judges singlehandedly unilaterally to create law and this is what's happened and this is why it's been a disturbance\nAnd so I thought oh good\nOh just yeah I agree with that completely and I was just you can't change it or at least not very confrontational can't change it at All right out of there weren't as the final word and at the statute that takes a lot of effort so absolutely\nYeah if you think not I'm a I'm sure Erin will rent out her voice for you for a weekend and then the rule of law real quick right\nYes yeah that's absolutely\nThere there are some things are so um your um your encouragement to mom's\nBesides getting their in their hands on your book living above loved and of course uh this is coming out are coming out soon as you get a little bit of a previous that comes out next week or so but to your recommendation besides getting their hands on your book is what\nTo the gym actually gain seats to dream for\nSeveral current democratic seats are in the spotlight nose in North Dakota Indiana Florida but none more than Missouri doesn't come a Democrat Claire McCaskill wants to hang on to her seat against her very able challenger Missouri's attorney general Josh Hawley\nMy colleague Larry Elder spoke with James O'Keefe of project maritime\nThis time keeps investigative team do deep inside the McCaskill campaign\nWe've got the news because it's clear McCaskill charged responded to our hidden camera investigation she packed\nA video of course she made a false statement in this state that she put out a she Hubble can candidate for Senator John Paul II had brought shortly embedded somebody in her campaign that is not correct\nI had nothing to do with Josh all that never spoken to him he I I was the main investigator involved in this investigation\nAnd just for your listeners know our investigation McCaskill campaign showed\nMultiple staffers saying that uh that her and McCaskill on the bottles policies\nAre saying but quote people just can't know that other staffers talking about banning semi automatic rifles and the capital herself was caught on camera in the office talking to someone she thought worked for her\nSaying that they would be gun than the sum type show the capital now just respond on local news in Missouri are claiming that the Republican Senate candidate had something to do with this which he did not\nAnd um but she's definitely on defense if you look at the uh a response that you just put out\nJames O'Keefe I looked at the video not only the the staffer talk about banning semi automatic rifles he talks about banning semi automatic firearms\nThat's right they talked about handguns\nClara herself talks about um when she gets into the Senate will vote with the so called Chuck Schumer wing of the party obviously there's the red state Democrats have to walk a fine line because\nMost of the people there are moderate they're not ... they're they're they're moderate\nTo pro life pro gun Democrats still thinking Missouri throwing in these states so that's the gay shouldn't expose is is that in order to get elected\nIn order to get elected you have to lie to people and that's what our staffers are saying saying the moderate we'll just have to get over being lied to marry devastating very powerful I mean maybe the most powerful undercover investigation we had ever done because of the ball hitting\nUS Senator has now responded to all of her staffers calling or wire\nHere is Claire McCaskill response James okay well it is some startling Josh how I Would be part of fraudulently betting on me and my campaign\nHe's the attorney general is famous Harry he spends to be going after fried participating in it [laughter]\nSo um there was nothing there have been very upfront about all my positions I made no secret that I think we can support the second amendment really talk about this is how how far they're willing to go to fry in bed my campaign\nWell first of all it's the whole thing fly categorically unequivocally falls\nJosh Hawley had anything to do with our investigative journalism I've never met him and she didn't live on local TV in Missouri Larry what's gonna happen next to this other than a candidate John ... and I tell you that had nothing to do with it\nShe's going to respond to that so I think were were cheating or goal of holding people accountable and I think that she's in a lose lose situation\nHurricane that ravaged the Florida Panhandle northward from the Gulf was horribly unpredictable and death toll is now past thirty angle air force base near Panama City took a serious yet and it's one of the size of our elite twenty two fighter jets which they were concerned with our nation's fighting ability to be concerned about that\nI turn to a regular on my program Congressman Mike Gallagher of the house armed services committees are defence expert at a Marine Corps intelligence veteran himself let's\nGet right down to it the danger zone\nHas receded according to I'm reading it real clear politics story here the congressional leadership fund has seen see six districts will hurt Andy Barr Mike Bost Rodney Davis Brian Mast John Katko receipt and to save comfortable territory it if we're down to twenty to thirty districts that are competitive and\nVery sound pretty optimistic it on hold the house or Mike Gallagher what do you think\nWell this is anecdotal but certainly in the Republican Party ... as we have around my district and our bases cap and we've seen an upsurge in\nVolunteers coming in people coming in that aren't necessarily party faithful to pick up signs and ask what can I Do to help so I Do sense a slight momentous shift I always thought this was going to be a night that when we talk about control the house you know five seats one way or the other\n... but also my understanding is that our we have real opportunities to pick up some seats\nFor Democrats in Minnesota and that the Democrats are pulling out of a couple of states that look if you try to in our direction so again we got to run through the tape this is you know we're fighting against the forces of history here can't take anything for granted and ultimately it's just going to come down\nThe candidate quality and sort of that twenty to thirty states that we're talking about\nHere now let me talk to you about some defense issues first of all the F twenty two at ten dull a it's a murky picture I read this very close and it seems like people are trying to say yeah we got her but we didn't get hurt that bad but maybe we did get hurt that bad maybe a danger to stealth technology are very hard to repair\nWhat's your assessment why by the way do we keep at twenty twos at our hurricane area\nSo as best I can tell and trying to read through that and I'm looking forward to being back in session and November So we can ask\nHard questions of the aid figure out what exactly happened it seems like Seventeen twenty Jews are damaged I think ten of those are cats and the storm rated hangar but no hangar is built to withstand a hundred and fifty plus miles per hour winds and seven of the seven of the Seventeen when Lester rated hangers\nI think it's important to note that no one thought this would be four to five little earth in forty hour fire I'm not trying to make excuses for the military here um but the planes are basic and do so that they can have access to the training range of of the Gulf of Mexico no one would want a bunch of ... going into super cruise ever Kansas it's too disturbing to the local community\nWe also wouldn't want people to be able to film and monitor their operations that we're safer areas of the country as best I can tell him talking to officials talking to experts on the outside it looks like most of them will be your air\nBut the problem here is the skin on the plane there's a lot of radar absorbent material ram involved and the repairing and replacing could be very expensive\nAnd my understanding that the initial site survey suggest that the air frame appear to be okay so we believe we can get most of them back on track but we're preparing the scans will be a very expensive proposition finally I just stay out of your question you know why we're so many their ground\nThis goes back really to the Obama administration decision to halt the program a two thousand nine sector gates was the ultimate decided that decision\nAnd the decision to cut back on the air force personnel and train maintained ours and funds for reading it so we had to answer the reason that the question that so many were on the ground and the first place with their engines pulled it because of a lack of spare parts and a lack\nOf train people to repair that\nPresident enjoying worthy job campaign when candidates in vulnerable critical house and Senate races in Ohio he took time to praise the work of some of America's

enough for the United states John Boehner I talked about this at that point he said we don't have the ... the middle east anything is possible that was last Thursday what are the second century six a sufficient for the United states\nWell a key question here is has turkey shared its intelligence\nTurkish officials have leaked to many people including me that they are in possession of audio and maybe video of moved from inside the conflict showing who did well in excess in Asia you know they've got they've got the goods if they've shared that\nWish there U.S intelligence ... who often work very closely with the Turks\nThen that's one thing and if they haven't if they've only briefed about it and that's another that that diminishes the degree of seriousness for the U.S diminishes the pressure on the U.S to try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared really start now\nDoes it impact for example the war in Yemen this was actually word comes home this was the anti Iran alliance spring stressors Jordan and Egypt and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel in America\nTo try to construct ... or shutting rockets into Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran does this break that anti Iranian alliance which many of us have welcome as being a necessary course corruption in the middle east\nI'm not sure this has any impact on their rent and all that I'm not I don't see the United Arab Emirates for Israel or Egypt\nShowing any squeamish whatsoever about what's been done here and so far it looks like President Trump is willing to accept this explanation she would even yesterday\nYou know getting out of the Saudis had already suggesting that this was a rogue operator before the show begins to float that explanation for themselves so I think the geopolitics are likely to remain unchanged so long as the succession in such an changed\n... therefore arms sales on interrupted the American public accept certain moves on because it as an exotic story and reads like a trailer I'm a ... has a lot of friends but it is it is very difficult to keep a story like this\nAbove the fold for very long to recover Patrick\nYeah I think they're trying to say before where it's going to hit the crown prince is elite opinion you know the street and Silicon Valley she's enjoy the company of those people he's worked hard to get them to invest in Saudi Arabia to bring their businesses and their insights and they're no out to help diversify the Saudi economy\nShe's going to find it very hard to be a front man for that sort of effort and that's not

world possibly a ... what do you think about that\nOr just something to ponder hello same a moment here brought to you by Bill Maher teams like twenty minutes before the top of the hour\nWe're going to talk uh with our good friend dean cell he's back where there's a dean is the branch manager first sight and sound as you may recall spin on with us and we were talking about the most is because they've teamed up with them virgin a Virgil films and entertainment to release the film version\nOf their original stage production Moses and or if you had a chance to see it you know you see it again and now we're going to have an opportunity to enjoy it on DVD a dean welcome to build my team as good to have you back with us\nFeel good morning it's so good to be back thank you so much for having us\nHey how's life in Lancaster, Pennsylvania buddy\nIt is beautiful you know it's all there is a Crispin the air the ... either changing their color and it's just absolutely beautiful here and the Amish farm fields of good old Lancaster County Pennsylvania\nI'm so jealous I keep telling my wife were going to ah were up for a road trip you know we've been threatening as you know for a couple of years to find her way up there because we've got to see the facility but also I Love I Love Pennsylvania and all the time because you know I was born and raised there tell people I was born and raised in Southern California okay so\nOur leaves are small brown\nAnd the first time I went to the east coast and saw the brilliance of the autumn colors first hand for myself I I just like it took me weeks for my my jaw that kind of you know you go back to normal 'cause I was in the perpetual all you know position with my mouth I'm using credit\nUh well it's a good reminder that God the creativity is alive and well you know we get to experience it every year but just once a year when all those\nYou know beautiful green trees all of a sudden become just a brilliant colors of orange and yellow and read and it's just absolutely stunning so now's the time of year come you know there's apple festivals everywhere lots of farms open up their doors and you can come in and you know during some apple cider some hot apples later\nBut if you're from Southern California you may want to bring your coat\n[noise] yeah well well I'm well even worse yeah now a so I\nI moved from a four years ago from Southern California to Florida I happened to be in California these days I'm visiting the kids and uh we're hadn't even further west 'cause the two year old grandchild in Maui is waiting for us as well so we we got a little bit of a trip but uh yeah so I I promise I keep promising to you um we've got to make our way and\nYou know I'm you know it'd be great to see you and see Lindsay and the kids and I just have some hot chocolate and enjoy the holidays that'd be awesome let's got\nTo have you okay great let's talk about most is I mean gosh dean that this was so fantastic won't when we saw Moses on the big screen and uh it was just such a blessing again sight and sound and only the wayside and sound can do it you guys just do it begin wonderful\nI'm well thank you so much bill yeah you know there really is no other place like it on the planet I'm and I'm not saying that because I work here you know it it really is amazing so for those of your listeners that maybe haven't heard or or don't know about sight and sound\nUm we bring the Bible to life on stage and [noise] ah what probably comes to mind immediately is something that are you a picture you know happening at a church basement with people wearing bathrooms but we really believe in using the biggest most spectacular hum special effects and stages that we have\nTo be able to bring these giant Norma stories to life in a giant arm is away and so as you said Moses was on our stage here in Lancaster it then went to our theater in Branson, Missouri\nIt played there are a little are close to two million people saw live and we said hey we want to bring this to more people so we filmed it we brought it to a movie theaters last month\nWe had an amazing turnout across the country from Hawaii to Alaska attorney to New York now people experiencing it coming to life on screen and now we said okay we want to take it even further so it is released this week on DVD and digital downloads so it's on I\nTunes and Amazon and many other places\nYeah so now if you didn't get a chance to get out to see it or in Lancaster, Pennsylvania did it also show in Branson as well the other location\nIt did yeah it was live on stage in Lancaster and then all our shows are designed to do just that they we we call it being modular so they're massive what they have to break apart into many pieces and pack into tractor trailers to ship to brand sending them back so mother took about fifty five\nA tractor trailer loads to get it from uh our our our theater here in Lancaster to Branson\n... this is like a lego kit uh adult style [laughter]\nI mean these faces they gather and uh I I mean what what a project I mean first of all for it you know everybody that comes up with this creativity and and you and I've talked about this before Dean I think you just so blessed to to be around these kind of a\n... you know these kind of creative genius is that uh you know God has blessed us with that have the opportunity you know I often say about creativity and an artist is they have to have a Kansas\nAnd watch a ... you know what you've been able to do there are in providing a campus for creative people that blesses the rest of us in the body of crisis just wonderful\n[noise] you know it's really amazing um division of our founders really was that they want it to create a place where people that were artists and creative and crafts people could use their gifts in Thailand a to bring the gospel to life they really believed that you didn't have\nTo go to another country in order to be in ministry and being the mission field that they could create a place where people from all different kinds of backgrounds or could bring their talents together in order to to advance Scott kingdom and\nIt's happening I mean you have people that honestly group on farms and they figured out technology and software and now they're building software applications here you've got people that are amazing um what ... do you have electrician the people that are able to do animatronic\nSome design and you have seamstresses and costume designers um you've got accounts of course you know we need them to throw at it is just amazing you know it's not the Hollywood model here where you hire a bunch of people for a project and then they all leave and you go look for you know other work\nYou know about the spirit of a child I mean Jesus said unless you come as a child a yeah yeah you know I mean when you think about the ... of that perspective a did God wants you to come to him as as a child you know very you know it's\nI'm very honest very direct a unassuming and I'm ... you know all the bravado which set aside cause and especially with two boys I mean yeah [laughter] I I had three\nBoys so it was my reasons for many years until I had another son and daughter as soon as I had a daughter I was done I mean I got reduced my lowest common denominator\nSo but yes with the with boys especially but they're they're just so honest and uh and and can be so much fun but also in the process as you mentioned um because it's so much about doing that you forget about being and in the process\nYou forget who you are even as a mom or as a child a gun\nAlso I Love that it ever set it up for coming to God with sort of childlike that say they\nCan't fight this today that and it's like it's so wrapped up there but my feeling is checking my to do list out like I Do all the time I Can't wear my may just how much they want to be with me I can take them out of school and they joined at the white stuff their face or a babysitter and and there's a mom you're home and\nI I just love that honesty about wanting to be with me I think that's what God cause us to as well and one thing like Alaska like his sister that deep desire just to want to be I Would think that certainly don't have to have it all together and don't worry whatever you know they look perfect or they say things perfectly they just want to be with their parents\nExactly their mom and dad and I I think on that got accept this just as we are and he wants us to come to handling and offer all of our audience that motion when I'm at right now\nWell as you stated um you know after the boys were born you realize that your identity I mean because we all we don't travel or do you mean in in many cases\nIt's identified with what we do you know your work you were an attorney or professor hum I mean you had a you know you have an educational pedigree\nAnd a show or I often admire women who were able to transition and uh and and sometimes it's the first season and uh and understood and sometimes um\nYou know 'cause uh I I don't know him and may maybe because young girls were diluted by uh\nYou know who who was the one of the super heroines I'm a super woman and they think that they can convince me that way so they they try to do both which is amazing to me a bit you know so you go from your identity being with what you do and now you're a mom\nAnd you know when you talk about in your book about you know losing a sense of identity as God identifies you not as the world's identifies you\nAbsolutely and and I'll just tell you're looking at it that that traditional it's not pretty it was it was a difficult time and still sometimes is and I I Do a little bit of everything and start from Holland sound they\nRealize that at least for me it's really easy to put my identity and whatever and get a handle on whether it's my job as a lawyer or whether it's my job at home with the kids\nOn all things are I think not what God wants us to I was and and the gospel of Jesus Says that ties than the God is still please introduce them to the world and\nWhat he's done is not you know this is the same here that's not the regime or they feel or all of these things that are true that is either\nBut rather Hannity does that really simply and he says this is like a lot of fun and Manuel please\nAnd I just I Love that because I think that our identity to speak and what we need to hear that weren't a lot of daughters and apart from our jobs their roles even as long as we're hearing a lot of daughter first and it's out of that knowledge that night Kennedy that we can't truly love our own children\nAnd when you talk about your background I mean it it is impressive but I mean what you were doing as as an attorney or a professor of law or is there she ... when I\nWhen we when I hear an attorney who loves the constitution as much as I Do um you you can help you can have whatever you want to hear and I'm I'm On your side or whatever I can do to help you out I'm not I mean you have a\n... in your career I mean you worked in the department of justice has counseled attorney general Michael ...\nUh so you have you've paid your dues you also a former clerk to chief justice John Roberts\nAnd I got to imagine in light of ah you know the recent or a hearings for justice Kevin Oh that that had to be quite painful for you\nIt was it was difficult to say and just to say I am now part not well on a work in the same building and he and we actually\nI played basketball together there's this great tradition that Supreme Court first play the DC circuit court of a tournament on and have it participate in that and\nI have a number of friends who work in court for him and or I'm\nVery pleased in order to do so and I think it just shows\nThe real divisiveness that our country and also an understanding of the role of a judge on the role of the judges issue on now is to interpret the law that Congress has written a natural by the constitution it's not to make a new thing and if we lean guy just kind of strange at those roles\nAnd they don't have a lot more comfort and ended up winning someone because we know they're not going to impose their on policy preferences are either way of how they think they should have found by the Democratic process so that people that we all ...\nYou know ... much like an empire I mean so like I said well are you a Republican or Democrat no we don't even think about that we just know they're there to call balls and strikes\nRight and that kind of situation unfortunately um it it has been ... to do this you know with activist judges and also a a the political forces that want to circumvent the process of a legislation\nAnd going through the process or are we using our fought founding fathers are said hey slow down take your time with that much to bake this let's talk about it and uh and when it's appropriate to if we need to amend something will amend is we need to create alone will create a law\nBut there's a way in which to do it but don't go to the bench and are expected judges singlehandedly unilaterally to great law and this is what's happened and this is why it's been a disturbance and so far so good\nOh just yeah I agree with that completely animals judges you can't change it or at least not very easily that competition I Can't change it at all run out of there weren't as the final word in it if it's a statute that it takes a lot of effort so so absolutely\nYeah if you think not I'm a I'm sure Erin we'll rent out her voice for you for a weekend and then they find the rule of law real quick right [laughter]\nYes yes absolutely\nThere are some things are so um your um your encourage mentioned moms are besides getting their in their hands on your book living above loved\nAnd of course uh this is coming out are coming up soon as you get a little bit of a previous that comes out next week or so but to your recommendation besides getting their hands on your book is what\nI think I Would just urge them I Know that tired and they have and that just as you watch our children and the\nJoy in a smaller thing than just want to be with you Lynn boldly my two my two boy there by reckless and as you see all these things than child I'd love to encouraging them and\nAnd the and it's an invitation from God to become dependent I got to really I live out that holding created by the gift giving him because he has your act and just to realize that it can be a child the child and\nEven as we're taking care of her own children\nThank God the air and has observed her son's in such a way and learn some lessons and there's been vulnerable enough and loving enough for all of us to share with us in living blood

J\nUh took this on and we want everyone to know what a what a tremendous help is was and then out great for where to\nLook we are thrilled that the reason\nYou know I I was very encouraged knowing that people were praying for me one of the fears that I had a son irrational think perhaps but when one one is isolated the way I was is it I Would be forgotten that people would not pray for me and I desperately wanted that per because I I felt very weak\nAnd so uh as I look back uh on my second year of one God was rebuilding me\nAside did it feel God's presence very much but\nAh I I Know very well that it was a personal God's people that was a\nThere was a grave coming to me that often was not felt it was like a hit and grace and I wasn't aware of it at that time but then I I Would look back and say well I came through these difficulties and I know that I'm too weak to do it myself you know I Know that it was great\nYou know you're absolutely right and we're taking a break we'll come back with Sandra ... runs the moment but interesting statement\nWhen you said where you felt like you were alone and there were those times we we've had other cases where people say the exactly the
