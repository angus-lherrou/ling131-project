{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "The problem is that an male female relationships hashtags meat to this should be both the female and I'm\nGlad to hear hear I'm Glad you said that because I I think boys are I don't blame them for being confused I mean this is this hook up culture that we have you know casual sex that takes place high school campuses uh college campuses I is\nSo routine I mean even reading back on um you know a doctor forwards\nOr annual information that came out there that are at her rural school the big thing for seniors was to um you know was to bad a sophomore that was you know to ah you know give some young men I guess\nIs a right of injury to manhood and they were going to be the ones that uh you know injured him in to this\n... next stage of life and that was their conquest and uh you know this was something that was part and parcel of the culture there at that all girls school can't talk about that though\nYes and ... and we have to you know we really know and understand that the that\nWe're we're getting so many mixed messages that that can only be solved by dialogue not by this monologue when you have to attack me to the whole concept of me to\nOnly meaning women that you know that really is an amazing [laughter] I I I spent the entire weekend conducting a couple of communication\nWorkshop and and I'm In New York and the and the idea of\nThe whole concept of the workshop is\nFor both people and the a workshop to be able to hear each other non defensively and to get rid of our biological propensity to defend ourselves when we're criticized and the hash tag ... to culture is making it so clear\nThat the only person who is to be believed as women and I do believe that women need to be believed that their story is what they perceived that story to be and the man stories what he perceived his story to be exactly those two ... and and and\nAt the university when I have insulted with couples\nI did a lot of role reversal dates in men's beauty contests were asked every woman to experience a every man to experience the beauty contest of everyday life that women go through and every ... every woman to experience the fear of sexual rejection than men go through when they initiate and then that led me to be talking with a lot of couples\nThat counselors referred me to\nThat felt that they had date rape experiences and almost always I was able to guide the the the couple\nTrue um her absolutely convincing story that this is what the man did it is absolutely convincing story that this is what she did and they both selectively saw the different messages that they have and body language and words and in a in an implication 'em and\nThey came out of it\nWith exactly what a university education is supposed to provide which is an education as to how messages can be selectively used to to reinforce what you would like to have from that message and oftentimes that women wanted a more long term relationship and they didn't want to\nGive it up so they they ... they ... the man certain you know it's a certain sense but they only remember retrospectively that no it's the man to remember richest respectively the fence and went and when he\nShare those with her she was like oh yeah I guess that's true and when she shared those with him and his response was the same\nI didn't really yes I guess you're right I Do remember that you mentioned it and that's the type of education we need to be giving her sons and daughters one where it's safe for both sexes to explore the misinterpretation of their um their sexuality experience here is to deeper problems one\nIs when we give our grandson\nOr in your in Grand Rapids wrecked the the message that sex is\nOnly a I'm a potential trap for him that could ruin his future in life even if it becomes a powerful and learned and as judge Kavanaugh what he does is he turns to pornography because pornography gives him an ax access to a variety\nOf attractive women without fear of rejection ended a price that they could afford it but it it\nIt releases your son's doping mean\nOnly by increasingly risky virtual effect with the the ...\nAir brush women that no woman can live up to the increased risk when he actually gets into a relationship with a real woman or oaks do he finds that the woman is turned off by his propensity to objectify and want a risky behavior that she's comfortable with\nWhich only convinces him he's a loser the male female sexual game which then only turns in fact more pornography which reinforces the problem of course\nAnd let's not even talk about virtual reality stuff that's going on too so that is all that's all very scary as you and I talked about it the break in the information age in which we live in what I Am a discerning is that people are crying out\nFor the connection that you can only have when you communicate and this is what you're talking about here if our defenses are up in unless you say um you know from a male perspective clearly that if a woman comes to that point to say\nWow I did something wrong you know uh uh I gave up a a personal side of myself I'm maybe in a way in which I win and so now I'm the only way for me to have any kind of excused for doing that is that um\nYeah I convinced myself that I was raped it was a date rape ... yeah that's what it was it was a date rape so now I'm not as guilty how much of that comes into play in this\nA lot of it comes into play in the air force did a study of years ago on what percentage of\nOf the claims for rape or a false what with uncertain and what was clearly rape and they found that more than forty percent of them or I'm excuses for they didn't get back to the to the\nPlace of their their fight on time and they were late and they said well\nThey were out with a guy and so they said that they were raped or they had a boyfriend or that they didn't call and um and there were jeopardizing their relationship in rather\nThan say that and they said that they were a rape and this and this is after lie detector test said after three judges from both sexes um evaluated though the girls and the guys stories but\nUm and so it is important to believe every woman um and ... and ... and investigate but we are all but if we really want to get to solutions to the problems\nWe have to do we we have to ask our daughters to begin to train and ask her daughters to share the responsibility for taking the sexual issues right now we have a culture that says\nWomen to have the option when you're an adolescent\nTo initiate but guys you have the expectation um and so you\nYou can ask the guy out but when you asked the guy out he's still the one that's expected to take the hat and the first time when it's a potential sexual encounter and the first one to kiss you and the first one to kiss you and the first one to touch it with a more energetic truly sensitive planes and so and the woman\nI can say yes or no it's we still have options versus expectation and here's the problem are we are women are looking at the world is saying you know all the people who are the entrepreneur is and the risk takers their old man that's discrimination against me but if\nThey're real discrimination against our daughter's not expecting that not expecting\nThem to share the responsibilities for risky sexual rejection because when girls learn that if girls are protected from taking and sharing the risks when they're ... they ... they do not get the training to take the risk but it's a common denominator of all the successful\nBillionaire entrepreneur is or almost a hundred percent male\nDr Carroll I understand it being a man of face a I'd a lean on what God says\nAnd God's clear in in his word how we are to address these issues if we as in the song is Solomon which I think is probably the best romantic novels in the Bible it's a really sexy\nExpos essay about the relationship the the male female dance here if we wake love a before it's time we\nWe open up avenues of consequences that are impactful that rhyme with\nThe things that are happening today in our culture is all this is because we have violated principles that I Believe that are well ordained and that caution us but if we're not going to do this and I and I understand there's argument on the other side that a yes if we have you know a pent up um\nYou know pent up desires this could lead to pornography and other complicated issues uh and uh but it's like\nYou know here it is we we've been in an era a in a culture of free love and we are reaping as a judge Kavanaugh said we really are reaping the whirlwind of our own sexual madness\nYes absolutely and and one of the things I think we have to realize if we're faced people is that you know that God created both sexes and whenever only one sex when both sexes\nAbsolutely I agree I agree wholeheartedly a doctor warns feral his book the boy crisis I'll tell you this is a must
