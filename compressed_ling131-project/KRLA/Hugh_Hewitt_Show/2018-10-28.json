[noise]\nI never thought they were being so mean shot I never thought they could move that fast and let me ... I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I Know I was just thinking about how long have you ever you know there was an old the [noise] you know Steve Allen of people remember Steve Allen did the Tonight Show and he wrote this book call I think it was a dumb ass\nAnd he said he pulled up to the post office had one heavy box he's having a lot of trouble lifting the box he finally gets to the counter at the post office and the clerk and Steve Allen's the only one there he was before Johnny Carson and the court says where's your number\nAnd see found says I don't have enough he says well you'll have to go back to not much we can freeze the box always it back\nPlus I Want you know those numbers like you might get it a bakery or at a deli counter something\nGrabs the ticket comes back with a heavy box walks up to the counter he's the only one there and the postal clerk says Thirteen call says number but that's the postal service right that's always been the reputation hey but you've got to give them credit seems those who investigated these kinds of things that an excellent job\nOf but seriously it never ceases to amaze me out professional an excellent our law enforcement people are well\nI don't you know President Trump says we have the best ... I think in in this case you know is around the world when there's investigations of plane crashes or any issue like that they you know last plane lost ships whatever it was called the United states we have tremendous law enforcement people\nWhich by the wayside was wild so disappointing to see the upper echelons of the FBI and the Justice Department engage in a soft coup I think a lot of people's knowledge that now against those who legitimately elected president of United States Donald Trump\nOr unhappiness with these top officials as I said was never meant to reflect on the regular agents those who do the work day in and day out in the FBI and other agencies\nWhich as I said that's why so disgraceful to see those in power tarnish the image of the FBI and other law enforcement agencies and then you have the Democrats saying\nAll the Republicans don't support the FBI now we do support the FBI we don't support it becoming you know its image being so tarnished and so rude because some of you engaged in an old like a banana republic activities that's why we're unhappy with the top people or the Justice Department people like Clapper Brennan and the rest of them\nSo whether the suspect winds up being someone with the mental issues\nOr someone who's just evil\nThe fact remains that in this country you do not get back at your political enemies by threatening them with harm or worse you just don't do that [noise]\nNeedless to say these type of acts can do irreparable damage to our political system [noise]\nAnd the you know you don't you know on the line I think of what the uh the Hillary Clinton people in the left and those who are out to get the president is what they were doing that's why we're so disaster someone should be pointed that out\nWhen he tried to do the political system as what you guys already with the political system and trying to get it legitimately elected as a president or impeached\nNo one can defend this behavior and everyone should condemn it this is pure evil no matter which side of the political spectrum the perpetrator is on and it looks like we all know sure looks like what did he have a stickers on his van and actually it looks like one of those crazy is that you want to be around no matter what side but it certainly\nWe all get deeply frustrated and disappointed when people we disagree with control our destiny\nIt always amazes me that those in the resistance against President Trump have no clue nor did they probably care that we were as unhappy with this election and the re election of President Obama to the presidency as they were with President Trump's victory\nThat would never dawned on them never never never dawned on them\nAfter all many of us thought Iraq Obama was the worst president in our lifetime if not in our history so what are the you know I was five days I think it was five days before the election that he wanted to fundamentally change the United states of America\nSo we are not mentally\nI always got the wrong I always thought it was seven days that he really gave notice you quickly for job you do give two weeks let us know ... days before that [noise] what previous presidents I Want to ask you had said anything even close to that\nAnd which president went on an apology tour soon after being reelected\nHistory has made when a leader steps up stays true to his values and sharks are fundamentally different course for the country\nThat's 'cause you're not in power when you get a power I Wonder if you agree that we should try a fundamentally different course when we get in power that he was talking about Obama I didn't even know that well he should have was right yeah [noise]\nAnd apologize for what you may know my sign off is always a pleasure privileged to have like front of the greatest history a country in the history of the world\nBut we're on our side never engaged in a resistance as such we never engaged in a soft coup we never threatened to bomb the White House didn't willows actresses or singers threatened that like that march that day of or the day after whatever it was\nPrinted you see this in the New York times uh about the assassination of the current president I guess it's supposed to be fiction obviously but ah we don't do that kind of stuff but the left and the Democrats and the press which is really the same thing\nHas never accepted his victory and will do anything to remove him from office that seems clear including blaming his rhetoric for the suspects violence which is where I'm going to go now even before anything they knew you know they didn't know much about\nThe suspect so this will be used and it's being used to hurt President Trump and the Republicans especially with the November elections

ideas I we all knew that the press would just immediately we moved the Democrats that they have to do that\nBut that's who they are but the press is all over this trying to just attached to President Trump there's nothing they'll stop at to try to defeat him let's go to Pam in Dallas texas Pam you're on with mark\nAnd it dawned on me I thought was driving and listening to what is about to unravel enhance I actually started they're going to use just another tool in the media\nCape Town try and hear their latest tactics to try to destroy him and defeat the conservative\nMovement you know I'm going to the polls cetera why can't we fire with fire watching any of the media and the talk show host talk about and bring up every single time they bring up a person that right that in court I Can't answer that\nWhy can't they don't live that way hey what about the guy that are out there that were shooting at a at a baseball field and almost killed one of our a representative Karen every\nWell you probably didn't hear that segment but I did mention it right away and the monologue that\nUh we've been blamed Bernie Sanders because one of his ... supporters are shot the congressman is Lisa ... who would have wiped them all out of given a chance right if there's a Washington police didn't come to their defense or or whoever was there I I Can't remember it might have been some personal security that the congressman that you're absolutely right\nOkay and and I understand hey I didn't hear that part but what I'm saying in addition to you know bringing out I don't mean mentioning at one time\nI mean bringing up again and again and again and again and that's what they do with their information that's one thing we can do and also when they bring up his character a counter that with all of Bill Clinton\nAntics that he did and I think Kennedy and all and all of the way they carried on when they were president and why we think and counter everything they say we have plenty of ammunition yeah what we don't think I\nWell I think the president doesn't that's what they resent so much in large doesn't on his show but uh yeah he did he does it all the time so you couldn't you know what the problem is you can listen more often to Larry thanks you\nDid it when I'm working at times I'm working late and I can't listen to him but every chance that yeah I Do\nLike Larry Elder dot com that's where to go\nBut the you're forgiven and and the fact that Europe's right and what is it that really what the press and the Democrats have so much about President Trump one of the other things I should say made about him he doesn't let him get away with anything so they can't take it and they're going crazy\nAnd I you know I was going to do politics maybe I'll get to it in the second in a second or third or who knows\nBut the fact remains that if we keep the house which a lot of people think the Republicans are going to lose the house if we keep the house and these guys are going to have a breakdown not not checked that they've already had a breakdown\nThey can be writing in the streets no they already do when you think if you are right or black lives matter\nI mean this this is getting bad this is really bad and it didn't start with President Trump they would like to blame him for but it's not true what really happened is this is the first time a Republican has ever fought back that's really what's going on and that's where people love about him let me know what you love about him [noise]\nWell to answer that as if we don't respond you leave it to your opponents and with the media and that's what makes President Trump's oh terrific for a lot of us he doesn't let them get away with it\nHe's saying what would you I listen to President Obama again I realized how ... I was when he was around and you know a lot we couldn't respond he's got the bully pulpit now we have ... this is what change looks like\nThat's what changed looks like great let's go to the temperature in Clearwater, Florida you're on with mark\nHey Mark I'm you got a great job I'm really enjoying the show\nAnd I I I'm I'm back from the old school I'm sure so\nAnd I have a ... hour and a lot of the shows that are a reputable station not drive by media and I have never in my life seeing any saying like what's been going on with people with a Democrat\nAnd I was always taught to think that the Democrats were out for people to help the poor people and all that but um I and I voted for a President Obama twice well uh\nI'm Sorry I did that but I Love President Trump\nI changed from Democrat to Republican\nI've heard that a lot of people have gotten that we need I I Know President Trump can win because I Believe that got his hand on that man his strong man he is a and and talented man\nHe knows what to do he wants to do the right I'm going to love this country and that's what we need right now if we don't get somebody like him but kind of lose our country and I don't understand how it for an immigrant\nOr you know I don't I don't mind people contests cocker ... doing the right way and and I believe that the only reason that the Democrats want this to happen is so they can get all the phone and put the Republicans out\nSo I don't know I had a nightmare about ... what does it Seventeen thousand now that are the caravan common one what President taught what kitten to when when they finally came here when with all those people I mean we don't get wrong for everybody\nNo you don't yet have absolute ... thanks by the way for switching over I was going to say you have a lot of redemption ... who pushed for voting for twice which made it up thanks few recall what he can do and he's doing he's going to bring the\nArmy or whoever the soldiers to the border you can't let these people in cars they immediately or a consider for asylum there's an invasion of her country\nThis is absolute insanity and the ... no matter what he does that going to get

whole lot to just to respond to\nNot easy to take I'm so glad I count the day every day that President\nThat's going to Roger in Tampa, Florida you're on with mark and\nMark thanks for taking my call bad just want to say that I think that the reason I was driving the Democratic so the President Trump is not from Saint Paul\nAgree as these ... jobs are um\nHe he's a self made man you know he says what he wants to say he's been raised up from a great family in Egypt love this country or like I Do and you know I'm Glad to be you know a Republican or conservative and somebody that\nHas the power of the you know working class person because of how his father raise it\nIt got what's driving them so crazy they can't they can't kill what they didn't make and you know he he just doesn't take like you said he doesn't take their there'll be a than um\nAnd it's just it's fantastic and as far as the the the the guy that just got arrested for all these pipe bombs I mean yeah we should stand up in the state every time\nYou know they they mentioned that would just say well you know we didn't we didn't attack Bernie Sanders a because we're better than that you know we don't go down that road\nUm that's all I mean it's just I just can't wait for the midterm elections and you know for our state I Can't wait to get a Rick Scott or yeah Rick Scott\nIn Senate and in a round the standard says our governor because I made the mistake of voting for Charlie Crist when I first moved to Florida from New York thinking hey he's going to be good\nAnd it was hard for me to take because I forgot what he did all the time which is he would set up strong dummies and then tear down like you said in the clip we have\nThat to you know we want to risk babies away for a lot from the arms of immigrants no they're illegal immigrants and we don't want to risk babies away was your policy by the way Mr former president\nYou know we didn't change that policy needs to be changed obviously but\nIt was your policy in the first place\nAnd we don't want to rip babies away in fact the real answer is\nDon't come here in the first place if you're going to come illegally come here legally and there'll be no issue and who knows who setting up this caravan who's paying for all of it how they're getting here I've heard all kinds of rumors but the fact is\nHe's got to stop them it's an invasion you can't allow this to happen so we followed by others but again he can't do anything right and of course the things he says\nAre the reasons that the suspect in custody did what he did it's because of President Trump\nBut then we evolved into the point\nThat you know why they hate him so much among other reasons because he's the first Republican that I can remember in years who's standing up to their nonsense who's willing to call it like it is\nIt's reasonable to ask because I mentioned the last hour whether Hillary should be indicted for what she did she committed crimes and when I was sympathetic to her eye on another station another network people get annoyed with me because I said if they agreed to leave the scene forever maybe we could agree not to indict Hillary and people said she's not\nAbout the law that is a reasonable argument that's what they said lock her up that is not violent but it's just following the rules and principles that we all in this country are subject to the country what is so radical about that\nYeah but but yet when President Trump says it it's absolutely outrageous\nAnd what else I Can't even remember what else they pick on him for what was the other issues besides lock her up that they say Trump keeps inciting the audience when I think of it I'll let you know but whatever he says it's it's ... it's just terrible right all the press because the press the fake pressing a fake press [noise]\nDo you mean the people the enemy the people if they're not going to do objective journalism cause they have tremendous power\nBut ... if they can if you American people can't get the news and an object away I never knew when I was growing up what the politics was\nOf the journalists who are reporting it that's not true now their gender so clear he tried to call them out on it\nSo I think this is insanity when when the Obama could be outraged sent in theory the rest of us and say things like you'll keep your doctor and you keep your health care and uh you know we're we're ... we we care about race people on our side and we judge people by the color of their skin numbers don't illegals\nI've often said give me nine black women on the Supreme Court core conservative and I'm happy camper know where the guy said always see race and gender and uh you know sexual orientation we don't talk that way we see individuals much more and it's Dennis

will mark a you know as a retired to a mental health professional I just have to say that the U.S one time media has finally revealed itself and its ... year cites coast\nAnd I'm at this point uh the media and uh this a bomber individual both have some very prominent features of paranoid schizophrenia\nAnd it starts with these uh\nA media are nuts are saying oh the Trump is responsible for all of this a bomber stuff and all these responsible for the bomb well you know\nThat's not only mind reading but it's thought insertion they believe that Trump has in certain thoughts into the bombers mine for him to go do it\nAnd the bomber of course well uh you know stock broadcasting and he's having a conversation with Trump through with television or maybe he looks out a picture of him in the paper the worst show I get the water or tell me what hardware store do I get the pipe what about this other stuff\nWell the reality is is that individuals are responsible for their own behavior and speech just moves air\nPeople their motivations belong to them and what they do is their responsibility\nAnd speech is protected for the president just as it is for everybody else\nAnd just like we've been talking we didn't blame a Bernie Sanders for what that guy uh with that a phony a you know Chinese a cave rifle did in nearly killing Steve\nSchool lease and um [noise]\nThe other people that were out there with the baseball but the thing of it is is that um\nYou know moving air with speech is one thing but behavior move physical objects and those things can either be helpful like somebody building
