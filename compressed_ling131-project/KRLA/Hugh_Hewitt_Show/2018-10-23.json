{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "Your family your friends your neighbors you definitely want to get them in front of this movie\nOr the movie itself was heralded by many\nWho went to see a ... film this was as we said Rick uh this was rather organic starting a is a true story a base it on\nA man or you know we we we hear this and people of faith here this all the time where they they sense a a a hearing other voice of God and people when when they do this\nThey hear it at all form and fashion and and I I think is why I Won a then right now uh you know with the stands a you know\nThe view of the women of the view\nSeemed to you know last about as somebody hearing from God the vice president hearing from ... and they thought well that was pretty pretty insane\nUh bits and a CBS now has a movie out to wear a God friended me you know bring Scott and other social media realm so uh I guess you can laugh about it and the view and then you can make money on it or if you make a TV series out of it\nThere you go well at the the fact is that I think God the you know\nDoes the desire our prayer and he he wants to to react to intervene in our lives our country\nThat's what we were talking about before the quake with a chronicles of working but I think he mentioned a very key point you know we we don't need to read it yet this day you know what we're going the wrong way\nRight we need to turn and look and evaluate changes but part of that is to pray that God's promises that he will you'll or late ... the people picked up on that uh we've\nWe've seen spontaneous cleric just break out is either is all over America was no big science class right now it wasn't [laughter] yeah there are pretty phenomenal\nWell and this is what happens when you are confronted\nWith the truth of God it begs a response so what are you going to do you know a ... awesome I think it's awesome that the people there and these are\nTheaters across the country you know got the message that look at a you know if my people who are called by my name will humbled and my first of all you have to yourself and realize\nHey look at it I don't have the goods I mean you know we've been trying to for decades and you know this country we're find herself twenty two trillion dollars in debt we got chaos of the border and we got chaos in Chicago I mean that every term we got families breaking apart I mean we're ...\nYes and so here it is the institution that God is established to be that transformational of force in the culture has been a bit lying dormant then I thought this was interesting record a Gallup it conducted a poll here now it's about Eighteen months ago\nAnd the secular America basically in one of the response is a I guess to sum it up as Santa hey where's where's the people of faith we're we're the Christians today we're not hearing their voices\nAnd I thought that was a bit laughable an ironic because it is these very same people who said look we don't want to hear your voice anymore we don't want your Christmas crashes we don't want merry Christmas\nThrown in our faces we we don't want this uh this Jesus stuff and now that their world has gone to hell in a hand basket they're going where Jesus right\nWell you know it it I think it it since we there's but what things are going great we feel like well we're we got discovered well no uh but uh there is a quite a crisis there's a point to be where\nWhere we get to go out and that's that's happened throughout history yes uh but I think that we are we just you know look at the news for the last few weeks so\nUh there's absolute hatred or a division a it is it's a you know somebody sitting above it is definitely a uh we need to you\nKnow and there is a crisis I think is that God please intervene\nWill when mark tailor the retired firemen there's depicted in the movie here I mean it's his story a you know turns to God and and you know any any hear Scott's voice\nThat says look at a you know Donald Trump is a ... you know is what you you know this movies about the Trump prophecy that Donald Trump's going to be the president of the United states\nSo you know here it is and then I'm not that much longer we see Donald Trump you know coming down the escalator there Trump Tower to announce his candidacy so what did mark thing than\nWell he uh it was it was pretty amazing when he saw that it it was just\nA little bit of such a boy I Hope I'm right ... ... ... ... ... mark introduced us is Dr Barry covert who was not a doctor culprits why it up not it's a game but I was really upset so\nGod is doing something here that are so that was there were certainly puts into the night that we all felt when we were watching the turn of the election is what happened we kind of picked a little bit of that at the movie as well that's\nA really cool through about each other when we deal with some of them but there certainly\nAre people that this was a miracle that in a way that I think so and I thank God you may be hurt our voice it gave us this too\n[laughter] well yeah that's one thing I've been talking about is that a before even looking in the prophetic that maybe we could get a what I called and then at the moment ah where there was a ... second chance where the profit Winston none of us said hey you guys are really messing Amy and and this of course was reluctant profit\nThat required a welder spinning out of the shores in this case maybe maybe Mark Felt a little bit like that because whenever you are apprehended by a word and you are given a mantle of the prophet\nYou go so you go in such a way that you are very cautious you know say okay gotta am am I doing this on my own argue with me and then you've got it you know it's God's will do hear firms and confirms uh the message and as mark is playing this out and being faithful to it\nAnd uh this organic bonfire for prayer and a revival is taking place and and not only here but the other thing was was Franklin Graham was very active he was on the on the steps of every a state of the union\nAnd I had and they weren't reporting on thousands of people you know coming out I I I let me say this there were more thousands of people coming to these prayer meetings then to the Hillary Clinton campaign stops\nYeah yeah I I I'm very aware of that uh you know one of my best friends is a\nGood beret who uh you know he keeps up with a to see that but as they basically from city to city pretty amazing thing and a pretty big commitment but they they they are good I respect or frankly for taking that position\nOr people kept saying are you going to adores anybody you're going to do she says oh but of course Christ you know we're going to do it is about going across the country doing that's pretty remarkable what they were able to do it there was definitely happening\nAnd you know I think this will be a big part of that to\nA Rick real quick here ah remind people where they can go because they can download the movie today right\nThat's right it's a it's available on on our website which is probably the easiest to them than just to to click and there is just ... dot com\nOr you know you'll be able to go to ... to do it that way as well or wherever you typically Amazon Prime ... your crime or a you know wherever you typically get your movies but uh\nWe we encourage you to go

available also what was on our website it will be doing specials on our site the\nLater with that too but uh you know we we just the songs of the of the soundtrack I think there are just a further it's gracious though but I get the new saw the greater good a ... wage things as it was a it was all the soundtrack of a marriage that that will be the next God Bless the usa\nYeah wow that's awesome feel\nWell and that's that is great well Rick I I think that also for faced a you know for the faith community\nBecause you know sometimes the question is God's hands on a ... you know still on America has in because America's turned his back on God has got turned their back on him but again I remind them of scripture time and time again God's always looking he's looking for those that are following him\nAnd uh those that responded to march passion and and uh marks or you know vision and the voice that he heard from God and ignited and and it went from ... you know from his community I mean you talk about Jerusalem Jay edge some air the most part\nI mean this thing organically caught fire did it not\nA really good yeah it was a it was it was it was phenomenal is the\nThe the ... the people say you like watching a movie that I like watching the audience was yes that it will be so I I just took the roof of the chair of the other way but\nIt really is it's a really outgrow already like this that people get it going to get there was burning their biggest fire\nLearning or a America ... I'm not there is a dog that's what happens when you go to Pittsburgh I'm sure Bob friends will understand that he's sitting in for me today and beautiful ... every a ticket I go to Cleveland\nBut Bob is doing parents because if he got mine veteran may feel really hadn't been such a Sam Darnell family wouldn't be too far and wide right now\nBlaming Bob for that but if you can turn around and get the Senate back in Japan's Richard house stays under control Kevin McCarthy all will be forgiven die from up your job that you [noise]\nOnly you can manage\nOwn when he's not even president\nAnd ah he he does an exceptional job of that yesterday morning glory you are done and now we're on the corner every time I feel is ...\nI got to pay him a yeah morning glory glorious morning however you want a phrase that that doesn't cost me money by prince joining you live from the pain free relief factor outcome studios of my home base in as you said beautiful Cleveland, Ohio the rock and roll capital of the world\nOf and fourteen twenty you the answer to the pain free relief factor dot com studios there of thank you so much for joining us big program today David I'm drunk or coming up a little bit later in this hour uh in the eight o'clock hour at ... eastern time and the third our the program got used to that part of things\nUh my friend Peter ... United States civil rights commissioner will be joining us to talk about the caravan into a galaxy there of and also in the south or an hour of the program this morning we will hear from ah RJ home and he's the director of government relations for fair\nThat's an important organization you probably are very aware of\nThat as a loyal listener of the Hugh Hewitt show uh the federation of Americans for immigration reform it is an extraordinarily important organization that really has their finger on the pulse of what's going on with respect\nTo the ... now the caravan is the lead story of the morning without question and a and that includes last night's massive rally in Texas for Ted Cruz are held by the president of the United states did you see\nNot just how many people were there but there was ongoing coverage throughout the day yesterday on Fox News and in other places of the thousands and thousands of people who waited in line overnight some for twenty four maybe even pushing up to thirty six hours\nTo get in to hear the president in Texas a rallying for Ted Cruz last night and by the way what do you know what a strange strange sight to see you know it was only two short years ago\nMaybe two and a half a a little bit I guess when you go back to the summer of twenty sixteen in the primary season in the in the spring of or excuse me summer of forty fifty and then the primary season in the spring of twenty sixteen when Donald Trump and Ted Cruz we're not exactly sharing stages together in warm embrace\nA lying to head the calls and\nAccusations of you know National Enquirer stories about a a Ted Cruz's father related to JFK and and uh you know these are all of these kinds of strange things\nBut I'll tell you what nothing like two years of Democrat insanity to bring former political rivals together in common cause\nAnd at the end of the day that's what this is that is what this was\nThe president of United States last night rally in for and he's done this with others to\nYou know President Trump and Lindsey Graham didn't always get along very closely as you know Lindsey Graham was more closely aligned with one of President Trump's fiercest critics the late John McCain but it's amazing what the Democrats can do for Republican unity ten unification simply by being\nWell very democratic and that's wrong way say but being very Democrat\nAnd that's essentially what has happened last night so the president of the United states last night a rallying for Ted Cruz and they came out by the thousands and thousands of people seem to at least say people the media\nThe media the left Democrats whatever you want to call them and kind of it's kind of all one in the same those are all synonymous with one another the media and the Democrats on the left are literally all synonymous with one another they want to say that these Trump crowds are overblown they tell you this bronco by my held a rally\nIn California a a short while ago filled with about three million just to just the the area in the county he was in about three million very very blue voters it's a very blue district here seven hundred and fifty people come out to sea of\nPresident Trump has tens of thousands at all of these rallies there were always overflow crowds outside they're setting up big TV monitors\nYou know big screens for them to watch from the outside they just want to be a part of it and the reason why isn't just enthusiasm for what President Trump stands for including\nHis very strong statements yesterday about um about the caravan and about migrants that about securing our border and so on and so forth it's not they're not just rallying for what the president is preaching and what the president President is is I'm advocating\nIt's rallying against the tactics of the left rallying against the bullying rallying against the intimidation rallying against the harassment rallying against the physical battery in a salt in some cases route rallying against um you know the media calling for these things rallying against the left\nA laughing when Republicans are treated in such ways\nI Know you played this yesterday bad voice and all you put a lot or yellowish yesterday and I'm surprised you didn't play the whole show an audio form because his voice was so bad and get well soon hopefully you are a couple you're not listening right now you should be sleeping after a night in Pittsburgh God Bless you\nBut you should be sleeping but a Phillip range of course former Obama a deputy ... deputy assistant secretary of state\nUh on on MSNBC that essentially mocking Mitch McConnell who was being harassed in a restaurant the way Sarah Sanders has been harassed and restaurants the way so many others have just been attacked\nOr just for being Republicans just by rapid liberal protestors who listen to their masters\nOn national television online they listen to note that while they can listen to it and there are now there are no Democrats elected positions or other well respected positions of authority calling for an end to the harassment and intimidation\nThere ... no one is calling for an end to this\nHave you heard Nancy Pelosi have you heard Chuck Schumer the two ranking members of Congress for the Democrats have you heard any of the more popular\nOr Democrats or who are kind of in the news you know the Elizabeth Warren's the Cory bookers the Kamala Harris says have you heard any of them denouncing Maxine Waters and those who would call for more violence intimidation and harassment of Republicans no\nThey're not saying anything former President Obama who is still revered by the left\nIs he's speaking out and saying no stop this this is not what it's about we don't win in the streets by by uh intimidating harassing and and and quite frankly battering people in certain circumstances we don't win that way we went up the ballot box no\nNone of them are saying this instead they're on television law allowing the media and people like Philip brains using the media to call for more of this and guess what it has done\nIs this rally those thousands of people to all of these places where the president is holding rallies by the thousands\nJust on the seats and yet they're willing to sit outside for twenty four hours for thirty six hours they're ill getting like throwing up at a football game just send the chance that they can get in and if they can't get in then they'll cheer from the outside of the venue like they did last night last night down in Houston\nThat's that's not just pro Trump that's rebelling against the insanity of the left that's rebelling\nAgainst the coals for violence and the lack of calls for civility that's what's happening so the president of the United states really found a tremendous you know has found really a tremendous rallying cry\nYou know and and that is against what the government you know he he latched on to something I Know he didn't coin it but a lot of people are truly brought into play and the president seems to have 'em brace that and that is jobs not mobs Democrats if you vote Democrat it brings you mobs if you vote Republican\nThe president has taken a saying now it brings you jobs\nAnd he's a hundred percent right over four million jobs created since he took over and of course the lowest unemployment rate we've seen in this country in nearly what five decades\nLiterally five decades I Want to say it goes back to Nineteen sixty nine [noise] ah the lowest unemployment rate and of course the lowest all time unemployment rate for so many of those subgroups including African Americans Latino Americans are women and youth\nIn terms of unemployment rates so you bring your what do you want jobs are mobs and I think people are responding they're coming out to see the president they're coming out to listen they're coming out to hear him rally not only for his policies and for you know a continuation of the tax cuts and the things that have a you know that a sport our economic growth to the level that it has\nBut also for those members of Congress that need a a little bit of a boost to make sure that we maintain the majority in both houses and also for those who are running\nTo keep control but he would be ... you know he would be bucking political history\nIn the same way that he bucked it when he won the office of president and the first place it would just be an amazing thing\nBut at any rate the president last night obviously a spending a great deal of time talking about votes and voters in the United states\nAnd tying it to the caravan why and how [noise] quite simply because the Democrats are trying to import more voters by way of ... [noise]\nThat is we're going to stop it and he says we will have nothing that we will not used to stop that carries out\nGonna talk more about that as we continue this morning ... in Cleveland, Ohio sitting in the great you do if you're on the CIA\n[laughter] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] middle nonstop action packed for me [noise] [noise] [noise]\nYou're you're there for a wise prepared to deal no about why food storage well let me tell you earthquakes hurricanes what we see him every night on the news every week there's another disaster are you prepared\n... during a disaster ... percent of all households are not prepared disaster terrorism civil unrest there can't rely on the government for out\nAt least not right away\nControl and protect your family now called why food storage the nation's go through supplier for emergency food they provided millions of meals wise prepared food tastes good to easy to prepare meals already in minutes wise ... can be stored up to Twenty years be wise to be prepared\nFor a limited time you can try wise food for free calling out for your for example that eight hundred two by four Ninety five oh nine eight hundred five four Ninety five oh nine eight hundred two five four Ninety five or nine or log onto why food storage dot com eight hundred two five four Ninety five o nine\nOffice is a huge huge\nWe've\nGot some trends activities slowing things down through Glendale they shut down the west bound side of the one thirty four at\nThe fine work they're continuing until five today comes on and commerce does seven ten north of Atlantic ... street white lanes are gone ... sending it for thirty right now traffic over that stretch you just a little bit slow\nThe city council committee will try again today to craft a policy for short term rentals and consider the latest proposal the capital\nRenting of a primary residence at a hundred and twenty days\nThe proposal would also allow up to three hundred sixty five days if hosts petition for more time and meet certain criteria\nCity council and the planning commission have been working for several years to come up with a set of regulations for the Arab BNB industry which connects travelers with hosts looking to rent out a bedroom or their entire home\nThe planning commission last September approved the latest set of guidelines which would allow qualified host to rent year round something industry advocates had been asking for\nDozens of suspected gang members are behind bars thanks to a team effort between several California law enforcement agencies California attorney general ...

you see that kind of unity happening just a you know on an on an individual or an anecdotal scale or is this widespread Republicans were all coming together to combat what they see is democratic extreme as well\nI don't know if I put it that way I think that you have a lot of Republicans that were at odds with President Trump twenty sixteen and understand where their voters our number one ... the voters like President Trump so arguing or being at arm's length President Trump when you're running for reelection in a midterm election where you\nIt Republican base turnout to begin with a ... that's not going to work\nOr you know number number two I'm the president has been helpful in\nIn firing up the Republican base and especially the way politics has become so incensed Balkan eyes um

there are better to Senate races are potentially competitive Senate races it just doesn't do any good to 'em\nRun away from Trump so if you if you want to make sure you get the turnout that you're going to need and if you want to make sure you're going to get to turn it you're going to campaign with the president and you're going to make nice with him and I think it's just it's as simple as that\n... David I'm director is our guest a by printing for here is that it's not so much just the the campaigning with the president and and being aligned with the president\nIs being United against the Democrats I feel like the Kavanaugh episode of this uh ... late summer slashed ball\nA along with this caravan episode now it is it is driving a lot more unity among Republicans because they feel like the Democrats have just become so extreme enter enter basically resorting to any measures necessary to try to stop President Trump I feel like more than rallying for president it's railing against that Democrat push and that's what they're trying to do\nWell so I think that if if you look it correct look I think they're trying to use those two episodes and we know that have a lot of impact on Senate races as we know it has an impact\nOn some house races depending on the territory where you have solid Republican territory where Republican voters have been disengaged or maybe place it that's what happens when you draw Washington it for all the White House in a midterm year I think having a kind of served to re engage Republicans and sort of wake up\nWith the conservative base and and so I think that's a big part of it I I just think that when you're when you're looking at a Republican like Ted Cruz\nWho had previously battle with the president and they didn't always get along and there are a number of Republicans in that boat if you look at senator Dean Heller in Nevada and then the calculation wasn't so much gee these Democrats really scare me I'm I'm going to be with Trump and make a calculation was\nThat I'm going to be with Trump because that's going to help me win because that's where my voters are and because fighting with a Republican president if I'm a Republican isn't going to do me any good in the situation that I'm In\nI think with ... and some of these other issues have done a native little bit easier to unite with Trump from a policy perspective because it has put in the background maybe some of those issues that were problematic about Trump in some of these states that I Would contend in a state like\nYou know Tennessee or Arizona Texas\nA North Dakota Missouri uh the best place you could have been all along is probably with President Trump\nDavid I'm drunk or is our guest a this morning on the Hugh Hewitt programs so that the ... let's talk about why people want to align with the president the president that was supposed to be so unpopular the latest polls I think it was just yesterday NBC Washington or uh or or not a washing Wall Street journal poll\nShows him at forty seven percent which is peak which is pretty amazing thing and when you compare it to President Obama going into his first midterm in twenty times he was that around forty five forty six I saw those numbers correctly yesterday\nHow do you explain that given the and I think you've seen the the same surveys done by the media Research Council and others that Ninety two percent of the press coverage for the president this entire summer has been negative Ninety two percent of stories including the Trump had been negative yet he's up there at forty seven percent I'd explain that\nRepublican voters ... just don't pay attention to news stories that in that regard I mean I I don't think it matters to Republican voter what are right or what anybody in the meeting\nMorning glory America ... I'm not there so there's a dog that's what happens when you go to Pittsburgh I'm sure Bob plans will understand that he's sitting in for me today from beautiful cleaver every single I go to Cleveland\nBob is doing premise because if he got in mind that there may feel for early\nIf he hadn't been such a Sam Darnell than we wouldn't be too far in one right now\nBlaming us for that but if you can turn around and get the set it back in June bands Richard house stays under control and Kevin McCarthy all will be forgiven side lost your job thank you Robert [noise]\nDoing my best to doing my best to do my job in the face of incessant trolling from the host of the show who is it actually hear my goodness gracious [noise] uh\nThe Baker Mayfield story a thanks for joining us by France joining indeed from Cleveland, Ohio my home base the pain free really factor dot com studios of am fourteen twenty the answer things so much for joining us to start your day great conversation with David I'm drunk or I went out of time before I could ask them\nThe question about the caravan in and it's a pretty obvious question and that is\nHow is it and why is it that no Democrat politicians have spoken out against care not one not one I mean quite literally no one is saying whoa whoa whoa whoa\nThere started with two thousand and it's not what the seven thousand and by the time they reverse the one thousand miles they still have to go to get to the southern border of the United states it'll probably go ten twelve Fifteen thousand whoa whoa whoa whoa we can't just take all of these people in\nWe can't just you know you don't release all of these thousands of people into the into the fabric of the continental United States of America on a wink and a nod promised that they'll come back for an actual am they are now asylum hearing it some but we can't do that and also why is that the why is the overwhelming majority\nOf these individuals who are in this caravan why are the men of working age because there aren't a ton of families according to those reporting from a you know that caravan\nFamilies it's mostly males of working age that are coming here are these people are really\nSeeking asylum is the really something that terrible going on in the middle eastern Asia or Middle Eastern rather Central American nations although the president pointed out there are people from the middle east who have joined in as well\nRemember our southern border is essentially a revolving door for people to come into the United states from not just Mexico or from Central America but quite frankly from all over the world\nBecause these other countries are not taking their sovereignty as seriously as we uh we would like to hear but anyway\n[noise] although the Central American migrants are few things really so bad in their countries that they need to seek asylum from persecution\nAnd fear that they face in their own countries is that really what this is about is this really humanitarian issue where these people are being persecuted and they cannot you know they they cannot stay in their own countries without dying\nWell let's put that to the test for a moment we'll give it a little credit to Fox News here and do a one of my listeners on my local show in Cleveland ah for sharing this with me this was a Fox News report from Sunday\nAnd I'm questions by the reporter here from Fox News of a member of the caravan I think are extraordinarily revealing well the questions but moreover\nThe answers are extraordinarily revealing I Want you to listen very carefully to what is really going on in this caravan of quote unquote migrants\nThat many of us believe are actually more like invaders trying to circumvent us immigration law please give us a list\nI can see as far as the eye can see I can see on during the immigrants headed north to the bus into Honduras they went to Guatemala and now they're trying to tackle Mexico right now they are north of that river\nNorth of the bridge that you saw people on yesterday so last night people got frustrated bound to bridge Mexico's process about six hundred and forty people get a visa for potentially asylum here could take forty five Ninety Days people got for us if they weren't worth it so last night in house across the river swimming\nPeople came in droves I had to see maybe two hundred immigrants last site maybe in a thirty minute time processing the river coming here and now you see them now I said they're going to be as a caravan they claim they're underway to a town called ... there were about we're right now about twenty miles north of that river\nGoing up a chill up right now some of the people here you can see taking a break [noise] we've got some shade here they're getting something great guy and he joined now by one of the members of the a caravan of his name is Louis here from Honduras tell me where these people going why are they doing right now\nWe're going to ...\nPeople want to go to the border of United hey [noise] then we come they come in over here because um [noise]\nA situation in our country is going back\nAsk you this so as you know the un eighty hours here un high commissioner revenues refugees actually brought them and to try to help processing the standard that they're\nGoing to use as unless you're a victim of her or him have a credible fear of persecution from race nationality religion or political views don't qualify for asylum so what are these people going to say when they get the United states\nFriday or say something I don't know they're gonna probably as\nThey they gave him something they can stay on the United states and they can't pay can go to school so they apartments and they can go to work as you know President Trump is that's it\nThat's it that's what\nYou needed to hear and I hope you understood what you just heard you cannot claim asylum in the United states unless you are fleeing\nPersecution on the basis of race or religion or sexual orientation etcetera he ran down the reporter ran down the things that you can claim asylum or you're being persecuted in your country so what is it he asked this ... this caravan remember that you're going to say when you get up there and he said basically we're coming to pick your jobs\nYou hurt him\nWere coming to take advantage of your educational system are going to put our kids in your schools and we're going to take your jobs he said we want to go there and we want to work and then what are you going to do with that money by the way are you going to spend it in the United states lost at least helping to contribute to the United states autonomy\nAnd he's not going to let people in Mexico said they are not going to let these people pass I Will tell you aren't earlier today we saw about two hundred wire police were going to stop them on this highway the brief they pulled back they retreated I don't think they want a confrontation but the point is president said he's not going to let people when you got to\nSay that I saw last last week we take over there but a a vending bought or sold them all and people were upset that voter they are already out of the United states\nThere's a change though as you know that Mexico in the United states it's supposed to reach a third party saved agreement unless you follow fire t._v. request asylum in Mexico we're not going to the United states is not going to let you and that's going to be the reason for denial\nThat can stand up\nDon't look back they throw it away they send them back to our country we're coming\nAnd that's one of the that's one of the\nIf they send us back we're going to turn around and come back again\nSo he says we are going to come here we want to take jobs and we're going to take money and we're going to send it back to support our family's back there this is why it's the vast majority of the members of this caravan are like I said working age males\nBecause they're gonna come to the United states to work they're not fleeing persecution for the race in Honduras they're not fleeing persecution because of their sexual orientation they're not fleeing persecution because of their um their uh ethnicity they're not fleeing persecution because of a of any reason whatsoever\nThey are coming to the United states because their nation can't get them work and so they're coming to take jobs for people in another country and they're not going to repatriate those dollars back to the wrong country they don't want to come to the United states to be America\nHow do we know this\nBecause they're not walking under the American flag they're walking behind a massive street wits banner of the Hondurans live and then they were flying Honduran flags over themselves as they march\nIf a group of seven thousand people tries to enter another country flying their own flag that is not a migration that is an invasion\nThey don't want to abandon the nation that has essentially made their lives unlivable in their minds and they want to move that nation north into a better nation but not swear allegiance to that new nation\nOne would think that it might be more beneficial for these people to be flying an American flag over their heads saying we love America we want the American dream instead they're flying the Honduran flag saying we have a right to come here and still be Honduras we're bringing Honduras nor\nThrough Guatemala to Mexico and into the United states and you can't stop us and if you try to we will turn around and come back again by the way the president or let us in last time he's going to have to let us in this time to not the president\nOf the United states last night speaking of Texas at his rally for Ted Cruz said really not so much I don't have to do that and I'm not going to do that\nNow it's over seven thousand it's organized this isn't just you know legitimate grass roots and just people are starting to walk and somebody else followed like Forrest Gump\nThey're not just running alongside just random laying off the cuff this is an organized effort these people are funded and they're fed\nThey're

I Want to play something for you very quickly this was a part of a Fox News reports I'm from Mexico or just on the northern side of a ... with a Guatemala and I'm a reporter is talking to one of them one of the migrants are one of the invaders depending on your point of view\nAnd saying you you can't claim asylum in the United states unless you are claiming persecution by your home countries government on the basis of one of of several things and those would be race religion nationality political opinion or social group\nSo if you can't credibly claim one of those things what is that that you're going to say when you get there and he was the response\nFriday or something I don't know they're gonna probably as\nToday and they gave him something or they can't say I I mean I Can't say we can go to school so they can apartment and they can go to work\nSo it's ... it's it's just plain as as the nose on your face they're saying essentially we don't have a claim to asylum we just want to go there and go to work we want to go there and take American Jobs\nAway from American citizens or for legal immigrants legal residents in the United states and then we're going to repatriate the money back to our own country that we can't stand because we're leaving but were flying the flag 'cause we march northward anyway\nThey ... this is not about asylum there is no persecution and Honduras these people are just trying to circumvent immigration laws and come to the United states illegally\nIf that caravan consisted of journalists warriors and potential politicians or TV talk show host you can bet that wall would go up in a hurt the\nFact of the matter is that the vast majority of illegal immigrants are coming here for jobs or simply to take advantage of the system I mean that is a fact we'll go to support the journalists tried to spin the bottle let's play identity politics for just a moment okay the progressive\nLung me let's act like Democrats\nYeah well you know kind of like that but what to do that okay [noise] um the fact of the matter is and you and I've talked about this for the civil rights commission has conducted hearings who studies on this issue [noise] those\nMigrants as they're called who are coming up here which is truly an invading force on moss\nThe vast majority of them are military age males Ninety percent of them I was looking very closely for the alleged families I didn't see him I don't need a harsh about the schools are just affects the journalist seemed to gloss over [noise]\nBut as we've shown them civil rights commission\nOf these individuals are going to be displacing low skilled American workers and what we found that the commission is that one group most harshly affected by that displacement are black males blacks in general a black males and it's profound\nThat forty percent of the decline in the labor force participation rate among blacks over the last couple of decades is attributable to competition\nLow wage competition from illegal immigrants who tend to congregate and compete with lax in many of the industries that blacks have been historically concentrated such as construction service agriculture so on and so forth when you do the math on it and we have\nWe're talking about nearly one million jobs that blacks have lost due to competition from low wage\nIllegal immigrants and that just to rest but illegal immigrants [noise]\nNow if that were to happen in any other circumstance you can just imagine what the outcry would be American citizens who are being harmed and if we play the game of glasses on identity politics it is one of the most vulnerable cohorts in America in terms of\nTheir status in society but we don't hear anything about that from the politicians who are currently running for office the upcoming election and if you take a look at the Democratic party and their dependence on the black\nVote we know that Ninety percent of the black vote traditionally goes to the Democratic candidate for president will say it was true with respect to other officers but ... percent [noise]\nAnd if you only peel away a couple of percentage points of a group from the Democratic\nParty then they effectively become as competitive as the weak part just a couple of points that's all it takes it doesn't require ten percent or Fifteen Percent and that's why the whole county west German ground outgrew ha ha or caused so much consternation on the left because it was a break\nIn the solid wall that the Democrats ... ... so that's simply you know if they want to get your identity politics this is a this is damaging to all of America\nBut particularly those favorite groups of the Democratic party and I would suggest that those favorite groups take a hard look at whether their interests are being protected by progress it's\nPeter cursing our is our guest he is the is a a commission on the United states commission on civil rights Pete hum you mentioned the wall and your first remark about how fast it would go up if it were those other individuals coming to this country\nAt the wall is is a very interesting point here because correct me if I'm wrong\nEven if we were to build this wall it would not stop what we're seeing right now now it would would stop those we're branching off from the caravan when it gets to our border and rather than going to our point of entry and it's just crossing the river or jumping over a a lame little barbed wire fence you know that we used to consider a barrier for us to stop immigration\nBut if they come that way yeah so what would stop that but all people would have to do is continue to go to the actual important point of entry which would be gaps in the wall and say asylum I'm claiming asylum you gotta let me and then you got to let them let me lose because you're not allowed to detain me or my family or my children\nWe found that out with the last caravan that came through or else is going to be a political price to pay and a judge to tell you can't do that you gotta let me listen to the continental us and uh yeah I promise I'll come back from my uh for my asylum hearing which we know they don't do what wouldn't stop that would it be\n[noise] well it it would I think present the a a symbolic barrier\nOr it would make things a little bit more difficult I think that it would now you'll white that setting yourself at a\nQuarter century Mickey silently you seen that happened and again we started this civil rights commission\nThat happens is no war the three to four percent of people with her for their hearing slips gun in disappear into beach area of the United states so President Trump is exactly right the laws need reform to have to be more tells you put a wall\nWill have a I Believe to be a significant impact let's just take a look at current events [noise] we had a migration similar to what we're\nWitnessing right now in Europe from Northern Africa in the middle east we had those huge chains of migrants coming across southern Europe into Germany in other places and hungry said no we're not going to do this we're not going to accept this and they\nBuilt a sense for lack of better to them something more than ... percent something more akin to a wall and every wonder why it said it was going to be an effective well\nIt went from hundreds of thousands of migrants entering hungry to virtually zero within a year so these barriers work otherwise countries around the world when you're working barriers are they actually work and it's something that is\nOnly part of the toolkit you're right that if people are going to be presenting a bogus asylum claims that is an issue but I Do think the Detroit valuable walls found\nAnd do they have to be carrying weapons in order to be considered in the city for suspicious to which could uh justify the use of troops I don't know there's a lot of gray areas there but I think that\nIn the first instance
