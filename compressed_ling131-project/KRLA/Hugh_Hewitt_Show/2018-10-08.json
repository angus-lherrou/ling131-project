they were in school and get a smack\nBut it was a ... in Los Angeles has been so critical and\nExcuse me you know young people were really struggling scaring warfare or on the streets were hurting each other killing each other and Denver really want to provide a place where young people of any color cook them and find the love and support\nA so it started with pretty simple origin where\nThere and it's grown tremendously over the past twenty five years a search somewhere in the neighborhood of twenty thousand years and families are so we know wraparound families we were sort of your people ... years old since ... provide a whole of the program\nHow do people in the community sure about you how do they come to take your resources\nWill because of what it's called home is going to open now for twenty five years ... and we know from the corner of so called ...\nBut it's a thirty part though who's corporate campus because classrooms and Gore who I Am about flooding field and computer labs and the arts programs in the recording studio there certainly are and all kinds of things you know we're a known quantity and the community and\nWe're really are too many other organizations that are doing all the things that we do\nThat in one place and provide services for the whole family and for young people from ... years old and twenties\nSo I'm really a popular place called home once a young person crosses are peripheral all the way to higher education but we've some four hundred young people to college with scholarships\nAnd we also have a vocational development on ... program provides paid internships and introduced to explore\nA you know good paying them fulfilling jobs I'm In the long the where young people are learning values of skills and getting involved with the community as volunteers and so it's really something that's er the entire community and I'm Kirk young people to grow up and make a difference in the world\nThen it's pretty hard to keep something like that if you grew up in either of these kinds of meat so at this point um we have a pretty large where do we have about six hundred and young people and families on world but we have more than that on our way to do\nOh that presents a challenge if you could serve more would you would you like to grow or do you feel about the right size\n[noise] will indeed we are committed to growth there have been growing up we open one new building that year and a half ago which recall the bridge\nIt's right across the street from our main campus and that is now devoted to our teens and young adults hit houses are really unique high school a charter high school a partnership with the victory schools called rise Hi Eddie PCH\nHas a special focus on working with youth and the foster system\nA youth coming out of the juvenile justice system may be on probation and homeless here and this is a full accredited high school that serves all grades and that runs the first half of the day and then in the second half of the day of the people that are full wraparound program\nAnd then on the main campus were surfing will recall the little the middle of a second graders through the eighth graders\n[noise] what is driving the need these days you mentioned homeless uses sector how how critical to the challenges ease the homeless issue for your service is\nNo organization is not primarily a homeless service organization but what we found them and many other organizations who are serving in families of LA\nAre impacted as well we found that there's really no way to to get away from that issue it's permeating so much in the LA\nBomb the fastest growing segment of homelessness has been youth a minor families ah it's pretty unprecedented and so we do find some other families who were serving a are living in cars or there may be uh going from one relatives\nCouch to another uh many families sharing a two bedroom apartment and in the case of our teams that go to rise by some of these are young people who are living on the streets who may be coming out of juvenile justice and don't have anywhere to go\nSo we've had to strengthen you know our case management capacity we do have mental health services at a place called on the other folks counseling program\nUm and nutritious as a big deal for a lot of the young people who come up to our campus every day or\nThree to four hundred on our campus of the day but also for families so we are cooking meals and we're also giving away bags of groceries every week and we do throughout the year some larger kinds of distribute from the bench for household Central's I'm\nA food clothing beds you know diapers so good shoes\nOr glasses all kinds of things\nWe're talking about a place called home Jonathan how critical easy to get to use what issues are at stake you weren't able to reach them\nYou know look it's one of those situations where you either provide opportunity and services support early in the young person's life or at the end of the\nDay you're going to be responsible for young people who may be improving the justice system or maybe doing a self harm or harm to others and may become a burden on society so when you see this as an investment without only in the young people\nAnd families but in supporting them to become leaders and to make a difference in their own community so that the east coast that a place called home\nWe make sure that the young people families to understand that this was a place to just come and be consumers to get free stuff this is a place to call them develop yourself figure\nOut what your gifts or what your capacity or develop them and then figure out ways to pay that forward and we'll share forward and make a difference in your community in the world\nSo like any young person uh every person every young person that crosses the threshold at a place called ...\nHave the capacity to take responsibility for their own lives and contribute to making things better world that's an investment you know not just them than these young people but in our city and in our society as a whole\nHand as far as success stories or can you kind of walk us through a examples you've seen where someone has gone to the program and is achieving today and is now giving back\n[noise] well that's a ... you know we have a a pathway to higher education so for Fifteen Years now and then comparing them and supporting young people and getting ready to go to college\nAnd then go on to a pound a university or a community college some of whom are going on now to get graduate degree and one of the things that I Love I mean I can give you specific stories but I Want to share with you that over the years that I've been doing this work close to Thirty years now\nI'm almost ten of those at a place called home\nOne of the things I've noticed is that young people used to say I can't wait to get out of self\nAnd now what they're saying and I mean really every one other thing I Can't wait to come back to south central with my degree so I can contribute and they're coming back and become teachers with social workers or the law enforcement they're working at a place called the

parents didn't graduate\nEven from high school uh he was forced to go on to college and he's at Berkley right now um and he's doing well and he's working hard so I think that the idea of young people

another meeting he is dead so publicly ... to ... really\nStoke those claims of the talks you see a president who sees that potentially is one of his signature foreign policy a achievement if he can

confirmation that saw Brett Kavanaugh triumphed what is the mood there\nIn the mood inside of the White House when they look at the calendar is they've got about a month ago before the midterms the president's going to hit the road he didn't go to Iowa this week Erie, Pennsylvania to help that Senate candidate Lou Barletta\nThey believe they have a message to sell on the tax cut\nOn the repeal of aspects of the AC a on the Supreme Court justice in the overall the judiciary and the more kind of traditional hawkish direction and foreign policy that's life even from a public and\nNow the question is can they sustain that message and make that the closing message rather than a a some kind of controversy here scandal a month and be a lifetime in politics so they're optimistic but they also know the elections not tomorrow\nThree point seven percent unemployment recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel or the congressional tax cut all this stuff I put it in a Washington Post called today because Republicans need to make a closing argument bought this anger\nCertainly gave them an opening and the attention of traditional Republicans uncomfortable with President Trump styled agree or disagree [noise]\nAgreed that the Republican voter now has what they want to turn out can they keep that enthusiasm up sometime to politic you you know this\nIs the voter who feels like they were wrong the Democratic voter maybe this time maybe more voted motivated to turn out knowing this snake knowing Republicans are getting so much done they have to turn out that they want to flip the house and not only have subpoena power but people to stop this this Republican agenda that's moving like machine\nNot let's talk about that Jerry ... is going to go after Brett Kavanaugh\nMaxine Waters is actually hurts the physical pursuit of Republican she would be the chair of House Financial services now there would chair judiciary I think that prospect actually may stop democratic momentum in some districts like Mimi Walters that's my home district when they used to live in California um that's because\nThe people don't want this Bob they want to go back to normal life I think\nThis is a challenge for leader Pelosi she's not talking in these terms she's an old school Baltimore and moved to California politician who understands that the midterms you got to reach out just like she did when she wasn't a house in two thousand that the suburban voter\nThe voter who may have one for Obama and well went to Trump and twenty sixteen below sea is it making the case for impeachment or for major investigations of these things she's trying to make the message and economic fairness trade\nBut who is the Democratic party Nancy Pelosi what they're more careful message you know where's the Jerry ...\nTalking about investigating Kavanaugh and Maxine Waters and that's the looming question if you're a voter id you define it and how do you see it\nSo I've been to watch for ads that show the protesters and I I Believe Republican congressional candidates are going to show the mob breaking through the barriers if the Supreme Court and Lindsey Graham I Want to play this for you he wasn't on our network yesterday he was on Fox News when Chris Wallace cut them right\nWell it's a while now and November at that makes sense I Hope everybody running for the house in these purple districts will asked will be asked a question do support in teaching judge Kavanaugh\nBased on five allegations none of which can be cooperative and he won an outcome so badly that she would basically turned the law upside down a all I can say is that this is going to the streets at the ballot box [laughter] how I'm going to have I've never campaigned against a colleague ally [noise]\nThat's about to change I'm going to go throughout this country and let people in these that you know purple states um red states where Trump won know what I thought you know what I think about this process\nThat Robert Costa I Wish he would say it on sale and I got to have you on this week on our network but set it on Fox\nThat means he'll go to North Dakota and worked its Heidi Heitkamp he'll go to Missouri and work against Claire McCaskill he'll go and work against Joe Donnelly in Indiana he will go and work I'm a against leave a Tammy Baldwin Wisconsin that is actually kind of shocking for me is that angry\n[noise] he is and he he really has become President Trump's top ally in the U.S Senate yet President Trump's close when Senator Paul and a few other senators McConnell is the power player who makes things happened but Graham\nHe channels the rage of President Trump about the process about the Democrat but what he does is he has a real understanding of the inside process of this data and so they're really a innocent team won at a at sixteen hundred one on the hill\nNow I was um I was telling Michael shear last or I have yet to receive a call to interview for White House counsel so I guess I'm not running someone's got to replace Don\nMcGahn a and I remember from my years as an assistant counsel in the White House that job on the second for the White House is one of the most ... in the entire government people don't know how good for building was he was recognize last week for having put\nJustice Scalia on the court he also help what chief justice Roberts on the court\nFor what do you think who is going to be the new White House counsel\nWell it's it's clear the Emmett flood\nWho has experience on impeachment and executive privilege is going to be a major player legally inside of this White House regardless of whether we it formally becomes White House counsel or not you're already in he's working closely with McGahn McGahn has told friends are based in my reporting that he would like she put perhaps easiest Chester\nBut President Trump has yet to make a fuss in and out and President Trump says he pretty much knows what we want but he hasn't said so I the only challenge the lottery or is a lot of people don't want to come in for the whites you firms because as much as the client of ... all of a lifetime to be with the president United States uh this is going to be a political war not just\nIllegal war [laughter] you know back in the Clinton years President Clinton divide the counsel's office history pretty well uh in Reagan we had seven lawyers total favorite is it nine counting the counseling because of the death the council poll seven that's just an associate capitals so a total of nine quadrupled under Bill Clinton in the impeachment divided the opposition to the\nTo the defense team on impeachment and then the other team which did everything else judges executive orders things like that it seems to me they need that ... team Trump as well with Emmett flood running through the fence of the president and there is a story out that John Kelly is preparing for subpoenas by the dozens\nOf the house Democrats get control the gab ... can you confirm that\nI I ...
