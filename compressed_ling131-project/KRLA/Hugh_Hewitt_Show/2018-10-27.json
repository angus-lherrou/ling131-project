moment here we've got to any word it was a\nNanny of course a a good friend of the shows with focus on the family here\nThe vice president of parenting or because of we need vice presidents of parenting I tell you [laughter] [laughter]\nThat's hilarious bill they expect for having me on the show for said\nHey good to have you talked about Halloween but when we get into a some of this stuff I mean what did you make and I was curious to get your read on this\nIs that you got some cities are in the country you know banning Thirteen year olds for trick or treating on Halloween I mean ah all this stuff is just a it's like whoa you know maybe we're better off just doing trunk or treat huh\n[laughter] truck or a threat sometimes just simplify Halloween would be would be really nice back in the back ... ... maybe a decade or two decades ago we didn't have some of the the deviant issues that go along with Halloween and a lot of rules around that it was just a time for for funds for many families and it\nCertainly with with media social media or movies some of the darkness around Halloween horror movies or has taken it to a different level but we don't have to go there's Christians we can we can do our own direction with the opportunity to pretend to imagine\nYeah exactly and there's nothing wrong with that but it's when it's gone overboard as you say a and were reflecting a you know the music that's put out into the culture of movies uh decentralization of our young people\nI mean you know some of these things done and I'm sure when when you see some of these kids walking around and even going to school and the way they're dressed up and\nYou think oh my God you know what what what is going on here\nYes you know I've I've a Thirteen year old daughter and a Fifteen year old son as many of you know and uh my son has had a lot of his friends binge watching horror movies and not close friends but just men school people are knows that are around this time they're saying hey we're going to go watch this this hormone as a group do you want to calm or\nOr we're gonna we're gonna watch hours and hours of\nHorror movies and and uh then some of the music that that comes out with that group it does it does create some great conversations with your team's about and you know what it means to have your mind and renewing your mind what what it means for on the on the Halloween when it interacts with their mind what what does that mean and\nIt's great conversation my son about gardening your heart in your mind and the horror movies are made to to scare and I think there's a lot demonic stuff with it really\nWell and that's the thing and and why you know Christians have been\nEspecially a protective over this and not wanting their kids to participate you know churches have responded as I mentioned with the events you know fall festivals trunk or treat you know where there's candy give out and you know that I kind of deal and so the kids can\nA habit and ah you know the the uh in the costumes that we see at churches or not we're seeing on this [laughter] bar to cities\nAre because some of those are really you know just bizarre and ah I'm I'm like you Danny I'm all for you know imagination I'm all for the creativity\nUm in fact we used to have a dear friend of ours I mean she was she was gifted it was like God designed or for Halloween\nYou she would she would come up and she would construct I mean her kids always one you know the best costumes in school and stuff like that she was just so creative and how she put these costumes together and I remember with beauty and the beast when uh you know that was a hit movie\nI mean she dressed up these kids and you think oh my gosh that they came up a Hollywood back [laughter] you know it was terrific you know\nThere's some there's some great costumes out that I think a lot of churches have\nBecome very creative and and this trade some some wonderful opportunities for kids to express their imagination about the Bible dressing up as a Bible character getting to talk about\nThat character is and why they're dressed up as a character and\nSome youth groups will do a like an escape rumor mystery thing where they go together and and have a time of a fun and and enjoying it together and some snacks and you know we\nWere were were created we don't have to go out and dress up as a knock on banks to have a good time on Halloween you can buy their superheroes and talking about that where you know I for me and my family we've\nHad to use this opportunity to talk about our new identity and Christ that we have\nThe opportunity wearing caution cautious three Paul says we're as Christians were giving given a new identity putting on the new cells but\nIn reality if we look at where kids are out today there's a lot of pretending that goes on throughout the year just to get love ... magic in Halloween you talk about what does it mean to be an authentic real person\nAnd and talking about that identity that that we have in Christ and living that out the rest of the time and Halloween is the only day that we pretend to be someone else instead of the entire year\nYeah exactly well and I think what would you bring up here Danny as the Christians have kind of incense got caught off balance here was Halloween because\nIt it's kind of morphed into a um you know something that was so I'm a confront too and in contrast to ah to our Christian faith\nAnd it's just seems like it's gotten worse than so ah Christians have kind of falling back on their heels as opposed to saying okay how can we take back this holiday and you know bring the family fun back into Halloween\n[noise] yeah I agree I slip in for it is a good place to go I'm thinking I was thinking about things that are true and ... ... what our mind can do but ... and the creativity of our mind and and talking about that that scripture alone Philippines for a music is a great way to look at\nHalloween what are some truth thinks about at one truth thing is we can be creative God has created a stabbing imagination we can have fun and we can play together as a family that part is very healthy\nSo let's do it that way we don't have to participate in those but the other things that are very dark about Halloween and I think it shows that contrast of good and evil Halloween brain certainly brings that out in a very clear way and I think this is great preparation\nFor the the Thanksgiving season and Christmas season when when we ... we began our time as a family with fun and and imagination take his time to maybe that maybe that maybe it's the beginning of of some movie a weekend so throughout the\nTime all the way up till Christmas as a family and picking those out maybe it's a time of\nCelebrating a superhero times and what what superpowers God has given us through prayer and through the Holy Spirit maybe it's just a ... France some games out every year around this time you\nYour brand game out and and you play that same game around Halloween this you can still create some great to traditions around us and it doesn't have to be dark\nWell didn't you know what you said you're and I and I hope people caught this is that you and this is a perfect time to engage the kids\nYou know and have and get them involved in the conversation don't you know you don't have to have the answers you talk to them and just say hey you know what does it mean to you you know what I'm you know what do you think about Halloween and uh

the psychology behind the guy that you're doing it and how are we on the on the trail of finding them\n[noise] um okay so you know we're we're only speculate here you know nobody knows for sure now

election that his way here than the average mid term the key word for Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer\nImpeachment of president hasn't been such strict flying Michael good one of the New York post including the rally with Ted Cruz once again with Kevin McCarthy\nTwenty six team was a long time ago in politics I remember\nBeing at the convention when crews on endorsed Trump and his speech and he was a century booed off the stage and I thought boy somebody just blow up this political career\nBut here we are two years later and there again and uh all as well and and you know when you need each other you're able to overlook a lot of sin but now and that's politics as usual\nYeah pretty much a listen the president is is working this campaign cycle from my amateur eyes Michael as hard as he would be as if he was running for office himself\nFirst of all is that a fair assessment secondly isn't gonna make a difference are we going to see some momentum growing in the Republican grassroots a congressional races that he's hoping he will be able to turn up the heat on\nWealthier your first point about him running as hard as if he were on the ballot um yeah I think he's actually running as as as life depends on it and and it does at a certain sense because if the Democrats\nTake the house or take both Congress says he's going to have his hands full that'll still have to adapt if they have the house\nWe know what a Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler and Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi have in store so it's going to be a very difficult to ride it they take the Senate as well then it would be extremely difficult for the president\nSo I think that he clearly recognizes that danger he's been out there three four days a week or putting in a Norris energy and time\nAnd yet I think that the\nSignificance or or the the question of whether he's helping yes in some in some states more than others in some districts more than others but he has a unique ability beyond what any president does I think to focus the mind on issues right and\nJust as he did with the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation process and the political character assassinations that the Democrats carried out on Capitol and now with the\nCaravan of migrants caravan Trump is doing something similar I he has a unique ability to spotlight an issue with language and emotion\nThat really gets the juices flowing and I believe in both cases accurately show I think he said some things about the caravan that may not stand up in terms of how many middle Easterners and that sort of thing when the less if they are able to reach the border\nIn significant numbers that that says we don't have a border\nAnd I think that is a significant political issue in the mid term than say you have a cabin and the care of them are are they in these two issues the president has highlighted are very significant issue is which is why you're seeing the left go crazy attacking him over\nIt's common it is weird this is it's like\nThis kitten the candidate has brought back Trump's number one political issue from twenty sixteen and put it on the front page for him to run on again and twenty Eighteen\nTo me when he that day one when he announced his campaign in twenty Fifteen I mean that's the day when he talked about Mexicans not sending their best some of them are rapists that was one yeah and that proved to be a very important issue for him and you know Kevin me\nThe immigration issue\nThat cuts across a lot of things I mean certainly impacts American Jobs\nThe economic situation the sanctuary cities that are also impacts public safety national security and so it is an issue that's potent and a lot of different ways and caravan I think is actually helping the president now [laughter]\nYeah I I caution saying we don't know how this story at right if he were to send the military if there were to be violence in the military were to accidentally or even intentionally\nKill people maybe children that would be a pretty horrible situation all around that I think would work against the president but for now\nIs that the threat of the caravan the pictures the the the imagery of the Evan crashing through the borders into Mexico and shame nobody's gonna stop us we're going to the United states that rightfully alarms\nI think a lot of Americans that we really have lost control of our borders\nThis caravan working its way up to our southern border has absolutely\nA campaign theme from the twenty sixteen lecture but it has also raised a whole host of question mark strand from am eleven sixty hope for

the things that they did as far as the open borders or the ... guy you see it as well when you have a conservative women who don't agree with the whole murdering of the unborn child is the birth

care about or white males I mean they pretty much so given up on them a less you or reject the toxic masculinity as they called it\nThere's no question that the cultural and political figures on the

N. G. N.

other letters to follow precisely because identifying as sexual minorities they are they able to leverage their power together\nBut this is where we also need to understand the tea transgender represents a particular challenge to anyone who has to run anything\nIt's a particular challenge to legislators it's a challenge to school administrators it's a challenge to anyone who has to do something as simple as labeled a bathroom male or female for men or women when you're looking at this kind of confusion it filters down to every dimension of society\nThat is why it was big news on Sunday when the New York times broke the story about proposed guidelines dealing with the definition of these issues\nThat would come from within the Trump Administration Monday edition of the New York times included a front page article by Eric el green Katie dinner and Robert pair the headline was ... may limit how government defines one sex\nThen into some heads gender listed at birth some had to threat to the protections of those who identify as transgender the reporters begin the story with these words quote the Trump Administration is considering narrowly defining gender as a biological immutable condition determined by Jenna tail at birth\nThe most drastic move say the reporters yet in a government wide effort to roll back recognition and protection of transgender people under federal civil rights law in quote\nNo that's silly paragraph from the New York times but let's work backwards just a little bit for one thing we are told the proposed guidelines again obtained by the New York times indicate according to the reporters\nThe most drastic move yet in what's described as a government wide effort to roll back recognition and protections of transgender people\nUnder federal civil rights law now wait just a minute when federal civil rights legislation had anything to do with transgender people the answer would be nothing but what is implied in this is the fact that the gangs for the transgender community by administrative action under the Obama administration\nThey are threatened to be rolled back by the definition of these issues under the draft guidelines obtained by the New York times so what's really going on here well the beginning of the paragraph tells us what's going on\nThe Trump Administration we're told is considering narrowly defining gender as a biological immutable condition determined by ... at birth\nNow before going any further in the article let's just say what we should all understand\nThat is exactly that is fundamentally that is virtually universally throughout time and throughout space how human beings have defined what it means to be male and female and to be to use the modern language a gender and human being from the beginning of the human experience\nThis is why as we've often pointed out when a baby is born simply looking at the baby there is the almost immediate celebration and it at a vacation it's a boy or it's the girl\nThe Trump administrator and according to the New York times is considering a definition that would be totally consistent with that\nMost basic human affirmation but you'll notice that that lead paragraph has written as if the Trump Administration has been caught trying to do something that is innovative but of course the administration if these guidelines are exactly as the New York times reports\nNot doing anything innovative at all it is simply declaring what a rational person throughout virtually any age of human experience until very very recently in

that we would be casting about it but\nIt said in those points that we actually then discover that kind of theological underpinnings that we have or that we don't have\nHow necessary was that for Joseph to experience all the suffering the trail the injustice that you are describing that we nose in scripture oh what useful purposes could that have served for him and if so is any of that applicable to us in our struggles\nWell you know one of the things about the doctrine of Providence is that we have to remember that you know guard is always working together in in a variety of circumstances\nYou know so if for example Joseph says why is this happening at the you know when he finds himself in the pet well the answer to that question is not into this for him to focus on that this is understandable but it's not it's not the answer\nA similarly if he says you know why is this going on in my life or why is this happening to me in actual fact what is happening to Joseph is not ultimately about what God is doing with Joseph but rather about what good is doing in the lives of other people who are around Joseph\nAnd so it it it actually is it's helpful reminder to as that God is much bigger than our circumstances and that he's at work in a variety of of not only circumstances but in a variety of consequences\nYou know for example in the story of a actually a bar so swear that the Holy Spirit is set to forbid them from a going out onto the next part of their plan journey\nAnd the response to that is frustration\nBut in actual fact the result of that is that the gospel then comes to Europe and moved from Asia to Europe\nFor the latter part of the book Alister you make the point of forgiveness how important was that not just for his brothers but even for Joseph maybe especially for Joseph that he could find it hard to forgive them\nI mean absolutely crucial because without without that reconciliation then the story would be would just be hanging by by a thread wouldn't that um but in actual fact at the reconciliation\nThat took place to place a through all these various circumstances and that uh the alienation between him and his brothers and all of a jealousy that was represented in it\n... makes a great a conclusion that just absolutely remarkable and particularly that\nJoseph is the one who takes the initiative and that Joseph has all of the power\nTo uh to respond to his brothers in kind he could have had them in prison he could have dealt with them to speak up there and said you know this is what you did to me and this is what I Will do to you and\nIn that you see it's one of the great pictures of Joseph is one of the pictures in the Bible that point it has forward to the Lord Jesus Christ himself\nWho uh was humiliated before he was exalted and ah who threw his sacrifice provides you know salvation who was brought down in order that he might be brought back up again\nAnd what the father is doing with Joseph is what he actually does with Jesus or you know it at the justice testers brothers he says you intend to do this for evil that God intended it for good\nWhich is exactly what ... is the case when you think about the death of Jesus that the religious authorities intended it for evil\nBut in that great moment of intended evil God was working the salvation of men and women it said it really is truly remarkable picture and to our reminder to us that God is much bigger than us\nAnd is it not true also faster but the higher God may want to live any one of us up you've got to understand that he's going to first have to take us down in much similar way am I right\nWell it's often a patch on this and that that uh that he breaks has to be forty ... and are here to use as I say and and of course

one of the intriguing things about the story that we would love if there was some kind of ... from the jail but no it's just so we're\nLooking at it all unfold from the outside in order that we might pondering wonder I then again it part of the answer to that is found in that does it really is a type of the Lord Jesus Christ\nIn the same way that we watch the unfolding story of Jesus\nOr we don't know much of what is going on except by observation\nFinal question what would you like to say to folks listening right now who are in their own difficulties their own food despondency will their own crises that seem endless and they prayed and beg God for intervention and they don't hear anything what would you say the word of encouragement to them\nYou know part of my reading this morning was found a hundred and Eighteen but ... says I was pushed back and falling\nBut the lord help me ... and strengthen may and I was saying are ... so the experience of being pushed back and feeling as though we're about to collapse\nIs not an unusual experience it's painful and I think we have to cast ourselves bike on the things that we know about God in other words that we need to bring our emotions underneath the jurisdiction of\nOur minds underneath the jurisdiction of the things that we know to be true of thought that he has he he doesn't cause his children needless tears\nGoing on for people I Want representing me and and the national government might be wrong about that but I Do notice that in that ... that I'm older now showing that in the contested states and now at least from the outside\nWhereas there was like Thirteen fourteen percent advantage or on the Democratic side a month ago is now one two three no I think that this whole um these attacks\nAre hurting the Democrats image and I think that hopefully but this will reflect the self from the maternal actually\nOr the Democrats so unhinged Bruce that they can see the damage that this does to their own party I mean 'cause the thing is this let's just say let's let's let's say Democrats to take over and and even if they don't regardless I mean we've got people here they got some serious mental problems I mean they got there exercising themselves\nAnd this is all you know the mainstream media is not reporting on it it's almost like it's acceptable so even after the election we've got their mentality and they're anxious to deal with I mean this isn't like suddenly going to go away I'm In you know after the election\nNo it's not no it's not it started when Trump was elected certainly not going away after that it's not going away anytime soon now but but I but I Wonder though I mean I um\n[noise] I I think okay so the Kavanaugh hearings or another example okay for the media you know they couldn't they couldn't hide that they were broadcasting they may be hearings\nSo they couldn't play down how the Democrats embarrass themselves in the country and the way they treated Kevin [noise]\nMhm right\nWell I mean surely cook the cook political parties are kind of D.C grew and this is a quote to do with this out of control demonstration on Capitol Hill against Kavanaugh nomination have any understanding of how much damage they did the Democrats and the party's chances of winning majority in the Senate\n... well now there is no\nBut they have no way I Do think the Capitol hearing is just like the creators here we're talking with Maxine Waters Cory Booker Kamala Harris all those I think that this is going to be a problem for them and in terms of how to be fair minded average American is going to look at look at at the at the in the mid term elections\nAnd again I maintain a Bruce the sad thing about all this is that we need Democrats in the fray here to be on deck to help us you know come up with solutions\nTo solve the problems I mean they are so unhinged right now they've lost their mind because they hate Donald Trump so much just like whoa you guys\nGo figure this out go call time out go out in the woods maybe you'll find Hillary out there I don't know but maybe you might find the other part of your mind that you lost\nSo that you can come back and be a positive part of getting this country back on track because to be so unhinged in to lose your mind and his direct ... you know to this degree it's like I'm I'm thinking man what are we how much longer is this going to last year\nWe've got a lot of positive things happening in our country could you imagine\n... and and not that this was you know I I don't know if we've ever had a ... you know a ... and ongoing kumbaya moment with Democrats in and bipartisanship that we could look back and say hey this is what this looks like a ... you know we can certainly talk about nine eleven but that was so short lived\nA you know 'cause then it was like okay go to your respective corners there and you can even talk after a Steve's beliefs and the Republicans got right um uh got attacked on the softball field but you know it just can't seem to\nSustain itself and um you just I don't know Bruce I just hope and pray that uh you know some a silver mines will um will take over here\nAnd stop the insanity because of the trajectory years very dangerous I mean it's one thing that you know physically attack somebody but uh you you know if somebody is set a couple I think Rand Paul says\nSomebody's going to I mean and he got hurt but I mean right I mean he could get killed here\nYeah yeah and and the problem as you mentioned is that if we don't have we need Democrats you're right we need Democrats to\nMeet us halfway All right that you don't get any laws passed in Congress unless there's bipartisan support\nFor the law Congress' job is to pass laws creating public policy in order to do that you have to have to compromise both parties have to compromise both parties have to meet each other half way you're not going to get everything you want to legislation but if you get enough where you want to support the legislation then that legislation will pass\nAnd if you if if the Democrats are going to go as crazy as you were saying they are continue to be that way\nThen we won't get any legislation passed we won't get any public policy created it'll just be the kind of stalemate that we've been think of the last several years only worse\nWhat we need the part of the country that they represent to be represented in the legislation and and we need their ideas this is all part of compromise as you say Bruce and this is ... ... you know we're missing out and everybody's paying a price

I think there are several reasons for that clearly a rising interest rates are the Federal Reserve is clearly going to raise rates again\nIn December they've already done it three times this year and it looks like they want to raise them at least three maybe even four times next year no matter what the market was telling the stock market has gotten weaker amount of housing has been hurt by it\nBut the fence as they want to get their rights back to what they call normal levels no matter what the impact is on the market and I think that's definitely one of the things taking your impact here well they didn't have that kind of sense when a block Obama was president correct I didn't feel it's a time of the economy is strong enough to withstand rising interest rates now they feel a strong enough\nTo do that and they raise the eight times since I started this process in December of two thousand Fifteen ... and there's a lot more to come and so people are saying and including President Trump is saying you're raising rates too much too fast and it's going to cause economic problems and slow down the economy and its\nI mean in the housing market we've definitely had a slowdown in in the home sales some of the markets that really got overheated like Seattle and San Francisco definitely cooled off the thirty year fixed rate mortgages over five percent my bill so that means that I'm On the margins some people saying I I don't I don't want to go ahead without\nYou know so what can we get what can we do and I mean because the fed is a defense the fed is on his own uh does whatever it wants to do with what recourse do we have it's not like we can uh you know put a sanction on the fed\nCan no in fact it's the opposite when President Trump criticizes him and they want to feel independent they're going to go the other way they're going to be even more aggressive to show that are not caving in to him to some extent I mean as investors what you've got to do is to put your money where it doesn't have volatility\nBut you're getting a decent meal you know the feathers raising rates and the banks are raising what they're paying what what they're charging a mountains but they're not raising what they're paying on deposits for the most part\nI mean not mentioned before you know what what are your people are a good alternative are they secured real estate fun mhm 'cause that's the way of getting an eight percent you know but the price of it doesn't go up or down stop violence all stays or\nTen dollars a share matter what the markets are doing basically and you get an eight percent current deals with um with monthly checks if you like are we invested websites that secured real estate ... dot com and we spent so there's an alternative or another for keeping them in the bank pretty much earnings are up\n... I I don't mean to get political that seems like everything's political these days um you know what the fed is doing as I said you know compared to what they did with the President Obama and um you know\nFor them now I mean it's like they're not even taking any kind of consideration I Know that that Trump was you know going hey out I mean you're you're working against us here without going to get this economy going I'm let's remember whose team were on and let's or\nThey don't look I don't look like they're on his team that's not the way\nThat I I guess that's my point that kind of makes this political because instead of saying okay what works for the greater good I mean I'm a you'll get your money I mean the fact that matter is you still got to figure out how to um you know reconcile what four or five trillion dollars a printed money you did under the Obama\nAnd they've been trying to reduce that their balance sheet went up to about four and a half trillion that's correct right as they used the treasury notes come do instead of the ruling them over there a maturing them and so that's shrinking their balance sheet flow and it went up very fast but it's going man slowly right but yeah they see that as their priority\nAnd they see the priority is getting the interest rates up to levels so that when the recession hits that got a place to go down things like that but they're creating\nThe economic slowdown that's going to cause problems in the future and I think it could be\nMet two thousand nine to I'm not saying recession but certainly slower economic growth not going to have four percent economic growth of interest rates go up as much and so President Trump is right it's just normally you don't say those kind of things that the Federal Reserve and you know as explicitly as has been doing well that's okay that's why we love [laughter]\n'cause he's exposing all this to help us understand the cause and effect relationship that uh and and exposes people in terms of like what we're talking about here we on the same team here or not and\nThey're not even though he appointed them whether or not basically ... as the same thing with China I mean he's saying things\nTo China that nobody has ever said before a we've got tariffs on them now the way things look like they're doing bill is they're going to raise the past twenty five percent on January first mhm on everything coming in from China right now it's two hundred and fifty billion\nAnd ten percent tariffs but he's talking about raising that dramatically and and and reverse the Chinese are going to have tariffs on everything coming in to China from the U.S as well and and less either side blinks\nWhich doesn't look like they're right now I think that's the long term situation we're gonna have tariffs on both sides and that also slows economic growth for the two largest economies are battling with each other as such a trade war\nWell supposedly China's saying hey look come on let's come to the table and talk and Donald Trump is saying it's not time yet he he you haven't got enough sight out of view them down and\nAnd all he doesn't have a lot of pain because of the Chinese stock markets like our markets to Americans down\nTwenty five thirty percent or so far this year\nUm they officially say that their growth rate six point five percent I Believe it I think it's much much lower of them that well their own said they they can make up their own numbers right\nSo well to some extent they do that's right exactly and make it look better than it really is but I mean while those reality underneath all that right um and I think they're really getting hurt or something like Seventy percent of their economy is export oriented\nMeat per cent of ours export oriented so we get a lot hurt a lot less yes I'm ... and companies are moving\nFrom China to Vietnam and Indonesia and Bangladesh and other places not to avoid these tariffs so I mean it is really hurting Charlotte the question is is not enough paying\nFor them to blink and say okay we're going to lower our tariffs or we're going to stop stealing your technology that that's a big step for them to make it I Hope they make it but so far they haven't or they move that direction\nDamaging and quite admitted that they're stealing technologies that like there is that they're entitled there's some way they're you know an exact with international per se perceive law that they've made up in their own mind\nHaving so much from property the same thing so you're writing in order for them to change that they've gotta agree it's a problem which right now they don't even agree on that\nIf they don't they don't think Jordan you're smart enough to have intellectual property so you don't deserve to have it so I said they do that that's that's their thinking\n[laughter] but they just silly things that Rick I'm agreeing completely what the problem I'm just saying that by putting tiresome them maybe in the long run on work and my husband does but so far it hasn't the results from higher tariffs on our part has been higher tariffs back on us\nAnd slowing economic growth and upsetting the supply chain but it's hard for people to know where to get product from now they're going to pay the terrorists are they going to pass and pass on to consumers is just crossing a wild disruption in the kind of see\nI see it this way it's needed pain we need to go through and the reason that we're dealing with it so much is because it's just been kicked down the road and Donald Trump's kind of guy goes hey what's this can this been kicked down there all pick it up listen to it and uh you know so he's going to head on with it and uh you know the good news is is whoever is president or after Donald Trump\nA habit and ah you know the the uh in the costumes\nThat we see at churches are not before we're seeing on this [laughter] bar to cities or because of some of those are really you know just bizarre and uh I'm I'm like you Danny I'm all for you know imagination I'm all for the creativity\nUm in fact we used to have a dear friend of ours I mean she was she was gifted it was like God designed for Halloween\nYou she would she would come up and she would constructed mean her kids always one you know the best costumes in school and stuff like that\nShe was just so creative and how she put these costumes together and I remember with beauty and the beast when uh you know that was a hit movie\nI mean she dressed up these kids and you think oh my gosh that they came up a Hollywood back\n[laughter] you know it was terrific you know\nThere's some there's some great costumes out that he got a lot of churches have\nBecome very creative and and as far as trade some some wonderful opportunities for kids to express their imagination about the Bible dressing up as a Bible character getting to talk about that character is and why they dressed up as a character and some youth groups will do a like an escape for him or mystery thing where they go\nTogether and and have a time of a fun and an enjoyment together and some snacks and you know we we're we're we're creative we don't have to go out and dress up as Bombay knock on they have a good time on Halloween you can buy it at the super heroes and talking about that we're you know I for me and my family we've\nHad to use this opportunity to talk about our new identity and Christ that we have\nThe opportunity where and caution cautious three Paul says we're as Christians were giving given a new identity putting on the new cells but\nIn reality if we look at where kids are out today there's a lot of pretending that goes on throughout the year just to get love ... maybe ... Halloween you talk about what does it mean to be an authentic real person\nAnd and talking about that identity that that we have in Christ and living that out the rest of the time and Halloween is the only day that we pretend to be someone else instead of the entire year\nYeah exactly well and I think what would you bring up here Danny as the Christians\nHave kind of incense got caught off balance here was Halloween because it it it kind of morphed into a um you know something that was so I'm a confronted and in contrast to ah to our Christian faith\nAnd it's just seems like it's gotten worse than so uh Christians have kind of falling back on their heels as opposed to saying okay how can we take back this holiday and you know bring the family fun back into Halloween\n[noise] [noise] yeah I agree I mean Philippines for it is a good place to go I'm thinking I was thinking about things that are true and what are what are my can do but ... and the creativity of our mind\nAnd and talking about that that scripture alone Philippines for a ... is a is a great way to look at Halloween what are some truth thinks about at one truth thing is we can be creative God has created us to have an imagination we can have fun and we can play together as a family that part is very healthy\nSo let's do it that way we don't have to participate in those the the other things that are very dark about Halloween and I think it shows that contrast of good and evil Halloween brain certainly brings that out in a very clear way and I think this is great preparation\nFor the Thanksgiving season and Christmas season when when we ... we began our time as a family with fun and and imagination take this time to maybe maybe\nMaybe it's the beginning of of some movie a weekend so throughout the time all the way up till Christmas as a family and picking those out maybe it's a time of celebrating\nA superhero times and what what superpowers God has given us through prayer and through the Holy Spirit maybe it's just a plain framed some games out every year around this time you\nYour brand game out and and you play that same game around Halloween this you can still create some great to traditions around that's when it doesn't have to be dark\nWell didn't you know what you said you're and I and I hope people caught this is that you and this is the perfect time to engage the kids\nYou know and have and get them involved in the conversation don't ... you know you don't have to have the answers you talk to them and just say hey you know what does it mean to you you know what I'm you know what do you think about Halloween ... and uh you know get their\nYou know and you'd be surprised the answers they come up with in fact one of my buddies he has his kids because that will get but just for a moment pretend you're ... you're you're dead\nAnd you have children how would you ... you know how would you want to celebrate you know a Halloween ... ... ... what would you what would you tell and I mean it was amazing the answer I mean the kids get it there really\nAre they're really sharp and you sit there you go gosh here I Am I I was so worried about how to approach and what to say to him and stuff like that and they actually brought more of the table than I had you know\n[laughter] the other day the family were were sitting around and we do this with with some of the the families had council and that's pretending to be someone else in the family so everyone takes on someone else has for all right then you take on an issue like pretend that you're late somewhere or something like that and then you pretend to be that some\nGives gives each other early and it gave each uh each of us a lot of insight into how we handle stress\nHow we handle conversations and we had a great laugh that's another\nThing you can do and then as parents have dress up have fun with this um ah they pretend to be someone at the end and then explain this is why I Love to pretend to be this person uh I I Know that\nWith our with our family we've had some themes together as a family it shows that unity we've had fun with it I wore wig I have a shaved head and my kids have completely enjoyed seeing me with a big head of hair [laughter] uh and so we can have fun let's laugh at each other and\nAnd a drink and joy tonight be creative as a family or or actually this weekend I'm sure there's a lot at church parties and different things going on\nA and and let's bring some good some light to where there's darkness and Halloween brings plenty of darkness\nWearing some light to it and learn how to show that as Christians we can still have fun we can still imagine we can still be creative and helping our kids see that living out the Christian faith is about living out an identity that God has given us\nA ... to live out in and finding that out as a family and along the way saying that we do love to pretend to be other people because we see a lot of good things in each other ... and that's part of being in the body of Christ\nRight and and and what you say Danny is so important and that is that we're prepared sometimes we just get route we react to the holiday and as Christians we should be prepared in and out of the season so here's the opportunity to say okay the world is already moving in this direction is kind of like a little bit of\nI I call it a ... you know attacking or the culture in in a sense of martial arts in jujitsu you know that uh if it's moving in that direction how do you get in front of that parade and influence that are for good right [noise]\nYeah and if if parents want to hear more I Want to read more about what we have ... focused on the family [noise] please come to focus on the family dot com slash pair thing or visit or

joining us we have breaking news the suspect has been arrested in these pipe bombings and we have\nA name now are just a name it saves are say Iraq I think I pressed that right ah in Florida someone with a ... some criminal history a for grand theft back in twenty Thirteen or he's been arrested as the main suspect\nIn these twelve pipe bombs had been delivered so far\nThere were two more devices delivered a this morning I tempted to be delivered they were all you know intercepted or those who were going to Cory Booker a senator and James Clapper uh CNN contributor and former director of national intelligence that what you're seeing it again um the the so far this started on Monday\nWith a pipe bomb at its Soros home or none of these have exploded no one has been injured but it has caused a lot of tears member the evacuation of the time we're talking about the significance that with the hotel with the office buildings would the apartment buildings with the grocery store shopping\nUm which CNN located there I mean they it it affects us cause hair\nEven if these devices were voting\nOr just were built correctly or that would be a good thing that thankfully no one was injured there's no place for the star politics eleven days out from mid term elections certainly puts things into perspective um but it does not mean we can't have vigorous debates and disagreements in our country\nUh without resorting to that's violence but tear which is what this is is that acts as a domestic terror and the tempted uh to to terrorize people and to get we condemn it to the fullest extent of should we have a name now a again of the suspect\nWe do the location in Florida sunrise implantation Florida up here's a vehicle was in one of those locations homeless and the other location us that's a north of Miami kind of inland from Fort Lauderdale\nAnd uh and we don't know yet or if there were other people involved this is the suspect\nSo I get it may not be over the president is planning to address this that happens while we're live on the air we will certainly\nCover it I Want to take a your your comments or Nancy on Facebook if I were to your phone calls as well at one hundred sixty four thirty one to Nancy on Facebook right said what kind of consequences does a person like this face said well\nOf course the obvious ... and then most appropriate and prudent and proper consequence is that he's put in prison because someone like this is not fit to live in the society of human beings and they're locked away\nFor a period of time because they've obviously committed or attempted amid the ... the most terrible crimes are and and then the worst scenario this could be considered an attempted murder\nBecause you're doing everything you can do to a eradicate the life of a human being by means of an explosive device if in fact that's what it was and even if they didn't uh explode the the fact that the perception of the recipient is what counts so the ultimate penalty here\nIs jail yeah I mean this is again what we hope is that this will bring it\nUp to this time period after this week in the United states of\nThese devices being delivered even as early as this morning with two more devices so a total count at twelve but the postal service law enforcement is that they have\nNo reason to believe that's all the devices um and uh the Biafra hitting the person that will stop them from sending more but how many more out in the postal system is is still the question so you have to remain vigilant uh let's see we have listeners on both sides of the aisle is obviously a focused on a lot of uh left uh those on the left\nUm if you work in those kind of offices in in Capitol Hill or in regional offices for members of Congress or be vigilant you know is going through mail and if you work in the postal service\nBe vigilant as well or we want you to be safe because while some of these individuals are so high profile their mail get screened at special facilities others are not\nAnd they're going through the regular postal service so again I we've got to remind all the people who could be in the light of danger\nBecause of an individual like this we condemn it to the fullest extent I think you put the politics aside because that may be their purpose or their ideological purpose behind it but obviously a something seriously wrong with a person whether it's their criminal\nOr or or just insane or criminally insane\nI used to put it all together or they should be facing serious law enforcement penalties that they'll go through the process but again this because the disruption the use of the mail service or the people who were targeted a very serious and now we expect that President Trump\nWill address that as well as ... will cover that on the broadcast if it happens while we're on the air department of justice is also going to speak to it later on today a show or taking your phone calls one eight hundred six eight four\nThirty one hundred sixty four\nThree one one zero we're going to get into a little bit\nOf this caravan issue out got Andy here as well or the caravan of migrants heading towards the border or are they are in Mexico now looks like they're heading towards either a Texas border or a California border Texas border crossing it's closer\nThe president Andy yesterday's authorized\nEight hundred additional troops through a a General Mattis Secretary Mattis department of fits that includes that would give up the number two ah they're already Twenty one hundred National Guard troops there that could increase to four thousand this eight hundred could be more as well so the U.S is preparing\nFor for a border effort for this to happen at our border if it is not\nAble to be stopped before in Mexico but that is the hope is that we work with the Mexican government and get stopped and dissipated\nBecause the numbers are still in the thousands mean estimates anywhere between three to fourteen thousand people that is a lot more than the last ... we experienced in April twenty Eighteen so and so we get Andy I mean it appears that the Trump Administration preparing for two things one\nPossibly are having to deal with this on the road and to try to get Mexico to work with us to deal with it together\nRight as we said the position of the scale Jay has always been that we want to have an intervention prior to the arrival of this a wave of humanity at the border and by that I mean intervening with Mexican authorities to stop them to turn them back\nTo put them into a\nCategory is perhaps of those who are\nLegitimately seeking asylum which says really available in the first state in which you feel safe and the first nation you wish you feel safe which should be Mexico in this case\nAnd then ... out those who are here to do ill to the United states\nAre people who are not here seeking asylum but to do danger those who are engaged in human trafficking and so forth and we're working with the Mexican authorities to do that\nOn of course as you said Jordan we're sending troops to the border but the ... they're they're only to support the civil authorities and they are not expected to come into regular contact with the migrants if they carry arms is solely for purposes of self defense\nAnd of course the law in the United states currently prohibits the routine use of troops in ... in routine law enforcement activities I don't expect that that will happen I anticipate and hope that they will not be confrontations at the border between this wave of humanity and the United states troops you never know I Hope it doesn't happen\nLet me remind you of the president's executive order that was ultimately okayed by the U.S Supreme Court after many legal battles on a on immigration and in preventing a certain individuals certain from certain countries uh for periods of time off from immigrating are being granted visas to the United states\nThere's discussion now being reported\nThat President Trump a one idea is to use that executive order\nBecause it can be expanded on the list of countries on that\nUse that executive order to actually shut down the crossing point so that our offices are closed there so that people who make it don't even have the opportunity to apply um that again\nWill caught that will cause legal issues in legal battles but I I Do believe that under that executive order the powers there for the president to do it it would be a unique way a CIA plot because it'd be happening at the border instead of somebody applying for a visa right\nAnd I think that that would be an excellent thing to do the president clearly\nHas the authority under the executive order that he issued modified issue another executive order that deals with the same thing but stop the portals stop the ports of entry stop those\nAre places where you come in McAllen, Texas was one the one who was the other if they win in either direction but he could stop that is the point of entry that would be no question here of any discrimination because of Islamic\nAh or Middle Eastern origin we're talking about invaders to the United states potentially which the president has exclusive authority is the head of the ... executive branch of government to protect the country to do\nYou talked about the troops power on the border down on Facebook writes in can the troops help make sure the situation doesn't escalate dangerously once the Caribbean if it does reach our southern border that is what they're they're just to make sure it does not reach a dangerous situation for citizens\n... what's the troops are there to do is really a defensive posture\nWhat we don't want there to be is any kind of horrible confrontation at the border between the migrants and the troops\nAnd you talked about the disease issue there's this these are all issues you have to face if it makes it to your border and you decide to open those crossings to process the applications let me try to grab one more call quickly before you go into our our next break Laurie in Arkansas on line one Lorrie welcome to Jay secular life\nThanks for taking my call which Hitler any opportunity for the United nations to get involved and protect our borders\n[noise] I don't think we want the un involves on protecting our borders they they get involved with their regional military conflicts like between two countries are not when countries should be able to work together\nLike the U.S and Mexico to deal with this so they're involved in like Lebanon Israel border\nAt least in Africa not where its allies\nTogether so let's not get the UN involved let's handled this between us and Mexico working together\nHopefully long before this fear of it reaches our southern border\nMid term

said some people\nJoined us or just the beginning of the second half hour Jay Sekulow alive let me up to you with the biggest breaking news the day and that is that they suspect has been arrested\nIn these bombings the twelve that have been intercepted or to some high profile individuals occurred and former\nGovernment officials well some celebrities or suspects has been arrested or they again does that mean there's not other devices that can be out there still remain vigilant\nOr the president is likely to address this if it happens while we're on the air we will go to the president's comments but we do want to focus in on give you an update on the mid term elections right now we're only eleven days out there is a yeah we've covered the caravan of which obviously it's an impact on the election of recovered the devices\nObviously has an impact because the entire week of news has been on these devices are but now we want to look right into the mid term elections were eleven days out\nFrom election day but let me remind you of many places including my home state can already vote\nMany people are I'm actually planning to vote in the next few days I'm so people are already making up their mind casting their ballots a lot of votes will be in before election day so we're at a time period now in America where we have election day\nBut it really is like a two week period where you can go and vote and convince people to get out there to actually cast their final vote for candidates if they don't want to start off in the U.S Senate ah because that is where it looks like Republicans are having to potential for the most games and there's pretty shocking news\nOut of New Jersey a Senate race there are pretty blue states do to elected people like Chris Christie there's been Christie Todd Whitman types in in uh in New Jersey the Senate race there Bob Menendez is in some trouble in the race has been moved by the cook Political Report to a toss up that would be a huge victory for Republicans\nMe monumental Jordan I mean this is one of the races that you and I have talked about several times on this broadcast and keeping an eye on it because if he did move into a competitive territory it was going to be a clear sign that not only the we're the Republicans are going to keep the majority\nIn the United States Senate but it might be a significant majority now pulling inside that state\nHas it in some cases within the margin of error with Bob you can closing to within five five points a button and then ended at Mendez of course during\nA bottom and then this has been plagued with scandal over the last couple of years ... has run a very good campaign he's a businessman he appeals to people that are maybe a little tired of the political process but the fact that New Jersey is on the map\nTells me that the Republicans in or are in a very strong position in the United States Senate Jordan as we've talked about most of the political battlefield in the United States Senate is in ... states that were carried by Donald Trump in Republican states as of this ... New Jersey would certainly not be one of them and yet it's in play\nLet's go to the president right now he believes addressing the issue involving type\nOf that law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody\n[noise]\nWe've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation find that person or persons responsible for these events [noise] these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country [noise]\nI've instructed authorities to spare no resource or expense and finding those responsible and bringing them to swift and certain justice [laughter]\nWe will prosecute them him her whoever it may be\nThe center of the law\nI\nWas never allow political violence to take in America cannot have that I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it\nJust like we have echoed and the president waited to suspect was apprehended to say we will not accept\nPolitical violence in America to do everything possible\nMake sure it's this individual and not a ... additional individuals as well prosecute them\nThe fullest extent of the wall so there you heard from President Trump the announcement of the suspect being arrested but still law enforcement activities ongoing he's taken very seriously also taking the mid term elections very seriously as well or we will continue to talk about those we come back in ...
