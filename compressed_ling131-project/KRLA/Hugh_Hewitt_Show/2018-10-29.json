{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "I Will get into all that let's back up a bit to these mosquitoes they're out there and they tend to I guess a are more active at dawn in dusk soldiers kind of a time angle and some advice for folks on kind of minimizing exposure right\nExactly for the first thing and the name of the game Israeli prevention or when it comes to us now you want to avoid the mosquito bite to begin with and then you can track disease or as you pointed out there more active in the early morning and the early evening hours I sort of that\nTransition time that they become more active and they start to feed so what you want to do is take extra precautions against mosquitoes and that includes things like\nAvoiding areas that standing water if you have standing water on your property than clearing that out so that it's not a unknown breeding ground for mosquitoes are wearing long sleeves long pants and especially using mosquito repellents if you're going to be outdoors in those areas\nAnd those mosquito repellents I've heard the word deet is that a chemical in their\nFeet is a chemical that is a tried and true it's been proven to be the gold standard and the most effective way of preventing mosquitoes\nAnd what I advise my patients in my clinic is to look for a a deep containing repellent that contains at least ten percent eight\nNine ten percent you're just joining us start to turn the youngest with this internal medicine specialist in Long Beach with monarch healthcare we're talking about ways to avoid West Nile virus but there are some people more at risk\nThan others people who may have what compromised immune systems take us into the the group that seems to get this\nAbsolutely so the populations that are most at risk drive at very young the very old so when I say very young I mean in fence I'm just brand new babies are at risk\nAnd then as an internal medicine doctor I don't see children but the other end of the spectrum which would be patient over the age of fifty or sixty are also at risk for developing the more serious form of West Nile virus or West Nile and satellite us\nUm and also a chef who have compromised immune systems that would include people with cancer\nPeople with things like HIV ah people with\nHistory of organ transplant who are on him you know ... medications\nAnd generally people over the age of sixty five or with diabetes\nEasy pretty rare in your in your practice anecdotally\nYou've seen someone who is they use the technical term presented with these symptoms and did you do any testing to turn out to be West Nile virus ... what's the practical the numbers are they actually very small\n[noise] that's a good question so I have anecdotally seen cases of West Nile virus I practice in a clinic in Long Beach but I also see a patient in the hospital\nAnd the way that you can from really the only way you can test and confirmed West Nile virus is to take a sample of patients\nCerebral spinal fluid now that the fluid that's in the spinal cord and you run it through an analysis a laboratory test checks for the west Nile antibody that's really the the gold standard and the only way that absolutely comes from\nThat disease but you have a clinical suspicion you wonder if they have the disease if they have the symptoms I mentioned the fever next fifth mass confusion or even going to the point of being comatose and if you have a history of being in those areas where mosquitoes hiking things like that\nRight now the interesting thing I understand is so once you do this test and if somebody tests positive for it and they have these symptoms what exactly is the treatment do we actually have some sort of anecdote\n[noise] that's another good question so there is no absolute antidote for the virus there is no anti viral medication that specifically for West Nile at this time the milder forms of the disease can be treated with\nOver the counter pain relievers Tylenol most trend things like that which can reduce the fever body aches but if you have the more severe form it can lead to a [noise]\nA disease process called sepsis and that can involve your other organ systems can a severely dehydrated and made intravenous fluid replacement out which would require hospital and then supportive care and close observation under a doctor and nurse at a hospital setting\nSo when do we know when to go to a doctor or not because I mean people don't really like going in English they have to I guess you're going to feel pretty lousy if you come in\n[noise] yes that is that is true um I buy my patience to reach out to our office if really if they have any question are concerned but what you're really looking for is if you have the more severe symptoms severe headache\nHigh fever neck stiffness uh sometimes you may not notice this but your loved ones are those around you may notice that you're more confused agitated especially someone over the age of sixty five major start to act\nDifferently and you're not sure why they're acting sort of odd or off that's when I Would really advised to call your health care provider or if it's really concerning um you're very worried I Would advise you to go to the emergency room that's really the main point I Want to get across to\nShow some of the symptoms sounded like flu symptoms things that people might get others sound different kind of a kind of analyze what he's in he's in probably the case there\nAbsolutely and sometimes even for the doctor it's difficult to differentiate between\nAn actual flu and the case of West Nile are the only way that you're really going to find out is by doing that test we talked about what the cerebral spinal fluid but people who have mild cases of West Nile\nWe usually don't get to that point because the good news with West Nile in these milder cases is it will go away on it found you may feel fatigue per an extra week or two it may take a little while to get back to a hundred percent\nBut at the good news is that it does work its way out of your system for most people are just naturally\nThat's good good to hear that in terms of the youngest was empty and internal medicine specialist in Long Beach with the monarch healthcare graduated from USC kicked school of medicine Tony fourteen so ... voice is always the best thing here and we're here in Southern California with great whether\nWe like to wear shorts and short sleeved shirts\nThat may not be the best pulled into where right absolutely\nWhen it comes to West Nile if you're gonna be in areas wooded areas areas with standing water like lakes ponds there is a lagoon not far from our office I advise my patients that\nIf you're going to be wearing those kind of close you should absolutely have their talent on but the the gold standard on the best way to prevent us to have those\nLong sleeve long path to avoid the bike altogether and that's how you're absolutely got prevent that disease of West Nile\nCandy sprays with the deep the different chemicals that you can get to protect yourself I apply him on a young children to\nYeah they have been shown to be safe and young children so what you want to do as\nA covered the mouth and nose especially and little kids they can't participate as well but at the most common reaction if you get any reaction to those types of ... pounds it'd be a mild skin irritation but they're generally very safe and the population\nAnd put it on pretty heavy I mean ... how many seconds would you be applying to spray if you were putting it on yourself\nI Would say if I'm doing it myself probably three or four seconds are applying to any given area\nOh okay so it's not just one little spray it's a good one to three next through one two three and it's got to be on two levels were maybe you can smell it tend to like\nYou smell it it does have a classic voter\nLet's recap here should people be concerned we were seeing these a Sikh tell these usually they involve somebody would you know older compromised immune system and they should the rest of his not worry for younger or be concerned how do you how do you set your worry level\nThat's a good question I never want to instigate panic in my patience and so I I don't want people to hear me saying that everyone should be worried about West Nile virus but I Do want the public to know that it is a potentially serious disease and while it does affect\nPrimarily the compromise patient that very old ... ah I have seen cases where even young patients got fairly sick from it it is fairly rare but I the main thing is to just take those precautions if you're going to be out having fun\nAnd a hiking the next to standing water and avoiding those altogether if you can because prevention is the name of the game\nYou're young what's a good resource for people were should they go to get more information talked to their their doctors for example\nAbsolutely reach out to your doctor or if you have any questions about West Nile a good resource that I use as the CDC website if the government agency that monitors infections and and spreads information or in the United states so C.

is running for the United States Senate and the show me state against Claire McCaskill and the most recent polling I obscene\nHas hit my head by a very solid poor points I actually believe it's further ahead than that Josh Hawley welcome back to the show my right your father ahead in most places in four points\nWe feel we feel very good about it you but we also know that we've got eight days ago and we now take anything for granted that it's going to be a tight race going to be fight all the way home and we've got to get out there and a while we found that I said\nNo I haven't heard a lot of places in Missouri from St Louis we got a big flame thrower they're across Jefferson City et cetera so tell people in Missouri specifically are they still able to do early voting or is that close to\nWhere we are just traditional absentee voting in Missouri\nWe don't have a we don't have early voting like other states but the traditional as a voting and a look we need folks to start planning to get out on November the six to make sure that you set aside time to vote talk to your friends if if they uh\nI Need help getting to the polls or make sure that you know you're you pick a friend with you\nThrough the bowls and we're going to need every last vote because it's going to be thought\nJosh Hawley it seems to me though that the Democrats are basically folding their tent in Missouri in North Dakota to try and saved by boat so there were karma cast what an awful debate performance she and her ads calling other Democrats crazy Democrats how does that play with their base\nYou know I I think it does that really has read the desperation phase of her campaign I mean you could see that in our debate\nLast Thursday these very angry very frustrated but your ears the thank you for a straight and it's really not with me with the voters of the state that may see it not done what the voters of the they\nTold her to do is not done what he promised them she would do and they're not happy about it and and that's the problem is\nA role and Martin who is of course that led to the lab but he's a friend of mine just pointed out that Claire McCaskill not quote one of those crazy Democrats quote ad was one of the dumbest ever recorded in political history she needed a strong energized space in twenty Eighteen her appeal to white rural voters\nWith that ad ticked off black voters if she loses that ad is the reason so you can see right there uh Josh Hawley that she clearly is flailing\nWell I I think there's no doubt about that to me is filing a good word or she is she ... she desperate you see is you know let's remember what we saw from the Democrats\nAnd the Kavanaugh we're just a few short weeks ago is that they are willing to stay and do anything in order to regain power and I'm afraid that are McCaskill who was with that mirror every step of the way that is no different than so uh this is really this election as a referendum\nOn what they want to do to our country on their behavior they're just the disgrace that they are carried out with regards the cabin on their entire agenda that with the lectures about\nNow let's talk a little bit about the the judge Kavanaugh that a confirmation now justice cabin or a successful confirmation\nClaire McCaskill was invisible uh she didn't she and she voted against him but she was invisible because she couldn't figure out what to do what in Missouri and think about that because he's obviously a good man well qualified and he was ... what do they think about her hiding from that debate\nI figure appalled by it and I have people say that I cannot believe the way that the Kevin always treated they can't believe the way the Senate Democrats coordinated your campaign and your rights that are McCaskill\nUh well she went right along with it you should never raised our voice against it but she lets us forget she was in favor of the Democrat Sam investigation she was in favor\nOf delaying his confirmation vote so that the circus could go on I mean she's on record for all of those things so she was part and parcel of the whole smear campaign and now\nShe says it's actually said our debate all I didn't have anything to do with that oh that's just nonsense she was there every step of the way and I think voters are going to remember\nNow let's talk about the tragedy of this weekend a Josh Ali when you get to the United States Senate you're going to be in a body that's very deeply divided in a country that is profoundly broken but I think part of the problem is that we're monetize ing hate on television where we've created a little corners for people to indulge\nTheir worst visions of everyone on the other so how do we get past this moment\n[laughter] well I think we've got to send a clear message for political violence never acceptable any form of ... by the way confrontations\nPolitical comfort cases like screaming at people in public places are using them out of restaurant yeah grocery stores I mean this all of this guy and I thought the president that exactly the right on by president one day that there is no way no place at all\nFactor dot com studios I Am to you and I have\nUsually my guess on friday in the last ... hours a week with a health fail dialogue\nThem starting the week with a health fail dialogue and Dr Larry aren't because we are eight days from a crucial election and we are on the other side of a terrible massacre in Pittsburgh and the rain to bomber in Florida and a incendiary rhetoric across the spectrum\nAnd I thought some history would be used for your doctor Larry on good morning and thank you for doing a double dip this week\nA good morning how are you here\nOn good I I Want to begin by asking you to put a what the no nothing movement in context is because last night I saw a lot of people on line saying that Donald Trump is leading the modern no nothing's\nWhich is simply not historically correct and I knew I could turn to you for similar to a place to what the no nothing to work\nAs well so like ... century political movement or they didn't they thought that uh Jews and Catholics and\nAnd that that they're especially focused on them and you know I don't know why they had to be ... million Jews but Catholics now that I Would say that we have to have to deprive ourselves of our sense of humor in these days but um\nThey they ah you know let Lincoln a lot of them voted for Lincoln a Lincoln denounce them\nAnd what they thought was that that it was a Protestant country\nOur country and that it would be better if it remains so\nAnd they and that you know they were spread around the country quite widely they never had a huge percentage of the vote and they were important because you know and in fact there isn't anybody quite like that important enough to make a difference today that I Know of but they were important because politics for very narrowly drawn for\nFifteen or Twenty years divided on slavery question but then ancillary matters\nThat could get four or five or two or three percent of the vote could change things a lot so they were important in American politics\nAnd they were they were not a passing phase they've never really gone away the idea of nativism into the eye that white Protestant on the country but neither have they ever been very powerful and I do not believe they make up much or even an infant decimal percentage of the Trump coalition\nI don't believe I asked Secretary Clinton this when she was on the show last year do you believe there's more than a half\nMillion white nationalist in the United states and she agreed with me that there isn't and and ... were they should have turned thirty million people\nI just don't believe it is that many people do one of them can do about ripping slaughter as was done Saturday in Pittsburgh we are not overestimate because by doing so we encourage the over estimation of their hatred\nThat trade and ah you know I and not only do I do not believe that they're very many people like that I don't believe they're very many people who believe that there are very many people like that in fact many of the people who say that there are a lot of people like that I don't believe they believe it I think it's a political tool\nYes and explain why by the way I think it's going to burn their hand for picking up this tool and specifically I I talk this morning\nAbout uh the network to which I contribute MSNBC is running high rise to lower third the little the words at the bottom of the of the screen I Want to read to a couple of them Trump's role in stoking violence among Americans how Trump sets the tone for anti\nSemite you see they picked up this this white hot\nSlander and I don't think an insurance to president I think it burns the people who employ it what do you think\nWell so there's a really great Holleman Jenkins caught column on the wall Street Journal I read it It's MORNING it might have been for the last week um and he makes the point that that a\n... you know everybody except for tiny sliver of the population or all of whom are probably watching MSNBC who knows um think that there's just way too much of this stuff right that that this politically correct talk\nOr you know making Kelly him I have never liked by the way but she got fired and if she just left off one expression what she said was entirely objectionable\nAnd somebody at Netflix to right and so they're chords that go after but horse how big are the hordes right and I and as you say in a country of three hundred million plus\nHow big are these hordes and the answer is not very big\nBecause most people don't think I mean if you just walk about in society and look\nYou will see the evidence of the fact that the society is organized around the principle of human equality and what human equality means of is a person treated like a person treat the same person like a person\nSo you just see in society today and it it wasn't always true with black people by the way which is a blight on our history but you but it is true today just look and see\nAnd then you know hey if you think it's always been a racist country go study the Eighteen fifty eight elections for the Senate in ... Illinois where Abraham Lincoln won the popular vote on the claim\nThat the black woman may not be are equal in all respects but in her right to eat the bread that she earns with the sweat of her own face she is the equal every person on earth\nAnd I I Want argue audience we've added to affiliates today a documentary on who have not heard you before and therefore will take some getting used to we have to knock the only news radio fourteen ten WTO be in Dover, Delaware and radio news radio fourteen fifty W. I. L. M. in Wilmington\nDelaware so they will not do our was one of the states that Lincoln had to worry about keeping in the union right Delaware was was a slave holding state\nHim at the time of the civil war and Lincoln had to work very hard as you said\nI Hope to God on my side but I must have\nKentucky he he needed the states and so he acted as a political person with regards to everyone in there but those sorts of politics\nThat sort of new one is lost in cable land I mean it's just it's all your evil or you're not evil and by the way it's not just on the left is on the right as well and I think it's destroying politics\nI don't so that I think that's right and and you know there was a lot of extremism in America in the Eighteen fifty goodness sakes you know there were plots to kill Lincoln and one of them succeeded finally [noise] but\nBut it's also true though that those debates between Lincoln and Douglas or very worth reading\nAnd then if you read them fairly in my in my argument if you read them fairly you will see the the inspiring man one and the man who spoke for the meaning of America One and it's just a remarkable event in human history because\nThey would get twenty thousand people out in the sun sitting for four hours to watch those debates\nAnd and that that means that in America there is this\nYou know basic way that we get along as Americans and it's the principle that everyone who demeans himself as a good citizen quote George Washington has the rights of a citizen and must all and and that means that the bias is there's a bias\nThe bias is when you encounter somebody on the street treat them like a human being\nThe man who spoke for the meaning of America One I think that is so ... would you explain what that means\nWell the you know and so you know all political history by the way has tragedy in it and there's even an argument that it always ends in tragedy a tragedy if they're very many remembering that it's the most glorious political story at least in modern times\nAnd the tragedy is that for the first time we found of the country according to the principle that all men are created equal\nAnd buy all men they meant women too and and then we had slavery among us and been here for a long time here under British Rule and so what do we do about that and in the founding there's a consensus if that's a really bad thing\nSomething's got to be done about that eventually and in more than sixty percent of the union it was quickly abolished\nAh but then new ideas took her out and this and this is where the tragedy is in my opinion these new ideas said that no we're evolutionary figures\nAnd we evolved to be different kinds of things and by the way if you look at the thought of modern liberalism radical modern left wing liberal is some you will see lots of thinking just like this if I were talking about genes all the time now\nSo it's like it's like somehow your genes control your behavior which means that human salt is not free anyway that gets going and by Eighteen twenty that's a major force in America\nAnd then what are you going to do about it right and in the in what we did about it was we fought our worst war over the question is human being a product of his heritage or is it a free soul created by God\nAnd we will come back to discuss more of that in a moment a documentary on my guest president Hillsdale
