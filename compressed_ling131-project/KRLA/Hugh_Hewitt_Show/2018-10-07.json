know worried about their teenager dropping greed running away eating disorders addiction or harming themselves well even violent behavior if you do nothing you could end up a gym worse we interviewed Christian academy fully accredited residential boarding grew in northern California\nOf sexual assault without any cooperating witnesses corroborating evidence\nIs not to say and I never have said and I defy you to find when I said the doctor Christine Blasey Ford is a liar I've never said that I Do think something happened to her it's not my job to determine what happened to her though is my job to determine whether or not\nWe we have fairness here and as Susan Collins pointed out this is not a jury trial so it's not a standard beyond a reasonable doubt but certainly it's got to be more likely than not which is what she said\n\nAnd given his reputation given the number of women that have voucher his reputation given that nobody's ever made a kind of allegation before given that he's now undergone seven background checks given that the four people Dr Ford say where they're all say they have no recollection of it\nThat does not meet the standard of more likely than not\nFor those of you who were\nYelling and screaming berating people like breathing\nSenator Flake look at me look at me look at me\nFor those of you who believe that just because I'm applying this more likely than not standard therefore I Believe that Dr Ford is lying that believe a sexual abuse harassment and assault or not serious problems in America you have been listening\n\nFor those of you who took up on this issue [noise] not really so much because you're concerned about the issue because you want to stick it to Trump because as I told you the primary reason that people are afraid about cabinet because they believe you overturn roe v Wade\nNot listen to me very carefully somehow some way this country function until Nineteen Seventy three with every individual state determining\nIts laws on abortion in states like New York California in fact in states where Seventy percent of the population resides had an abortion pretty much on demand\nAnd there's no reason to believe that if and when roe v Wade were to be overturned in the matter goes back to the states\nThe land skate would shift in a sort of dramatic way right now in conservative states you will not be able to find an abortion doctor they'd been shamed out of business\nAnd in ... states ... overturn what makes you think the state legislatures would suddenly an act anti abortion laws given their own popularity in those states so in the real world\nNot a whole lot with change now how and why Ravi way became known as a quote right to abortion case it's beyond me\n\nAnd if you look at the LA Times article not Fox\nThat Breitbart National Review came out a few years ago\nAbout the opening of the papers of justice black man he was we signer of the author of the decision and he thought was going to be a very narrow decision he thought that the decision on whether or not women should have an abortion was a medical decision one that should be made by doctors\nAnd almost issued a warning that the this was an art not be ... be construed any other way he was talked out of it\n\nAnd so for those of you who have turned this into a man gets woman thing just because everything that you dislike him Donald Trump\nEverything he does everything he says you're going to attack it because you think evoke or because you think he's a bigot because you'd make is a racist because you think this because you think that\nGets what his approval ratings are up he's now a fifty percent according to Rasmussen guess what the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans used to be ten points just about a week or two ago is now plus two in favor Democrats\nGuess what the attack against Brett Kavanaugh\nThe fact that some lessons have referred to him as a attempted rape is for a serial rapist excluded a backlash\nAnd the backlash is going to motivate Republicans even when Kavanaugh gets on because you've already signal that you intend if you take over the house to open up a piece of an investigations so I'm urging Republicans not to let their guard down just because\nKevin ... is likely to be confirmed\nFor those of you who feel very strongly the other way\nAnd feel that this is the referendum against women that it means that you don't believe women means you're not taking a rape and abortion what rape and sexual assault and things like that seriously you haven't been listening I Know you're just like this\nBut one of the reasons Donald Trump got elected because he promised to nominate judges that would follow the constitution this now his second one\nAnd God willing and the creek
