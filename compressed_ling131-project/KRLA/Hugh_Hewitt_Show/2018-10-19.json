{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "I find it quite interesting that it is a in the culture is in the marketplace right now\nOr the team and I was talking with this I mentioned with the Salem\nMackler one of the producers are ... and I'm a medical honey or who are you know investigative journalists from Ireland of course you pick that up very quick you talked to him because of their accent\nBut are there that this has been a longstanding project I mean he and I and ... and we've been talking for three years you know through the crowd funding and\nYou know the problems I mean this was not a slam dunk they had to really stay focused and the quality of the movie you you've you've seen of yourself now have a Jew\nI haven't seen it at this last weekend by hurricane pack oh yeah that and I have it on my hit let's go why\nYou have got you got to see if it was well it is well done\nAnd again the content is so important for this time that we need to really look you know at this issue and you come away from the theater after watching this thing going well this is one guy how many other guys are there out there like gods now that ... that's\nThe scary part and the thing is is that look at like you said I mean for those of you don't want to say look it's my body you know my children and all that kind of deal um I and I hope you can gather this I understand that that to your body is important to you\nAnd if it is what is being done all in the name of you know Planned Parenthood and\nAnd your choice and that sort of thing if it showed pernicious and so dangerous women are still dying and the thing was it was quite shocking that came out this movie\nWas in Nineteen Seventy two prior to even roe v Wade Dr guys now himself and other doctors were involved they called it the mothers' day massacre Fifteen women were taken\nAnd uh they were kind of like guinea pigs for abortion\nThis is this industry this is how discussing this was and they have this idea and this invention where they inserted in the woman's a woman\nA this little metal ball a a steel ball and it opened up and exposed to these knives that just went rapid like a pac man inside a woman's womb\nAnd it was an absolute disaster Dr ... now a scapegoat concrete with impunity he went to ah ah the Bahamas I Believe and laid low for a while\nAnd then later on opened up his facility there in uh Philadelphia and uh you know like we said the rest of this is a disaster it's a horrifying history that we need to be aware of that two women think just because the government has given the good housekeeping seal of approval\nPortion that somehow it's it's okay that is just a you know it's just a bunch of tissue is just a tumor it's really not a baby or you know but you actually see what was happening there were you know babies that were being born uh lived there in that and they have no idea as to numbers I mean there were six\nThat were part of the trial but uh I mean over you know Seventeen years or Thirty years that he was conducting abortions I mean God only knows or if there were hundreds of babies thousands quite possibly that were born you know and um and he murdered them outside the ...\nYeah it is actually her if it's really hurting even hard to hear about that along the it's I'm trying to get my heart and mind ready I I have been for a light than I Am pro choice pro murder I thought that it when I was pregnant Hollywood that's what I saw a lot of celebrities\nWhile working on that first and especially whenever there was another upcoming election and the timing of the movie thing really could not be more God\nI Believe so I I think he's exactly\nYeah they're given the option which side are you going to promote and be part of the good versus the or or evil or like you said last week we talked about this movie I Know what's going to be moving where you leave and you can't remain silent you have to do something about ending the murder of ... and the blood on our hand it happening on our watch and ...\nAnd again and again you know it it's yes it's the babies but it's the moms and I and I still believe even dads are being affected their going out and we're like wait a minute my son my daughter was murdered\nHere and women to this day will be like I said you know many times anecdotally speak to women who've had abortions and they said do my my child had been Thirteen today and I and I mean what are you what do you say my goodness I mean it just\nIt breaks your heart to realize that we all bought into ally and if participated in this abortion industry and we've killed sixty million of our babies are in and\nGet it has to come to an end and it has to come in and I want it to come to an end while I'm here on the earth\nYou and you're like you and I and you and me both you know I Want to talk I Want to talk about Netflix Netflix has been on the radar for a long time but they really gone over\nThe top here with a big mouth which you are brought to the front to a discussion here and uh one of the episodes here of uh and I guess it's part they're partnering with Facebook is that's not enough can you believe this\nFacebook who's supposedly is so concerned about you know I mean the day of ah you know they they've scrutinized or any kind of promotion for the guys nail movie but I guess if you want to do something to sexually explicit that affects your kids I guess that's okay\nYeah I ... Harris than we've got five hundred and fifty a conservative Facebook pages that has been stripped off the air I stepped up and that stuck in the last week ...\nFive hundred and fifty and they won't let us have our voice at its head of the people arguing hate speech and they're going against the eye and they're going to roll the pace but no it's not they just have their conservative view is very clear it their mission they take five hundred pages out all that weight right the near term because you don't want you to get out there like you said\nThey completely promote on Netflix is still with a big mouth in last September twenty Seventeen millions of young kids are watching at adults are watching it very graphic I might counterculture mom ... parents download my ... thousands have the right thing because you don't want to be notified ahead of time I said don't blast ahead of time\nThey're going to let them be aware of what's coming out of Hollywood ahead of time that can guard their kids from it and ... than that which I get my ap\nCalculus ap download it right now and get free and you get kind of great talking at your fingertips that could be alerted by Netflix that warning for years I I just punched out a couple of different alert the Thirteen reasons why this big mouth so it's very graphic they basically now are promoting plant air force and I was laughing about abortion\nGiven the recent episode on there where literally that the women honest all the characters are still are completely naked and are talking about their body parts and how to use on a three hundred guys\nAre very graphic sexual behavior where literally promoting a pet is Syria abortion master based on the recent episode like\nWell that's yeah that's one of the things that the parents television council um has reported on that you and I were talking about earlier Tina that uh this Facebook game called the hand masters play with yourself\nAlone it's crazy and the thing that at my ... parents that you have to have the coast guard at what your kids are are looking at watching I don't blame you I think that the best way to do that as a guard what they're watching for entertainment no\nDepending on hold the kid is constructed I mean you're talking how to use the technology properly and well and if they see something rocky graphic or roast them to come you don't have a conversation about it will be able to block that on that but if you ever get that\nAnd not gain their trust you are the parent I Want to talk to you have to get up here because otherwise you will have a kid is going to get pregnant at Thirteen at any land behind bars dad whatever the case and you don't want to be there I have so many parents elect me balling it out when I pick it up there for that and\nMy son the signs were there five years ago but I Know what to do right because it's pretty easy access to technology we I Would say no cell phone records of what's going\nOn with just a couple of emergency numbers on it because they don't need to be rolling around on the Internet\nOn a diet it opens a gateway to too many things here and we've we've had expert gifts on her camera was on his movie or you know connect which is very very powerful and revealing a net flicks um according to the parents uh TV council says\nThat they presented as as you're saying Tina a number of challenges for parents who want to protect their children from harm the media content um you were trying to figure out how to block of this content\nAnd they said the only thing standing in the way of children in this content is a four digit PIN that you are not aware of and that's a lot of parents aren't even aware that this four digit pin is available to turn on the parental controls so that is available you need to check that out I Know you're going to\nTalk with him and and see ... and and make sure that you understand that so you could buy set out to a you're not in the\nNext week I'll make sure I habits I can tell them and then what I can do to them I knew that if people want it ... the word guide do you I think he\nCouldn't number for work for nine nine nine able to get my news that are like a black so in today's newsletter I Will blast out what that and that will call Sam I got to sell my not what that is because I'm not aware that I've been doing research for a year is

Gallagher and various other people on the stage\nSeeking to explode in the midst of the blue wave I Do have I I I don't just have good news here from Texas a I've got fresh news here from Texas I was hanging out with my buddy Ted Cruz there's a name drop of a lifetime but it's true just last night we did a Facebook Live\nBroadcast that you could probably go I'm just at that that that uh but the ... Ted Cruz page on Facebook a the the main with us to point one million followers so that was called\nAnd it was kind of sudden because I'll I'll pull back the curtain a little bit and take kind of what happened 'cause ... had a a had a vanity infomercial on CNN last night and doubled down on Trump impeachment that's always a winner in taxes\nI'll give you some uh some some view from here on the ground as the saying goes in Texas and by the way that's where I Am and it's great to be back with you spend a little while I don't know what those are filled on just about every other us Salem Radio network program and so it's nice to be\nBack here in the land of hue from the studios of six sixty am the answer in Dallas Fort Worth where I Me happy morning host Hugh provides me the quality lead it every day and then I go do whatever I Do\nAnd I'll do that again today right after we're done we're together for two hours today the final hour of today she was you at [noise]\nProgram is Hugh indie recorded conversation those magnificent Hillsdale dialogues with Larry aren't so that'll be our number three next hour oh we've got a couple of folks who can't wait to talk to a little poetry action going into the weekend from Tarzan of Joe\nAnd uh at fifty minutes past the our next our time to look at we can movies with sunny bunch that means I have seen\nIt means I have an hour and forty minutes to figure out exactly how to massage the first man issue [laughter] guess what new sunny and I have in common we both love whew what new study and I have in common we think the first man controversy as ridiculous\nAs it I got to get some Chad and some ...\nAnd this caravan of of folks coming to the border what do you want to do about it one eight hundred five two oh one two three four one eight hundred five two oh\nOne two three four Jamal to show he as a human being I care ... he's one of God's Children he was brutally murdered and chopped up in a little bit it's terrible as an American\nHow much am I supposed to twist off about this exact believe is a question I'm asking maybe you're asking yourself to let's try to cobble some answers together at one eight hundred and five two oh one two three four wheel movies coming out this weekend we'll talk about that with sunny but I just I just got to\nCommiserate with my buddy of of all why be sunny I mean I Love it comes right would you buy a boat I went I went to war with this uh with my Gallagher because ... it's the knee jerk reaction of of of the decade\nThere is no such thing as I say there's one time and then then I'll pick it up with funny if necessary there is no such thing\nAs a human being can has seen first man and thinks the American flag was slighted no such thing I'll just leave it at that\nIt is a magnificent film it drips with American achievement I walked out of it as proud to be an American as I've ever been and uh so just if you're sitting there thinking\nYou know global is Hollywood pitiful by the way there's plenty of global as Hollywood ... don't listen if you're looking for ways in which Hollywood dishonor is America you will not have to look far but don't look at us because it does not happen in his magnificent ... Oscars for director Damien ...\nAnd Ryan Gosling who is no and clarify as Mrs Armstrong he is no perfect\nAs Neal that boy you're talking about the the main job even bigger than Ted Cruz you're ready to ten years ago I had a chance to hang with Neil Armstrong I Know how that happened [noise] well this gig is helpful and living in this town is out but we have a wonderful um\n[noise] jewel in the crowd of DFW called the frontiers of flight museum and ten years ago we did a fortieth anniversary of the beginning of the Apollo program 'cause obviously if you do the math that means the fiftieth anniversary is now and you are correct\nAbout that [noise] ah and Apollo seven a crewman won't Cunningham knows a lot of other astronauts and so I'm looking to Neil and buzz and bill Anders from Apollo ... and Alan ... the leader now late Alan Bean walked on the moon Apollo twelve of Fort Worth guy\nAnd I I I Am seat a panel with all these guys I'm pension myself because believe you me I Am a ... is what the take cue and his feelings about the Cleveland Browns that is me and and manned space flight ... which is probably a whole big clumsy analogy but uh\nBut but that that was me I mean I'm sixty right now so in in my pre adolescent years through my adolescent years where all the Apollo missions I live with them I read them\nAnd uh it it simply must be a God saying where through through a set of circumstances that I scarcely\nDeserve that I was able to meet and hang out and speak with these folks and Neil was very unassuming he was very much the American hero very much uh the the the uh\nThe enthusiasts for his country but he was also very aware that he was representing him and he was representing humanity and it's the thing that made me probably the most nuts about the whole first ma'am controversy it's like we had to pick sides it's either an American achievements\nOr human achievement guys it's both they're not mutually exclusive okay enough about that enough enough enough enough of that\nPart of what's the best thing that I can share with you about Ted Cruz and a beta or four months and months and months and months you know maybe not so much lately but for many moons are all the stories were pouring out of my state of\nTexas a close race oh Ted Cruz's in trouble who'd Texas is going to turn purple and the way to turn in blue who there's never been a candidate like Maydel\nTed Cruz is running scared every single one of those stories were crap just to use the vernacular\nBy it was ridiculous it is ridiculous this was never a close race on paper now were there a couple of polls that there was one that had a beta with like a one or two point lead well we know the kind of recent history that polling organizations have had no don't wait\nBut in fairness to that industry\nPolls are a snapshot\nOf enthusiasm of the ... that are taken in the blink of an eye\nIf you go back when was that ... by one or two a month and a half ago ... something like that the saga September [noise] it is possible ... ... did a survey with any of the sample size of acts\nMight have run into a vein of democratic enthusiasm because let me tell you a Democrat and Fiji as I'm In my state is higher than it has been in a long\nTime now what does that mean what does that mean it means that Ted Cruz is not going to be ... by sixteen points as he did Paul Sadler six years ago to get to the Senate it's not going to be a sixteen point when in fact it could be ... as much as ten points closer\nI Believe that the ... and it's kind of a wide range but hey it's an election who knows these days predicting is a very sketchy game I consider the range of possibilities\nFor the Ted Cruz Beto O'Rourke race when we wake up on November seventh or go to bed really late [laughter] it's been my case on the sex I Believe the range of possibility is Ted Cruz winning by four to Ted Cruz winning by twelve\nTo eight points but hey I if if he wins by for that means that Cruz voters were lazy it means that Texas Republicans were complacent it means that we sat on our ... and we thought we got this\nAnd it and in that capacity I never want to be part of the problem because I'm here I live here my show is here and I know and I was I was hanging out with my buddies in the Ted Cruz campaign last night did a Facebook Live with that I it's it's still posted on ... we had a good time is about\nForty minutes or so talking about stuff pulling back the curtain on a few things to all of a Ted Cruz Facebook page\nAt that as we get down to election day\nIf it's for points or five or God Forbid free or something like that it'll be like beta one and we'll never be rid of these people\nI mean we have Democrats in Texas we just don't let them run the place and uh at ... they'll go gunning for John Cornyn\nAnd twenty twenty\nAnd a very important house race with house rules chairman Pete Sessions and district thirty two which is a lot of uptown Dallas\nYou have a

have every part of the ballot is important down to your local court house I'm In Texas is pretty conservative edited Dallas used to be pretty conservative but in two thousand six\nUh they flip the court House Democrats not run the judiciary of Dallas and it's been that kind of a nightmare ever since every every line on the ballot matters if you have if you have straight ticket voting wherever you live do it Democrats do it Republicans must learn how to do it\nAs well we're in Columbus Buckeye country crash hey Mark Davis in for you welcome our you\nTake a good morning lark\nI wanted I wanted to talk to you real quick about health care in your take on something like I work at a big hospital in Columbus area I Me and my family tend not to go to see doctors because we can't afford the\nCo pays hum wow so my question is I enter like Obama I saw on PBS how that whole deal with Obamacare was put together it's a sham\nUm how how is it that I'm covered just gotten worse for some um it's covering others now I understand that but it didn't address the elephant in the room which is insurance companies\nExactly you've asked exactly the right question and that's because insurance companies have been bludgeoned by the suddenly of\nPressing obligation for for starters to cover people with preexisting conditions if you and I run an insurance company and all of a sudden when there are millions of people we suddenly got to cover and they're sick already what do you think we're going to do the premiums they are going to skyrocket that's why free market solutions state run state

state it's about our country and that means that if if if that does I think the blue wave is already dissipating\nBut is there a Democrat enthusiasm in Texas or Democrat enthusiasm all over the country in the first opportunity but Democrats have to interrupt the Trump agenda the most conservative governance we've had since Reagan\nYou bet there's Democrat energy but the good news is there is Republican energy and it is freshly motivated the Kavanaugh hearings absolutely had an effect it made us\nIn ... about the way we acted I I mean when when all of a sudden conservatives on their list of heroes\nList Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins you know everyone has been made better there has been in a conservative spine infusion and Lindsey Graham I I I I Can't not love the guy\nHe's dead wrong and immigration maybe we should check back maybe got better on that too but on a whole lot of other things especially\nYou know war on terror national defense national security he's he's inspiring way correct and wonderful Lindsey Graham ah is it has been a joy to behold for these last few weeks since that moment of magnificent righteous indignation\nThere in the Senate Judiciary committee when he just gave it to Democrat America for what they've done gave it to his Democratic colleagues for what they've done absolutely great and then Susan Collins a wonderful woman\nOr a New England Republican meaning Swiss cheese conservatism that unless they we don't we don't do Republicans in New England the way we do Republicans in taxes or\nYour or Mississippi or Utah right it's a New England Republican we used to have Democrats in Texas were more conservative than some New England Republicans but unless it I'd rather have an are by somebody's name in the state of Maine\nThen

has never been as misguided as he is about first man\nThis is a magnificent film it drips with American achievement there is I Want to describe a non existent creatures sunny a non existent creatures like a ... or Jeb Bush supporter is nonexistent the person who has seen first man actually seen it and believes that it is anti American take the floor\nYeah absolutely I mean look this is a uh there there is a controversy that has been picked up a about first man and it is largely the fault of the star we have to put blame where it do with your uh you know at a press conference at the Venice film festival Ryan Gosling\nSaid something really do is that you've got a dumb thing we can all agree that this was a dumb thing he said that uh Neil Armstrong thought of them though not as an American hero but as a war hero now ... what kind of ... and in his own experience that Canadian Canadians of course don't have any heroes\nDo they have to appropriate the world's heroes so I understand I understand what he was doing and look it was it was a mistake\nAnd instead of putting out the fire the the the director you didn't doubled down exactly but you said a truth day which is that a within the context of the story of the actual planting a flag I mean again what we're talking about here is the planting of the flag the splitting of the pole\nIn the moon rock they do not show that that and the second clip of the moon Germany okay\nUm but within the context of the film it makes perfect sense why they wouldn't do that uh when they get to the moon\nThe film which is to kind of a more subjective experience that kind of put you in the edit Ryan Gosling Neil Armstrong and\nAnd it is it is designed that way and it works I mean look you see you see the flag on the moon everyone is talking about how the flag has been a rate from this movie insane knew everyone everyone who talks about how this movie downplayed the American achievement or or suggest it's not about to face rate is insane\nEveryone who talked about how this is not\nA an event that had fired the rest of the world to follow American achievement in American and great and it is it's just wrong I mean there's ... after\nThe moon landing takes place there's literally a montage of people talking about how great America is there's a French woman does the French we could never do it but America could do it I always believe that now\nSo I mean it's like it is ... anyone who actually seeing is that movie I don't know anyone who actually goes to see it that have just relying on the uh angry uh\nI mean and I get it I totally get it because Hollywood is a snake puts a snake pit filled with America hating Dennis ... I Know it's so it's an easy target middle is a lot so I just I'm I feel I feel Clinton's that\nIt was great and it also by the way all this crap aside it is a magnificent film ... does an unbelievable job putting you inside the sole inside the helmet inside the spacecraft is a remarkable movie\nYeah I I I thought it was quite good I mean and there are reasons to criticize the film I read a plenty of negative reviews that that had an intelligent accurate things to say about the film\nBut if you read it and you're avoiding the movie is because you think uh that it ... you are you're doing it wrong as hard as we as a kid that\nI Know we've got at least one or two new ones but give me thirty seconds is star is born as good as thirty people I Know say it is\nI mean look at its high melodrama

especially about the constitution but also about Winston Churchill in Shakespeare and all of our conversations which began in twenty Thirteen about Homer\nHad brought us to the constitution itself today are all found at you for Hillsdale dot com doctor are they Good Friday morning to thank you for joining me\nGood to you too All right we're back because of current events I have to go backwards in our constitution series to article one section three the United States Senate and the reason I'm doing that is not\nSurprisingly as the Republicans seem intent upon keeping and indeed expanding their Senate majority we have seen online and on the air arguments that the Senate is non representative and must be changed that it's wrong for North Dakota have two senators et cetera so I thought\nVery aren't as the founders chaos there one of his great books on the ... and what they intended and we're going to talk about the Senate and what it is supposed to do this morning an article one section three says the center of the United states shall be composed of two senators from each state chosen by the legislature there or\nSix years in each hunter show have one vote now with choosing part has been changed by the seventeenth amendment which now reads the center of the United states should be comprised of two senators from each state elected by the people there um for six years in each ... one boat that was ratified in Nineteen Thirteen\nSo our original document was updated in Nineteen Thirteen wrongly the right way but we kept Matt Larry aren't we kept that two senators would you explain the theory and practice their up [noise] ah well\nThe the ... the original is slightly different from the current uh they both have the same central principal the original was a compromise in the ... the biggest compromise in that that made the constitution come together\nAnd that the compromise was shell there'd be two chambers both representing just population of the United states or shall there'd be two chambers one of them represent any of the states\nAnd uh that compromise was necessary to get the constitution through\nAnd in my opinion also good and I will tell you that James Madison and Alexander Hamilton who was the initial enemies of the compromise\nThey came around to that way of thinking to justice convention produced a consensus on most of the big things\nAnd why well at the the thing is they were looking out already upon a continent and they didn't know how big it was yet they they didn't find that out for almost Twenty years uh actually you know the almost Twenty years\nLewis and Clark Lewis and Clark right so somebody came back you know is big day when Lewis and Clark outback\nTell me about it I said it's a country you know what what is this thing you know\nAnd that but they were keenly interested in the thing right so George Washington's army was called the continental army and then the question is and they also very much believed in this isn't the art art arguments of the federalist papers more than the anti federalist but it's in both sets of papers in various places\nThe argument is you're going to have to have a big country and you're gonna have to have a big country for a lot of reasons but one of them that's obvious and simple is national defense\nAnd we don't want to build another Europe here we don't want you know all that you know ... borders neighbors wars\nConstant intrigue and so they were interested in extending the fear of the United states and the deeper reasons or in federal is nine and a there about\nHow you can get better divisions of power and ultimately more excellence in government by having to watch here so they're they're going to be a big country\nNow the question is how do you represent and just take the Senate is like\nA massive fact that happened in the same summer is writing a constitution in the northwest ordinance they devised a method for the country to grow and the method is not that uh the new territory will ever be treated as a colony it would not\nIt would be treated as a territory soon to become a state\nAnd then there's one thing that's always a consensus in the ... in in the founding era and then the constitutional convention and that is most things done by government will be done locally as close to the people as possible\nSo now at the national level you've got to represent\nContinent and and you know huge diverse changes in territory and geography and therefore the way people live and so you want to represent that too and you want to represent the whole of it because the challenge is to unite a great empire of liberty\nSo the Senate is for balancing its for protection of local and it's for uniting the country section by section into a whole\nTo stretch out of many disparate parts one quilt of liberty now Larry on our framers were often on horseback traveling great distances not just during the revolutionary war but before and after\nAnd back and forth to the Annapolis convention to the Philadelphia can mentioned this day ratifying convention and they were acquainted with the diversity of this great country and this is not merely no one is partially\nA slave owning interest versus the abolitionist interest is not merely that they also recognize that we're looking to states like New York\nIn agrarian states like Georgia and small states like Ryder Rhode Island and ... states like Virginia which at the time of this\nWas literally unlimited I Believe because then we got the land grant all the way extending as far as it could go show what part did that recognition of the of the deep diversity of America play in the car going together of the Senate\n[laughter] yeah well they they would not yeah they did the the word diversity a curse in the federalist papers good point um so yeah and just remember people today people have real attachment to the place where they were born\nAnd grew up in the Michigan you
