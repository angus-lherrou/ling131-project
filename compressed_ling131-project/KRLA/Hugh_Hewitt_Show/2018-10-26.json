{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "Or serve twenty two years on nuclear submarines are learns a submarine onto of admiral recovers famous forty one for freedom the USS John Adams and the U.S as Woodrow Wilson out of Charleston South Carolina a commander welcome to bill Martinez live how are you sir\nI'm doing fine thank you very much\nHey thank you I mean I ... I mean to to be so\nIncredibly gifted I mean to go through all that you've done and serving our country and everything and now a ... you know to give us a ... you know a series of books that you have and of course uh\nThis one here are inspired from um a firing point and earlier book that you've written\nA comes hunter killer and now here just come into the big screen what what's that like for you\nIt's exciting a part of the best way to describe it it's a\nShort of the combination of a lot of hard work on certainly Donna my part a lot of other people's to to make this reality ... and to see what a\nMillennium studios and and ah Gerard Butler and ... it with her story or is really great\nBut they have done all they have done just as to what we were trying to do and telling the submarine story\nMhm [noise] well uh in your background in dealing I'm a I mean commanding a\nSubmarines give give our audience an ideal what what that's like I mean I you know for me I can I I think about it I've I've certainly have towards some submarines of it but to be a no live on a submarine to experience\nA a you know the whole life or underneath the water like this is just a something incredible to me\nFor us it's certainly something far apart from what most people get a chance to experience a matter of us to Houston as it's been seven Thirteen she was one of the Los Angeles question now the commission\nThat you're part of the life is the submarine and the fantastic technology involved\nBut probably the most fun part of the most fulfilling part of commanding a boat is having a great team yes and if they're suffering really as a team sport mhm and you know it might play the quarterback\nA but having that great team behind me to make everything happens just fantastic it you know so if I say team is wrong and it's a Brotherhood because it's one place where you literally depend on everybody on that gene for your wife among each and every day\nI was going to say to be in close quarters like that day in and day out a it transcends that I mean it and then like you say it's about a ... you know it it's like it's life and death I mean is that critical I mean you ... the ear you're dealing with their rent or\nYeah or somebody makes a mistake you will die in a in a critical situations somebody does\nRight you all live so yeah it really is that critical on pretty much every day\nWell or the movie hunter killer as we mentioned earlier was inspired by one of your previous books are firing point I'm a soda and tell us tell us the um ... you know the synopsis of hunter killer\nTalker a ... or leave the ending out Steve everybody has a\nWell we're we're all looking forward to seeing this I can I tell you there's so much about as bad hunter killer looking boarded back yeah I I was supposed to go to a premier and I'm I'm In California right now and it's just been crazy with my schedule so uh\nI'm I'm gonna go in and uh see the movie with uh with everybody on friday when it releases nationwide ...\nGood good now I Will say that a friend of mine told me that they should charge half price for the ticket for yourself you because you're going to be on the edge of your seat entire time you're on the ground\nThat's correct yeah I Love that that's excellent so at least give us every popcorn you write yeah go ahead so anyway so I get get us give us an overview\nOkay a basic synopsis um\nI'll give you the the very quick one first this is the one that I'm Gary Oldman a\nDescribe the plot ... put it in a probably just a couple of sentences uh and uh we're dealing at this point with Russia a shorter and a and a decline\nA president does not really very strong and a Russian admiral that wants to restore the honor of the ... the motherland mhm um\nAnd to do that as Gary Oldman put her very first I think like a he needs to\nBe in that you shouldn't have a slight of hand\nSo that the Americans and anybody outside won't interfere so he comes up with a plot or to bring the world to the brink of World War three is that sleight of hand ...\nAnd it's dealing with that whole complexity of hype what's that together that this plot revolves around ... and sort of uh\nThe u._s. is Arkansas which is the the ship that Jerry ... or ah commands mhm a sort of falls into by accident what's happening and it it falls from there where he and then a team of seals a\nHas a responsibility to spoil the whole thing mhm\nSo it's almost like they catch themselves in a game of chess that's already been underway right\nNow pretty much so mhm yeah and that they're trying to catch themselves in the game of chess and they don't know they're in a game of chess and so they don't know the rules of the game\nSo they've got to develop this all was go along\nAnd meanwhile they're relying or as they did for hunter Red October or history or any kind of intel that they can put together to figure this out and and I guess what makes this so powerful is that um\n... you know what what you're presenting here and what you wrote the book is not that far fetched I mean you know this\nSeems to be a you know what Russia is doing in terms of as you say wanting to return to a their previous greatness and that has been a growing frustration for Russians ever since uh the empire so to speak was broken up ...\nYeah exactly exactly mhm and yeah all of our books you know I Try very hard to be a I guess the best way to put it is right on the edge reality mhm um so we're clear present a plot that is not the least bit farfetched you could actually happen tomorrow\nAnd then have all the from that\nAnd sometimes there are risks with that you know we've had books were we were almost finished\nAnd something happens to the world order and a plot launched goes away totally well and sometimes it's like like this and do everything falls in places the world order progress has and frankly we looked like profits we project at all of this\n[laughter] exactly well you know with your with your background and understanding you know world bans I'm ... ... again it's not that far fetched to be that far in front of it I mean you can project\nOr you know some trajectory here with what's going on but it's really an ... ah the way you've written a book and of course uh now I just like I said I Can't wait to see it tomorrow\nNow I got to imagine as a commander of a submarine that in your experiences were really critical in consulting for this movie [noise]\nActually uh certainly we we spent a lot of time in the in the book itself making a very real ... and\nIn the early screenplays yes ah once the navy if it got aboard and they've been aboard very very strongly ah for the entire production or they actually assigned a post commands navy commander a\nOn site for the entire filming ... a commander Gail ... a good friend and they rely they being ... and the filming a crew relied on him heavily for the authenticity [noise] my wife and I went to watch them film for a couple of weeks for a week over in London\nAnd they were doing it and he likes to be over there\nAnd I couldn't tell you how many times I heard a\nTon of 'em and say hey Caleb Caleb we gotta asking this right wing and they were following exactly what he told them so when you when you set down tomorrow night and you look at the screen and you see that control room of that of the Arkansas [laughter] you\nKnow you haven't ever been on average in your class submarines but no but if you look at that that and exactly what a Virginia quest that mind control room looks like oh wow\nIt is realistic well at least this time somebody ... taking pictures not going to violate anything a national security issues have been the brick right\nThank God for that was a lot yeah let's say let's not but uh\nWhat what what a um ... ... you know congratulations on the movie look forward to seeing it tomorrow night I'm In you know are you sir for Twenty years on nuclear submarines what should civilians or know about our military men who endure to serve our country [noise]\nWe're getting better by the hour as the Pittsburgh way receive is\nUnder a hail storm of drugs\nActually just a Z pack bronchitis as of now the thing I learned that his father's it but\nIt's over it's done and I'm\nSo glad to be with you Paul boys the one good thing about lie around all day and doing nothing is if they allow me to drive deep into the numbers as we approach the election\nUh and of course I'll talk about the packages I'm a ... that story is actually become\nUm pardon the pun overblown\nBecause there's nothing to report it's a bad thing that someone said ten packages\nWhich were intended to go off as far as I can tell I'm not sure they were capable of going up but once you say that and you say the FBI is there to search to Florida\nWith some focus on New York that's the end of the facts\nTherefore any conclusions thereafter are also it I've got ... conclusion to play for you but let me go through the news first ... of the great shirt I stick around Joseph Ellis who is joining us the author of you know finding brothers and many other wonderful books he has a new book out called American dialogue the founders and as\nA dog that had just got a lot of course it's friday we're not having a Hillsdale dialogue this week we're going to

support Bernie Sanders was and I write to him\nUm the remarks of Mr Smith from the Massachusetts ratification convention on January twenty fifth Seventeen ADA the system it rises Mr President I Am a plane man and I get my living by the plow I'm not used to speaking in public but I beg your lead to say a few\nWords to my brother plowed joggers in this house he goes on to say that when I saw this constitution I found that it was a cure for these disorders it was just such a thing as wanted\nI got a copy and I read over and over I had been a member of the convention of former on state constitution and learn something of the checks and balances of power and I found them all there and I did not go to any lawyer to ask his opinion we have no lawyers in our town and we are do well enough without my for my own opinion and I'm pleased with this constitution\nThat for the Democratic impulses in the jokes about what's that say eight thousand people those conventions that ratified this document\nAbsolutely and the conversation that you and I are having who is exactly what I Want\nDialogue argument that you and I would disagree about originalism ... and the constitution and doing so in a ... way yeah and ... ... and that was such a divided people now we're all living in our own little apps on our own little bubbles\nAnd the ability to reach across a space between us and have a coherent argument is exactly what I'm trying to do in the book\nWhere this is where the public historians come in like you and and Doris Kearns Goodwin on earlier this week and I've got General McChrystal coming on public history as you say it expands your memory it gives you a longer memory and dust better arguments what'd you picked up a couple of minutes to tell me or tell the audience why it's so important that they read popular history\nWell I think that they should read history that can speak to you know beyond that the categories that academic sometimes occupy outlook on a card carrying a story of a new bad and other than the ... and the\nA and too many historians are only writing to each other and they've created narrower and narrower definition of our history\nA little amount of the ... who couldn't even past civics test that a new a new immigrants to America have to ask is is astounding and\nYou're right it does expand our memory back in time in ways that allow us to have perspective on ourselves or that or that we all know that when we get older we look back of our lives and um\nSo what you're doing now is what we need to do more and the historical literacy of the population will allow us I think to break through the conduct cross the ...\nI and I think that is actually I read David Brooks piece earlier this week the rich white civil war\nMost of the anger comes from eight percent on the left and six percent of the right and if those fourteen percent cannot destroy the conversation for the eighty five percent of us who want to have that and to move the ball for I don't think you\nKnow the times I get pessimistic and uh I'm a realist and I'm\n... I mean when you get on the Internet and listen to what people are saying ... ... it's hard to believe in what they've called the better angels of our nature and I'm a\nAnd so ... is like yours are helping us to recover that and um and I really do think that in the in the end\nArgument is the answer um it's it's not that that that's what the constitution really is it's a framework to argue it it doesn't it doesn't provide you with a clear set of answers it provides you with a friend with which we argue\nThat each generation needs to be able to do that all the time terms\nAnd Madison's example is I think maybe the best because he's not gifted in Hamilton is with charisma physical side he hasn't got Washington's rectitude ... to ... or ... but he just works at it he just works at it every day you have\nPay any he thinks like a lawyer even though he's like I like Hamilton or out others or ... percent he's not trained as a lawyer or he just thinks that way and um any you know he can change within his own mind of the building is sort of step on step across\nEastern half of the ah the eastern part of the Gulf there that allows a our military to test I'm\nTest different um pieces of equipment aid they can do a lot of training there which is where you know where the air force of the navy that's where you're trained to learn to be a pilot\nAnd so they can do it and I interrupted by a commercial activity there so it's it's an important a mission for the for the United states we have twenty military bases and reunify command\nAnd as governor I've tried to do everything it can to help them fulfill their mission and make sure all the military members editor veterans have all the resources they need to ... everybody want to live in the states\nNow governor Rick Scott let's turn to politics or I have heard it said that you would be running away with the Senate race but for the fact\nMichael wiped out the voting ability of many Floridians in the panhandle I read an executive order you sent out our ... going to be able to vote because they want to send you to Washington as their senator they really do want to replace Bill Nelson I Want to send you but they got to be able to vote and you know there aren't any school to go to\nAsk you what we've done is we had eleven counties impacted\nAnd some some impact a little bit less like with the state capital is the county so we sat down with their supervisors elections there lifted the county\nAnd we said how how can we work with you to make sure\nYou know people have the right to vote and they can get out there so you can vote by absentee or by mail\nUm in our state or you can do it by early voting and you can do it on election day and we've worked in every county to make sure that you eat out the vote what they did in Lake County which is Panama City they have five supervised election wanted to do there has to stop by big mega sites 'cause that's where we got\nA more damage where there's a lot of people and so\nThe supervisors doing of elections down there is doing\nTSA I'm just making sure everybody gets off the boat and and clearly you know campaigns will do and make sure people know where to vote because\nYou know you will happen to a lot of people they wake up unless they say okay I'm going to go vote and they just go to the last place they loaded on the last time and so there are everybody's working hard to let people know that you might have to be going to a different place\nSo how do you feel about the campaign right now I I look at the our CPA average three of the last four polls have you had but you're busy during hurricane recovery it's not really campaign mode and Rick Scott style which is a hundred and ten percent or how you juggling they expect\nBut my first job is to take their I'm going to get on the governance okay if that isn't so that's what I've been doing\nMy wife has gone out and campaign for me when I ...

Services Alex Azar who joined me inside the beltway I'm In the early ... is our welcome\nBack I Want to talk to you about drug pricing and good morning to you but I had to the pharmacy this week for the Z pack and all the other stuff that goes when you get bronchitis a tell me and I was little sticker shock then I've got good insurance what were you in the president talking about yesterday about lowering drug prices\nWill you great to be with you again uh yesterday morning here it ha chess we actually revealed data showing that in one of the most important parts of our drug program\nMedicare pays one hundred and eighty percent\nOf what Europeans and Japanese pay for the same medicines under deals that farm it gives them and the president came over here at age eight jets and he said that's going to stop that for a free ride into the stock we're ... we're going to be done without paying sticker price and that part of the Medicare program\nAnd we're going to get the benefit of these foreign prices here in America and it'll save Seventeen billion dollars over five years for the program and three and a half billion over five years for patients like you when you get your drugs\nNow six days are I Want people to know your very fine lawyer you are what we call a litigator having court for the white honorable Michael ... who am I correct about that\nIndeed I was his first Locklear okay so I Want him to be our next attorney general but there's a litigator you will have concern for\nWhat the statute permits you to do and whether the regulations which will go through the nose would come in ... are going to be labeled an overreach and you know the big pharma spends a hundred and Seventy one million bucks so you're a lobbying so you're going to get a zillion comments during the notice income and things when do you think\nAre without pre judging the outcome ha chess will be able to issue a regulation from the center for Medicare and Medicaid innovation to implement this proposal\nOur plan is to have this up and running by the end of twenty Nineteen so the end of next year or the beginning of twenty twenty\nWe're gonna take input but let me be I Want to be really clear view we're going to be doing this\nWe're gonna get input to do it the right way but we're going to end of this foreign free riding that's not debatable it's gonna it's gonna happen but we'll do it the right way and we're doing it open and transparent process to ensure we're seeing around corners and doing everything right because we want to make sure this works for hospitals\nWent to make sure it works for for our providers for our doctors and want to make sure absolutely works for patients and will do whatever it takes to make it work for all of them so they save money they have access and we stopped us for free riding and how far was taking advantage of us\nNow senator or is there I grew all that but I go back to the fact I think by the time your regulars out into the courts Chevron doctrine will have been greatly limited so I expect the Supreme Court to look very very closely at the statute under which you are proceeding\nHave you already done that as a litigator and can and persuaded yourself but you got the authority to do what essentially it looks like a referencing to me a midpoint averaging like the real clear politics average of drug prices and implement that has the will buy price for Medicare\nBut that that that's correct you know um I actually have through a what's called the center for Medicare and Medicaid innovation\nExtremely broad authority to test alternative methods of making payments and Medicare to improve patient quality access\nAnd affordability and efficiency of the program that's why this is a demonstration project that will take place in fifty percent of America it has very clear metrics to be studied through it\nI have not the least bit of concern about our legal authority to do this to do this project\nThat's very good to know which ... now what about the Americans are on the other fifty percent of the country they're not going to be happy [laughter]\nWell you know I'm using as you just said I'm using the full authority that I've got I Do have to test a proposition I Can't just do it across the board for everyone now if Congress like this idea they can do it tomorrow across America I'm and I'm happy to work with them if they're interested in that\nUp but for the rest of Americans who are not in the fifty areas the fifty percent of the country that will be doing this they're still going to see a benefit because as we the way the system works\nAs we hold down the reimbursements in this fifty percent of America\nThe silly way that we currently fixed prices in this program will also pulled down the reimbursements as a result in the other fifty percent of the country not as much but they will still get some of that benefit\nTo conclude secretaries or of health and Human Services you got a new proposal it's going to notice and comment rule making you expect to have it in operation by twenty Nineteen what you expect a health care premiums to look like in the year ...\nOr so we actually have had great results Medicare Advantage and part D these are two of the most important programs for seniors the premiums for them to President Trump's leadership have gone down\nAnd you know I I we we get some golf for this but we don't we don't like Obamacare we think it's fundamentally flawed within gets broken we think the premiums are too high and it needs to be repealed and replaced\nBut President Trump's doing a better job running that program the guy the guy whose name is on it premiums actually for the silver benchmark plan on which everything is based\nAre going down over one percent in the coming year for the first time in history that program and choices of plans are up for the first time since two thousand Fifteen it's still a broken program it's still not meeting the needs of our citizens but we're least making it work as well as it cannot tell Congress fixes it and replaces it\nMorning or a America on your Hi Janet\nEighty five percent of my voice after sunrise or the first black but I wasn't gonna miss is always because of that interview\nToday I was trying to say my mom had joins me\nBirth another West Point graduate General Stanley McChrystal rejoined minute talk about his brand new book author with jet backers and Jason men don't\nWaiters myth and reality you can't put it down you cannot put down later General McChrystal welcome back always a pleasure to talk to\nYou it's my honor thank you\nI I got to say this is a hits home for me because I've spent hundreds of hours with dark I help Richard Nixon write the book leaders and Winston Churchill's great contemporaries is one of my favorites so when I saw that Stanley McChrystal had done to talk for the new millennium\nSix pairs of leaders compared plus one stand on I thought I cannot wait to see the Thirteen are but I didn't allow myself to go through the table of contents I wanted to be surprised are you still and I bought my surprise are you still surprised by the leaders you and ... and mango and chose to profile\nQ. I actually am you know I felt we were going to come out with short of a more expected political leader or even business leader group but we try to get diversity and what they did and there sexism their backgrounds and whatnot and and I feel really good about it\nWell you said we lack I'm quoting you know we lack the leadership equivalent of a general theory of relativity so you set out to outline and underscored the complexity and the book and I thought to myself I don't have a formula and I don't think he wanted me to have a formula\nThat's exactly right you know we we were writing this book and partway through we came out with the realization that leadership is it what we think it is and studying history we realize it never has been\nAnd show as we went back to deconstruct\nWhat leadership actually constitutes weed or it's not something that leaders possess that they aim at followers and they make things happen it's really like an interaction between contextual factors followers and leaders and it's always changing and therefore endlessly complex\nSo now I Want to warn the idea that we're talking about some specifics from leaders myth and reality so if you want to be surprises I was you can just turn it off and go over to the book and Amazon dot com leaders nipping reality by\nStanley McChrystal ... and Jason Ringo but if you don't mind getting a little bit of a a spoiler let let me just say the biggest surprise for me is to find Rob sphere and Zarqawi at the middle of your book\nBut boy does it make sense when you're done with reading about these two villains they were built with us leaders of extraordinary ability\nAnd the effectiveness that's exactly right and we we called it was jealous because their strength came from ... G of their conviction and the fact that they will waiver from what they believed even though we might think what they believed was completely wrong it gave them a magnet for followers\nI also picked up general ... names I mean a great deal\nUm zealots in other leaders end up with different sets of named drug spear became being corrupt double stark how we took on many different ... that name for him\nAnd so this renaming process is part of our myth building and to get back to the court person you always went back to their childhood as grant recommended we do if you want to know the man behind the child\nThat's exactly right because\nI don't think people stray too far from what initially forms and we talk about how we hit this tough upbringing and ... in Jordan industrial town he gets to she's kind of a bully he gets his fight she does these things and show the rest of his life\nIs both a journey to move away from that to become a leader to become an ideologically pure a Islam is but also he can't step away from the fact that in many ways you shut up\nAnd when he personally bad people he's not far from issues\nThat's it and added to bring up the full portrait of the evil and the ... tree it in to do it in thirty pages is amazing there's lots of disgust Coco Chanel is a wonder\nA Walt Disney is far more complex than I imagine and I got a contest you I've never even heard I Hope I pronounced it correctly John who I have never even heard of him I'll be talking about him and not president she is using it with the secretary of state and a few minutes how when did you discover ... am I saying credit young you\nYoung hey I die there when we were studying this we wanted to find somebody from Asia China preferably and\nThat is that the agitation we had on the show and it was a lot of what he's he's known for you know being seven feet tall having a five foot waste\nBeing made it unique at age ten and then yet but coming very famous admiral all of those things don't seem believable and of course many of them may not be accurate\nBut the reality is she has become a symbol for modern China\nAnd show he civilized says that China's past wars international\nAnd show that the F ... road initiative that Xi Jinping is pushing he can go back and point to somebody look John ... and go look this is a new for us this is legitimate because we've been doing it for hundreds of years\nThe astonishing success or the treasure played again I'm getting my historical ignorance I didn't know about ...
