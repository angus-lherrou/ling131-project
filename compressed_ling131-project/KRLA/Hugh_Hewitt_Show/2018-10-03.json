Art Blakey share their story is the only time they'd ever share the story I'm hearing their life that twenty two years ago ... shot art um he was Nineteen years old he was just a few months out of high school\nAnd women as friends decided they were gonna\nI'm Robert local establishment to hang out and uh the VFW hall and he didn't know that there was an off duty that if it was there that turned out to be art and that he said he came in shooting just scare people um and you\nKnow people are all dispersing the art comes around the corner and they run into each other and they both exchange fire and end up getting shot in the stomach both of them ... and they're transported to the same hospital now at this time um\nArts dot dot her with a senior in college and she comes to see her dad and she says you remember the first thing they hate that when you it is in the hospital was on the ... the\n... like I don't care how he is who care about is I don't care if he's fine and he's like that's not the time for that this is not the time for that um you know want to know how he is and are in the U.S in you know uh this guy could have gotten\nSixty years in jail he ended up getting it down to a twelve but you know because of art\nAre actually during his testimony to the judge the judge start crying because he's like you know this man deserves a second can just give them a second can\nThe judges in cheers wow the judge\nWas crying because that's the money into um\nYou had to know that had to be pretty compelling you know for the judge to the most like that\nOh absolutely so the judge ends up giving Danny uh twelve years and then he said he went in an angry guy but you know are kept showing him love art was checking on his ... he was in jail\nAnd uh you know a daddy's mama data in

at his house one day they ended up embracing and a hug and he's like I Love you I forgive you\nAnd you know anything that art loving him throughout that just it changes the world there was just this unconditional love that this man had or somebody who had done such harmed um um that you know it like it it took the wolf is I\nWill just as a power you know of love of human love one for another that you would extend yourself to that degree I mean this is an incredible story but it's when it's within the capacity of all of us\nTo do this sort of thing it it sounds so extraordinary and it is on on all counts but what's worse I mean ... what is it worth to save a man to save a man's very saw this kid was going\nTo hell in a hand basket and because of the love of this police officer taking care of his mom while he's in jail and everything and uh and being there for him you've got somebody now um whose life is going to be ... you know it's been so dramatically altered\nAnd a and one inexperience want an example you know jobs are police officers to all of us that here the story it's no wonder that is gone absolutely viral because you know I I think we all want a second chance\nWe all want to do over and and this is what God's love gives us the gives us that opportunity to have the very second chance that we long for and to see in an action this is God's love an action I mean this isn't done I mean this is so extraordinary I mean this isn't done within the\nConfines of our human psyche our human psyche says oh no yeah I Want this kid that I Want him there for sixty years I Want him suffering for all that he has done for me\nAnd uh I got to imagine you know for our the law and that his uh in you know his spirit is so we're healed in such a dramatic way that uh the scar is um you know just a reminder\nOf what ... what have could have done but what love actually did\nAnd then I also think about on Danny and I think about all the lights he'll change by a either by re telling our story it was a A R dead you know are actually\nPassed away a there was hundreds of people he's he's a he was actually police chief when he passed away and there was hundreds of people out

trying to land on an island and there is is when they were going down for landing that didn't happen instead of the fight hard and it was taking off right on right when they crash and you know they're still not sure what happened but\nUm fortunately the pilot was able to land the plane of the water and by the time of year passengers were getting up the water was waist deep\nArea say by the time the water was up to their ways they realize this was more than a rough landing right\nThat's right but they're all trying to get out and of course you know they're they're nearby to the lead but this plane is going down and taking them with them and local see what happens and immediately get their votes to come rushing out in the U.S navy was there a repairing a dog and actually\nGot out their their votes to or were you know escorting people back and forth and uh you know I I just love when you see I I have no idea how the pilot would manage to land in the water to clean it up there thinking like thirty meters deep though it was just you know if they are all\nThey get their the limited amount of time to get out of there but thank God everybody's survive time for one more story and I like this story about this selfless nine year old uses make a wish to throw a party for the entire school are you kidding me\n[noise] that's right the ... and it's got a voice for anything in

going to hear what the cubs come mid term madness [laughter]\nYou're registered why then you have to pick the winner and the twenty five races\nWhen you have to pick their margin of victory\nShow a lot of the early bird got in last week and they said I Will but we know where we know what's gonna happen\nNot realizing that thirty days as a lifetime in politics so the bottom falls out of the Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and Joe mansion because they have participated in McCarthyism named the judge Kavanaugh and now they have to go back there might have picked a Kevin Cramer North Dakota I sure would have\nBut they might add a margin of victory of two to four points that I got to go they're not going to get points for that if he wins by more than four points so they got to go back and they either adjuster and trail we allow that you make your entry and you go in so I think you've got to go in and make a second entry but head over to\n... play I think\nJudge Kavanaugh is going to make him for it but I Am I Am now persuaded that when the president opened up last night although the hot takes from the media whoa whoa Terry do this for days ago he said Christine Blasey Ford was a credible witness yeah but four days ago a lot of stop had not happened before I talk about\nWhat has happened or just a Monet let's first talk about what the president had to say last night and this is what do you have to say last night [noise]\nEver got already\nRight I Want do you think it was I was wondering\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago when I don't\nKnow [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know where [noise] where was I don't know if that's the only thing [noise]\nAnd the\nMan is in tatters a man's life is shattered\nWeed out all over the media this morning\nIs the word mock\nBut that said that the president mocked Christine Blasey Ford [noise] I don't believe that is a fair characterization but it's a boot bubble characterization cause a Catholic president negative like what are you doing as\nHe is casting doubt on her testimony you not mocking or as a sexual assault back to me is casting doubt on her testimony let's play it again cut number eight\nI Wonder I Wonder\nDo you think it was it was one of them are good [noise] how did he get home I don't remember how

don't\nFly a manned flight shattered [noise]\nNow I don't believe is the shattered er and tattered I think you're going to be confirmed adjusted to the Supreme Court because this is McCarthyism but I Will tell you why the president did that he knew that people were talking ... off the record in the green room\nWith their hands over their microphone about the fact that\nThe fear of flying defensive there'd been productive Chuck Grassley for the delay\nBut that was a lie maybe not her alive but it was a lie that um she said she wasn't aware that the Kennedy would come to her and we got like a part of the documents that can be offering to come to her not sure whether lawyers they'll look back from her or she lied [noise] she is familiar with polygraphs according to what corroborated

is also a new report from real clear investigation that the second front door in her home was not installed because of cost her phobia\nThere now contrary evidence that court was installed as a second entrance perhaps for an office for therapy no I don't know the answer to any of that stuff but what happened last night when the president went after her one beer testimony\nIs to appeal to people to begin to look at the credibility of the primary witness [noise] you'd also\nGot the attention off of the McCarthy I attacks on Brett Kavanaugh back on the fact that this was all set up so people are down on the president it might have been more prudent\nThat the vice president do this in a more prudent way because I just that perhaps might a bit but it is it that's not what happened to me while Lindsey Graham went out on Fox News with Harry last night said this number fourteen\nWell the cabin I'll bump Israel that the biggest change in the twenty Eighteen mid term so political observation in

don't have rallies but they're all asking themselves about\nChristine Blasey Ford's testimony the president is the head of the curve again and then Lindsey Graham went on with Sean said this number Fifteen\nWhat about these red state Democrats I think they're toast\nOver all of them all of them politically motivated by the only they are open seemingly ... even though there are tests that they

her or say\nIt was the cat and Romney at great for that that that was not as much of that but I Am not sure that\nHelp like they don't get it that way\nHe he decided to break the glass and it may not have been proven that would have been better had Mitch McConnell or someone else pointed out there was no fear of flying the committee offered to come to her and she was not aware of that something about the lawyer or the boyfriends letter on polygraph said I'm not hearing about the\nSexual assault the second door investigation the Rachel Mitchell Report someone else should have done it but he didn't see it getting done so he did it\nWell I got that and I think I ever call into question Kevin I got to be a judge it calls into question Croix it can be\nWell put well put again Lindsey Graham on Fox News last night here at the political reality number Thirteen\nHave they have a colleague that this is the new normal Ethel want to be a judge and a number again\nOn Saturday cut number Thirteen ...\nWell the cat than I'll bump Israel that the the biggest change in the twenty Eighteen mid term\nFor political observation in North Dakota sixty the twenty eighth he should be confirmed every race in these Trump\nOr red state held by Democrat there's been a surge by Republicans why or whether you're a Trump Republican a libertarian vegetarian\nMcCain Republican Romney Republicans Bush Republican you're mad as hell because for all United that this is unfair what they're doing it this good man\nWho are hard to you in the early record our studio inside the beltway\nGive her listening this morning so pleased a welcome back from the United States Senate representing Iowa the great state of Iowa senator Joni Ernst ... senator urged\nEl good morning he'll how're you doing on\nGreat oh I Want to give you a a GPS somewhere we are this morning show I spent the first hour talking only two women first time caller just talked to copy in Scranton and in Dallas Sarah in Tampa in and Detroit was a teenage son Norma in Michigan Alexandria Newport Beach California are weighing in Louisville\nUnion Oregon showing in Columbus\nAnd in San Diego ... percent colors all of them want Kelvin are confirmed nine out of ten of them support what the president said last night one wish the hat and set it and they all\nDon't believe Dr ... testimony though they are all very sympathetic and indeed one as a daughter who's a barber survivor of sexual assault that's just a slice of what I've been hearing what have you been hearing\nWell I Am hearing of course a mixture of the calls I get to the office a lot of them are are saying get Kavanaugh confirmed\nAnd then there are others that um are you know adamantly opposed we see those folks on the TV all the time um but what I Do hear when I'm Out and about and people just can't understand why we haven't moved on with a\nGetting him confirmed they understand that he has the right to um credentials to sit on the nation's highest court and they fully expect that we should get this done soon\nTo be a ... I Do not\nBelieve the president was mocking the idea of someone being assaulted last night he was poking holes in testimony and I want to review a few things with you about the testimony first of all there was a story and political\nThat she had a fear of flying which is why that had to be the way it should never actually feel better itself but\nThat was represented the committee she did say she was not aware that the committee would come to her so that could be on her lawyers her former boyfriend has filed a letter saying she some motor with polygraph they'd never discuss sexual assault there they knew real clear investigations report that the\nSecond front door contractor evidence shows it was not about claustrophobia but at second entrance for an office there wasn't a single verifiable assertion or testimony and not one that could be disproven either and then there's the Rachel Mitchell Report by simply do not believe that that testimony could knock Brett Kavanaugh of consideration\nNo I I don't believe so either and and Dr Ford I\nDo honestly believe that she has experienced trauma at some point I sure do I sure do I I I think most folks will agree with that however um even\nThe witnesses that she called forward actually uh can't corroborate or simply tear down that the testimony that she gave about um uh some party that she had attended so unfortunately um for for her I don't\nFind that to be a credible message again I Do want to reiterate that I Do think she experienced trauma but I don't know and it wasn't proven that it was judge Kavanaugh\nMeanwhile we have the secondary assault on judge Kavanaugh who I Do not know by the way he's ten years younger than I Am so we did not move in the same circles but he he strikes me as a very good and decent man and his two daughters caught me telling the fourteen year old\nWill be dealing with this for the rest of their life and that people are not stood up to a to underscore that their father is not a gang rape is but none of this has been proven that Sheldon Whitehouse is allegation\nWas libel was slanderous and immediately reputed referred by the committee for prosecution are you and your colleagues doing enough to stand up and stand by judge cabin on your view\n[noise] well I think we are standing up for judge Kavanaugh of course she won't hear any of those stories covered by mainstream media um by we certainly respect him we respect his family they have been put through um the\nThe worst possible situation ever with their father being demeaned and an discredited and and it's very unfortunate and we'd have those discussions on why would anybody want to step up\nBe nominated for such an important position why would anybody want to run for office if it simply takes an accusation and unproven accusation which can put a family literally through how\nDuring the other who would be the chairman of health judiciary if the Democrats take the house that's a very scary thought he said he is going to open impeachment\nHearings based upon the judges perjury nothing he said ... of them doing this for thirty five years remotely approaches perjury as a lawyer nothing there's not a single under viable assertion that he made he characterizes drinking who did not\nDenies drinking why would anyone take that seriously\nWell just look around here it's all about obstruction it's about resistance and as about what can we stop and put\nIn the president's way what can we put in Congress has way to stop them from doing a better job for the United states of America I mean look at our economy and how strong we are doing right now and and know thanks to our counterparts across the aisle they have tried\nTo slow us down stop us at every opportunity whether it's getting rid of unnecessary regulation whether it is stopping the tax cuts and JOBS Act what ever it\nIs they try and delight delight resist um and that's exactly what they're doing in the house if they take the house we can expect that for the next two years\nNow I have been calling this frequently on law and the new McCarthyism because McCarthyism as the taking of a very serious charge that's been proven in another context and the case originally treasonous conduct against the Rosenberg perjury by his signing it to the Hollywood screenwriters that's McCarthyism\nThis McCarthyism is taking people like Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby and they're horrible crimes and attributing them to a red cabinet and I think people need to stand up and say this is hysterical and it's deeply unfair senator\nAnd as it is absolutely unfair and it is absolutely ridiculous if you look around the Senate you can point fingers here too and members that have added admittedly I'm had bad behavior and they're in their past which\nProbably surpasses any accusation that has been\nLeveled against Brett Kavanaugh so I think people should tread very lightly on the things that they are throwing at this respectable man and his family they don't want it to come around\nFive fold against them in the future so um we just need to do a better job here in the United states at teaching our children what is appropriate behavior what is not appropriate behavior and then of\nCourse I'm just doing better as society but for other members to kind of laugh about what they did in their college days and then a point the finger at Brett Kavanaugh on say you are not qualified to serve on our nation's highest court because you drank beer and high school or college you know shame on you\nThey had better start thinking twice about what they're doing\nA ... boy ... campaign within four and I believe to be a very decent man he actually had good faith and the Democrats who's been proven wrong of course they did not use those to wait for the FBI report they immediately moved the goalposts\nOf you got any sense when the FBI are going to finish and therefore a motion for cloture filed do you have a timetable\nI Do think that we will say that this week I think the FBI as probably winding down as as we are speaking out with their\nWitnesses and I know that our leader is very intent on getting this uh voted on this week so as soon as we can receive the report I Do think it is important to a review\nThe information and the report for the supplemental investigation um we need to know that for our constituents just be able to verify you know everything is okay if everything does check out and then we move forward and and have the same laptop but I Would anticipate um as the leader has stated he wants to see it done this way\nHave you heard any ... I've heard that possibly the FBI report will be done today and culture bio tonight have you heard that\nUh I have heard some semblance of that and but um again I I Would hesitate to say that on on a national program I just think that we have to make sure that we are going through the report that we've had time to absorb it and make sure that we're able to push back to our our constituents\nThat everything has got to go and then we move forward do\nYou expect at this point at this point obviously with a report to review that you will be voting for judge governor\nI well I'm unless there is something that surfaces and they are and the investigative report that you know the supplemental report that would cooperate Dr forwards testimony unless that happens I plan to support judge Kavanaugh\nBegan last thing I Want to play pea Lindsey Graham on on a Sean Hannity was by cutting number Fifteen what about these red state Democrats I think they're toast over all of ... uh do you agree with that senator I wound up go ahead\nI Do I absolutely agree with that underground and and a lens they has been a hero through this process he\nClearly phase what is going on and he has been able to demonstrate that and and clear concise language for every one which we all appreciate uh but I Do believe that those are Democrats that are in red states those are up this year they are going to have a very very difficult time if they did not support judge Kavanaugh\nTo spend on the DC circuit court of appeals for twelve years going uh assessments had this credibility has integrity before this hearing now if you're going to reward people for destroying his life that's questioning his temperament and you're sitting in motion the destruction the judiciary to any Republican\nWho wants to

impeachment she just saying I'm a yes to that what you're hearing\n[noise] we're supposed to fight that for you is what what I'm hearing Republicans Republicans are standing strong everyone I ever talked to they are saying ... percent corroborating evidence of Dr Ford in this report they're staying strong with cabin on\nYou know look I think that's the assumption I think that um you know Senate Republican leadership\nBelieves that that absent corroborating evidence that that that that he is going to be confirmed that they're going to have the vote 'em but I I think that there is sort of a a a an unspoken built in caviar in everyone's mind here that that um\nYou know corroborating\nEvidence is potentially in the eye of the older you are and and I know that that sounds strange but we're living in a really strange time and this is a very strange situation and I do think that there\nIs a potential for some finding that is not corroborating in a legal sense but that is a you know a significant in undermining portions of of judge Kavanaugh's a sworn testimony and that that could change things for for\nSome senators for some Republicans I'm not saying that's going to happen but I I certainly don't think that anybody is closing off that possibility if they're being honest about\nYou know the audio and transcript the journey urge to be posted pretty soon but I'll tell you what struck me ten\nShe is not going for that little margin you tried to go there shooting which is you know drinking or throwing ice in a bar that just irrelevant to her she wants corroborating evidence of salt\nWhich launched all of this everything else just post facto to her and doesn't matter and I actually believe Republicans will be wiped out if they do not confirmed\nKavanaugh within ... in the absence of an explanation corroborating Dr Ford story I really think they will be wiped out in a way the revolt will be so massive because what I hear and pick up is it just passion\nLike I haven't seen in two years you know Trump is there a shattered the Republican Party it's altogether that is what Lindsey said last night\n[laughter] yeah look I I I Would certainly agree with you there I I think that the Republican base is probably more unified at this moment that it has been in a in a Twenty one months of the Trump presidency that's far I I don't think there's any question and I and I do think that that they\nShould do it as a matter of of sort of delivering and as a matter of motivating and and mobilizing I'm politically yeah there's there's no question uh that that they are now in a position where and I think some folks on the hill even some folks on the Republican side who sort of whisper like geez I you know\nMorning all your high Canada you you're literally factor dot com

it up they vote or off at all\nThey could ... or ... on\nThe current political down on at the heat to get from voter an independent voter who made like clogging all in like President Trump will come out and vote the bomb and the following year but they also have their party with with the in the rye in law and it's a perfect storm for them and and not by Graham and senator and they have a point he looked a Democrat\nRunning a plug in some one\nOf them because they thought point\nI also like salient says often forgotten I learned that from a\nA a Martin back in the day of Harvard that you always have to look at polling data and find out whether an issue how people responded an issue but how motivating it is I think the cabinet issue is I didn't have any parallel in my experience back the Clarence Thomas it's even more intense than that I was only a weekend house back Clarence Thomas day\nThe intensity it set off and I think Robert it is because of the unfairness of it I and I got one of the woman called I've got this a lot of Monday I have a teenage son I'm worried about my teenage son\nBut but it's just his daughters I really do think it's about parents of kids watching these daughters be tortured if you pick that up\nYou see this visceral reaction across the country\nBut you do see a lot of wind power of I've seen it and it goes well others and they worry about this on the father is all worried about their daughters mothers worried about their daughters what's happening in such a cultural divide\nIt beyond ... I mean these gender debate or who are in this country I mean you see it on line with us talk about men right you see it in a rival commentators like Jordan Peter image or onto a psychologist\nWho talks about really protective non in modern society and it's all kind of come into the Kavanaugh nomination that are really starting it's kind of deep cultural division\nAbout what's really happening in American Life that are ... are under siege about something more than ... interim of riding a wave\nNow let's talk a little bit about reporting I'm Joni Ernst does not know when the FBI supplemental will be arriving I've heard probably today with a vote on culture tonight or or the filing a coach or tonight reporting on that Robert Costa\n... all of our reporting and opposes the FBI is pretty much you know and\nThought I'd probably take through the end it today Thursday\nTo finish it up and down cost McConnell wants to get to vote on this week it's got to be done locally but once they interviewed ... and now they're they're pretty much it yet\nAnd so it is possible it will be filed tonight then it's thirty hours until you can vote on cloture and then thirty hours to the final vote I think it'd be seated next week have you heard of any Republican announcing they are not voting for cabin on\nThis point but it's not clear yet whether the Saturday So I've been briefed on finding the ... or even a chemical confidential from the public at any kind of contradictory saving it could raise red flags\nAt certain what what's going on in Iraq and on the road but with the episode it all the word for word was not a lot of evidence\nAbout what happened back in the early Nineteen eighty they're not made public aid tell me may be able to ... nomination afloat but even if it's something that the Democrats that won the Republicans will study\nWhich was very specific she said in the absence\nOf evidence corroborating Dr porridge testimony shouldn't care about throwing ice in a bar at Yale in Nineteen eighty five don't care about that in the absence of evidence corroborating Dr Ford's testimony she is voting for Kavanaugh will now I Want to talk about whether or not the
