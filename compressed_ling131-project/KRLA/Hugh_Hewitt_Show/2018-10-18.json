{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "And a seven hundred and fifty people in the fifty thousand facility is pretty pretty hollow and really when you look at the numbers\nOf agitator that are out there it is a small number and a duty I'm you know main street America is going to be careful not to shake the dog\nWouldn't you love an aerial photo of Iraq Obama's appearance of Anaheim Stadium and see those seven hundred fifty people in the ... in a stadium that old but you know forty thousand I ended up you know these the educators you talk about\nTheir so radical so extreme of being encouraged by people like Hillary Clinton Maxine Waters Eric Holder 'em and many of them are paid ... and they're violent than they are domestic terrorists exactly actually so and so yeah it's pretty horrible\nWill just kind of get in a column I wrote a while ago about a just cause you're allowed doesn't make you more right it just makes you more louder and so\nThose are typically right hand and it does hand right you win no it doesn't make you when it's the thing that they're learning\nYou know they dress up like a hands made Kael may come and disrupt the capital\nAnd they cause for up to the United States Supreme court and trends and filled the streets and scream and yell and lose mhm 'cause now they have to deal with justice Kavanaugh of the United States Supreme court\nExactly well because it all comes down to substance at the end of the day uh you know panic carry the day I mean you know all this victory all can only carry so far and you know just like ah keep saying like somebody who's drowning sometimes you just have to let them get the fight out of themselves and realized that uh yeah\n'cause we've been we've been through this before\nYou know back in the sixties and you know when everybody was against a Vietnam and you know and you got a a you know Jane Fonda who suddenly now is um realize that what she did was regrettable\nAnd some of the causes and the way she represented herself and and uh and very you know very much a disrespected the military or you know she now is the you know admitted some regret it only took her what fifty years to get to that spot I guess\nWhat you write you know history does repeat itself we know that we'll heirs and burn it deemed or\nThan this extreme factions weatherman for the predecessors who and teeth today\nMhm we have it's like a change their names and they change their costumes but then there are domestic terrorists and and the third dangerous and there are what's amazing is to say mainstream supposedly\nPoliticians mainstream ... office holders on the Democrat side actually encouraging encouraging this kind of\nCriminal behavior is ... ...\nYeah it's amazing and then there's the first ones to call you know for civility [laughter] in a minute you're the one of the house down and now you're just saying hey we should outlaw fires well you know out now then what once we do that then what what what are you going to come up with next right\nThat's right [laughter]\nOh gosh the irony of it all uh but uh it's like you said ah it it's not like we haven't been there before\nBut all it takes is good people to remain quiet and I think that they're starting to stand up and of course they did that the twenty sixteen election much to the shock and chagrin of many on the left and why their brains emptied out\nBecause uh they just thought that they had it all in the bag and a reality struck them to say no America is not quite that stupid\nYou know I mean talk about history repeating itself\nNow Americans have to be flooded with polls yelling them to the elections already over the Democrats won the house and the Senate and that's going to tell her rate during the next few weeks until the election polls\nIn some cases are skewed and other cases Chester flawed because of the fact that the people that are supporting the right of center candidates are not participating in the polls in a large enough number for the polls to be scared [noise]\nWell a lot of people aren't going to give a straight answer because the victory all of the body politic right now it's like look at it I I just wanted what I just want to get by my day\nAnd I'm working hard I don't want to get exercised and\nHave somebody being raped me because I have an opinion and uh so okay fine you know you're you're you're basically training me how to answer the question but when I get in the voting booth thank God the voting booth is still a you know a private a respected spot\nAnd um you know I'm I'm going to vote my conscience which is what people did and the twenty sixteen election I Believe that's what will happen again\nI mean again you look at the difference to your your earlier point rock Obama pulls a seven hundred and fifty people in Anaheim, California the Anaheim Stadium seats forty thousand plus\nAnd Donald Trump meanwhile every campaign or that ah every stop that he's making James people are waiting in line for hours there's thousands upon thousands of people in these arenas that he's going to\nUh so you've got I mean you know they talk about the enthusiasm gap and you know one deal another and I'm going well if there's a gap I see it more you know from the left I don't see it on the right\nAnd also people are saying that Israel result they're in the African American and minority communities record unemployment and when we look at the news and they say hey what happened to ISIS we hear about ice the same way they find out that\n... the Korean War formally and and the pieces breaking out it appears mhm even between north and South Korea and in the entire Pacific Rim and they look at this pastor Brunson or one of many\nBut the most recent person this guy held in a Turkish prison\nUm brought home without\nPayment of money without concessions to the Turkish government and what is the guy do he goes into the oval office puts his hand on the shoulder of the president grasp on his knees and begins to pray right up president for the nation\nAnd these things I think\nUm they resonate the it but it's the even the corrupt media can't stop the word from getting out ... um they see the results of the growth in the economy they see a president whose work ethic\nIs inspiring and and and they know that it's been two years\nOr this and the and all the notion that have been and are still being forced but by the media that somehow Trump has some sort of a pay back curved thing where Russia improvement but we can look at the fast food\nTruckers tougher on Russia and at least those last two predecessors exactly and it's just the facts are really different than the corrupt media narrative\nWell and this is a you know and and even like with Leslie stall the other night you know she wanted to do a\n... you know just really dig in the president about prudent and and uh you know trying to dig up some mud and you know she would just love the he he should have had fun with her and just as you know Leslie I'm Glad I'm Glad you brought it up you know I Want you to know that tomorrow I'm going to tweet that we're closing the Mueller investigation could [laughter]\nI can see how much money could have had with her\nBut he did have an accent that I Know he did [laughter] I Know but they wouldn't let her get away with anything no yeah he\nHe wouldn't let the leading questions go down the road right because I Do as a matter of fact Leslie stall is being criticized by her colleagues are making too soft on the president if you can imagine that\nWell she was his route as you can be I mean she interrupted him every two seconds and you know it's just like wait a minute you know this guy and then finally had to remind her as well and the president Lesley [laughter]\nYou're not Leslie yeah right [laughter] go\nGo figure that one out [noise] um let's shift gears for just a moment let's go to TV um the Roseanne spin off or uh ABC a little bit nervous like a cat on a Hot Tin roof as they say\nYeah well what happened is you know first of all everybody knows that Roseanne looking backward it seems\nUtterly ludicrous you know we look at all the racial insult CNN and MSNBC launched it towards Kanye West far worse than anything Roseanne has ever done Don Lemon ah\nUse terms that truth easily got him fired ... works hand gets fired for one tweet it was a bad joke but what happened is\nSome reporters with the u._k. daily mail apparently got a hold of two and they describe them is senior ABC executives who said how nervous they are about the Congress now they know about ... feedback they got from marketing and publicity\nWhich basically is telling them what we already know exactly that you're already public is insulted by the way they treated Roseanne\nAnd there's no way they're going to watch the Connors now some people may tune in\nIn the beginning of out of curiosity what they were very very soon going to turn it off\nThey couldn't do this isn't going to be ... not going to be Tim Allen this is going to be you know more like a the re boots of um um what's the name that that scored last place um oh gosh I just had her name right\n... am Eric how old is your high\nAverage or you know what I Am in Tampa, Florida and all of a sex scene the answer an answer to the answer during an event tonight

is and uh I got used to call up and up to Virginia Falls come to\nDC in Virginia so I Walk out the playing like Ninety five and a hundred percent humidity so I go inside immediately I turn on BBC World news\nExpecting to see how are the bracket negotiations going you know Theresa May's over in Europe trying to save the deal and not have a hard breakfast blah blah blah\nAnd ah and of course we had a lot of pressure will be reporting and it is becoming increasingly clear that the number two in the secret services the fellow who ordered the interrogation the interrogation went wrong whether by designer intent\nThere's some horrific details out there put out by the Turkish media but look this is the yellow dog media of Europe I'm not going to trust them on the details will eventually get the forensics but\nLooks like the number two guy in Saudi Arabian intelligence or Tibet and uh\nThe question will be did he do so with the knowing approval of the crown prince and the king that's the only question will find that out but that's what I thought I Would say on BBC Breakfast and show gay instead they had a reporter in North Dakota\nNorth Dakota they said there is you know eight people per square mile and North Korea went through the whole North Dakota thing for more cows than people in North Dakota it's hard to find people to talk to about politics I said what in the world is the b._b._c. doing in North Dakota well Heidi hide camps\nOf sexual assault survivors and rape victims as well as miss naming people as rape victims has shattered her campaign\nChair with by twenty points and BBC was set up there to explain to Brits why Americans would be so upset over publishing a list of a hundred and twenty women many of whom were not sexual assault survivors or many of whom had not given their permission\nThere was like a tailspin and they spend a lot of time talking to Heidi Heitkamp supporters who are saying we're though so crass towards sorry she did it she's terrible I'm terrible we're all terrible yeah you are who thought that up and Heidi Heitkamp and fired anyone yet to my knowledge but she'd done she toast [noise]\nWhat was interesting is they didn't ask\nWill have any impact on any other candidate of course it should\nEvery Democrat in every race is attempting to exploit\nThe me too movement for democratic purposes that's what the cabinet hearings was all about\nWas the attempt to use a me too movement\nHarvey Weinstein Bill Cosby moment to smear him an innocent of that Bill Cosby and the generally turn into an attack on all man people like me people like you got nothing to do with this who conduct themselves a gentleman who brought up the right way\nWho have wives have thirty six years or Thirty years or twenty five years or Fifteen Years or ten years or one day from your water and trust and you got daughters\nAnd mothers and you do not act this way there's a there's a five percent of the population three percent I don't know creepy terrible horrible people Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby's among them\nAnd there are a lot of advice or survivors of sexual abuse and rape out there I Know some I represented one and it's a terrific how in different institutions are\nWhen abuses occurred\nBut that there's not a license Democrats\nTo turn everyone into a mob shouting me too at innocent people like Brett Kavanaugh\nOr in Heidi Heitkamp ... position to publish a list of people who are not victims of rape or sexual abuse or who did suffer that terrible assault and did not want to be publicly out it\nShe's got a bunch of list from a women's advocates groups around the state didn't check with the people that's Heidi Heitkamp\nTry you know what I punished Joe Donnelly for that by punished Claire McCaskill for that type punish a Bill Nelson for that I punish Joe mansion for that Joe mansion voted for cabinet but he didn't do so until it was over so we already had fifty one votes\nHe knows coming so he just decided to do I'd still vote for pat Morsi in Virginia over Joe Manchin mentioned about for the next one\nPortion of a ... vote for Ted Cruz of course you're going to vote for Josh Hawley over Claire McCaskill\nAnd the guys creeping up John James in Michigan I think were and they say still in the game but it it's that that will require Ohio to surprise away Kentucky surprised when they elected a Matt Bevin in the off year that was truly astounding or he was supposed to lose by five to seven any one by the same amount that's what\nRene she won't let you only to ten point air and the polls but John James up in single digits and rising I think he is the most interesting Senate candidate tied with Muslim exile in Arizona because they're fighters\nThere are veterans of combat they defended you they defended me with their lives Martha ... in the air and eight ten providing ground support for troops in combat\nOr first attack pilot fire attack pilot who was a woman in the air force history and a John James out of West point became an Apache pilot fought in Iraq and Afghanistan then then sadly is life took a bad turning out to the University of Michigan business school\nBut then again a successful entrepreneur in Detroit and I do not understand why we have not got stories everywhere about the the black guy up in Michigan who flies Apache attack helicopters went to West Point and has given Debbie Stabenow a run for the money you know why he would get paid or work every night on every show and nothing about John James\nBecause John James is black and a Republican in bed O'Rourke is white and a Democrat\nAnd the mainstream be is full of blue Barbara bubbles that like white Democrats in red states and they blow a lot of money and time on 'em and they really are afraid\nOf an African American like John James in Michigan they are afraid of John James ... if I if you get the Koch brothers or somebody\nI Would just pour ad after at into the televising marketed Detroit I'd go and try and get ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of the African American by the John ... yeah he's a Detroit kid who went to West Point he made good he went to Michigan we like that or less where you know Michigan State people like Alberta\nWhen John James can when you get behind that and I I get the sense that hedging I saw on BBC watching MSNBC now my my doing as you watch Jake Tapper at Fort Chuck Todd at five and Brett Baer at six\nThirty three best news programs there actually newsy Bab all points of views Jake Tapper for Chuck Todd at five\n... got time you're throwing the b._b._c.

they should be chased will show he's one of us one of my colleagues at the Washington Post and it's pretty bad story but it's profoundly not of interest to the average American voter who was looking

for the American way a mat during last go Allison rushing chose a summer position that the alliance defending freedom\nThen called the Alliance Defense fund that are now ATF is one of the far right leaning organization opposing algae ... quality church state separation abortion rights\nAnd the eleven years since she graduated law school she has continued to support the organization through its Blackstone legal fellowship which helped mentor in advance like minded lawyers I gotta tell ya I Love Alison rushing now more than I ever did\nWell we are uh you know pleased to see a great plate of judges overall being opened up there and I'm very excited and it's of any as well\nNo well tell me about did you ever work with Allison have you ever did you do you know or from your time as the

helped him get jobs they teach them up and originalism they help them with their careers they're everywhere but you're also on the hill Matt tell us what a ATF does on the hill\nThat there's a lot of work going on with a legislation the impacts religious liberty that impacts campus free speech in a variety of issues where\nPocket Lee consulted a without legal experts ... cases the Supreme Court and litigation across the country of what is the impact of these laws who are they going to help who are they going to hurt some bad laws out there and so we're asked to provide our legal guidance on these very important legislative issues with\nThat [laughter] so so how big is the center for legislative advocacy alliance defending freedom is quite vast they've got four thousand it's a way that attorneys I've already mentioned the Blackstone fellows they've got their alumni throughout the country but this particular center is focused on statutes in drafting how big is it\nThere's a handful of us that were working at not only that you know with policy group and allies on the hill but across the country with state policy groups that are fighting or religious freedom fighting for free speech and so again where they're helping them insulting them odd pieces of legislation in the legal impact\nOn just to get taken to a legal expertise and helping to ensure that the law why with those legal\nThey allowed some of your key people Matt Bowman went into the government of course ah my friend Carey went into the government you know Greg Scott went into the government and came out of the government or how you doing when the government wants your lawyers to go to work for him\nBut you know there is a strong group of people across the country many came out of our black program that are passionate about adding a religious freedom that we are blessed always have a strong ally of attorneys and others working with is\nJoining us that our work and so ah you know although we all wish well as with other physicians where we're always blessed to have a strong crop ready to jump in and take up the take up the battle with for religious freedom\nNow mantle and not mad at them and that sharp I'm Sorry about that I kind of think that the Supreme Court is going to find a way to get to the establishment clause quickly into finally brings who coherent said dean or when Sharon ski on the program earlier this week he's a man of the left he's the dean of the Berkeley law school which is a left leaning place\nHe said he expected the new majority to articulate a rule that goes back to the original intention the public attention intention of the constitutional conventions ratifying the federal convention and they came out of Philadelphia\nWhich is we will not have one religion in the United states and we will not have overt financial support for religious institutions and everything else like crosses in graveyards\nThat's just fine how are you as optimistic\nAs um ... pessimistic because he's not happy with that but I sure am\nYeah I think the the crack in the existing establishment clause just put it into starting to show that\nPop up in a variety of context I think at some point the court is going to have to grapple with these issues and I think we're we're optimistic about the district instruction is that are on the court and a third jurisprudence on those issues and that hopefully the correct some of the laws that have been\nI started into that establishment clause cases over the years\nThat are you getting worried about winning too much you won jak told to master piece of cake choppy one Lutheran schools you won a ... that's been going back to Washington state a chief Cochran got one point two million dollars I saw a picture of him with David Cortland

Colorado and after they get\nA set of liberty is the title vigilant than I think it just demonstrates we can never sit back and just left on the west it's an ongoing battle because we know that just like the Colorado GOP their jak with all of these other situations they finally attacked religious freedom and free speech\nThat's why we need alliance defending freedom match sharp from the center

Infantry Division that were slaughtered\nIn a in the great war hundred years old then there are a hundred years and they won and the fourth circuit they won\nIt's unbelievable but that will go up to

Heidi Heitkamp campaign\nHas collapsed what do you think\nWell I wouldn't to include that you I mean we've got two weeks left and we have to work very hard I liked the position that Josh how he is in I think he's hitting the right means and I think he has the momentum but we got to work all the way we're\nWell of course I don't know I watch the b._b._c. world news last night and when the b._b._c. world news goes to North Dakota and declare the Heidi Heitkamp a campaign over that's kind of early warning signal of collapsed I don't want anyone to stop doing anything 'cause their congressional races as well\nBut I Do look at the poor video there aren't people at a rally there's just no energy and she voted against Kavanaugh\nYeah I think for a vote has hurt her a lot in the state I think Josh has left a message is getting through in what you he's he's new he's fresh she has integrity and I think people trust him so\nIn addition you he always had a name identification gap and there was always going to be true as that gap shrunk that he was going to get stronger and I think we're seeing that now\nWouldn't Claire McCaskill said Jim Talent that she was writing off he'll what was she talking about\nThe Boot Hill of Missouri a which is by the way some of the best the farmland in the country because it's built the country\nAnd uh what she's saying is she doesn't think she's going to run very well there are ... I think he's going to run really well where she's going to try and win by Karen in St Louis and Kansas City very heavily that's typically the formula I don't think it's going to work here I think Josh is going to run well all over the state\nLike you know we're not talking about uh ten point you know election probably blow you up it is it says ... year as city I've ever seen I mean I I just it's it's hard to make for ... even two weeks out\nBut I Hope you go over and play our mid term madness the gym because I think it is I'm getting more and more comfortable with the Senate races knowing which way they'll break and I'm very encouraged by Jim John James soaring in Michigan oh you can close that gap but I'm pretty pretty comfortable about it now\nJurors I'm watching the New Jersey to other\nOil yeah man does this fall and because I mean that's really a heavy burden to be carrying and this year to have been prosecuted as he was and their mom money\nInto that too you know\nTo get their ... their panic special counsel Mueller here's expected to issue findings in the core aspects of his Russia probe soon after the November midterms\nNow I have a I have a problem with this story being out there I have a problem with a leak either one exonerated the president or one uh blasting the president or this is not what justice should be doing it would be disastrous for justice if this report comes up before the election agree or disagree Jim Talent\nNow I agree uh it it would be disastrous to leak something of this is an election or not I mean you I mean they ought to they need to hold any confidence until they can present the full report everybody can read it I think it's going to find anything I've never believed there was collusion with the Russians\nYou know they got in a Ford and some others with some unrelated things\nBut I never thought there was glued on going to be shocked if they find it\nBut I I and I expect the president be exonerated but I still think it would be banned from the bureau and the department if they leak that before the election it will it will be just like coal me coming to the to the microphone about Hillary during twenty sixteen they got to get these high profile investigation off the cycle of politics yeah here\nIt would be bad you maybe they've been compromised in the last couple of years I mean it's it was terrible and I think Sessions' is is moving I'm not with regard to this 'cause he's recused himself but I think\nHe is the director are trying to to clean up the top levels of the euro\nAnd the department to try and get all it takes out of there it's essential you're right this is a huge structural question and I don't mean by that downgraded I mean it's very or the people I have confidence in the integrity of the department and the bureau to operate now politically so you're right this would be this would be another huge problem along those lines\nI Do not expect um attorney general sessions last much after the election I'm hoping Michael ... replaces them a mostly they're becoming a lot but I Need your quick comment on my pond pale going to turkey and Saudi Arabia\nA big Clinton's comments he said I don't want to talk about the facts trying to make them look bad what he says I was talking about the fact they want to talk about back 'cause we don't know what the facts are yet that's what he said and that's exactly what he should have said Jim Talent\nYes and we don't know what the facts are you know you've been reading and I've been reading that Danny but it had a good article today on the on the Web site actually was from yesterday\nThat we don't know I mean yes there was there was clearly Saudi involvement in this we don't know what factions in the Saudi Government were responsible or yeah\nWe we need to continue to be able to work with Saudi Arabia in the region and that's the things that the president and a A R R balancing and they certainly don't want to try and strike that balance till they know what so yeah we got to try and find out what happened then we got to try and do this sort of way where we stand up for what's right\nI'm Eric I'm old is your high Canada\nI'm In Tampa and today I made sixty the answer will be doing an event tonight if you want to come on out and joined us tickets available on the answer Tampa dot com\nIt's a dead heat and who is your land and I am joined by my for on the Republican nominee for the United States Senate businessmen extraordinary is faced off against Joe Donnelly the incumbent Democrat who both elected Chuck Schumer\nThe leader and who voted and for again spread ... to me Joe Donnelly voted against Brett Kavanaugh Mike Braun welcome to the program or there's new poll shows daddy\nJay art or the momentum that we've got since the uh oh Kavanaugh episode has been measure of all that I Know in that I didn't know was there a reason for all that just came out that you are\nYeah the apple is being in a star round the real clear politics in shows you and Joe and the margin of error and it shows the libertarian was seven percent that always makes me crazy\nWhen liberty suicide these elections what are your city or libertarian friends out there about how important it is if they really care about freedom they got to vote for the guy who's going to support the originalist judges not not Donnelly but broaden\nExactly and so much of a what libertarians believe in and Republicans outlying up but I think they just need to realize that\nUh if you really want your vote count bring it over to my side I've lived my life was alive read up on the enterprise that that I think as they you know start scratching their heads here they are under three weeks now there'll be coming my direction at\nThat real clear politics to average just falls I think to get that result that I can tell yours out there are the ones we really pay attention to our own and we do um you know weekly through the finish line at a much better news that the Kavanaugh a\nEpisode when Donald declared that he was going to vote\nAgainst the judge or early on and they got in and reaffirmed it uh we feel really good with a structural lead that we're going to be taking into these final three weeks that\nI it was unbelievable what a difference that base because they really were white or in that particular race in a few others orders that differentiating factor and that was that your weight your talent from the moment almost he became a click on it at a\nGrassroots folks and just the cost or or disappointed with it\nWell it was it was a disaster for Donnelly because Indiana supported cabinet late but we've them\nAnd I know they are seen the average so as a man but I don't think they've got the cabinet bump in here and I think that bump across the country has been seven eight sometimes ten points Mike Braun because people woke up and said my gosh the future of the courts the future of our liberties backdoor libertarian friends\nOur First Amendment freedoms of speech and religion are are are right to be free of our property being taken without a compensation our Second Amendment right they're all on the
