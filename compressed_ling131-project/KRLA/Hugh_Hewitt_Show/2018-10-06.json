{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "You just have to pick and choose your battles and\nAnd this is a bit of the challenge of what this country is dealing with right now\nA boy I'll tell you we have been taken on quite a roller coaster of subjects or if it was in Russia the twenty sixteen election or the Mueller pro and here we are dealing with judge Kavanaugh but meanwhile there are real\nSerious issues that affect us on a daily basis I mean think about it for just a moment\nHow 'bout kids in foster care are you ready to stand in the gap for kids in foster care well Dr Sharon ... joins us now issues with focus in the family nationally recognized child welfare ... a welfare consultant and the retired manager for a\nPermanent sea services for the Colorado Department of Human Services in the division of child welfare services she is the former president of the national association of state adoption programs and the association of administrators for the interstate compact\nOn adoption of medical assistance Dr Ford welcome to bill Martinez live our him\nOh thank you glad to be with you today\nWell great to have you here as I said in the intro I'm it's easy for\nUs to get distracted with so much hyperbole and emotions flying around our country right now but we we've got kids in foster care that need help doing not\n[noise] we do actually there's over four hundred thousand children across the nation that are in foster care and many of those children are right there in the backyard of the our listeners\nExactly what you think about what these kids are going through I'm fairly miserable young lives these kids in foster care and not all but most\nUh some with a biological parents who are you in jail on drugs or abusive [noise] um you know it's rare that they get a a a happy or a joyous memory is it not\n[noise] you know there are so many challenges that kids have faced as they entered the foster care system and you said at their parents have gotten addicted to drugs or alcohol they have fallen on really hard time saying that struggle\nAnd children and I had been abandoned they've been neglected and some of them yes even accused\nHaving so No Child should have to be living here that in this day and age\nExactly what kind of fair shot to they have it life if this is the way they were raised in and their parents are dealing with this and you know what are the chances of that they ended up like their parents\nYou know the fair shot is this that government and their narrow\nIt's supposed to protect the children so when they remove them from their challenge towns it's the government's responsibility to recruit families to care for them because the government\nCan't shouldn't raise children and so who are those families courageous who are sitting in the few that let's say yes to God\nAnd become foster parents so that the children couldn't be nurtured and loved on provided structure and guidance and had an opportunity to heal while their parents are getting the help that they need\nSome time soccer forward people are unrealistic about the reach of government\nAnd this is what gets government in trouble is that we all have a link to play in solving this problem and a lame to be and then this is what I Am seeing more and more and when government gets outside of its lane like any of us can do it anytime 'cause we see something as good observation wrong conclusion kind of thing\nAnd uh we meddle into things and sometimes we give the government too much credit and when that happens and we think that the government is going to be your daddy avoid it just opens up all kinds of problems does it not\n[noise] that's why government's role is to actually set a narrow lane it's about safety and protection and recruiting families to care for children um until the government can stay in its lane and the church and the community would step up and play the critical role that they can play\nIt makes all the difference in the world and the life of a child\nWill darker forward the church has been discouraged to play a role is you know because uh all under the guise of separation of church and state\nUh you know the government can't be perceived as supporting a ... you know any kind of face or you know anything that has to do with religion\nBut this is the big live it's been perpetrated on our culture and meanwhile it is a our kids are our future for tomorrow's it's all being compromise all because of the bogeyman of religion\n[laughter] you ... do you tell the truth there that um sometimes government struggles to realize that there are rich pockets\nOf families and all of their community who couldn't make a difference in the lives of these children if the government would open the door and say you know what let's focus on the children these children need to be nurtured in ... but of families come through the process\nTo become foster parents so that they cannot only live on that child but how love on that first family who is struggling and going through their treatment needs something maybe ... because we know a God that redeem\nMaybe those children to go back home to their birth families um but at the church would step up\nAnd as late as you said they tried and the government would say yeah well yes we want to access these rich pockets of families who can love on kids love on those birth family and so that they were being any more children maybe having the opportunity to go home\n[laughter] are you going to tell me doctor I Know you're not going to tell me this maybe it's more rhetorical this question but as a people or people of a secular rise mindset are more equipped to teach morality than people who have face\n[noise] I think that that's an interesting question and I I Can't tell you that I've ever studied it\nBut I can tell you is that um people who share values about children all along and families and that they were back that um that children deserve structure that children need to know who they are\nUm and who they are the children need an opportunity to have an education that is rich with all kinds of opportunities for how the experiences that I'm\nChallenge their minds and and helped to shape and grow them in the image of Kool Aid you know should be that as long as we have a level playing field than children will do better um then then by folks like want to skew with that picture should look like\nWell I think people need to appreciate that with God you don't have a level playing field it's to your advantage to say that I have two points real clear in terms of empirical evidence let's take a look at the school system in the sixties we decided the ten commandments was irrelevant we needed to get it out of there\nWe've got it out of there and look what happened to our school system has been absolutely decimated is there any correlation with the uh you know since we took God out of schools is there any correlation to the effectiveness of the education system today\nI think our school system has diminished um has gotten off track their teaching things in school today that they would have never taught in the sixties seventies and eighties\nAnd nineties for that matter and because our kids are kicking down bunny trails about things that really aren't relevant about them being able to um reading writing and arithmetic and not knowing how to be social and be kind to one another ... needs to\nBack to being an values based\nUm educational system that we can grow and learn and kicking butt commandments out of the school somewhere on what's now show not kill now shall not steal your mother and father\nWell it's wrong what goes basic structures that helped shape at school we are as people\nWill because when you take that out of the uh out of the marketplace and and the\nArea of debate then you have what's on display in our country today the dismembered meant a of individuals' the disrespect of individuals and of course we're not going to talk about sixty million aborted babies are in terms of a lack of respect for life\nAnd you have women today because of their claim that it's their body\nUm another big lie this being thrust upon women but to many women understand that ah it's more than just their body especially if they're married\nOr you know that's a whole nother conversation but Dr Ford I you know imagine for just a moment focus of the focus on the family with all the great work that they do and support and everything\nIt focus on the family was secular rise to what would that organization look like\nWe wouldn't be the organization we are today\nWithout all on so many levels on so many levels the ideas that are in Dr Daley\nAt all and you know the team come up with a you know the support system everything is just so wonderful and I'm sure\nThe gym daily would tell you uh the guy gets all the glory that it is God and but for God focus on the family would not be in existence\nWe wouldn't you know we stand for biblical principles and writes is right we don't agree to disagree but we agree on this principle that God is God\nCatch my program each weekday morning alive six to nine AM and on demand twenty four seven learn more at ...\nDot com [noise] what a week in the beltway\nThat makes our typical partisan politics looked like a play around the stage but for the eyes of the country this week ugly uncaring crash do come near to what transpired in a new phase of judge Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing it was an effort in and it's sort of ... the as soon as I argued over at the Washington Post this week\nThe Democrats will ultimately share the credit proceeding to ruin the lives of Brett Kavanaugh and his family likely is accuser Christine Blasey Ford Elite media outlets that their part in the facilitates the allegations the Washington Post and the New Yorker and then it was something of a free for all\nOne qualified legal observer professor Alan Dershowitz retired now from Harvard law school a lifelong liberal now moving somewhere near the center laid waved to the Democrats cynical miscarriage of this confirmation proceedings my colleague Dennis Prager took a closer look\nLet me read to you from Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz\nAnd his description of what is happening\n... denied the appointment it will be because he has been depicted as a sexual predator who deserves contempt origin impossible imprisonment\nHe may no longer be able to teach law coach sports or expect to be treated respectfully she could be forced to resign as current traditional position because having the coat convicted unquote rapist on the bench was unseemly\nFor these reasons he now has the right perhaps not a legal rights butter right based on fundamental fairness to have the charges against him put to the test of clear and convincing evidence or some standard close to that\nA judge Kavanaugh been rejected an ideological professional grounds before the sordid accusations were leveled he could go back to his life Robert Bork did but if the Senate fails to confirm him now his life will never be the same\nBut this is no longer about who would make the best Supreme Court justice is about the most fundamental issue affair and issues of fairness this country has faced since the McCarthy Era\nThe American civil liberties union stood strong against McCarthyism by demanding due process and hard evidence but the ACLU now argues that quote unresolved questions regarding credible allegations of sexual assault unquote\nBe resolved against the accused nominee but we now live in an age that risks a new form of sexual McCarthyism we must not go to that even darker place darker than McCarthyism liberal Democrats Harvard law professor\nDarker than McCarthy has\nEven know if you read the report of racial Mitchell for woman who seems to have asked you know ... very on challenging questions\nThe wall Street Journal published her entire analysis I can only provide bunny assessment of Dr forwards allegations in a legal context\nIn the legal context here's my bottom line hey he said she said taste is incredibly difficult to prove this case is even weaker than that\nThis is from Rachel Mitchell pay a prosecutor of sex crimes duck the Fort identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or fail to corroborate that\nI Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee newer or nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of the evidence then to understand the difference folks\nThere there is the standard beyond reasonable doubt but outside of the legal world all you need is ... I think in the ... ... ... if I'm not mistaken in civil suits\nThe preponderance of evidence standard that's different from beyond reasonable doubt just ... but it doesn't even meet the preponderance of evidence\nThat Republicans seem to show absolutely turn acidic user and giving deference to the wavering members in his own caucus delayed the confirmation one no\nOne week the FBI mated visual anywhere\nWe guys with the second ranking Republican in the United States Senate and also a member of the Judiciary Committee John Cornyn also formerly a Texas Supreme Court justice\nNow if in fact we get word that the FBI is done and that shouldn't all center as well have the report it's okay to file the notion of cloture because that's just thirty hours of debate people will have plenty of time to read the report\nThat's right down to the Senate rules there will be at least a an intervening day or the other words you filed today tomorrow intervening day and then the vote cloture vote wouldn't be until the following day so there'll be plenty of time for centers to read the FBI's a supplemental background investigation\nSenator I represented the victim of a sexual assault on a major college campus I Can't say more because of confidentiality I'm very sympathetic to victims because the institution that America has not yet adopted to deal with these but that they're changing nevertheless I'm a lawyer like you and I know one\nThe fear of flying narrative that was given to the committee that simply wasn't true it wasn't given by her I was getting by the lawyers her ex boyfriend has filed an affidavit saying she has some millionaire with polygraph inconsistent with their testimony testimony and this is a lawyer deal\nBut not contain a single verifiable assertion nor one that could be disproven that are very rare and then we have the Rachel Mitchell Report are there are problems with her testimony\nWell there are some lives as well a ritual Mitchell a\nWho was retained by the committee to question Dr Ford um and I thought that a very professional job but I thought she got the basic facts out the demonstrated that there are gaps I understand the victims of of trauma can have memory lapses and it's hard to reconstruct things after thirty five years but\nI just don't think and I think the American people don't believe that uncorroborated allegations should be enough to condemn or a nominee\nSo let's go to the last issue which is Jerry ... Adler the incoming chairman of the house Judiciary Committee if the Democrats take the house\nSays he will hold each month pushing I say bring those on because they will be laughing stocks about Seventy rule I just got into it she said Brett Kavanaugh why I said he absolutely did not lie about drinking he did not lie about devil's triangle people who say that don't understand what perjury is are lying is your assessment a senator\nWell I think it's this has gotten a ridiculous absurd we're talking about in prison as high school yearbook whether he threw ice on somebody at some point in the past um I think they've been unsuccessful and attacking the judges credibility\nAnd feel like a now they're off on this wild goose chase and uh the goalposts says five\nFriend the majority leader like say a after continued to move out but it's time to vote\nHere's what Lindsey Graham said on Fox News last night cut number Fifteen what about these red state Democrats I think their toes\nAll of them all up all the little\nPolitically anybody I Know the only people that are open ... even now senator\nCornyn Joni Ernst agreed with that do you agree with that\nI I agree uh because I think I'm In these red states that President Trump carried I think that uh I think the judicial apps are on I think the Senate candidates incumbents running or looking at their own polls in our polls are confirming what was he just said\n... has the national Republican Senatorial Committee come back and confirmed that to\nA duck Cory Gardner who's the chairman this\nThere is a is basically confirmed\nThat you know I think something very big is going on and I've been doing this show since two thousand I've been doing radio since Nineteen Ninety nothing compares to the ... rejection of McCarthyism directed at\nBrett Kavanaugh nothing and I think it's because of his kids why because if they are being so badly injured and I'm just picking twenty thirty forty years from now people will throw this out them and judge Kavanaugh knows that and that's why he's angry what do you think should recorded\nI don't blame him for being angry and this this ridiculous ... allegation that the judge will somehow be a partisan or heard not display the appropriate temperament on the bench\nThis man has been slandered he's been accused of multiple times and he felt it was important to defend his good name and I I thought I thought he handled it appropriately\nThere were a couple of times where I think well one time in particular where he asked the judge or should or corporate charter question he came back and apologize for that and I think that was the right thing to do\nWhat he shouldn't be expected just to take a business slander these allegations are\nCriminal conduct and ruining his reputation and good name and damage he goes family anybody in that position who feels like they've been falsely accused I think would be angry and be justified and I'm a showing some of that anger\nLast question senator I I Know that some people might be obliged them good shape because of the FBI report not to vote for um judge cabinet I I think it will be a huge mistake unless they're direct corroborating evidence from what I also believe a Republican doesn't support him his or her\nCareer done as a Republican I've never seen the base this way is that the general sense in the cockroach\nWhile I think you'll see overwhelming support in the caucus for ah for the judge\nUs MCA workplace NAFTA which dates back\nTo the mid nineties Larry Elder joined us even more of the Heritage Foundation will pick up their interview with more\nLet's switch huge victory for Donald Trump I mean we've got a new now so modernized now but by the way I always thought that there was a pretty good thing I mean it unified a North American continent or Canada Mexico and the United states and but it needed to be modernized there were a lot of things in and out there that were out of date or unfair and you know Trump\nHad a big big for your first you got Mexico to sign on and that is\nThe screws on Canada and they made some real concessions cheer Larry that they didn't want to they didn't want to make and now they're sets up very nicely for negotiating you know the big big deal it's going to come up with China because they they are the worst or you know abusers of portrayed laws and on the planet\nOne other quick thing Larry I was there at the rose garden when Donald Trump\nGot his past outbreaks of one of the points you made as you said look I Want to use these tariffs has a negotiating tactic to get these other countries to reduce their tariffs on us and I have to say you may not agree with a tactic but what is it working because these countries are reducing Dr\nSteven a review of the congressional budget office\nSays it NAFTA increased economic prosperity for all three countries and the University of Chicago survey of ... Ninety six percent agreed are strongly agree that on average Americans have been better off close but with NAFTA than the previous trade deals so when President Trump's keep calling it the worst trade deal ever don't you have a problem with that\nI did it you know and I told them I disagreed with him on that I think you know I actually helped jobs now they're back in Nineteen Ninety three or Ninety four when we originally factor when Bill Clinton was president we got the Republican Congress to vote for\nTrump also had a point that it could be approved or the best of all worlds you know in my opinion we have a new free trade agreement is now called the U. S. M. C. A. we're not going to call NAFTA any longer\nBut it is a new on North American free trade agreement that will open up orders are between all three countries is modernized because America has a better deal\nAnd so I look I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nUm my understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why is that why is it a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing minimum wage out another country right and that's one of the things I don't like about this deal so there you got me on that one that's not you\nKnow we ... we want to go to have a twenty dollar minimum wage that would put a lot of Mexican workers out of out of business so that that's one of the things I think is bad economics in this plan by so I'm going to agree with you on that\nOne so on par though this deal lower tariffs and barriers are up for a candidate has imposed against us and Louis ... and barriers that Mexico imposed against us in general\nNot just otherwise just one quick thing or not just terrorists but also there were a lot of you know as you know we talked about this on your show before war and more what Americans producers called intellectual property we his computer software we've\nGotten some copyright so bad that acknowledging each and when it comes to some of these countries like Canada and some ... and certainly trying on\nAnd many other countries and Asian countries they just steal our intellectual property and this new uh I'll call it the U.S a CNA has much better protections\nFor not America's intellectual property so countries are going to use our products they actually pay for them\nTo the entire interview with economists even more on telling all review dot com telling a\nMillion dollars of taxpayer money went to prepare religions America's religion for the discovery of extraterrestrial\nLife sounding the alarm on your credit ... women tell all review return the Roman\n\nBrett Kavanaugh will most likely be confirmed to the next justice the swing vote similar vital to his\nThat's been worse secured yesterday there were the votes of Maine Republican Susan Collins said West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin colon says Kevin I wasn't titled to be presumed innocent\nSenate confirmation side to side but signing nano legal battle you press the presumption of innocence and can do here on my thinking\nThe full Senate will vote on Kavanaugh as appointment this weekend the city council is approved a proposal to fund the city's portion of a temporary homeless shelter\nTo be located on west ...

the dark as we've witnessed on Capitol Hill this past week we saw some light on Thursday shining on a very appropriate place you're talking about our stores elementary and middle schools high schools all across the country was bring your Bible to school they might say on a colleague Joe Walsh Jim valley of broke us on the family\nEducate in the late ... what is bring you in the school that\nWe started this five years ago we had eight thousand children the first year participate last year we have five hundred and fifty two thousand allow\nChildren participate it's the elementary school junior high high school even college kids both from public schools as well as Christian schools but it's just to set aside a day to kind of flex your religious liberty McGough a little bit and then there is this is totally constitutional\nTo simply bring your Bible to school and read it and nobody can take it away that's\nOne of the great things about living in America but oftentimes a school administrator or a teacher will come up and say hey you can't do that it's illegal right have a one sheet from alliance defending freedom\nA people can print that at the website they give it to the teacher and I go oh okay it looks like it's a way to go ahead and that's typically have the day goes on in your face thing these now\nUh are usually pulling together a little table talk Bible study at lunch at school they're reading the book uh John or something if yeah self directed yeah so they do whatever they want to do but\nAt the website bring your Bible dot org we have ideas for youth pastors and test the teachers and parents on what to do\nGym if we've got families or even young people listening to us right now in their thinking this is a cool idea I mean how will they know if anybody else is bringing a Bible to school and and what they might be able to do\nThe power of just the freedom way out the shaming to say yeah I'm a Christian I'm bringing my Bible to school to be able to share with my friends during free time lunchtime\nA this is what I can do is a Christian in this country and here's the thing showed that always is frustrating for the those who might have posed this you know they talk about not shaming and the importance of no bowling and yet when children do this we'll get the reports of teachers and others who are really shaming the kids yeah\nWe have many reports were teachers or grabbing the Bible's putting them in their dad\nAnd telling the students they can't bring this to school that sounds like the Soviet everybody and it's so for these kids to be able to flex this religious liberty muscle in the United states it's completely constitutional by\nThe way the gym and where does your legal where does that come from the teachers and

display of face and they show intimidated\nThe public square in those in the public square that we tend to just fall in line to behave the way they want us to yeah but that's not America we know talk about our faith we can express our faith and that's the goal and bring your Bible to school\nUh the show boating by the Democratic senators um there was no you know there was there was no solid evidence that you can hold to to even the you know you kept saying you know I'm like I could go and kill give her the benefit of the doubt let's give her a lot of space I knew a lot of people were real sensitive\nAbout saying anything whatsoever hours the other night the president really caused to\nThe less brings to explode when he was a basically utilizing her testimony you know presenting the facts there as a campaign rally and you know the people didn't you know some on the left really didn't like it\nUh but I can tell you some on the right to you know the well it's it's not dishonest what he's saying you know it gets back to Trump's uh you you know his style and and his tone I guess\nWell and I think really what happened is he was saying out loud what an awful lot of people in a in a country what thinking exotic it was you know all the ... what's interesting to me it's the way this thing has shifted at you know your your listeners might be interested to know there's a website that in real time\nA site betting odds and when she began to pacify the odds of\nKavanaugh being ... from plummeted they went from pretty reasonable high odds are very high odds at all because everyone thought oh my gosh and by the way Chris Wallace on Fox sort of said this is you know he's totally speakers have such a good job\nAnd I wish I could I was shocked to Chris Wallace rolled I thought he ruled pretty quick on this I mean he went to any level I don't know just say\nEverybody was afraid to say anything other than that I think honestly but that what's interesting is when cabinets started beating the odds that right back up again so it truly by the end of the day was shaking his head\nA audience is generally found both unbelievable and so there we are again at no proof no evidence that allegation which\nIn a second and third generation to the point where the third with an audience quiet charging gang rape or they can't ludicrous and I think actually I think that any one individual I Would fight to individuals who really hurt the Democrats\nA quest chair wanted Dianne Feinstein because I think a lot of people that come here saying wait a minute she sat with us Matt in her office is good person\nOr again so highly respected et cetera and she never even asked him about these allegations how inhuman is bad I mean to me that's just plain that sets it honestly inconceivable the second person is Michael ... and for anyone that interested I wrote a piece about him\nI don't know ... weeks ago at the request of thought that I didn't know anything about the guy but I did a fair amount of research on it he is a horrible individual who and miss Taylor by every partner every white X Y every one is ever had this is where basically it it would have for\nChatting for doping now for dishonesty so people should look into this guy before they get all the time that day\nExactly will lose um were you surprised a\n... you know we're just like I mean he got hot box to his good friend in fact I wrote a column on this as well as I was concerned that\nYou know the last a week or so where ever since he got hot bucks by Chris Coons I think the Democratic leadership so whatever you do do not let him get out of your shadow you say hooked to his ship\nYou keep drumming him with [laughter] you know with the dialogue and ... you know he's kind of a he might be our insurance policy after everything is all said and done\nBut really it it seems that um you know just like to the country to favor\nBecause look at the numbers you know to your point now that the uh Best Buy this evidence background check has come out about this that doesn't you know it's still the same I mean there's no there's no big bomb coming out of this thing so far what we're hearing\nIs a look at the numbers I mean they have a ... than they are a dominant now to make sure that uh Kavanaugh gets confirmed\nYeah they ... the interesting thing too is a a polling and a lot of these swing state Senate races where I think the Democrats are pretty charged up and now they're ... they're charged up so you know look at some of them ... looks in trouble seriously a hike Catholic gone oh she's hassle\nI think it's a serious trouble ah they kinda go down the list and there's really been a shift in some cases you know almost double digits in the last week or two as people look at this and say hey you know what having a Republican Senate is incredibly important to what I Want to have accomplished that country\nAnd by the way it Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed which chair point I think it will be a ... there's also a cat that there's a lot of justice\nTape it comes to bail and particularly if Donald Trump actually elected\nIn ... we have to go through with another justice than that\nI I think it won't even be as hysterical at this time because this time what people need to remember is the paper said well why didn't Gorsuch had such a big problem well Gorsuch was taking her

it's just um you know again it's he said she said a is we've been saying here I take great exception\nTo the idea of the use of the term credible and it was like wait a minute you guys are some people you know most of you graduated from college but first good number of you are attorneys and we understand what you do with the English language already you already make up words and do all that if you think not talked to a court reporter\nFor up to take the patient and uh you know it's quite comical dear friend of mine uh many years ago it was a court reporter\nAnd she would tell me the stories of ah these attorneys and the words they would make up and it was their job to straighten it out and to interpret what it was um you know and we're adding to the language [noise] but um you know the thing is is that and even the attorneys no credible means\nCredible means there's evidence it means that it is a ... it's more than believable but it's believable based on facts based on evidence not on emotion not on a somebody being able to\nPerform as we've talked about a very believable in that you know in that starring role that she played and um but uh that's one thing but to save somebody is credible especially when you're talking about something like this and the and the idea that this is not a court of law yes that's true because let me tell you if it was a court of law\nAt least none of these cases would have come before the court they just throwing it out and that was my big question early on look at it this big violation is taking place why didn't Dr Ford\nTake it to the city take it to the city officials take it to the police and say look at it hey I'm you know that that this memory is come back which is you know that's a whole nother\nA consideration in the legal parlance of a a a recovered memory in terms of it's about a validity but nonetheless okay uh she goes in and present their case\nThat's where it should have been presented not in the court of public opinion and here it is she comes in and you know as we've all I I think we're in agreement\nThat something probably happened to Dr Ford you know I'll give her that benefit\nSomething may have happened to her but the stories and ... you know just not connecting as well you know based on her own testimony forget about what Donald Trump said the other night at the campaign rally a ... that's that's a side\nI mean basically echo there he did it in his own you know let Trump the Trump kind of mode which uh it's just you know causing heads to blow up and they've been blowing up since he was elected and twenty sixteen\nSo you know I don't know what are the Democrats or even a members of the Republican Party or thinking it's like look at sixty two million people voted Donald Trump in and one of the main motivators was the control of the Supreme Court\nSo it's a sad a sad situation that you have even some Republicans who are questioning the boats are sixty two million people and I will tell you one way or another ah but especially if it goes against judge Kevin I'm a wait and see what will happen\nRepublicans will come out and mass I Know that you're hearing statement said oh the women you know they're they're against you know yes I mean if you take a segment of society and women and you look at the\nThe numbers here but but look at the numbers of what Donald Trump's able to generate and the numbers that Amy Schumer is able to generate or even Murphy Brown they had to rebuild and Murphy Brown would like to laugh it was zero and of course former secretary of State Hillary Clinton was there some would say well it's all her fault\nNo it's it's a Murphy Brown I mean it's just not\nIt's not that good a show and it's like oh ... you know um and didn't didn't pull compared to you know when Roseanne didn't hurry boat I I think it was like five six times as much as what a ... you know the ... of Murphy Brown brought you know ... people are tired of this stuff\nYou know a liberalism okay and has its place a little bit of flavor but we're over done you know ... it's just too much flavor and uh we're getting tired of a tasting liberalism at every turn\nAnd especially when you have what's going on with the Trump Administration right now unemployment again [laughter]\nYou know it just keeps getting lower didn't get to the boy I mean already we have more jobs in people but what are we going to do and it's a you know we're in a you know zero percent you know that everybody is working what a concept a but not to mention you know who the other things that are\n... you know economically that are taking place\nBut look at at at the heart of all this mainstream America realized that we were in trouble\nAnd that if we continued on with policies have Brock Obama and the socialist and the socialist movement\nThen we're going to be in really serious trouble it's going to be your recoverable I mean we're already trying to chop down Twenty one trillion dollars in debt\nCan't shouldn't raise children and so who are those families courageous who are sitting in the few\nThat would say yes to God and become foster parents so that the children could be nurtured and love Don provided structure and guidance hum and had an opportunity to heal while their parents are getting the help that they need\nSome time soccer forward people are unrealistic about the reach of government\nAnd this is what gets government in trouble is that we all have a link to play in solving this problem handling to be and then this is what I Am seeing more and more and when government gets outside of its lane like any of us can do it anytime 'cause we see something that's good observation wrong conclusion kind of thing\nAnd uh we meddle into things and sometimes we give the government too much credit and when that happens and we think that a government is going to be your daddy boy that just opens up all kinds of problems does it not\n[noise] that's why government's role is to actually set a narrow lane it's about safety and protection and\nRecruiting families to care for children um until the government can stay in its lane and the church and the community would step up and play the critical role that they can play it makes all the difference in the world and the life of a child\nWill darker forward the church has been discouraged to play a role as you know because uh all under the guise of separation of church and state\nUh you know the government can't be perceived as supporting a ... you know any kind of face or you know anything that has to do with religion but this is the big live it's been perpetrated on our culture and meanwhile is ah our kids are our future for tomorrow's\nIt's all being compromise all because of the bogeyman of religion\n[laughter] you eat do you tell the truth there that um sometimes government struggles to realize that there are rich\nPockets of families and all of their community who could make a difference in the lives of these children if government would open the door and say you know what let's focus on the children these children need to be nurtured and a\nLot of families come through the process\nTo become foster parents so that they cannot only live on that child but help love on that first family who is struggling and going through their treatment needs something maybe ... because we know a God that redeem\nMaybe those children can go back home to their birth families um but at the church would step up\nAnd as they as you said they tried and if the government would say yes\nYes we want to accept these rich pockets of families who can love on kids love on those birth family and so that they were being many more children maybe having the opportunity to go home\n[noise] are you going to tell me doctor I Know you're not going to tell me this maybe it's more rhetorical this question but the uh people or people of a secular rise mindset are more equipped to teach morality than people who have face\n[noise] I think that that's an interesting question and I I Can't tell you that I've ever studied it\nBut I can tell you it's that um people who share values about children all along and families and that they were ... that um that children deserve structure that children need to know who they are\nUm and who they are the children need an opportunity to have an education that is rich with all kinds of opportunities for how the experiences that I'm\nChallenge their minds and and helped to shape and grow them in the image of Kool Aid you know should be that as long as we have a level playing field than children will do better\nUm then then by folks might want to skew with that picture should look like\nWell I think people need to appreciate that with God you don't have a level playing field it's to your advantage I Will say that I have two points real clear in terms of empirical evidence let's take a look at the school system in the sixties we decided the ten commandments was irrelevant we needed to get it out of there\nAre we've got it out of there and look what happened our school system has been absolutely decimated is there any correlation with the uh you know since we took God out of schools is there any correlation to the effectiveness of the education system today\nI think our school system has diminished um has gotten off track their teaching things in school today that they would have never taught in the sixties seventies and eighties\nAnd nineties for that matter [noise] um and because our kids are kicking down bunny trails about things that really aren't relevant about them being able to um reading writing and arithmetic and not knowing how to be social and be kind to one another ...\nBack to being a values based\nUm educational system that we can grow and learn I'm kicking butt commandments out of school so Ron let's now shall not kill now shall not steal on of your mother and father\nWell that's wrong with those basic structures that helped shape who we are as people\nWill because when you take that out of the uh out of the marketplace and and the\nArea of debate then you have what's on display in our country today the dismembered meant a of individuals the disrespect of individuals and of course we're not going to talk about sixty million aborted babies are in terms of a lack of respect for life\nAnd you have women today because of their claim that it's their body\nUm another big live as being thrust upon women but to many women understand that ah it's more than just their body especially if they're married or you know that's a whole nother conversation but Dr forward\nI imagine for just a moment focus of the focus on the family with all the great work that they do and support and everything it focus on the family was secular rise what would that organization look like\nWe wouldn't be the organization we are today\nWithout all on so many levels on so many levels the ideas that are in Dr Daley at all and you know the team come up with a\nYou know the support system everything is just so wonderful and I'm sure the gym daily would tell you I'm the guy gets all the glory that it is God and buzz for God\nFocus on the family would not be in existence we wouldn't\nYou know we stand for biblical principles and writes is right we can agree to disagree but we agree on this principle that God is God\nAnd there is none other and when his principles say that really I'm walking love our ministry walks in love with God people I can tell you I don't like your behavior but I Love you as a person ... and got on earth that we we're our God\nHonoring organization and we seem to really focus on helping\nFamilies do right by their kids that's why our our parenting program\nHas so much information from our club junior magazine to club magazine to our [noise] our brio magazine having our marriage programs we what marriage is to try to have that I'm going to make sure that they need

down for a hundred points\nWell on days like that like back in February you know Goldman Sachs had the two hundred million dollar day on a down day just like that right so one of the things I Love it though I was just getting started off onto with with my point is I Love being a part of these happy classes and being able to really introduce people to how to make money as the markets go down\nSo they don't have to fear the bear right you don't have to be afraid of a bearish market bears markets just like Bush markets are great opportunities to make money and even\nEven sometimes greater opportunities to make money because er which would speed the market goes down\nIt's that whole fear and greed pits principal the up markets are driven by greed the down markets are driven by fear that you know I I remember asking a class once you know which which which a motion was more powerful fairer agreed\nAnd I have to say I I I think it's greed and we chatted about it because most of the clock thought it was fear and one of the points that I came to was if it was greed everybody would do everything in their power nothing nothing would ever standing anybody's way of making money but it ends up being fear 'cause the fear of the unknown the fear of trying something new\nConsistently stands and the way of people's people's ability to make more money and it gets back to your point of that is why most people go out and they just get another job rather than generating another stream of income like passively are actively via the markets because that's a safe zone they already have a job to get another job well it's not the most appealing thing\nIt's a little more safer for our psyche so those are some of the things we help our students overcome a so I Love that you went down\nShorting path there because that is a great way to make money as the markets are going down and one of the things that we could do to help get a few people get started really being able to see the opportunity and embarrassed market is we've got a big stack of tickets here that we are going to give away today where you say we pull a couple of these out and we give them a waste of our listeners get some people educated [noise]\nAll right well right now we've got to have to a class coming up in your area and at the\nHalf the class and really it online training academy ... we focus on generating income as the marks growing up in the markets are going down but the half day classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to be able to do that\nNow the half the class there about three hours long your investment is going to be three hours of your time to come in and raise that financial like you to help you get better returns in the market in just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you're driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top constructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional inside of it makes it so you can get started\nNow ... when he did a call now and\nReserved those seats the number is eight seven seven four zero three eight seven to three that's eight seven seven four zero three eight seven to three if you end up\nBeing colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nLarry as we start to kind of continue down this path of making money in multiple directions we've got the up market we've got the down market you know what are some of the hurdles people have to overcome we touched on a few minutes ago as far as the Bush by us that we already have is being consumers\nMaybe maybe you could take that into it into a ... expand on that ... for our listeners and even even anything else that you work with or that you deal with when you're working with new students whether they have twenty years' experience or their brand new to the markets on how they really can structure things to make sure they're poised to profit of the markets are coming down\nGreat question right and the number one mistake that most people make when it comes to trading are investing is they try to do it on their own\nThey don't get themselves educated said no it's okay I'll do it on my own and eventually maybe I'll get around some education the problem is it's a very costly lesson why would you want to spend all that time energy and money\nWhen you can learn a system and what I Love about the term system Ryan it's saving yourself stress time energy and money\nAnd so we teach our students is to trade again like banks do back in February last year Goldman Sachs had a ... large winning day was ... million dollars in one day simply by shortening the markets and so I Want to use this analogy hurt me use it before\nIt's like driving a car if anyone said T well you can go anywhere you want to go in this world right now but the car can only go in drive you can never put it in reverse it'd be pretty frustrating Dr number one you're educated enough to know that the car goes both directions well most people don't realize so to the markets you can trade when the markets are going up\nYou can trade when the markets are going down to what most people have learned\nBy coming to the academy ... becoming educated and not trying to do it on their own is that there's a simple step by step process the system regardless of how old you are your background your education level if you're someone who's coach ... somebody's committed you can make money trading the markets like the banks do\nYoung when you look at how we learn how to do anything it's really how we learn how to trading invest as well it doesn't change just because we're in the investing world and and the thing that the thing I was stressed inside of my classes is that we focus on the skill and that was one of the things that my\nMy mentors really pushed on me about Fifteen sixteen years ago was focused on the skill and the money will come the the the issue ends up being as ... it's a natural tendency forced to stare at the money right out of the gate and we want to me I got to me I Want to make a hundred dollars a day we've got to be that starting right now right rather than building the skills you have the skill you can generate the money but you have to have the skill first so many times\nWe tried to put the cart in front of the horse there and that's where the appropriate type of mentoring and teaching in different things like that can can can really help you know too many times we we approach the markets and and and when I talked to people is very normally the did they say\nIf I say I I lost a question are you looking for a get rich quick program you know and and everyone always says oh no no no I'm I'm not looking at looking for that and say well good 'cause that's not what the financial markets are this is where you really have to develop the skill to be able to go in and generate income but once you have the skill\nYou can generate the income scale has to come first and\nThen the the patience of developing the skill that really determines in my opinion whether or not somebody a successful or not it's just like I I I compared flying an airplane I mean how comfortable would you be if you sat down a inside of a seven forty seven and you're about to fly from LA to New York\nAnd over the intercom you heard that the pilots say well good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I just finished my Youtube video on drag versus lift we are ready to take off\nRight at that that's not going to get you there you have plenty of knowledge on on how flight actually works the mechanics behind it but as far as the skill to fly and navigate that plane across the country that's a\nThat's a whole different conversation and we would never get on that plane because that's a life or death

dot com\n[noise] this is how retraining radio back to the show [noise]\nWe'll come back if you're just tuning in humans Larry Jacobs and director of a structure development and top instructor it on my training really shed some light on income we've talked a lot about multiple streams of income we talked about different types of income passive income\nActive in a little while ago we did a whole a whole series on passing versus versus active income\nAnd and it's so much fun to talk about income everybody needs more income whether it's whether it's for income for today or whether it's income for tomorrow and I'm not in comfort tomorrow is what we want to spend a little bit of time on in this segment talking a little bit about the retirement accounts\nAnd so one of the things maybe missed out on that last segment as far as talking about more ... more generating more income well don't worry we're going to be doing it in this segment but really focusing on that retirement side of the the income equation\nWhether you're tuning in for the first time maybe you've been with us for the whole show\nDon't worry get excited the best is yet to come and learn sometimes I'll be talking with a lot of our listeners and and that happens a lot via social media we got the Twitter we've got the Facebook rose got all these different avenues where they can reach out they can ask questions we have different the different ... in our series and stuff like that but one of the things that we hear a lot there's two things really that we hear a lot\nNumber one we're hearing from people saying that they don't have enough money to retire even with the markets at all time high is right now\nThey don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire are consistently saying they're not quite sure what to do with their money so maybe if you could address a few of those topics because I'm sure we got a lot of listeners in one or two of those ditch one or both of those situations listening to us right now was\nTalking about urgency because right now historically statistically the markets and the correct about every ten years or so so here we are ten years later like I mentioned earlier on the show we're seeing the Federal Reserve continuing to raise interest rates were seeing the housing market starting to reverse so what does this mean for you\nWho are listening right now with the first time we've got to do is go back to how this all started if you have a four one K. where you're only able to trade and mutual funds the biggest concern you should have right now is the fact that prior to\nTwo thousand we came into the mutual fund world the Nineteen nineties was roaring bull market well the first time we experienced any pain was back in two thousand so what makes this different than most is if you have a pension where your boss just set aside money for you\nThose monies were protected because it was coming out of our their payroll are coming out of profits and it was put aside the separate account and it wasn't subjected to what was happening in the markets will everything in your four O. one K. is not protected in fact if you think about a congressional people in senators they don't have for one case they have\nPensions intentionally because they want to make sure that they have this money available do our taxes\nWell right now you should be thinking about and especially if you're putting money in every two weeks into your Ira or four one K. you're investing an all time highs\nAs you might have mentioned I don't remember but let's just worth repeating that the market falls three times faster than it goes up so right now if you've been investing the majority of your money in the last couple of years at all time highs right now than it is a lot more room for this money to fall you should be concerned\nBecause we saw what happened back in two thousand eight it was a four O. one K. the became a two oh one K.\nAnd again it took about six years to recover\nWell this is much higher than we've ever seen before in fact if I look at the Buffett index speaking of course Warren Buffett right now it's higher and more extended\nThan we ever seen that index have been in the past and they simply means that if we have a correction and things continue what's to say this four one K. won't become a one oh one K. and do you have the time right now to be able to put off your retirement\nAnd still work when you thought you were going to be able to finally retirement and start living your life yeah and the ... the the\nTo make money in the market hasn't changed or a thousand years we're talking about it earlier when you brought up shorting and making money as the markets are going down it's always been by low so high and it will always be by low so high so what's the probability of buying an all time high as as being you buy low opera opportunity\nRight can markets go higher than they absolutely can we're taking on a lot of risk in those situations there's ... there's constant pull back there's constant wholesale offerings even as the markets are going higher and over paying for things is is really what limits are potential upside and what opens up the downside for uh\nFor risk you know we we talk a lot about the the the bullish biased in how as consumers we just usually sit there and buy everything we Bye bye Bye bye bye And right now the market's going higher and higher and every payday the average person buys more stocks they buy stocks through their mutual funds to their four one case\nBathroom there are a speeds through their IRAs doesn't matter what account type it is that ... that the general practice kind of around the world is on payday we just buy stocks\nWell it doesn't matter what the prices though just matters that his payday and so we are going to invest into it now the markets are collapsing or financial advisors have a brilliant way of of of talking to us about why it's okay to continue to buy as the markets are going down\nRight the ... dollar cost averaging as the markets are going down and they say by more by more by more is it's going down and then when it comes back you're going to be rich and while that math actually makes a whole lot of sense the problem ends up being is we don't stop buying when it's on its way up if all we did was by on its way down dollar cost averaging will be very powerful strategy\nBut when you're averaging your price back up buying it these all time highs\nOffsets all the money that was invested in that for a while and came back in two thousand nine and we're taking the\nAverage price up with us which which raises are risk exposure and lowers are profitability and in the end it's for one reason in my opinion my humble opinion and it's because Wall Street's businesses to sell us products and that's OK\nRight we just have to know that at Wal Mart's businesses to sell us products too and that's how they make money and I don't think they're evil right into the wall Street's evil but as the customer not client noticed I use the word customer\nHas the customer we have to understand\nThat what we're what we're doing when we're when we're engaging with somebody when I go to Walmart I realize that I'm not planning on making money I'm just buying something from them and\nIf that's the same thing that that's happening with us with Wall Street we've got to kind of take that into consideration with the\nWith the kind of analysis that we're doing on the situation are we planning on making money on this transaction if the answer is yes\nHow do we plan on making money on this and usually the answer after that unfortunately is is I don't know but that's where getting a little bit of education on how the markets work can go a long way and I say a little bit can go a long way and it really can a little bit of education\nWill put you miles in front of the average investor one of the ways where we can help you do that as we got a few more tickets so we can do a little give away as long as I said okay let's do it right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area they're happy
