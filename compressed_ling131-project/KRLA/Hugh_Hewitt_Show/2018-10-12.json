just ignored you know the hash tag implications of at all not to mention it you know the kind of guy a God's knell is now this movie\nThat is coming out this week I'm telling you I hear it's well\nYou have got to you know not Pashto collect two hundred dollars get out there see this movie and um you know I saw it with some friends and the recording question is\nWhy is that they why is it that we have the sense that God's nails not the only one\nHe's the only one that's been discovered this guy all under the guise and protection as we're talking about abortion you know the holy the holy grail you know you can't talk about abortion can't do this I mean to the point that you've got\nPolitical leaders turning their head ignoring this guy was an operation for Seventeen years\nAnd the abuse the disgusting abusive was going on in his clinic\nYou can't even imagine it is heartbreaking\nUh you you cannot come out of that movie\nUh without tears it will show affect you and to realize that this is the seed\nOf what he has contributed to the death of sixty million plus Americans I mean kind of amazing here that here in this country but if you're born in this country you know and your parents aren't citizens you know you're the anchor baby and here we have babies that have been murdered at will\nUh and and and even you know uh just forget about the idea that which is the law there in Philadelphia\nThe term abortions were illegal throw that out the window it was according to Kermit guys now is Kermit guys now said that a ... you know that baby could be aborted it could be aborted\nAh in one in several cases the babies were born alive\nHe didn't he didn't kill them in the womb they were born and then they were post murdered outside of the womb\nAnd this is this is what a ... you know it was one of the uh ... you know one one of the fences or that he got he got convicted for\nYeah I I in my mind what allowed and all of the hard choices are I\nMean it was just telling us well for life part because the problem at the cheapest not being called it's called ... not being told them ... ... it's not being taught primarily and find out that way and not being funny or sell a lot of young girls literally are saying a lot of that is that right now I think why you gotta keep saying that that person that murder like the only thing\nThey certainly do not understand that at Washington ... ... no procedure when right now is being promoted it on by exactly but when I get out of the I'm Sorry I saw some Dell is that\nThe filmmaker director neck a fear the stop even though he had so many difficulties and trying to get somebody that I was reading that book for years to finally get it I mean and then when he tried you\nWondering for the town I guess what what where do you call for fundraising oh Kickstarter we here so long as a producer is actually fun rain that didn't stop him they set a new record out and it goes off and then after that they won't let them fight for the movie and yet nothing stopping man from saying this has to get out the American public so I just want to\nEncourage your listeners today ... ... it's going to be tough thing does not want to get the truth out there I I have five it's only one out of my ... in a life of where St is trying to stop me from what I Do I go out and\nHear the details but when you're getting something writing he will try to stop you from what you're doing ... keep plugging away like ... director you have to go check out the I'm going to go check it out this weekend and I was just encouraging people bringing a Kleenex box\nAnd possibly a trash can you you\nYou are it it's gonna it's gonna be tough and I got to tell you what are you know in much the same way as Abby Johnson Johnson worked for Planned Parenthood I think it was for like eight years and worked her way up and became a supervisor of a clinic it wasn't until she actually saw a sonogram\nA procedure of the abortion when she saw it and and it was so heartbreaking to her she walked out she couldn't handle it and has become an advocate for pro life ever since then she's been on with us many times and I love the habeas heart but this is what's happened is that\nThe word to you know we're taught that oh it's just a flash just meaningless all that kind of deal I got to tell you the other night uh it it came up\nThat I saw this it was kind of a an animal antics or a presentation of the abortion process they touch on this in in the gods now movie but touched on that I Wish they would have actually shown exactly what happens and how they go up and they get the forceps they first tried a vacuum\nAnd the child repulsive the child instinctively realizes something's coming into their space and you you see the child or pull away from it and then they go in with forceps and they start yanking body parts to extract the child and uh in the ... and also in the case here where they talk about\nIf the child is beyond a certain number of weeks well the brain is formed will they cannot get the child through a you know through through the canal and so what they have to do is they have to empty out the school's collapse the school so that they can draw the body out\nAnd what they try to do as much as possible as David delight and point out in those a regulatory videos\nIs they try to get as much of the body as they can in certain vital part\nSo that they can sell them I mean this this is what's happening in a ZIP Code near you and especially\nIn these targeted areas of black America I mean this is all part and parcel of Planned Parenthood singer who is still ready to disgusting Lee in this country which is amazing and Dr Ben Carson called it for what it is\nThis is genocide and we are sitting on our hands and we uh give place\nTo women who want to come in and scream at the end you know a a process of account for me you know confirming a aide chief justice in our country but because it's become so political\nYeah people have lost their minds it's almost like their brains have been vacated by the ideology you know\nAnd on the road speaking for how many years teen years here at somebody went in that um\nAre no longer pro choice but they were called choice or pro for a horse that because they had an abortion so many women justify their decision I let women have their own body because they themselves had an abortion encourage anyone sitting in right now\nMany of you many when men were not for the ... going into a partially quite active they follow the math of feet up here to tell a lot of baby and they believed that\nAnd some of the Senate out there from state and that is such a demonic situation what the step that I Want to get and curricular parents once again\nAnd don't let the light you were told that caused you to go into getting a forest and stop you from now being that truth but also ask God forget me for gas and then use your testimony to save all there are women\nWere contemplating abortion and you can do so much your you did not lose that baby in a in a unit is what happened in your life to help save other baby I'm telling you it's somebody women have gotten that\nFound no margin amazing ministry where women are like I had a question at at no longer I'm now going to start a truth and we are banding together realizing that\nWe can't stand for evil even if we have down that path regardless if we knew what we're doing or not though I didn't want to get out there thinking like that word where our identity is what happens after what we did that it not our identity identity isn't quite\nYes and I think the loser plays out there um we always right time at the end the mind if I connect with the ... where they can can never go any going on\nI have a ton of

Jim Brown where they're at the same time but I was over and they all the OB I sat down with our national security advisor bachelor John Bolton and here's the conversation we at\n... thanks for talking to me it's good to see or hear I'm Glad we went to a use for your entire life for this job and you've arrived with the most disruptive presidents so Saturn Jackson in the world or to those collapsing is the job ... wouldn't be given all the years that you've studied the ad I say\nWell I think it's a it's a it's a job that really gives you an opportunity to serve the president or who's who's in office in every president has a different style or I think good job of the national security advisor really is to make sure that whatever the style of the president that he gets the information he needs to make decisions\nOr that he has the range of options that he needs and then that those decisions are carried out so that's my job I think it's fine that we've got to disrupt the president even a kind of chaotic world because there are a lot of changes that need to be made\nA we're seeing a lot to do bills come do from the Obama administration so it's very fast paced\nUh but uh I wouldn't trade it for anything else\nLet me ask you about your own job since it's now in the United nation Nasser you're right a mention of president twofold what kind of personality and should this be a job in the cabinet or should be some Cabot\nWell you know on the second one it's really up to the president or he can make any job the cabinet rank\nAnd he'll make his decision a as he sees as best\nI ... I did not have cabinet rank uh when I was ... I don't think it affected me in any way either up at the un or in my dealings within the administration\nI think it's a job where you have to be prepared to get deep into the substance of issues I think it's very important in implementing policy and mostly what you do at the un has implement policy that you\nUnderstand the significance of the actions you're taking a and it'd be part of a team I I felt very privileged when I was there I helped make policy but I help mostly to carry policy out\nSome national security advisers travel a lot so stay close to the oval office what's your travel schedule like looking forward especially between now and election well\nI've spent most of my time in Washington or or traveling with the president when he travels overseas or I have done some travel I've got a trip coming up to Moscow in the caucuses countries are in about ten days reason for that is to continue to carry through on the\nConversation that President Trump and present prudent hadn't Helsinki during the summer to talk about\nU.S Russian relations and where we can make progress where we still have issues and disagreement or and then in the caucuses to see the very significant geographical a role that they have dealing with Iran dealing with Russia dealing with turkey\nSo it's selected I work very closely with Jim Madison I ... we had breakfast this morning as we do once a week to kick all these issues around and I think that's very important that the national security advisor I think under any presidential style has to be an honest broker and I I work\nHard at that when you sit down with your counterpart Russia next week are you going to tell them hands off our election I may say three or four times loudly\nYeah well every time I've met with the Russians in this job including with President putting himself when I went to Russia to prepare for the Helsinki that meeting I've made that point as has the president\nIs the message to believe\nThat we're ... feet well so far we don't see the kind of Russian meddling we did in twenty sixteen Chris Wray the director the FBI said a couple of weeks ago that that could change with the stroke of a key we are very worried about the question of Chinese interference not just in individual elections\nBut more broadly trying to influence\nThe American political discussion with an influence campaign that uh I I think could well be unprecedented we heard vice president Pence speak to this issue or last week it was a very important speech I think people need to read it and consider it a and I think the United states needs to stand up frankly to any foreign government\nThinks it's going to interfere in our politics we are a self governing people\nWe will govern ourselves we don't need international institutions that tell us how to do it and we particularly don't need foreigners\nAre trying to exert undue influence over as\nWell that transition to the story of the day Jim ... we're trying to influence the response of the Saudi Government of the world at noon or Thursday are you satisfied with what the Saudis have told us about the disappearance of Mr ...\nWell I don't think we've we've known enough or I spoke with the crown prince yesterday along with Jared Kushner a secretary of state Mike Pompeo spoke to the crown prince is well the the president has spoken to this issue or it is something we need to get resolved and uh we need to do it as soon as possible\nIn the aftermath of the Annapolis was from shooting something people criticize the president or has the enemy of the people that are in the aftermath of a shock and disappear and some people have said that the president is turning a blind guy to violence against journalists are across the world particularly Russia what do you make a critic for the president trying to tie him to the show as\nWell I think this is ridiculous I mean I think this is a he has spoken out about it uh he's directed a secretary said palm patio or to speak with a show he's a fiance and that'll happen as soon as they can get that scheduled a we're taking a number of other steps\nOr that I really can't get into at the moment but I think that uh it's just a hypocritical to say that somehow the president's not concerned about these things when manifestly his words in his actions are to the contrary\nUh Mr Nasir Saudi Arabia and political structures at best convoluted is it possible to Henry the second situation when we get rid of this metal praised spiraling out of control or even something more and more level what that someone intended that undermine the crown prince and the king via this action\nYou know honestly we just don't know what the facts are and that was one of the points that are that I made to the crown prince or we need to find out what the facts are and we need to get this resolved quickly because if it is a a a a another operation\nA people need to understand that I I think the uh the Saudis themselves are being damaged because we don't have the facts out there is obviously been historical animosity between turkey and Saudi Arabia\nOr we have our own difficulties with turkey at the moment with they're keeping pastor Brunson effectively under house arrest for no good reason whatever ah so this is a this is not that anybody's benefit and it needs to be\nCleared up is it possible that if the operation happen it could have happened without the knowledge of the crowd\nI think a lot of things are possible in the middle East I'm at the United states does not have information it's not revealing or if we had information we'd we'd know better exactly how to handle this we've made it clear we want to know what the facts are we're going to continue to do that\nLet me turn from our ally to our enemy um the commander the Iranian Revolutionary guard so I'm On a use social media to threaten the White House there are reports that there are sleeper cells in the United states given those sorts of threats and those sorts of reports are American should we be alarmed about ... reach into the United states\nThink we should be I think the Iranian regime as an enemy of the United states are we just had a ...\nIn the past ... on the arrest of two Iranian agents in the United states are scoping out Jewish and Israeli targets for a possible attack\nUh we've seen France and other European countries\nArresting a agents of the Iranian intelligence service for planning an attack on a rally of dissident Iranians in Paris this summer we've seen transfer example now impose sanctions against Iran because of this behavior so we see Iran or not\nA conforming to western norms because of the Iran nuclear deal they've not done anything to try to modify are concerned about their continued support for terrorism around the world they are accelerating this this regime is a threat that's why the president\nThat got us out of the Iran nuclear deal that's why the economic sanctions or being re impose\nThat's why we're putting maximum pressure\nOn the Iranian regime and just to be clear we are having a very significant effect\nYou can hear the European governments talk about staying in the deal European corporations and I mean the biggest one the biggest oil companies the biggest manufacturing firms are getting out of Iran are Iranian oil exports are plummeting their currency has gone through the floor unrest is spreading across the country\nEven countries like China or reducing their imports of oil from Iran because they don't want to tangle with the United states\nUh this is something that we shouldn't be concerned about because Iran remains what it has been since Nineteen Seventy nine it's\nSeeing the world is leading state sponsor of terror at a press has its own

ring at the wall Street Journal this hour that turkey is expected to release pastor Brunson today\nGlory America to you and thank you for listening today and when rather northern Virginia and indeed Michael\nExisted in the Atlantic last night roaring through Virginia I think down in Virginia Beach Norfolk Hampton Roads area it's a lot of\nPower lines are down it's that are out to be posted on that [laughter] I'm pleased to welcome the guy who would be in charge in Ohio were a disaster happen\nNext year for the next four years Mike DeWine he's the attorney general in Ohio right now he's running for governor in one of the most closely watched races in the United states former senator now attorney general DeWine welcome back to the euro ... great to have you\nHere it's great to be back with you and your listeners thank you were not\nOne of the things I think when we watch Michael come ashore governor a jar general the wind is\nWe listen to candidates and we think to ourselves are they are they able to handle the crisis and you've been doing this a long time now but but speak Richard Cordray your your opponent has been a lawyer and a lawyer and he's been a lawyer or how about you [laughter]\nWell you know I've really tackle some tough problems and the interesting things\nAbout if you compare Cordray and Mike DeWine is that we both were attorney generals and\nUh you know I beat him eight years ago close race but I but I beat him but what we inherited a was a real mess up the courage Ohio runs the state crime labs and when we took off as a\nCourt right left us was if there was a rape or serious crime that occurred in Ohio the unknown DNA was taken to the state crime lab a it was sat there\nIf you can believe this for a hundred and twenty five days without anybody ever looking at that's how far a backlog that they had and a quarter or less a mouse and so we fixed it uh we turn cases around now\nA twenty four hours if it's an emergency uh we're doing four times as much DNA as we did today ah he left office and uh you know our average times about three weeks but we can turn case around very very quickly and another thing that he couldn't pair\nCordray and what we've done now he left\nUm they were they were all rape get sitting and police departments all over the state of Ohio law states that have this problem\nOr he didn't do anything about it while I became attorney general we we started hearing about that and we actually have tested every single one of them we went out to all the police say bring it to us\nOr we want to get this evidence are tested and we've tested as I said close to fourteen thousand uh some as these are all cold cases old cases\nUh some there's some Fifteen Years old and\nWe've got hit or matches and thirty six percent so we've gone back\nYou know and better than a third and told the local police who then turned told the victim hey we got you're right that we got your rapists\nAnd the entire county alone and Cleveland where we had a\nLarge large number of them are they they have a indicted over seven hundred and fifty people rate while as all of that so it it's it's a great lesson and you see a problem you go after it a court right just just sat there and didn't or\nYou don't do anything and don't forget of course his time are heading up Obama's a consumer a group out in Washington if you if you recall uh we we saw for example or because of overregulation we ... we saw the number of our community banks\nOr go down significantly in Ohio I'm sure that occurred in in other states as well just because of the over over regulation a quarter a and others had in place\nNow I got to ask you a general DeWine the idea that Ohio which is\nDoing well in this recovery I\nMean we've got I Know north eastern are pretty darn well I Know a large town is cook and I know that that's Trump country as well up and running in Trumbull county nice to be what county Cuyahoga County it's cooking why in the world would return the state over to the left the uh the laugh I mean what in the world well that people think about\nThat that look that's absolutely right we're we're we're doing well and Ohio uh we do not want to go back to where we were eight years ago\nEight years ago when Cordray I'm a ... you know was was attorney general and a ... ... you know he was the attorney general state of Ohio we had had lost a\nClose to four hundred thousand jobs\nAh and you know we just were not moving or or unemployment rate was high and in the last eight years under Republican conservative leadership\nUh we've kept taxes down cut taxes out we've seen the economy move forward and so you know what I Want to do my running mate John ... we want to take a while to the next level uh we've come a long long way we do not want to go back\nUh we've got we've got a couple of challenges out there we got an opiate problem that we we have to get in front of and now instead of a you know people\nNot being able to find jobs and not the economy not moving forward our biggest challenge now for employers is to find people who are qualified or people who are able to pass a drug test so\nWhat we're really focusing on you is is two things uh one is tackling a the drug problem we have a twelve point action plan that which makes makes real sense it's realistic uh some of the things I'm already shirt has already started to do as attorney general but there are things I Can't do until\nTill I I'm governor I mean one of the things that we want to we think is very important as education and prevention for young young kids in regard to drugs or\nYou know I started my career as a county prosecuting attorney I can tell you that I don't know in five years or ten years if we'll have an opiate problem but\nA ... there's always some drug problems and so we weren't prepared young people starting as early as kindergarten K. through twelve something age appropriate ... year every year something that's been proven to to actually work\nUh we will implement that\nAnd it will make a huge difference the the other thing that we're\nWe really want to do a is double doubt on President Trump's opportunities zones a were have opportunities owns Ohio oh this will mirror the tax cuts uh and and the job act that the president and Congress put through a we will make it so that ah\nSomebody looks at the state of Ohio and I said well that's the place to invest that's where I I Want to take my ... capital gains I Want to take a ticket to Ohio or put it through this in our\nMost problematic areas and you know we we believe that a given that tax break I was going to get a lot of money to be invested in Ohio we hope from a you know all over the country\nAre going to help ... yeah if you take that up the young son Warren given the physical structure that exist there already in your combined with economic opportunity and it will cook I\nTalk with moaning valley chamber when they came to DC and they're flying at first you gotta win tonight I'm planning to Columbus Ninety eight Ninety answer dot com and people want to come out and see a Mike Gallagher and Jim Jordan and our taxes night sitting down at\nI'm over it you're going to college that\nThat'll be great if we're gonna we're gonna juice turnout but early voting gets going in the Buckeye State doesn't it I mean we're we're ...\nWe're into it or we should we ... we started this week and uh\nYou know we're what we're seeing a since the cabin up a nomination and what the Democrats did and what happened in the Judiciary Committee we we've seen a real\nA firing up of our conservative base in Ohio or in a county is all over the state and you and you mentioned you mentioned in an area of the state of Ohio in ... in eastern Ohio them hunting valley for example Steubenville\nAh which you are very very familiar with you know historically historically big big a Democrat area but socially conservative and what we saw of course is what what President Trump did when he ran and did exceedingly well\nOr in areas that you know never in in several lifetimes have not been gone gone Republican\nCounty went for Trump bad happened since I think Nixon\nTalk show that's right it's been it's been a long time but uh but you're right we lay out the way our opportunities zones on top of that I mean\nWe ... we have them with with the tax bill but weren't doubled down at all because we're going to say we're on to do that with our our tax code in the state of Ohio too and and we really believe that that's going to have a lot of investment [noise] ah we ... we can't have there's there's not enough government money out there to have a government investment and to have\nA we have to get the private sector and ... and we have some great things going for us and a lot of areas but with this with this tax cut that we're talking about that opportunity a it's a really ... economic development Ohio\nLast question attorney general Mike DeWine going to be next governor Ohio and I was there for Rob Portman before I joined NBC and had to stop doing fundraisers sort of like a thousand people running for governor but they all came together behind you and you're not used in his euro as you're a number two guy in Germany she's running for Senate here in the party actually\nTogether and working to get people we got one minute left

building our talk or whether or not we ought to be doing business with China\nThey have a lot of business partners of the United states should Google should Facebook be helping the People's Republic of China to develop tools of information filtering and basically control when this as a nation that has admitted that a million like ours in concentration camps\nYeah I think vice president Pence spoke very eloquently on that point at his speech at the Hudson Institute last week and I think the biggest applause line he got was when he said that the information technology sector don't cooperate with the Chinese in in this effort I Would say to shareholders of these companies that portray themselves as\nThe open Internet transparent future really want to make money off of repression I if I were shareholder I'd I'd want to know what the answer of\nOur corporate leadership was the shareholders though we certainly would not have allowed in pre war Germany Americans to sell the Carr Fire works but designed for new artillery are we is there a role or the government to step in the Silicon Valley and control technology transfer well we\nWere looking at the export control area look we did this and continue to do it in terms of dual use technology that could affect nuclear chemical or biological weapons are ballistic missile development I think in cyberspace we're entitled to do the same thing\nThat because we've abandoned free market principles but because we have to be realistic about the adversaries we face in the world today that use the fruits of American freedom against us and we shouldn't let that happen we want to do it in ways to protect our open economy but the NIH others the ability to take advantage of it\nOr return to the previous administration and Bob Woodward's book a lot was overlook one thing that was overlooked was a candidate missions that they had to hit the scope of the north Korean nuclear problem\nOf the country so that they were a further along either war president but that was his biggest problem today in fact conceal the extent of the problem and we're we prepared for pre emptive strike the Woodward describes\nWell that the Obama policy they described as strategic patience\nThat is a synonym for doing nothing about North Korea\nAnd it's another example of the do bill coming due for President Trump a I think the combination of the\nPotential use of military force against North Korea and the maximum pressure campaign that the president waged on the economic front is what has brought that Kim Jong on to the table might punt pales just returned from another\nTrip there will see a meeting I think between a chairman Kammen President Trump sometime in the next couple of months\nUh we'll see other efforts go forward the president has held the door open for North Korea he gave him a great little of the movie and er in Singapore\nWhen he met with Kim Jong on that showed what North Korea's future could be so the doors open they need to denuclearize completely and ... and if they knew that and walk through the door of the future could be very different for the north Korean people\nKnow John Holdren has been known for Twenty years is the most skeptical of skeptics of a feel good diplomacy are you feeling good about the diplomacy with North Korea\nBut I don't think we'd be in the place we are today if we continue to pursue a rock Obama's policies I think four more years of that under Hillary Clinton\nWould've guaranteed and North Korea with deliverable nuclear weapons or the the future remains uncertain on the president's diplomacy he's optimistic he pressed his heart he does not have stars in his eyes about this neither does my palm pale neither does Jim Mattis neither do I\nShould we be encouraging our allies to match what the Chinese are doing the creation of artificial age ... and the Harlem in the Philippines and Japan can do it I think it'd be doing\nWell I think we've got to do more first to establish for the Chinese that we do not acknowledge the legitimacy of any of this the ship or near a collusion you mentioned a is an example of how dangerous Chinese behavior is\nWe have now gotten more participation by allies the\nBritish the Australians and others are sailing whether it's through the south China Sea we are going to do a lot more on that uh I think we could see more exploitation of mineral resources in the south China Sea with or without Chinese cooperation they need to know they have not achieved the fed accompli here\nThis is not a Chinese province and will not the\nGetting the light up so I have to ask you to things Russia's in the rearview mirror and Christopher Wray said this yesterday they're worried about that is probably not as worried about tomorrow's problem\nI Want you guys for teaching thinking stuck in a rush of first as a problem and not focused on China as the major geopolitical strategic challenge of the century\nWell I think we do see China as the the major issue of the century I don't think we're stuck in the rearview mirror but what I Would say is in a world that's now post post Cold War\nWe are and I'm very complex environment the United states faces a range of challenges globally sound that the strategic nuclear level summit the level of terrorist threats\nWe've got to be prepared across the spectrum of threats in a way we've never had to be in our history and the nineteenth century we were much more isolated than we are today we are being global power and are threats are global\nAs well and what is the president's grasp of the geopolitical complexities of the war we get this question all the time you deal with in daily well\nI think he's got a all the grasp of it he needs the the one difference between a President Trump and other presidents is his economic background\nMorning\nGlory America malls are on Canada at you you know their way back in our studio inside of it when we're in northern Virginia don't\nWay where Michael exhibited stage right towards England last night after taking two hundred thousand people in power and southern Virginia and leaving a\nTrail of destruction tears from the panhandle north I Am joined by Dr Larry on President Hillsdale College Hillsdale dot edu for all of your Hillsdale needs\nAnd his online course on church which is apparently very necessary reading person people in America who thought\nChurchill got into this cabinet business doctor before we begin with justice cabinet or the\nTragedy at this level is a little hard for people to grasp but when you look and see\nThat Panama city's gone back to the beach is gone to jail air force base which was home to three thousand people in the military all their possessions are gone but why do you tell your students about tragedy and sadness of it [noise]\nYeah well you got to pick up and go again but that that you know when this thing come true like the water is the big thing you know when ... modern buildings don't really look out all that much but the water comes and that just you know you got to start over\nWhen when England went through the ... and large parts of it were destroyed and every night this terrible stuff what happened how ... how did they introduce resilience or was that just part of the national character already\nWell uh you know people don't like being um but now that makes it [laughter]\nIt makes them just like the people who are doing it they got really rapidly now they they uh you know Winston Churchill as prime minister of Great Britain and he was pretty good job so not only did he give eloquent spacious\nIt's also true that they came up with an insurance scheme you know and so you didn't bear the burden of that yourself and the way it worked you know you can drive through London today and if you see a cluster of\nOld buildings and then an interruption with new buildings and then the old buildings resume\nThat bombing pattern and if you go up blocking turn left and left again you'll see the same thing repeated in the next block over and so it just cuts swamps down\nOf London and you know if you were in the law and you got you got hammered but it was it was a you know people wanted to know\nWhat's so it's different than you know a natural thing like this or is anybody with him to get here so I guess you can blame it on me for global warming argue but yeah yeah\nThat was there was a lot of that going on by the way they forget the Labor Day storm of the Nineteen thirties the destroyed a lot of Rhode Island they forget Camille in the sixties I mean if it's convenient the Gulf goes up and down and different years it's up this year and that made it tougher\nBoom yeah it did and uh and it if you live on the coast you know and what we see in this Michael thing is living right on the coast is dangerous if you live in the Gulf or on the Atlantic seaboard but uh\nIf you know she lived five miles and that sounds like you're enjoying wonderful coastal living and so those people are getting punished and that's too bad\nYou know I talk this morning where they northern Virginia beach family or because they are two hundred thousand people without without power down there so it started in Florida went through Georgia South Carolina North Carolina and eggs in Virginia that's just never happened before that is a weird thing and we're going to have to the president respond to it but now\nTold everyone uh Tim Roebuck on USA dot org if they want to help out\nLet's turn to the other tragedy which was the violence done to the presumption of innocence\nThat I think this is a and to the mob rule that with legitimate eyes uh enter the difference between political rallies and chanting lock her up which I don't particularly approve of it but it's a rally and it's a chance [noise] versus menacing Ted Cruz and his wife in a restaurant with the imminent threat of violence or the to the mobs in\nPortland I think we've lost our capacity to distinguish Larry between political speech and political violence\nTo two weeks ago or\n... I read something by the ... and I heard her talk he'll still by Charles Kessler and they both use the expression cold civil war\nAnd uh you know this is like the early Nineteen fifties right did you mean they just are Eighteen fifty Shia Eighteen fifty and what is the future of it the point is\nWe have to have an agreement that we're going to decide our political differences through a process and the process has to be agrees in advance and especially if the process is hallowed\nThen you don't want to mess with it right\nIf you read Lincoln's great first inaugural address he says that the first time that a ballot ever placed bullets\nIn fundamental political it was just it was an eight hundred in the United states of America which I think is true [noise] so so the point is you're going to sell the the people elect under the constitutional process to seize that majority in the Senate\nAnd the president of the same party and he gets to elect a bunch of people on the Supreme Court that can't be planned in advance that's you know that's how the constitution works and so\nTo obstruct the process because you know what what I think is\nIt was a shame for this thing even to be taken up and the reason is\nThat that lady seems like a fine lady and says sincere but there is no evidence for this and it happened you know a human generation ago when Brett Kavanaugh was it was a kid so the thing is that something that you just would not be able to get to the bottom of\nIt is it is a problem of proof that the very beginning that ought to have been recognized and ensure amount of oil but it was politicizing was weaponized\nI Want to pause for a moment of cold civil war 'cause veteran I have a disagreement about this from Charles and I I went up the ante them two weekends ago and that's a hot civil war that twenty thousand people dead in one day from a dunk or church all the way down to burn a bridge and\nEven in the Eighteen fifties we had you know John Brown and the Bush ... in Kansas and stuff like that or we're not there but I Do think the warning about what happens\nWhen we don't realize\nThat debate can be fierce but you cannot men is that is the constitutional pest by the way in in the in the Supreme Court which is the intention and the ability to incite violence is illegal it's not protected speech\nThat's right that's right and you know the\nSo I I think I said this on a couple of weeks ago but in in the Nineteen forty five Winston Churchill last elections the socialist me said would ultimately result in it to stop and the socialist got forty eight percent of the vote and they got over sixty percent of the seats and so\nOf course the conservatives were rumblings about that and she'll give a speech he's the leader of the opposition now and he says\nWe're not going to complain about that this is the constitutional system this is how they got in and this is how we're going to replace them and so you know it it contrast that with the ... of the electoral college and now the Senate\nIn the country in other words there isn't any constitutional range but that shouldn't be it's not subject to a salt in the interest of partisan politics of the day\nIt is that is true everything is under assault and if you're not on the right\nThing in the media will\nAbsolutely demonize you and by the media I mean the broadcast networks with the exception of Fox I mean the big newspapers I mean the beltway Manhattan Media elite they are on the left and they will demonize you\nIf you are not on the left and they will protect you if you are and Kanye West is finding out big time on CNN where they are mocking him in terms that\nFor any other commentator to use concerning any other minority that come to it or would be off the air\nFare well we did have the Donald Trump rule now and that is anything can be said about him or anybody connected to him that's that's a new feature of American politics\nThe repeat that that is true that you can't go low there's nothing so low about Trump that will get thrown off the air here I Am in violence may be a threat of violence that would do it\nWell that's a crime as you said and are not protected speech and uh violence against the president is is a particular crime or so they don't they don't do that but I mean lord there's a movement to impeach Brett Kavanaugh\nGoing on right now and it's in you know the uh the chief justice has referred to as a complaint that he did not manifest judicial conduct in answering the charges against him before the Senate that's been transferred to the ... circuit but the point is\nEverything is going to be harassed at every step and that's the tone of politics these days\nWhen we come back and break Dr Larry on I Will continue to talk about the choice of it now in front of the country it's very clearly not the choice of the mob or it's the choice of the the Republican Party and out or play out in Michigan with John James and out will play out in Montana with Matt Rosendale in Wisconsin when we look mare [laughter]\nAnd then this stuff is brought up\nAnd that is not fair or a good political maneuver and if you transfer that to what it would take to convict the guy of something which is rightly a different standard than just\nLike a document about politics then this is crazy 'cause it would never go anywhere\nAnd when we come back we're going to play for your um you know the seminal exchanging the media John Dickerson and Mitch McConnell talking about judges and what people have to understand about the constitution and\nThe structure
