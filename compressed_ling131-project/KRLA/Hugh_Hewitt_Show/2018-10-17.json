I'm OK into a he was from Charlotte and whenever you know hurricanes aren't screen through\n... you might have seen stories about whenever he went and you bring helping 'em his house actually got robbed they got ran in fact he had different things like his computer and\nI'm In his gaming system and all that different steps taken heat there were there helping people and somebody breaks and to top and taste it and it and I'm sure people who were uh knowing there are others are gone we're actually taking advantage here and they're angry and yeah it's terrible when something like that when you have a tragedy and funding on top of that and\nPeople found out that this on that I'm Sorry\nNo no no go ahead finish your story finish this deal I'll come in there\nAnd people found out this soldier had I'm lost his money went into the story went viral about you know tell many people across the country were upset about this young man ...\nMe and are you near his stuck in his house and ... to go fight may recall rating five thousand dollars and they actually ...\nBut they raised Fifteen thousand dollars and he decided to get part of that away to other people who have been affected one guy had hit a tree fall on his house there was staying in a hotel and you know he called it first and he's like I don't want to take advantage of generosity like and I've been inspired by the generosity of others and so he went on to just\nKeep giving his money away and you know\nI'm just kinda restores your faith in humanity a little bit when you say stuff like that happen you know nobody wants to have um our soldiers especially mistreated so I I I Love the story\nWhat what an example that's a great story and one that we need to hear\nUm you know and and ah in innocent up I mean he he is a serious Fifteen thousand dollars or more than what he needed and so he shares with others that are in a ... you know a dire situation and and good on him for that and uh that's awesome but uh you know for the people that are attacked him to the thought that somehow it's their right\nTo go ahead and take advantage of somebody who was missing and going ransacked their house I mean look at I I Know this stuff exists\nIt it's just you know but you know on the other side would exist or good neighbors you know good neighbors like him who go out there and help the community I mean there's Brock

one of those legs as\nHis neighbors helping neighbor as a ground level doing what you know this soldier did any instinctively did it in an eerie as he gets kicked in the gut for doing a good deed and then um you know is blessed again with the some money and a looks beyond himself\nAnd looks disturb other people I mean what what an example I mean you know we that's what we need we need more
