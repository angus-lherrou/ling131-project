{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "So the way we need to do business has to be different and so prior to measure age\nAh which allowed us to have more fun to do this work we didn't have enough outreach teams to do this and important work to literally and figuratively go to people experiencing homelessness and connect them to the myriad of\nOf resources that they need and so and for about a year we've been able to augment our street teams and now we have enough to me five hundred outreach workers out there on any given day doing this really important work\nAnd so not only have we augmented that street base capacity but a big piece when you have so many people and so many agencies and so many entities doing this work who have\nSlightly different um skill sets has to be able to coordinate this work\nAnd so we've also invested a lot of time and energy and funds and creating a really robust coordination um infrastructure and part of that coordination infrastructure\nIs the LA um um the LA homeless are each port or LA hop which allows us to really understand where people who need the most health and connect them to an outreach team\nGive us an example of someone who is part of this five hundred member team are working on the streets to get to the homeless what are the how are the interesting what are they saying what kinds of services were things to me help them with\nA great question our teams really have to be a magician they have to be able to understand\nThe entire um homeless services infrastructure they need to understand the broader infrastructure of benefits medical mental health just even to get an ID or a birth certificate they're really remarkable individuals and so they spend most of their day literally on the streets\nAnd pre defined areas and so they'll usually have you know what I think law enforcement would call it beat 'em but it's a social worker beat and they will get to know the people living in those\nAreas whether their encampments or people living on their own and to start to build a reporter we know that takes time to build trust and to build that relationship\nSo that we can start assessing what they need and we have a common assessment tool that will that help us to develop that road map with the person experiencing homelessness to start I'm addressing their needs and it could be like I said as as easy as getting an ID 'cause it's almost impossible to do anything without an id\nUm or hum as complex as getting people into permanent housing and so it's\nTheir day is often driven by the people they're working with it\nThat's up to that person because all of our services are voluntary to understand what they want and what they need and it tends to be an iterative process once you are able to connect somebody to a pretty basic service\nThen you build trust and then they might be more open to something more robust and then over time ultimately our teams goals are to get people indoors and that could be a shelter or a permanent housing\nWe're talking was calling Murphy Eli homeless services authority um and you mentioned at the end there the ultimate is to get them off the street into a shelter or what is the timeline for that to happen in one of the issues that\nMake it so it's not you just walk up to somebody and say Hi I see you're camping on the street here come with me and we can put you in a place to stay tonight why that happened\nWell I think if we think about people experiencing homelessness is not really a lot different than ourselves and sometimes that takes us a while to do things that maybe we're just not ready to do whether it's a diet or stopping smoking or things like that so part of our work is to assess\nWhat is going on with that individual and to see what they are ready to do in terms of making changes on and to be able to folks aren't ready to continue to work with them to better understand\nHow we can do behavior change which is a complex process for anybody and to start really than just wiggling away at it so that's the first issue it's it's the human being peace\nBut then also even when people are ready um we do have just severe limitations on access to a shelter\nAnd to permanent housing right now um there's a lot of work going on in tandem with the expansion of outrage to grow\nMore shelter beds and our county as well as more permanent housing I'm specifically permanent supportive housing which is designed for people with really complex need on the folks that we're seeing every day who really need a lot of TLC and supports to really get them into housing and keep them into housing\nSo we need more of that and so we can only be successful with our clients on if we have\nUh those those places to place\nPeople if I hear you if you were to invite them and everyone said sure all come with you there wouldn't be enough beds to put them right\nExactly exactly and I think even if we have enough shelter we need to get people out of shelters shelters are really only a short term peace and then we need enough permanent housing so both go hand in hand\nAnd when we have a three percent vacancy rate for rentals that can become very challenging to get people endorsed we still do it but really to be making an impact on the streets we need to be able to really be talking as a community about\nHousing people and what that looks like and we do it successfully where the humidity it's actually cheaper to house somebody then to keep them on the streets and so understanding the economics\nAnd the resources that go into shelters because also I think people have a concept of shelter looks like and we're working really hard to change the look of shelters and what a shelter looks like and the type of services and have them really be cutting edge in client base but also good for the community to\nHelp us understand the analogies we see now I've been in downtown seen what looks like a rule of tense those merged along one street right if you get off the freeway at Alameda\nAnd you you think to yourself or are they there because services are being provided for them and that's where they congregate are they there because they want a free lifestyle where they don't have the income ... of\nTaxes and work and home ownership are they there because of mental illness you use it a bunch of all of that I mean when you actually walk to the street level are you dealing with their\n[laughter] it's a very complex mix of reasons why people become homeless but what we see 'cause we do surveys every year as part of our homeless count to better understand why people are there because\nWe can't serve them if we don't really understand and we find that the biggest piece is the divide between cost of living and income LA has one of the largest gap between um cost of living and income and so people are falling into um homelessness\nUm quicker than we can how the people that are on the streets once you're on the streets it is very um it's very hard on me and so it can exasperated mental health issues it can act fast very physical health issues\nUm people are often preyed upon and so it creates a real vulnerability and we find that people living on the streets actually their life expectancy is much lower than yours\nOr mine on so I think my ... in my experience and I've been doing this for quite a long time people want to be how they want to be part of the humidity they don't want to be out there but it becomes really impossible because a myriad of\nPoor credit a mental health challenges\nA gap and I'm gaps in um job employment um so we have to start digging away at that but in most cases people did not want to be out there and when we do have a solution for them they're ready\nTo take him explore that gap because ... is it this is a group of people who have a skill sets the would afford them the kind of income that they would need to be able to afford rent explain who they are they working non working who are they\n[laughter] we see that there is really a variance in terms of homelessness that we have people who recently fell into homelessness and we have programs for that and are more geared towards getting them a real lift up\nThat called rapid re housing and so they might just need some support to find a new apartments and job training and things like that so when we at that people we figure out if they fall within that kind of contrary to folks\nAnd then we have people who really mental health is is their primary challenge and so will want to start addressing those needs and to get them and housing that really helps them\nTo handle their mental health challenges and that we believe in something called housing first that's really hard to address your mental health and substance abuse issues if you can't have a roof over your head and feel safe so\nWe'll deal with that if it says the goal health issues will want to get that I'm also dealt with it if it's up and sees I'm part of the new outreach model is we have mental health physical health and substance he's professionals out there on the streets addressing this so\nWe're able to do is a lot of this work on the street versus brick and mortar and so\nWe really have to take each person an F F what they need but we have interventions for everyone the question is do we have enough and so that's where we just have to do the best we can with what we have\nGlory America had to do it all your high Canada thank you for listening today from the really factor that comes to the inside of the way one of the most consequential weeks I had in\nA modern American politics will the new McCarthyism work will Sanders and deceit analyzed directed at judge Brett Kavanaugh to succeed but well enough decent men and women in the United States Senate step up and say no moss\nThis is not acceptable I understand the motivation of Jeff Flake\nHe just did not seem to understand that the left would not in good faith undertake additional inquiry into the credible allegations against judge Kavanaugh as they were termed by Democrats I don't think\nThere are any credible allegations against judge Kavanaugh but Democrats do\nThey believe that judge ... for it as a credible allegation in my world of belied it's not credible\nTo be an on corroborated accusation from thirty plus years ago that as many internal inconsistency that have been teased out over the weekend that anyone who is focused on it would agree simply falls apart under close scrutiny and\nThe allegation Mrs Ramirez don't even rise the level of allegation they are a simple smear so the FBI will be busy with the remarriage allegations there's nothing more to be done with Dr Ford she testified under oath at great length\nAnd her testimony is no to the Senate there are no other witnesses as she was admitted they can't talk to Mr judge took up all the other boys from Georgetown Prep should be done today\nI fully expect shut up majority leader McConnell to apply it filed for cloture tonight which sets in motion thirty hours of debate so that on Wednesday they would vote on the motion to\nCause debate\nThen if it passes with fifty one votes to fifty three votes that we make mansion and hike camp or left but after the match in standard that you need more than an accusation I expect him to vote to proceed it will go to the Senate for ... on Thursday that's what I'm hoping for\nAll we get along I watched them used that Democrats attempt to change\nThe focus from the FBI's investigation as to whether there are as anything\nElse to the credible allegations that Democrats are credible but which I I reject and that means the Yale allegation and the doctor ... report allegation there's nothing else by the way they referred for prosecution one of the hits on catalog that he raped someone on a boat in Rhode Island\nThat person's going to jail because they called Sheldon Whitehouse and that idiot\nPeople Rhode Island you have an idiot representing him in the sense that idiot bleak that to the press and they put that out there again Brett Kavanaugh has two daughters ten and fourteen they switched over\nTo a week on a salt on the fact that he was angry at being accused of being a rapist Saturday Night live when all that despicable just despicable\nBrett Kavanaugh has been rated highly qualified fully qualify the highest rate ... has and the left has been working all we get along to get that back because the left intervene and the person that the president ... friday without\nTalking to the idea ... standard they've got the highest qualification for ratings he taught forever at Harvard He is known by everybody in the legal community I don't know about that from the beginning what my first choice but I Will not let any stove go I'm thrown against the McCarthy I\nKnow McCarthyism does by the way it was directed over the weekend I'm not going to tell you the details\nThat a young left wing journalist\nOr young left wing journalist on Twitter came under assault with just a few keystrokes find out what you did at ... school to this person\nAnd exploded that's McCarthyism\nYou move from the Rosenbergs who were treasonous Alger Hiss perjured himself because he was a a traitor genuine honest to God communist agents to accusing him blacklisting people in Hollywood on the basis of mere accusation that tail gunner Joe stop you know it was set up a tail gunner Joe Margaret Chase Smith\nFirst woman senator senator from Maine stood up to Joe McCarthy\nThan I Am hoping that every Republican follows the Margaret Chase Smith example and will have nothing to do with this I was disappointed when Jeff Flake\nFaster the FBI investigation I wanted to move forward but I Know he's a decent fair guy and he thought this would have been\nJeff is continually disappointed by the people around them I Am disappointed and Chris Coons and an Angus King for not denouncing the smears I don't expect them to vote for judge cabinet they they would prefer to have a liberal they would prefer to have it at our way to Kagan said to my are but they lost the election\nI expect every Republican to vote for him and I expect Joe mansion and I had kept to represent their states or they will be defeated I think they're going to lose anyway but they will most certainly be defeated you need to call your senator two two two to four three one two one two oh two two to four three one two one and tell them\nWhatever way they are voting on Kavanaugh they need to denounce\nThe malignant evil slander against him Tom Cotton was on face the nation after day cut number twenty three\nKavanaugh hundred percent denies these allegations\nThere's not a single bit of corroborating evidence every evidence that we do have to include the people that mess for herself name either don't recall this instead or they denied that it happened you find this is four and a doctor horn kind of\nMiss Ford was sympathetic and she was sincere she's been victimized by the Democrats in this process John they portrayed her own requests for confidentiality they leaked to the media the last minute because they were on a search and destroy mission for ... Kavanaugh said only last talked in November I think it's important that women feel they can come forward\nIt's going to change the norms any expectations of our society a woman came forward here\nAnd you're saying basically she said nothing credible how can women come forward if when they do they're they're told they're not credible\nShe came forward confidentially Dianne Feinstein time Feinstein did not share that with the proper authorities Chuck Grassley her counterpart with him she served for decades in the FBI that could have reviewed this matter confidentiality confidentially then they leave it to the media and re reading the circus environment you're saying for the last two years\nNow he went on cut number twenty four\nOn first off what's understand why they had to have this hearing\nThis for these allegations and accomplish a letter to die Feinstein in July shortly after ... Kavanaugh was nominated there or not he was nominated Chuck Schumer the Democratic leader\nSaid that he would do everything in his power to stop the nomination and that's what happened for three months the Democrats have turned the advice and consent process and so I search and the story mission these allegations are completely an supported by any evidence what evidence there is twenty thirty six year old climb\nAll support judge Kavanaugh's denial but then the Democrats have disgrace this process and the United States Senate and the orchestrated smear campaign of character assassination they've run against us Kevin hair argument of course was that doctor for an ass to have his housing confidentiality and if they tried to do that\nAnd that's what it was what ... I don't know no no no no John let me talk to you about that when they talk to your listeners about your views about that there's a well established process of confidentiality on the committee Dianne Feinstein could have showed that letter to Chuck Grassley and the two of them as the leaders that committed to share that with the FBI and could have discreetly conducted\nThis increase in July and August without betraying miss sports confident says and they have betrayed her they pointed out to lawyers Who Lied to her and did not tell her that the committee staff was willing to go to California to interview her all that now all that water under the bridge those laws\nYou have to face a D.C bar investigation and in the midst their misconduct time Feinstein and her staff is going to face and investigation for why they leak that all this could have been done discreetly happens hundreds upon hundreds of times every year and then this year it's made it doesn't happen\nAnd then more Tom Cotton ... twenty five to John any impact this entire episode has had on women's willingness to come forward and report sexual assault trying carts and also do immediately after it happens\nIt's caused by the Democrats is caused by Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Schumer not respected her request for confidentiality smell when you come forward with an accusation as serious as the U.S it has to be tested against the evidence and against ... and we would have known that\nConfidentially inside of the ... are wasting its time [noise] I don't know what I don't know what the FBI going to find that the media is not already found\nAt the Kennedy staff has already interviewed all the witnesses that mess forced out of the interview miss forward and judge Kavanaugh for six hours after judge and she sent him a letter that was an interview and you're not right about that\nSo they've either interview them or they receive letters under penalty of perjury I sat for now these are actual interview so I'd be surprised if any of these people under penalty of perjury change\nTheir statements that they've already given this year well ...\nRight yeah one or cut from cotton because then the that is the bottom line you do not lie in a letter that subject you to perjure you do not change your story when they arrived to talk to your personal pet twenty six\nJohn we already know what everyone who's alleged to be at the party has said that committed statements urban interview under penalty of perjury I Would be shocked if any of them change her statement under penalty of perjury to the FBI but if this makes you senators more comfortable about going forward and voting on judge Kavanaugh is\nVery highly qualified nomination in in the face of an orchestrated democratic smear campaign then was

in his testimony on Thursday I thought that was show real so powerful so Ross who sad and heartbreaking because you can imagine what his family has gone around\nAnd and you know I I have to repeat that I'm embarrassed for the the way that watch has behave and I'm not the only one I talked to a lot of people who had shared that same sense and that's who have been crossed you'll have been on both sides of the\nI'll and and and it's it's\nAll I have talked to women only callers this morning at one eight hundred and five two oh one two three four had a half dozen already and they are angry too

media with it and gave it to the media and made it into the media and that person's going to go to jail that person is going to go to jail they called back and they said sorry I made that up but it's

three four has with the first two hours I'm only talking to women callers today and boy are they serious indeed there is a serious backlash growing against Democrats for their descent into McCarthyism over Brett Kavanaugh but the Saturday Night live mocking of him for the latest reporting I turned to Mike Allen of Axios\nAm Mike good morning I Am told my reporting is that Mitch McConnell may bring a file for cloture tonight which would mean the culture about would be Wednesday and the title broke on Thursday you have any country or additional supplemental reporting on that\nSays you can tell you that the White House and Capitol Hill or access to it as very quickly reporting in the New York times this morning that the president in an epithet\nLay the call we would call a had a school to\nMitch McConnell and later said that they should have just dam bond with this through earlier and you here's why the hurry actually has popped up a story saying that Brett Kavanaugh is too big to fail now this is the administration to you\nThat it's Brett Kavanaugh ... or ... they do not have a plan B there is not someone that that there is not when they're preparing to send in the game that for some reason Brett Kavanaugh should go down and and it's fascinating a quote from a someone who is involved in this process\nWho said that they're worried\nThat any male nominee he could have what they call the Kavanaugh problem and the source a jock swan dominate any man and\nYou worry about neck and it's thirty six years old how do you vet or that\nThat that is in fact what I'm hearing but interestingly Mike I'm winning my calls today to women because they are worried about their husbands\nSons and grand sons they're worried that McCarthyism in the short end McCarthyism is defined as the taking of a terrible charge that is true in some contacts as against the Rosenbergs and his and applying it to innocent people as it was against the Hollywood blacklist\nAnd ruining their lives as a consequence here we have genuine me to where it's like ... a Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby and a number of people in our business who have been outed as sexual predators being applied to Brett Kavanaugh with ... euro evidence one bit of testimony from Dr Ford which the women were calling this morning are not buying\nAnd they are furious I think I Can't go and blow the water as we speak and Joe mansion in diving in and I'm sad\nTo say that I was so disappointed in Chris Coons who I think is one of the nicest people in\nWashington not standing up for the righteous outrage of judge Kavanaugh what are you hearing\nTo do it there's no question is emotional when I can tell you that there's a lot of women who are angry and even you feel violated and ah\nI can tell you that uh this is in addition to the point of view the you express like there's another one which is that\nThis could be a problem for Republicans is it looks rushed Republicans should have called for an FBI investigation earlier they should not\nLet it be perceived as being extremely constrictor constricted and limited as it is being perceived they should have a real FBI investigation and then everybody would feel more confident in the result will be better for Brett Kavanaugh it'd be the Supreme Court for short for sure for sure\nWould be good for any Republican who's on the ballot\nYeah Mike I I have to say that I think that's how it's being perceived inside the beltway but in my ten phone calls this morning I have done more reporting of women outside of the beltway that every other talking had I have seen who have been repeating left and right both pro Kevin on culture cabin on I'm actually\nTalking to women and they they can't get through their seminar callers we know how to do under this Nineteen years we know how to find first time caller to are outraged and the reporting is Contra what the blue bubbles or the newsrooms believe and I don't know how we break out it is one of the things they're mad about is one point of view\nHas been wildly over represented in the media this week and I don't watch box because I I don't like confirmation bias I watch MSNBC and CNN and the wild over representation of anti cabinet sentiment is in fact fueling the outrage by people who think he's getting slammed\nThe only good news for him is that uh he's been played by Matt Damon and you know as as permanent ...\nWell yeah but that also feeds into I saw that and I thought\nThat Damon who at the ... you don't have to agree with me on this who has contributed very little to the public good as far as I Know comes on and mosques have good man\nIt would be like mocking in the army McCarthy hearings show Welsh Matt Damon should go and play Joe Welsh in the army McCarthy hearing and say have you know decency and the Mets buttering venom filled spittle flex rage because that's the parallel\nAnd it is McCarthyism Mike and I think everyone who stands by and let the good man gets married who has a ten year old and a fourteen year old daughter and a wife and parents they are complicit\nIn this that's why I you can tell I'm furious I didn't even know Brett Kavanaugh I've ever spoken to in my life but I'm a dad and I just cannot imagine this\nYou another piece of reporting was popped up on ... years and this is related to the ... or ... idea a swan is picked up that\nWe could well have a four four court for a while if for some reason the captain our nomination does not work out and do you add to that that a Democratic Senate certainly is a more likely than it was about to go\nThere is no sentiment inside the White House for nominating somebody that Democrats would confirm Swann has started shooting a quote from a source with direct knowledge of the president's thinking who said if Kavanaugh doesn't make it\nAnd the Senate flips I think the court is for for for the next two years\nIs that it's not going to put that and and uh I don't doubt that that is true I I Believe that if if the Senate flipped I don't think they'd come from anyone but I Will tell you this ah the president when recess appointment someone who had nominated between then and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski I just don't believe they are going to be complicit in this I still think it's going to be fifty three forty seven\nBecause Joe mansion and Heidi Heitkamp will lose their seats almost inevitably Joe Donnelly is going to lose any Bill Nelson is going to lose Josh Hawley you've got a two point lead over a Claire McCaskill it's going to grow in Missouri calls this morning\nI just think the Senate the Democrats in the Senate are in the Bible and they really don't know what's going on out there these red states Mike Allen and I don't know if it don't you find it odd we haven't seen any polling\nPulling on on Kavanaugh and which way the public is moving the only thing I saw I was in West Virginia where eight out of ten people believe Kevin should be confirmed\nIt or what is it a point that makes you most optimistic\nAbout Republican Jeff Flake saying that unless something new came out of my point is is a Josh Hawley being upon Claire McCaskill Kevin Cramer extending his
