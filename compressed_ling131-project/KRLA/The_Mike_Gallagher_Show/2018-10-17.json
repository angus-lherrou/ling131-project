I've been told by the many people I've talked to about this about\nA half an hour ago Muhammad ... posted this Saturday website says Riyadh authorities will some and the Fifteen people brands with turkey claimed to where they hit team that killed ... close friends to ask them what they were doing and if the ball and the day 'cause she'll be died what do you see happening David\nWell the music the mood music for a while has indicated that Saudi Arabia would pin the blame on some scapegoat in their security services\nThat turkey was likely to accept that explanation or as long as Saudi Arabia acknowledged that your mouth show he had been killed inside the confidence in his temple and that seems like the way things are headed at this hour last night of a well informed\nSource or who knows what the courts up to a told me that Saudi Arabia\nHad identified the person they're going to say is responsible he put it Maurice Lee and said the person that is responsible or someone in the intelligence services who knows crown prince Mohammed bin Salman personally and felt like he he this person in charge of had the authorization to carry out some kind of rendition and that went horribly wrong\nUm if you've been following Saudi Arabia or you've been following this story that does seem terrifically plausible but it's convenient for Saudi Arabia or for turkey and for the United states to find a way to move on\nAnd this is the Henry the second defense from when the English King said ... will no one read me of this troublesome praised him for his lights go off and solder Thomas Beck and Ken America the drill it works and you know the twelve hundred in the ... century I'm not sure it works today David absent\nPublic judicial proceeding with the west can pursue what ...\nWhat what has worked me you know for them and governments make do with a partial truths fairly often uh the quarter public opinion is a different matter I think at this point are after all that we've seen\nLeaked by Turkish officials and all this been confirmed it's going to be hard for crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to repair his ... his reputation\nYou know he got pretty far in the west as a reformer and somebody was going to open up became them kind of an innovator and a new kind of leader for Saudi Arabia I think he's going to have a lot of trouble now getting that kind of selfies with Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg that he's been accustomed to\nIn fact the person that has been identified to you by a good source as likely to be\nPointed to as the prime mover rendition gone bad\nUm import cage NBS in ordering the rendition does that important do you do you think the royal court changes in succession [noise]\nA two elements there first of all I think this person this intelligence official who was going to take the blame if that person has tried that person will be tried in that Saudi court so that's not the kind of court we're used to wear the defend it might have an opportunity to blame the ground perhaps\nA second of all a you know in the past a crown prince who came under this kind of a cloud might have trouble with the succession\nEt cetera has changed crown prince ... consolidated power like no figure in the kingdom in decades he holds all the key\nLevers and so the best handicapping if there's no reason to change if we're going to challenge him a while there are many people in the kingdom who are enjoying criticizing him over that he's made many enemies along the way none of them seems to have\nEnough heft or to push him out a lot of succession as long as you're dead is okay with it is dead is elderly and may not be that company right now\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo wrapped up a very brief meeting with the king ah not too long ago and she expected me with NBS when he's there\nI'm expecting that he will I don't know the details of his schedule\nThat show is is it possible that\nThere is within the guy and this was just a range of possibility or giving that having a second option which is your ... responsibility but not a guild\nAnd the other one as you say someone was trying to take me out the rogue operative was actually working to advance the exiled faction of the royals that I had improved the Ritz Carlton has that been floated anywhere you\nKnow you know it to be honest a cynical as I Am I expected that is what they would go with a expected we would hear that there's rogue operative was associated with some old regime\nBut in fact what I'm told we're going to hear is that the rogue operative as someone who actually was a friend of crop respond but Solomon\nWho felt like he had the okay from the crown prince to do this rendition and who was trying to make a name for himself who was trying to impress everybody with his daring do and be a quote unquote James Bond and it went horribly wrong\nThat is the Henry the second I had as pure Henry the second Thomas back at a parallel will that be enough for the ...\nBut states John Bolton that I talked about this at that point he said we don't have the fact that the middle east anything is possible that was last Thursday would the Henry the second offends me six a sufficient for the United states\nWell a key question here is has turkey shared it's intelligent red turkey Turkish officials have leaked many people including me that they are in possession of audio and maybe video of from inside the conflict showing who did what in the ... you know they've got they've got the goods\nIf they've shared that wish there U.S intelligence got her pies who often work very closely with the Turks are then that's one thing and if they haven't if they've only briefed about it that's another that that diminishes the degree of seriousness for the U.S diminishes the pressure on the U.S\nTo try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared really\nStart now does that impact for example the war in Yemen and this is actually where I come home this is the anti Iran alliance being straps this is Jordan and Egypt and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel and America\nTrying to confront the who the judge or sending rockets into Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran does this break that anti Iranian alliance which many of us have welcomed as being a necessary course correction in the middle east [noise]\nUh I'm not sure that has any impact on the Iranian allies I I'm not I I don't see the United Arab Emirates or Israel or Egypt showing any squeamish this whatsoever about what's been done here\nAnd so far it looks like President Trump is very willing to accept this explanation he was even yesterday you know getting ahead of the Saudis and already suggesting that this was a rogue operator before the Saudis had begun to float that explanation\nAnd the Dow is up a hundred Nineteen oil is leveled off at Seventy one Nineteen gold is at twelve thirty three and a ten year treasury bond which is the marker bond
