creates such a picture is seen as more than five hundred hot air balloons from over a dozen countries penalty area sky and to give you a taste of what's transpiring right now as we speak\nAnd why it's such a popular of and joining us on the show hotline is tight young president of the Albuquerque fiesta [noise] hello Hi thanks for joining Mary ...\nHello there my pleasure good to be with you\nWell good to have you here with us I Know you've got a lot going on right now we'll get right into it you know as we speak right now just after eleven am eastern time a little bit after nine AM mountain time on October sex set the scene for us on exactly what's happening right now at the forty seven annual Albuquerque international balloon fiesta\n[noise] well it it's art kicked off day and we had a full mass ascension today with nearly all of our five hundred and sixty seven balloons and a box wind effect was in play today so it really kept the blue here the field there's still a few up even though it's warming up quickly and it is just been a perfect day for us\nFor wow that's good to hear it's high I think one of the things that we all think about whether we tend to the ... or not we see me that kind of photos of all of these ... going up and she just described yeah and I think people you know we're all familiar with the teardrop traditional shape the land that there are some other shape as well correct\nCorrect or a special shapes we have Ninety eight special shape allude to here including probably my favorite a new addition to fiesta does yours is ahead of van Gogh and it's it's really a unique balloon [noise]\nI've got to be and I just ask you what does the person who owns that balloon in shape of that event do do with the balloon when he's not entering it in the Albuquerque mass ...\n[noise] they actually travel around the world and go to different little events were obviously the largest and gender the premier event in the in the world as far as the only immunity goes but they do travel around and uh I Would say every two weeks or so they're flying somewhere\nThat sounds expensive who's paying for that\nYou particularly with that but what I don't know but it's often a friday but it's a love affair sometimes there's a corporate sponsor involved like we have candidates are presenting sponsor and their ... travels around the world you're round for my heritage and it was spreading good will\nRead some of the air so I so tight listen you know told you been attending the balloon fiesta now for more than forty five years and I've been suggest I said this last there I've been suggesting the marry that we should bring the program out there at some point and broadcast live from on air balloon but for people listening right now who might not be real keen on balloon flying\nOut what else can they do or see when they attend the event\nOh gosh well first would love to have your broadcast from out here and then I promise you you'd love to be here or there are big law events every day or we have a music but one day that's next Saturday with\nOld Dominion headlining the number one is in the country right now uh they're chainsaw curbing which is a national competition or car shows there's concession row with over a hundred vendors that are opening day roundly of evening night glows where the luge or on the ground\nAnd they light up we'd go ... like a big\nScandal in the sky and there's something there's something to fill your time the entire time\nWell last question really for so how many times have you traveled in a hot air balloon\nBoy if I had to get to be over a hundred\nOver a hundred and ... and your favorite thing about it\nA duck pretty quality and and the smile everybody seems to get immediately when you're around them with a

know I really I was just going to give give give the website and then I I Know you were saying something but I Want to go check out the red light cameras all these different things balloon fiesta dot com ballooned fiesta dot com so room sorry what were you saying\nOh I just wondered how they keep the balloons from like it when you're doing that many balloons going up at one time they keep ... bumping into each other I mean\nI I Would I'm curious about that in fact well something for us to go check out our eyes I don't regard I Know\nGo up and down to ... by increasing either decreasing it but uh well I Know they have\nThey have pilot competitions based on accuracy not speed so I'm sure that they're they're all kind of plant in the air I Would think\nI've got a different news story here that I'm just going to hit on before because I thought it'd be funny and it's a different type of flying so maybe Rudy ah maybe really this is why you got out of dodge if you will and you're over in the u._k. but if you're headed to Minnesota anytime soon it might be a good idea to plan and wearing goggles in Helmand in the north of Minnesota peculiar round dilute and Gilbert\nMany birds including Robbins in Cedar wax wings are flying into windshields right now bumping into treason buildings in acting completely disoriented and why\nWell the area police say that there's no need to worry the birds are just a little drunk I frankly I've never heard of this but apparently it happens every time you know this time of year hot and it's a result of the bird eating berries fermented earlier than usual due to an early for us the Minnesota\nSo it seems to reverse migrants don't have a boy I saw a report yesterday from the University of Wisconsin I did actually said that this ... usually happens in late winter early spring but if you go to Minnesota that's been the birds are acting a little while to\nCalifornia has its fires earthquakes ministers got drunk burn out rate we're

shortages and emerging technologies come into what Scott\nShow returns in Britain [noise]\n\nJoin Robert Marion Rudy calling eight hundred three eight seven eight oh two by four follow us on Facebook and Twitter are em world travel we're coming right back\nWater essentially very quiet a retelling\nAutomated helicopters and use those to replace a taxi isn't over Lake Michigan being able to fly in urban areas\nWow yeah I've seen some of them out there I said what's left a unpack that a little bit more here because back in may Bonnie send me the president of Jet Blue ventures she was an act upon herself she was on the program with us and we talked a little bit about one of the companies that they're supporting the suit in Iran which essentially is developing regional electric aircraft\nSo with what you just said and combined with what soon and arrows doing\nFar along as this technology pat you know in a world where Tesla electric cars are now navigating our streets\nWill it be that long before we're seeing electric Thomas planes flying our skies\nWere at the beginning of it but a lot of factors or race\nIn this too and I'm very quickly much more quickly that I've ever seen in our industry so type thing is a a an airliner at what we call it the whole electric airplanes and that promises to bring down direct operating costs things to him issue\nAnd then the other side of that is white little helicopters at what time is both of these together is ... and the stuff that we've learned from the automotive industry in hybrids and electric propulsion and using that in airplanes to do sort of the same thing where we're reducing the cost of the nation\nBut we're also doing it to make a mission that we couldn't do before so these\nLittle helicopters it might have a whole bunch of little rotors we we couldn't have gas and you hear that electric propulsion and many different ways is allowing this\nLarge expansion in fields of aviation I find\nThat fascinating side would think that reducing emissions is one of one of the items that what are some other overriding implications that some of it's a lecture and cannot time is technology is going to have I guess in aviation but also for all of that here on the ground [noise]\nIt's kind of funny um the FAA has been\nConservative in the certification of our town it's like when you move to a lecture by propulsion that has to be baked into that high already so it's a little bit of a Trojan Horse or moving forward the automation on airplanes I'm Talking you know relatively sophisticated automation because\nMost airlines right now have the capability of flying from the same as they take up who when they land by themselves so we're talking about automation has a point of airplanes making decisions on rooting and stuff like that by themselves and that was brought on by like by proportional as well\nI I Love the technology to ... you can hear the personal connection that you have to have passionate about it and I thought really ... it was interesting your comment about wishing that you were the seats versus in\nFront of the board but that was really nice to connect with the day we thank you very much for
