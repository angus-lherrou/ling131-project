evidence they that's what we've been saying all along\nThey don't even that's not even that process there's no federal crime here\nThere is no police agency like the Maryland police department investigating all they can do is take her reports and present their findings to the Senate that's all they'll do there's not going to be a conclusion from the FBI they're not going to say aha we found out she's lying\nOr aha we found out he's while he was lying next they're not going to find that they're going to find witnesses who are\nPotential corroborating witnesses to the accusers and they're

testimony\nOr you can get the report all you do is ... the key word memo to one eight hundred six five five six four or five three will send you the report in full you could read the whole thing it's

memo\nTo eight hundred six five five six four or five three to your phone calls here's Len Len thanks for hanging out with his how're you\nDoing good good you know we keep saying that uh the FBI does not come to conclusions they just record the activities of the accused however with call me in investigating Hillary\nCame out with this big announcement that they come to the conclusion that there was no no no prosecutor would bring charges against her go\nTo a good point I mean it's you know it is I mean we have to remember is that what this amounts to as a as a seven background check this is not the kind of\nFBI investigation or special Bob Mueller as special counsel dragging on and on and carrying on for this is a background investigation this was interviewing people putting in a report what they said fine if there's any cooperation looking at the corroborating witnesses talking to them and putting it in reporting given it to the Senate Judiciary committee that's all it is\nUm and and that's I'm not going to be satisfied anybody as the weak progress as I think but maybe it will be enough for some senators to vote yes including a couple of Democrats Chris welcome how are you crash\nI'm doing well my point I wanted to bring up with a personal one where\nMy mom was sexually assaulted in the worst matter and I won't use the word you can imagine what I'm Talking about or an almost put put away and murdered and um she she had something with me the other day about that before that really made a lot of sense she said the\nTestimony where she talks about going into the supermarket to say hello to the accuser or one of the accusers that would never happen\nThat would never happen my mother couldn't even go into a shopping mall for years and not what she had to face the accuser record and and in a line up\nYour she's not going to say Hi to the guy in a grocery are not going to say how did they think about it why would you\nDid you hear the Lindsey Graham line about the the woman who claimed that she witnessed gang rapes going on at ten parties after the first one do you think you'd go back nine more times you gotta\nIf you're watching my ideas yeah lots of ... lots of questions I'm very reluctant to question the credibility of an accuser only because I'm mindful that and I said there's a million times there are lots of women who've been abused and sexually assaulted they had no corroboration and they were utterly alone\nThey lost their jobs they've lost their careers you've heard the stories and uh you know you can't read these stories and hear about some of these accounts even yesterday Jeff Flake was some event in Boston we are going to play some video and audio from that\nBut that is why I think Jeff Flake is a is a no he's playing to the media is playing to his Democrat friends and there were a bunch of people standing in the front rows of whatever event he was at in Boston holding up signs saying I was a sexual assault survivor\nOr I'm a survivor or something like that and and honest to goodness I I I I feel great compassion for anybody who has been assaulted who's been attacked to has been um victimized and they got nowhere to go uh\nAnd and they work maybe in a in a in they happened in the workplace and they had a powerful man who did this to them and they got nowhere to go um in in but the problem is it's a double edged sword\nNow you you have a woman coming forward late in the game because of the Democrats the eleventh hour making ...\nAccusation that has been countered\nBy the passionate fiery response of of Brett Kavanaugh that makes people think that's exactly what I Would sell like if I were falsely accused pack your next step on the calendar she'll get a lot of trying to get as many calls and as we can do they Hi Pat welcome how are you\nA quick question that will make you like me and then I'm going to say something that's gonna make you\nFeel like you already don't make me hate you come I yeah I yeah

some reporter for the New York times who had been tweeting anti\nKavanaugh opinions over the summer discovered that in Nineteen eighty five judge Kavanaugh through some ice at a man in a bar [noise]\nNow you think I'm joking you you if if you're not paying attention to this um I Know you think I'm pulling your leg let me repeat that the New York times has discovered that Brett Kavanaugh allegedly through some ice at a man in a bar in Nineteen eighty five\n[laughter] no one would think the whole nation would be laughing at such an absurd reveal especially in Nineteen eighty five that's thirty three years ago Brett Kavanaugh would have been Twenty one in college\nAt Yale got involved in some kind of an altercation in a bar and through some ice\nAt a man now\nAnd that's the extent of it I mean nobody was arrested nobody went to jail the New York daily news has a cover that is reminiscent of like the one that Hynden bird crashed\nBoozy breath all question do I might sound effect that's why my echo chamber we've got to work on that because I Need to put this in an echo chamber\nBoozy birds all questioned by cops he was questioned by cops in uh Nineteen eighty five bar

have a little sister come on we're done with Brett Kavanaugh this is where we are now I laugh on the outside I'm Crying on the inside\nAnd\nNow even the the meat the mainstream media is calling out the New York times for this dreadful piece think about what the media has done thinking about the role of the media has played NBC News\nCory Booker Colorado or rather Cory Gardner\nA Democrat in Colorado gets an anonymous letter no return address NO NAME no nothing judge Kavanaugh I don't know raped me or rape my daughter raped my daughter's friend or something just totally out of NBC ran with it and be she actually literally reported that\nAnonymous led some nut in their basement could have written NBC a letter just to see what would happen\nOr ... or rather Cory Gardner a letter and

got a letter anonymous no attorney name Noah turn address Brett Kavanaugh gang raped people oh okay that's on N. B. and B. C. news\nMy gosh real journalists have to be flipping in their graves Edward Murrow pioneers of I I think about the great publishers of our time\nAnd so now the New York times article written by a reporter named Emily base a lot\nYeah sure sure I'll eat and Andy Andrew a Kaczynski and others are pointed out that this particular New York times reporter was tweeting anti Kavanaugh opinions over the summer\nI think about that she's not columnists like you know Maureen Dowd she's a reporter for the New York times signs their story\nWent through I sit in Nineteen Ninety five at a bar so little haven't [laughter]\nI mean and people wonder why Americans lows the media but I give credit to address present skiing yeah sure Ali and others who are pointing out yeah sure I lead to each family the reporter should have\nNever been assigned to this story or have her byline on it not a good look because it doesn't take long you go back\nTo July ... over the summer that same New York times reporter tweeted and I quote her name is Emily bays Alon here's your tweet\nFrom July night quote as a Yale Law school grad and lecture I strongly disassociate myself from tonight's praise of Brett Kavanaugh with respect\nHe's a fifth vote for a hard right turn on voting rights and so much more that will harm the Democratic process and prevent a more equal society\nThat's that's objectivity bats professionalism that today's New York times\nIn any other normal time in our nation's history heads would be rolling in the newsroom was in New York Times some might get fired when you're in opinion lady you're you're you're you're trashing Trump uh trashing Kavanaugh rather and Trump I'm sure in the summer\nAnd now you're right you know a big bombshell here's a bombshell I mean I I I I heard this play out less I thought no no no this is not this is a real this can't be\nNew York times as an undergraduate student at Yale Brett Kavanaugh was involved in an altercation at a local bar during which she was accused of throwing eyes on another patron according\nTo a police report [noise]\nI I don't know how these guys aren't so embarrassed by their own behavior how they have no self respect no dignity no no [noise]\nIt's it's stunning it's unbelievable\nAnd every day we come to work thinking the American people are going to be so disgusted by this crap\nThat hey they're going to make sure that I mean there there's there's got to be Republicans and maybe even a couple of Democrats who are going to push back against this nonsense\nThere were reports Mitch McConnell is saying that the vote may come later this week majority leader Mitch McConnell said yesterday the Senate will vote this week on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nUm if it is believed that the FBI is about to wrap up its investigation it's seven background check I don't know what's gonna happen I Wish I could give you some some some confidence productions I don't know what the answer will hold but I Do
