we were asked by a a young couple there\nFive this was myself and Dennis and and and Larry Elder we're asked what would be your primary advice for raising a child from a young couple of was expecting their first child\nAnd they want to just one thing one bit of advice then escape for but um I uh I mentioned the Senate\nBecause whether you're religious or not religious whether you're Jewish or Christian whatever you want to have a period of time that is set aside that is in violent\nWhere you can stress not just the urgent but the important not just the immediate puts a timeless\nThat is a real gift and\nIn that context there's this one story we put it out in our newsletter are newsletters available to him by the way everybody should sign up we we have literally tens of thousands of people who have signed up\nAnd I hope you will to its free completely free just go to Michael med dot com sign up for the newsletter we put in this obituary which is remarkable for a truly truly remarkable man and one of the greatest unsung heroes of World War two\nAnd he was playing poker if the Jewish lithuanian club Chicago and one day just before Russia shutting not that far from the time of year\nOf one of the they were playing poker and one of the one of his fellow said don't go to Russia shot a service is this your how can we go to high holiday services issue where was God and when we needed help and everybody stopped talking and it does in the air when people didn't talk about their experiences in the Holocaust I seldom heard\nOne person says there is no God get over it we're out around the next person at the table says a ... that\nThis was a failure of of people look at all of our Christian neighbors they watched as we were deported in in my father's case watch this my father's father was murdered my grandfather was murdered and did nothing [noise]\nAnother person said you know what we can't understand the world Israel wouldn't have happened without the Holocaust show what greater good even though that's hard to stomach a greater good came from all from six million people being murdered\nAnd since then I've always wondered about that court question that people asked which is how can a nominee benevolent God allow evil on earth and so I've been in a way of thinking about these questions since before I was bar mitzvahed\nAt and they'd been bubbling with me and I've I've as I've grown older I've heard so many people say that it's not rational to believe in God and run with all we know about science and the history of the of the Bible and and modern morality and frankly I think that's totally wrong\nI've read all the books I read all the books that Richard ... not all of them but I read most of what Richard Dawkins wrote Christopher Hitchens Daniel done it even you've all Harare and I'm Steven Pinker and people would say well I read sapiens and I'm an atheist or read to read ... Hawkins and I'm an atheist and let's say\nYou have a really sat down and thought about these things and I\nYou know figured if nobody's doing it a in a way that I'd like where I'm going to do it in a way that are right\nNow you where did you grow up I grew up in Chicago did grow up in Chicago um and you you were raised what as as a nominal do was was was was your Jewish faith a central to your life in any way was this just something that you had privately going on\nMostly it was private so when my father arrived ... into the right one more I met ... just one more to more words about my father my father was liberated was sixty pounds [noise]\nUm he had been slave labor he had been in the concentration camps and luckily was liberated by the Americans who nursing I'm ...\nPounds ... set is practically impossible to think of\nIf he had been liberated uh we have ... if he had been liberated a week later he would have been debt I wouldn't be here today I mean he was on the verge of death\nAnd so he had watched his father be murdered his uh his brother was murdered his uncles were murdered my closest relative as a second cousin once removed basically um everybody was murdered and so\nShe was one of those folks who was certain that there was a God and he was certain that there was a God because so many things happen during the course of getting to Chicago that they couldn't have happened unless there was a God in his in his mind but he was angry at got\nAnd you know what he had a right to be yeah and I think there was and he so he didn't speak to ... went to services made sure we were there and Russia shutting 'em ... rolled meaning Hebrew school but he wasn't going to sell God and I think they were both God and my father were giving each other the silent treatment\nThen you know I think both sides understand what was going on [laughter] wow wow wow wow\nOkay so so you go or you go into finance ... been successful founding banks and a\n... at what point did did you settle in your mind and that you believed in God was that something that that that happened early honors or something much more recently as you're struggling with these an atheist books well\nThat journey started actually I was at the Chicago public schools in that journey actually started when I was a freshman in high school\nI went to I was we were doing the dissection they still do the fetal pig\nYeah and I had had enough Hebrew school to know I've heard about the six day sort of thing and evolution versus creationism and I went up to my teacher I knew from us why a little bit he was which is a conservative Jewish youth group right mix of Mr do but\nI said we're ... we're learning about um ... you know how the fetal pig or you know goes goes through all the steps of it of its evolution right how does this square with the Bible\nAnd are already looked at me and he started a mother a few things and then he gave a shrug\nAnd I started thinking well look I'm not getting these answers here so is my ... by the time I was a junior I transferred myself into either crunch Jewish academy in Chicago and I said I'm going to at least know whether I Believe or I don't believe and that's really what started me on my head Ernie that's amazing\nAnd the funny thing is that ... ... ... ...\nIs not even true I mean in this day and age you know that that second art and that that was based on those ah what is it that the heckle drawings that they're they're just you know these things\nGet picked up and they put them in in textbooks and they go on and on and on and you know fifty years later they realize oh that that's wrong right\nAnd meanwhile you have an several generations of people who walk around it was on the test it's got to be right you know who knows a planet where do you want from me uh and then you really don't know that's not true actually so it is interesting\nUm but so yeah early on you actually decided that you you want it to know you are not everyone's like that everybody got crates assault differently but you really want to know what an early age so what happened where did you go to college where you at any kind of a a a God worshiper in college where were you\nSo I um the ... the importance formative thing for me which was I'm grateful for every day is when I transferred the Hebrew high school I learned to read the ...\nAnd then opened up a whole new world for me or not that there's anything against reading the text in any other language yeah but for me it just made my understanding much deeper\nAnd I became a sort of a lifelong speaker I consider myself a hopefully a lifelong learner I there was no magic moment where I suddenly became observance right um it was something that happened over time and I really really needed to reason my way to every step you know why should\nI keep ... why should I keep kosher I'm not one of those folks who just does stuff because other people are doing it so it it it took me literally decades and in this book is is to some degree some of the research I did started decades ago I was a ...\nI'm I'm trying to reason out well\nHow do you square evolution and God how do you square the creation of the universe how do you square modern morality with what we read in the Bible you know people have tremendous criticism ... so I had it thinks are each and every those questions for myself\nWell it's terrific or we're going to go to we're going to go to a break here but uh we are a talking to Scott Shea a and the book is in good faith questioning religion and atheism disease which actually so stick around [noise]\nHello\n[noise]\nI just don't see how my life can get any better\n[noise]\nIt's everything and she feels like everything around me is falling apart if something

it\nWell every person is corrupt double\nAnd um we I think a ... not enough attention is given to the real meaning of the way we juice counted the third commandment most Christians kind of the second commandment\nWhich is not to take God's name thing to take out said shop in Hebrew and it's the only of the ten commandments by the way for which there is no redemption of repentance that says that writing the commandments\nAnd what does that mean to me it means when people set themselves up to ...\nSeoul spokespeople for God and we've seen that in history we currently whenever anybody says look believe that you you don't ... don't believe in me because I mean believe me because I'm the soul\nI can give you the sole answer to what God wants all you can get in the same sort of trouble which is how ... the stick religions get in trouble right people say look just listening to me you don't have to go behind the curve don't bother reading the scriptures don't bother reasoning for it right All right\nThat's that fast and then of course that was the ... the loser issue I wrote a biography of Martin Luther and it's so fascinating because you realize that at the heart that\nHe wasn't really a\n... all he was doing really was challenging the authority of the church and the pope and saying look\nYou have to bow to a higher authority just as I Do and if you don't do that you have no legitimate authority and they said oh no no you're wrong well we'd say goes right we are the ultimate authority where the ultimate arbiter of what God says or didn't say you have no right even the question that and at that moment you realized\nTheir goose is cooked when you when you have that when you aggregate yourself that kind of power and authority you take the place of God\nWhich is really creepy yes and you Hadley\nYou've got and that's what Luther tried to do and you do an excellent job of showing of of of demonstrating that is to reclaim the Bible would learn the scriptures on your own see what it says you don't have to take the local priests opinion is it\nThat's I mean it's a tricky thing right because you don't want to or you don't want to say that everything is subject to whatever your point of view is is valid never know when I mean we're not saying that and Luther didn't say that right at the same time\nWe do need to take the responsibility to dig in for ourselves\nAnd to be careful not to just to listen to somebody because they seem like they're right but but to understand that they are falling human beings as well\nAnd we can't a ... at the end of the day it's between us in God and it's our responsibility when we come back folks will continue the conversation we're talking with Scott Shay S.

H. A. Y. the book is in good faith questioning religion and atheism and it's got to just great uh to get to know you a little bit and to to see the work you put into this\nBook I I Love the idea because it's it's so close to my heart of trying to get people to think for themselves about what is right in true and I mean I think the reason you and I want people to do that is because we actually believe that if you do that it will lead you to the God of the Bible you'll say holy cow this is true\nAnd I think so many people don't do that they kind of take whatever they kind of you know ... from the white guy says it blows by and they're not really going to go deeper if you go deeper you'll find that truth challenges does Ike guys that that ... where we are today or in the culture\nThat there's so much in this culture that is against God and against truth but we actually have to know that to stand against it\nRight I I a hundred percent agree there's so much bad fate part of the reason I titled the book in good faith is there's so much bad faith what people placed their faith and all sorts of things that don't make sense the good news about the Bible and about ... about worshipping\nDig out of the Bible is that while you can never proved got\nThe God of the Bible is a Bible that is a God that is consistent with reason so we have a reason to put our faith in that got people put their fate there was a recent Pew study of significant number of people in the United states think that their spirits and rocks that there are all sorts of strange things going on in the world\nAnd what I've tried to do is just show that you can only provide evidence I mean there was no way to stay you can prove there is a God and indeed I think and I go into the book\nWhy I think

has been arrested in Florida for these or what have been called pipe bombs none of exploded no one has been injured thank thank God uh twelve so far have been intercepted to high profile people mostly

that is the news as as as we have it right now the breaking news of today\nThere's also breaking news on the care of it\nAnd I want to get right to dispose of that now than it is joining us and the second half hour broadcasts were going to go right into the mid term elections were only eleven days out we got a lot to talk about the Senate and the house and races that are changing or some favorite Republican some favoring Democrats were going to get into all of that but let's first talk about the Caribbean\nBecause there's some news there as well uh let's go first to Tracy in Virginia on line to Tracy welcome to Jay Sekulow alive [noise]\nThank you so much I was curious when this started way that they were on your way up here and [noise]\nWell I think we know that there was a organization behind this or that started this I've got that they're actually base to the United states in in uh in Oakland, California way below sin Fronteras which means village Without Borders\nSo it's a U.S base in geo that funds these caravans this much larger\nThan the previous caravan that that we all kind of remember back in April\nThat started with about Fifteen hundred people dwindled down to around five hundred\nWho ultimately made it to the border more than a hundred of those were arrested for illegal entry some of the others were granted a their first level of asylum\nSo they were allowed ... asylum basis or what it appears as if this group one of their strategies may have been in that case is to dwindle the group down to those who could make a serious claim for asylum but this is a I get an activist organization\nBased in the United states working with leftist politicians in Central America the difference here is this caravan is much larger\nThe estimates are are anywhere between three four five six thousand all the way to fourteen thousand it's still pretty far away\nFrom the United states than but the president's taking steps the department of defense to secure our border and these two locations and even thinking about closing of border crossings using the executive order we fought so hard for on on the immigration and visas\nYeah a couple of things during the first of all and the origins of care of and I think it's crystal clear in this case it ... there were a lot of political motives are from the left for the origins of this a caravan but still even show it leaves the United states in the in the predicament of having to sort through what the group looks like in the end whenever approaches the boarder she you're going to have\nA certainly people that should not be allowed into the United states then you're going to have people that will claim asylum those will have to be processed according to the law by the way there are some some statutory changes it probably need to be made\nBut it is incumbent on the president to use all of the leverage that is available to him you mentioned the executive order he's already engaging the national guard the military to go down to the border of course he's also said that he would be denying foreign aid to countries that don't cooperate with us\nAnd Jordan I think maybe most importantly he has to distinguish between the countries that this caravan is passing through\nThat might have the capacity to work with us to stop it I mean you know Honduras Guatemala El Salvador they really didn't have the capacity to stop this hair ban\nBut Mexico does and you had seen the president engage the Mexican government or their ... seems like they're cooperating it seems like the the the goal here is to stop the caravan before I get here\nBecause Jordan if and when a group does get here the United states will have an obligation to didn't sort through whoever's there if the borders not shut down and determine who might have a legal point and\nThey were talking about a legal claim for asylum right which is different than immigration law and the ... you have to prove that your life is in jeopardy and you've got to have evidence of that\nYou also have to prove that the countries that you pass through we're not safe\nSo it's supposed to be the the first safe country you get to outside of your home country if you're looking for asylum is where you were supposed to declare settled that's under the un standards of international law and US law\nSo if you were someone fleeing Honduras because of a specific threat in Honduras and you've got to a town in Mexico or city in Mexico you should be claiming asylum there\nAnd the Mexican authorities would then go through that process about whether or not you meet the qualifications that we know people want to get to the U.S and we have allowed a I think the laws are not tough enough\nPeople to keep crossing through multiple countries and then heading to our border and they're making an asylum claim it get and say well you know I didn't really want these other places I couldn't be safe either in some cases individual cases that may be true\nHas it in some cases within the margin of error with Bob Cuban closing to within five five points of button and then ended at Menendez of course Jordan a bottom an index has been plagued with scandal over the last couple of years ... has run a very a good campaign he's a businessman he appeals to people that are maybe a little tired of the political process\nBut the fact that New Jersey is on the map\nTells me that the Republicans in or are in a very strong position in the United States Senate Jordan as we've talked about most of the political battlefield in the United States Senate is in Trump or states were carried by Donald Trump in Republican states as a ... Point New Jersey would certainly not be one of them and yet it's in play let's go to the president\nRight now he believes addressing the issue involving the hype\nOf that law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him and took us\n[noise]\nJob by law for us we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation to find that person or persons responsible for

America to do everything possible\nMake sure it's this individual and not a ... additional individuals as well prosecute them\nThe fullest extent of the loss of their you've heard from President Trump the announcement of the suspect being arrested but still law enforcement activities ongoing he's taking it very seriously also taking the mid term elections very seriously as well or we will continue

president said no place for political violence that our country\nProsecute them to the full extent of the law use all resources possible uh to uh make sure this person and anyone else was working with them or is apprehended a again it's important 'cause eleven days out from a midterm election people already voting early voting\nI'd has an impact I mean that's being tried to sell crass but it does um the care of an issue has an impact as well we want to get into the numbers we want to hear what you think what do you see in your state one eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten do Republicans have a shot\nAt keeping the house of representatives and maybe make some pretty big games\nAnd then the Senate big gains are three or four or five seats that's a big game because it's only a ... it's a a branch of government with only one hundred seats and so it's not really a question right now Republican majority in the Senate which is a lot different place from where we were just a few weeks ago\nA but how big that Republican majority could be eleven days long type of politics lot can happen but we update you throughout these time period because people are already voting so we want to make sure you kinda know since the layout of land I Want to start back do stay in New Jersey because I think it's so important this\nIs this is really the breaking news political of the day is it the cook Political Report which is very respected\nHas put the New Jersey Senate race which is incumbent Democrat Bob Menendez who's been there a long time has had a lot of legal issues but still no one thought he really had a chance of being beaten in a state like New Jersey though I remind you Chris Christie's\nA Christie Todd Whitman there are Republicans have won their before statewide um he's facing a businessman\nAnd that has been a move to a toss up tell us about them\nWell the reason it's so surprising is because it's New Jersey joined but the reason that they toss up is because of how hard the momentum is moving towards ... and I mean just a matter of a few weeks ago you were seeing polls are Fifteen and twenty point lead Shabaab ... even though his you know favorability race inside the state we're not that high he still had an enormous lead\nWhen you looked at the polls that has been closing and closing rapidly so the last poll I saw had it with it within the margin of error which if you are a an incumbent in a blue state running as a Democrat and the police shows it within the margin of there you have to be extremely worried and I think Bob Menendez is at this point but then when you zoom out a little bit Jordan you're right\nThe reason New Jersey tell such a story across the landscape the United States Senate\nIs because the Democrats Jordan cannot afford to lose a single sheet that they currently occupy and then they need to a U.S essentially sweep the competitive races that the Republicans\nAre defending if they're losing New Jersey Jordan it tells me that they are going to lose a lot of seats that they're holding and likely would not flip any that the Republicans are holding so you could be looking at a scenario where Republicans have fifty four fifty five fifty six\nFifty seven seats in the United States Senate if Bob Menendez is anywhere on the map\nJordan the Democrats are in a lot of trouble in the United States Senate\nAnd if if the house where to go Democrat but you have that kind of Republican majority of the Senate if it does give Republicans a lot more power bargaining power along with the president who's a Republican in the White House the executive branch\nUh to to deal I mean if you want to get things done first of all the Senate handles all the confirmation of officials and judges so it would not impact that if the house goes Democrat\nBut legislation obviously you want to be able to legislate get budget through make changes make fixes there's some big issues like immigration as well it would be a lot tougher with the Democrat majority but we're not there yet I mean I I Want to stay on the Senate first uh let's move to North Dakota this is one\nDo you say is is so key because I'm basically you wouldn't North Dakota that you know\nThe GOP at least keeps the Senate majority\nYeah North Dakota's the reason that I'm convinced that the Republicans are going to keep the United States Senate is just a matter of margin and here's why Jordan because Republicans come in with a fifty one to forty nine a seat advantage I think there are only two seats that that the Democrats still have a chance to pull away from the Republicans that's in Arizona and Nevada\nSo then if they held every other seat that they have Jordan or they would only have a one seat majority well I think they're going to lose the seat of North Dakota I think Heidi Heitkamp is going to lose the congressman Kevin Cramer\nAgain like we talked about New Jersey the numbers are just moving rapidly in his direction the difference here Jordan\nIs he is moving from a close race to a blowout raised in his favor as opposed to what Bob Menendez is doing which is closing the gap so I think that is going to be a be a flip to the Republicans and then if they if the Democrats when every other ... competitive seat on the map it would be a fifty fifty spread from Republicans and vice president Pence\nWould cast a tie breaking vote let me tell you something folks you are a politically in touch audience I Want to hear from you or eleven days out have you taken part in the early voting of what do you sensing in your own state\nAs you watch or even across the country because\nWe can all see kind of what's happening is we're national broadcast in different places but we'd love to hear from you one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one to enter your vigorously backing candidates have you already voted are you talking to your friends and family about where do you get the sense that the momentum is is about Republicans have behind Democrats and a lot of that will depend on\nWhere you happen to live and sometimes it's you know where you happen to live in what part of the state what part of a city\nThat you happen to live and give us a call we really want your thoughts on that one eight hundred six eight four thirty one and we know you all enjoy discussing politics and we have an opportunity to do it here was eleven days until the very important midterm election so we talked about North Dakota Tennessee of taxes these were two states than\nThe Democrats really had their eyes on in Tennessee\nIt was in the Senate race it was a Phil Bredesen former governor a running as a supposedly ... moderate Democrat versus a congresswoman a Marsha Blackburn a well known to people who are Fox News and conservative in the conservative world at that race was looking very tight and President Trump came down\nTo a couple of minutes go for that one state going to be at the soccer and I think that could be Michigan ... up against Debbie Stabenow\nThree weeks ago he was ... points down now seven and in some competitive various things either even or when he is a rock star if you have any ...\nFather once and Michigan check him I website and definitely tell I I can then several people already just telling about him that are close to vote for him so we we need to talk and communicate with our friends and neighbors and make them aware he has a wonderful ...\nThis was a lot of military experience right then and again was twenty points down just six weeks ago is surging right now in Michigan State that President Trump did carry I I agree with\nSurely I think this could be a shocker was on my list with Bob Menendez remember Donald Trump won Michigan Debbie Stabenow should be able to win that state but John James has run a terrific a campaign but I won't be surprised at all to wake up and twelve days and find out that John changes is never senator from it in\nA stab at all or imminent as losing for Democrats would just be historic for Republicans I Will put it that way those would be one of those two soccer's I think um maybe maybe both of the people who could have too shocking states let's keep going Billy in New Jersey on line three are really welcome to Jay secular life\nFirst I Want to thank you guys for all the work ... here in my prayers all the time\nUm yeah I hear you on the Republican in nature and I mean frankly shocked when Chris Christie one um but when it came on the ballot here in nature there's not even out what public and candidate and a lot\nAnd I think you know get your hands you know when we had a governor that ran on the platform charting New Jersey and toward sanctuary gay rights and actually one okay Chris Christie credit is that there is a complacent Republicans top shut out there but it's not going to happen and I\nI I think so and I think that's right but you do have this ah to give you some hope I get you I've lived in states and cities where\nThere are no Republican options no concern of options before a and a and it's disappointing but you've got a statewide race there that is very serious or was this a surging candidate against Bob Menendez let's mentioned that one more time than just quickly for people\nYeah you don't have that situation right now Bob ... and he is running a terrific campaign in New Jersey there is traction there so look it's not an opportunity where you can complain about who's on the ballot in this case you got a candidate that are right in the midst of Jordan\nAll right we've got two calls last let's take both of them Cindy in Missouri online six very quickly city you're on the air\n[noise] yeah Hi I'm hey I'm In Missouri and I just drove air states at St Charles Missouri Columbia, Missouri\nAnd I thought that is just totally and only one Claire McCaskill side so I don't say it but when you drive or evil or on fire for gosh probably\nAnother very close race within the margin of error but either candidate when turnout will matter just highly state attorney general\nState attorney general in ... won statewide I can tell her with the bull so they say the Josh holidays ahead\nYeah and so again but turnout matters let me tell you eleven days out early voting is occurring people are already casting about the need to be talking to your friends and family [noise] I'll probably be Cassie my ballot or the next few days and so I get a\nMany Republicans as interesting\nWait until election day and so sometimes those numbers are little lopsided we'll we'll keep coming
