cabinet hearings why\nWild because it's sort of awake and they sleep you will probably do well but more than that\nEspecially in Tennessee with the weather that is kind of a unicorn Democrat who who Republicans really do like in Tennessee and really did have a record of centrism is that it it sort of brought out in the election which is\nIf you're voting for blood then you're voting or you know possibly a Democratic Senate so Marsha Blackburn had I had a hard time making that case a for all sorts of reasons and the cabinet issue because basically make the case for her\nAnd it helps Tennessee revert to its standard partisanship that we would expect to see in a presidential election\nAnd that's what it's been such a big deal and the Senate races which are taking place than Republican states like Trump and that's why it has been such a problem or Senate Democrats and why it has probably take them to send it off the table for them so they just you know us does that\nDoes the atmosphere in about ten days or so\nRevert back to the need for what his mid term cycle has been but I wouldn't put food that from happening locally because\nThey've seen it before and twenty six they have the Access Hollywood tape in mid October and three weeks later Trump win elections don't [noise] I don't like the like the predictions but right now this is why it's looking really good ... in Tennessee and Republicans in other sent away\nSo I think when you're able to make the argument that vote for ... is a vote for Schumer is a vote for Dianne Feinstein is a vote for Cory Booker is a vote for Sheldon Whitehouse and it's ... ... is a vote for Mazie Hirono that it's very easy to remind people that\nFor thirty days it's hard to do that for a year but it's very easy to do that for thirty days

Senate candidates anywhere where the state is inclined to vote for a Republican but where you know per atmosphere reasons and for candidate raised in the states will\nFlirting with Democrats I look I I was in Indiana and North Dakota in August that I thought that those two candidates\nAre those two Democratic it's Thomas Donnelly and hike camp or trouble the Dali and hanging around the high camp I think there's been behind it they just really is a duck punch a darling I was hanging around see this in theory should help on\nA creates a distance we'll see if it does I'm Jon Tester in Montana the other one who had managed to\nWhen he's always a very good candidate to sway people underestimate him he had kept distance between him and Rosendale an outlook is caught him and I think that this has helped so anywhere where the playing field is designed to elect Republicans and elect than easily especially I think this was going to help in swing states like Florida\nI think it's an open question because the atmosphere are still generally favor Democrats and this is a state that swings with the wind is one of the reasons why I think when you look at Ohio in Pennsylvania the Senate races are still off the table\nYou know it is eight\nOr a lead allegation a Democrat for using this as a talking point but the mob rule if not I was angry about that before I was I was shocked when they broke through the barricades at the Supreme Court\nThe videos of the anti mob in Portland went viral yesterday I just think people have had it with the intimidation politics of the ... really had just had it and they're going to vote Republican is a rebuke to that more than they were going to vote\nAgainst Donald Trump for his occasional cruelty and his bowling the China shop stuff they're really angry at those politics on the hell am I right am I wrong\nWell I think it depends on where the voters are I think you're right where the voters are inclined to vote Republican and where the partisanship is designed that way I think you still have a lot of house district and you have some of these swing states where the president's they'll get a dominating\nAnd and I think that you know for for for Democrats that the danger in this thing lasting\nIs that they lose the ads they have had with independent too of what the Republicans and President Trump and send you all parties and\nWe've had enough of you I mean that's just been the view\nAnd it's replaced by looking at Democrats saying basically there's no difference between you and them so maybe I vote for him maybe I don't maybe I vote for Republicans maybe I stay home and that's that's the danger for Democrats I don't think that in a midterm cycle that we've gotten this far along that the the\nThe apple carts and it could be completely reverse and you're just going to have the review switch the other way\nBut I think it's done I'm including model um the battlefield\nAnd it could reduce the number of seats Democrats to pick up possibly enough that they don't win the house majority or they end up winning house majority but by just a few seats and it's definitely\nGoing I think to cost them a chance to pick up the Senate
