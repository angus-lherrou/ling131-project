speak the senators are reviewing the FBI report the wall Street Journal is reporting that the wall ... that the for the FBI report contains not down\nTheir nose is no cooperation is what we're hearing so far who knows I don't know I hold my breath and hope for the best but senators are reviewing this\nThey're being very careful about not being revealed there are witnesses there are people involved but according to the wall Street Journal\nThere has been no corroboration of the allegations of sexual misconduct claims against Brett Kavanaugh\nThe White House examine interviewer interviewee reports from the FBI's latest probe into his background according to people from Neil you're with the matter says the wall Street Journal still the White House's conclusions aren't definitive at this

because we are in for a heck of a week\n[noise] we're also in for we're experiencing what may be an October surprise of epic proportions are surprised that we never saw coming enthusiasm right now for Republicans in a way that we haven't seen all year\nThe lack of decency ... the the the I get so angry watching\nThese these these democratic\nHacks standing there pretending to be outraged at judge Kavanaugh reacting angrily and with deep sadness you know they keep talking about cabinet or being mad last week how 'bout\nHow about the the the anguish decry the tear decrying the tears because of what his family has been put through by this extraordinary effort to stop him at any means ... by any means possible to quote Chuck Schumer\nHere's what those same Democrats that the the the just pick up all Democrats for Cory Booker Kamala Harris these grandstanding Democrats who think they're going to be in the White House some day\nYou know what you know what they'd be saying the judge Kavanaugh had\nBeen very calm and measured and wooden and plastic and emotion unless\nThey say it was a guilty man\nThere's a guilty man a guilty man doesn't react with emotion when he's called a gang rape first oh you're guilty refuses to get mad or shut up here after the disgraceful way as family has been treat treat it\nMust be guilty you know that's what they'd be say\nThey're opportunists in the

side but it's a very newsy inside the beltway perspective\nAnd a number one on today's daily actually is a um the the one big thing the barrette balance top Republicans are telling\nMy gallant and Jonathan Swan over it actually is they're seeing a surprising and widespread surge in GOP voter enthusiasm\nPowered largely by support for Brett Kavanaugh and ... court nomination the debate over cabinet has dropped a political grenade they say into the middle of an electorate that have been largely locked in Democrats' favor for the past six months in many ways what's unfolding\nIs the Democrats worst nightmare unified electorate\nRepublicans joining with independents and yes even some Democrats who are appalled at the way this thing is played out and the media is complicity in that they're clueless\nNBC I doubt to this day will acknowledge the ludicrous awful evil\nAct of ... of reporting on a story about anonymous letter scrawled with no return address or name accusing Brett Kavanaugh of and think of all unspeakable acts and they ran that on N. B. C.\nThis is the kind of stuff that infuriates good and decent people and Americans\nAre waking up there is a great awakening I don't know what's gonna happen with Kavanaugh but I've got a pretty good feeling what's gonna happen on November the six as a matter of fact\nIf these dirty tricks and this despicable evil process of Democrats led by Dianne Feinstein hiding the allegation by this woman for all those weeks just so they can drop it\nOn the committee after the hearings were completed\nIf somehow that works and capital doesn't get the votes\nThere'll be a red wave on November ... people are already enraged\nAt as a matter of fact as desperately as I Want Brett Kavanaugh confirmed because I think he is an originalist I Know he is a ... an originalist I Know he adheres to the constitution which is what we desperately need the Supreme Court to do\nAs deeply as I Hope he's confirmed if this gets derailed\nBlow to the Democrats on November ... because they're going to lose by going to
