relaxation resort\nIn my head in the multi manila Philippines\nAnd it was still in this house that no more rural area and beautiful very tropical setting with nature and beautiful flowers and palm trees and all of that very very lush and green and I had multiple what was called body work\nTherapies on myself and that's what I wanted to share because it made me feel great I had a coffee getting

imagine incredibly stressed why with apple amount to travel\nAnd all of that that that entails and the idea a massages enjoyable but I thought it was like a a a a bit of Ben and Jerry's ice cream it feels good at the time but it does is it actually good for you is are are you seeing doctors we said\nWe go in in a regular massage a bit of body work will de stressing ourselves that actually helps us long term\nIt does and in fact massages moving out of the just the um will face a world into the real mainstream medical world and it has ... medical value and of course anything that feels good is going to have medical value I Hope so\nThat is very good to get your endorphins going and oxytocin from the touch and so forth so you know the feel good when on the one that makes me feel warm and
