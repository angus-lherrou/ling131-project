five two we're waiting to hear from you or Portland absolutely absolutely joining the bigger picture family this week is the great city of Portland\nPortland, Oregon oh beautiful beautiful lifting forty up hatred patriot the patriots and now for our weekly contemplation of health and medicine it's time for a healthy perspective with Dr ... doctor fleece how are you this fine fine eating\nYou know I'm just great how about you guys really really good tell ya dang healthy and not only antibiotic I tried to\nSue I Try not to you I'm very anti medication I'm not like that but I I Try to minimize the amount of medication I put in my\nMe too I don't think I've ever taken a finding the doctors don't like give out those antibiotics like they used to back in the day\nYou know what changed between back in the day and now they're given at Opie Obamacare\nCut the it's the Obamacare you got to fry those antibiotics set of their hands now they used to throw him at me like candy corn\nWell they're still saying that at least a thirty thirty three percent of antibiotic prescriptions are unwarranted says he'll be on high alert\nSo I Know people they get a sniffle and they get a trash can of antibiotics and shoveling in their mouth with handfuls that's crazy\nI Know and they've been in the news lately I don't I don't know if you saw it because it's so busy and but last week there was an article it wasn't really new news but it was you know another article on the topic in Raleigh gardening one day I'm very commonly prescribe antibiotics separately sip of Fox and a bright one of the um [noise] very\nCommonly used ones that it can do something great harm to people they don't realize\nThat and this is it a new thing for a lot of doctors as well\nThat the way that it works to kill off the bacteria unfortunately it's actually working in a similar way to damage on mitochondria when you're on the implanted bacteria in ourselves\nYeah so it actually works two in the production of energy\nAnd the bacteria but it does that in our own selves and the results can be in ruptured ooh wow they deal with like people get like they they go out and they just take some walking their Achilles tendon ruptures where they can get nerve damage and mood disorders even heart damage\nSo it's really important not to take these types of antibiotics unless you really really need that and then there was a alternatives\nWhether there was a moment there do you remember the anthrax mail was going around was the only thing that is what everybody we load up yeah everybody out country was buying ...\nSays now Eugene ... doctors at least you didn't mention what I had always heard about the problem with taking too much antibiotics as you build\nUp resistance oil bought had and the and the antibiotics become less effective there's\nSo many different areas where antibiotics can be\nBoth life saving and also very problematic in the big picture\nOf society yes we're getting a lot of resistance and they're talking about we're getting close to a new world where no antibiotics for work and will be another antibiotic free zone just like it was like a hundred years ago they won't be any antibiotics for much of anything and\nSo there you know we're looking at many alternative now to antibiotics for example for skin some of the essential oils like time oil works against Martha infections really quite well\nSo we and we're looking at the microbial herbal as well for some infections of course\nThere are times when you absolutely have no alternative that we want to make sure\nThat we reserve or antibiotics for really important infections if it's hard to believe that we actually used to get that not everybody died at first it will in fact I Know you know we had it and you will is supposed to actually be able to fight off bacteria and viruses\nBut people did die of things like strep throat or why it and\nThey were terrible auto immune related things you know like romantic heart disease so we definitely don't want to go back to the time before we had antibiotics because those weren't you know then that started\nThe average the average life expectancy of links fifteenth century France was like twenty nine years yeah ... anything bad happen to you you were you were you were there was no way of going in and fixing the one of the interesting facts about infection I Know this is only tangentially related but you took a shot from a bullet\nAnd ... says hey you were dueling or so you just took a bullet in like Eighteen ten or something like that the bullet doesn't kill you the bleeding doesn't kill you know what kills you that little bit of shirt\nThat goes into your body angry all that infection and you die ... silly things used to kill a spin or antibiotics or or they\nMess up your life or Andrew Jackson took a bullet in a pool and killed him twenty five years left and it you know majors like miserable for\nYeah I knew a member of the um the scenes from the civil war when they were anticipating legged with gang green and such\nAnd such terrible\nTerrible time you know and so you know we are aware of like ... antibiotics the great resistance and of course they can do terrible things to our gut microbiomes and you know we always talk about like ... good guys you can get diarrhea you can get the death infections and that you need to have the sequel transplant\nPeople actually get allergic reaction you know that right I Know there are guys allergic to penicillin\nI've heard of it but I Know are they good that\nYou know there are plenty of people who are you can get an answer for lactic reaction that\nOnly chain penicillin like twice in my time here in the biomedical well waiting till they supposedly had there aren't aren't\nThey're supposed to be what is it safe issues as Asia save ... as an alternative to to ah antibiotics are not exactly sure what I'm Talking about like anti microbe aging microbial pages that you say oh well like\nYou know having people all their lives and you can't just like ditch those things they they they they track you to your great you can not get rid of a large amount of ... out of bankruptcy and not that many students won't have considered that now here's my concern about the issues that we have a student loans\nWhat it's enabled is universe is just to raise their fees and ... and ... just as they come on down or you know it's all finance we finance ... hammer and you do have\nA right and center a a bachelors degree you can have a four year degree in finance don't worry them in whatever you want and of course it will radically improved your earnings sort of course it will\nRight you've got that that university experience or you know everybody is precious and special an amazing and of course you're going to make a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year your first year I was just going to be fine I I remember hearing\nA story and and and they love doing kind of sad stories on the in the media about people and it was someone who I think ended up barring like two hundred thousand dollars\nTo get a bachelor's degree in like ... like like performing ... they chose the jazz [noise] and it was a ... and she just steady jak ... where she knew that it was performing and I'm going to be Haitian\nAnd and the young lady was shocked shocked that this money was being paid it you know that she was in crew wing all of this debt this money was being paid into the university\nAnd and there was just no way of of getting out from under that now I I took out soon as I was in a very similar position you know we went under the age of this educated person who who spent four years studying spending all this money I mean what is\nYour ... how does she think she was going to get out from under is what I I think she assumed I I think that if if that is that at least the school of thought she would be able to repay because why would the school and her money why would the lenders lend her money\nIf they didn't think that there was that salary well in in the rational and yet ... maybe Mr Collins can\nTell us or what they're thinking when they went two hundred thousand dollars to somebody who's studying ... and we don't know if he if this person going to be a jazz legend in the future self meal you'd move out maybe who maybe there are some actuarial around or were they ...\nThe ... you know are the jazz legends who are earning that money is who are able to ... to support a debt level like that you know none of them have\nA college degree I have a college degree I genuinely believe this and I will say it now and it's got me a you know a lot of blowback at dinner parties and social situation goes against ... when I say when I say this\nI don't think that there is any good or service in modern American\nLife but it's so consistently missed sold and miss bought\nHas a college education the pure who were selling college educations are selling something that's so different from what's actually being delivered and the person buying that college education thinks they're buying something so very different than what they've actually received\nThat really funny mismatch that's going on here ... at least a few of those points I think we have Allen on the line can we go in the head and had Alan ... Alan how're you\nDoing how are you pay really good apologies for the technical hiccup were up on the satellite we're live now in not only in Los Angeles but and beautiful Portland, Oregon so we're still working out some of the little kinks there\nNow and now we all love college and hate loans how can you walk us through that little puzzle\nStroller well no just just recording this system ever grown out of control what started out as a pretty fine idea and moderate places has turned into a big government monstrosity apps or you know at the\nAt the turn of the century as a country we owe it maybe a hundred ... billion dollars in student loan debt\nWell today that it has increased to ... thousand\nBillion plus five hundred billion or one trillion five hundred billion we has absolutely exploded\nAnd at the age you know it it seems like there's no stopping colleges and universities from increasing and increasing and increasing ... we we chatted about this briefly before you came on the line and and I think we we landed on a on a pretty\nImportant question these lenders why why it was a lender going to say yes\nWe will win you two hundred thousand dollars to get a four year degree in jazz without considering the fact that that person is never going to be able to pay that back\nThat's exactly the right question and the the reason is that the federal government has decided that it is willing to either guarantee or more recently milk the loans themselves or anything raw\nThere is no risk in this market anymore these loans or had been stripped of the most fundamental consumer protections ... unlike every other alone\nThere are no bankruptcy protections for student loans there are no statute of limitations so we've got a system where the government wants to lend out as much money as possible because it makes money or back whether the students can pay or whether they cannot go how does that in many cases\nWell that's right I was in the absence of bankruptcy a productions and such and such limitations\nBut turns out that the government can actually make a profit on defaulted lunch over the long on\nBecause they can follow these borrowers for the rest of their lives and they have a collection of ours that would make a boxer and wow they can have wider compared with the one that they can garnish your wages without a court order they can take your Social Security when you're a senior citizen so\nThey just said five basis we sixty five and you've been working at Starbucks you been keeping on the down low velocity degree you you've you've been off grid and then you finally get that kind of get my Social Security check no I didn't I didn't know\nUncle Uncle Sam will be there waiting and along with the bank a job as a sort of bang for the federal government has essentially Hern this landing system\nInto some sort of a weaponized a ... instrument but whites of which are a nation that literally never ... or other loans in this country that the consumer protections but I mentioned earlier don't exist\nNow now can I ask any loans can I ask you an incredibly politically incorrect question and and the one that really goes to the ... or ... of this whole\nDebate careful now we've been groomed by the the government agencies in the universities and the chattering classes to believe that a university degree is essential that you have to ensure that your kids go to college good a good college get the best\nPossible degree that we can ... God Forbid how much debt you run up God Forbid how much delta there is between servicing that debt and the amount of money that the person will learn with a college degree\nIs a better question to ask me on ask a question and I ask you this is the question should all of these people be going\nTo college should these people who are racking up these huge debts\nShould they be getting these degrees is it in their best interest\nQuite frankly no and that was ever true it certainly is not true now over the past Twenty years the sorts of degrees that we're seeing more and more\nHave very little utility in the real world and all the way that it no longer teach for years to get an undergraduate degree lots on average six or eight years now\nOn average ... ... yes you do these kids are being sold a bill of goods more and more off and the value of the degree is highly suspicious at this point uh you know I I think that's a great question though\nIt's not going to ask you Alan as as an excellent question student loan justice dot org ... great website name hopefully all of our listeners out their friends and neighbors all your scribbling down\nWhat does that website what does your efforts here how does it help people what's the connection that you want to make to our listeners right now\nYeah we we are fighting over there to make these loans there again I'm\nLike I said the government is property every which way very I'm very ... you know there's no other lender that makes a profit on all very strong arm so we are fighting at a minimum to get the costs ... bankrupt in return to the loans should have never been taken away\nThis world horse the federal government to crack the whip on the schools right improve the quality of the colleges of education warmer their prices are and returns for market rationale and this is Mark Fletcher will\nFantastic and I thank you so much Alan free time thank you so much for being part of the bigger picture before we hit our next break I interesting fact\nThere's a lot of the fish in the coming out of this and and there's a lot of businesses that are going to be created and we'll graded around opportunities leveraging this this opportunity in in boxing\nNow I've got to ask you this conference that you went to this week what sort of people were there was it um why collection of people at different levels or was this really just kind of the experts to propel her head that we're we're trying to push the foundations out even further what kind of crowd was\nThat would that would allow or mostly in the early ... fanatical about ...
