P. sauce you got to get the brown sauce and you've got to\nThrow it on all of that is just simply healthy\nYou don't want to know what it's made it some of the lesser known Oregon's owned in those three or four at the all the awful awful which is an awful lot of old or\nSo I either do a big fry up what I Would call a big fire or I I just do like a bit of yogurt and like a glass of orange is just really grabbing do those\nThings I encourage people to do is to stop thinking about foods like when I and like they were I don't know whether you think about that there is this idea about Brexit versus getting food but um it doesn't matter that moving them into food into correct is\nThat what they have here at this hotel that and that they have like a salad bar that most people don't think of that one guard but it's really quite healthy if you can have your breakfast salad I don't know you guys would ever consider that\nSure why not try anything\nNow that sounds like when I'm In Asia anytime I travel in Asia I'm In the hotel I go down there ... and the salad it's just the thing you're the least afraid ... exactly they're crazy stuff you look at an Asian breakfast enough that they cry she stopped like where my eggs you know we were funny learn anything\nWrong with eggs act just like a classic breakfast thing is there are have we had it wrong all these years\nAt a good egg is a wonder of good ac yes it has a lot of this\nWonderful Coca Cola lean in it that helped many many aspects of your body including your brain the normal transmitter ... coli come with holding and that's how you'd have memory so it's\nLike ... ... some olive oil and Dallas ... yeah salt on it that's better than no olive\nOil you scramble your egg but in ... if I go through Nordstrom have established by the way it rolls Selassie people that I was like I said what's your preferred police what's your preferred breakfast ... you woken up this morning one of you know\nI Am going to have one and I haven't decided yet it couldn't be scrambled or they had these wonderful either poached eggs are like that and he said that they\nCan have an oil that they serve you in the shell little with a little holder oh yet and actually\nThey take it out of this show back in the shell but they take it out of this and that makes it easier for clean up his and I would definitely have some breakfast salad and they have these wonderful tomatoes going to say you\nMade earlier tomatoes for breakfast or amazing\nI got you always\nWin win on days when used bring\nOur news department never sleeps breaking news Web cam Asia [noise] [noise]\nFriends neighbors I Am ... this is the bigger picture to show that asks big questions about the world we live in what first our we had tons of callers conversations\nReally very little fear here on the bigger picture for engaging with the the contentious issues of the day Dave I think we didn't shy away\nWe weren't shying away away from Kanye now we we weren't we started with ... as much as the ... I I don't talk about I Wonder if Kanye and Trump ... and saw an equal ... saw themselves\nThey're Trump's thinking if only I was a rapper\nAnd ... and ... thinking\nIt's only I'd gone bankrupt more time maybe I should he go bankrupt once or twice a Trump did well I mean Trump famously gone DJ he is he is no problem never declared personal bankruptcies or maybe not maybe he's just he's just not you maybe for\nYou know major corporations go\nThat decided that decided to do that friends neighbors or phone lines are up in eight six six eight seven zero five Seventy five to ... when you go to our featured gas this evening we are joined on the line by John Yoo Bush\nMedia analyst and commentary on the residents of the oval office or this year which happens just Sylvie Donald J Trump and giving us some insight into his contacts in the history John how are you this fine fine he'd\nFind find this evening really\nGreat to have you on a we've been taking our listeners on a journey the last few years trying to better understand the man that is don't Jason I'm trying to understand how he's impacting the presidency impacting the oval office\nHow do you put our current president into some sort of historical context\nWell you know running a Reagan Foundation in library as I Do um I put Trump in the context what Reagan in the sense that you would not find two individuals are more different than the one another and just about every way it's just interesting though to watch [noise]\nDay after day Trump seems to take one page after another from the Reagan playbook so while they might have remarkably different styles and personalities as president\nTrump is unveiling a an agenda of similar to raise and I think as a result Reagan conservatives are very happy\nI think Reagan would have been surprised by how conservative troubled truck has become I think he was a pretty sturdy Democrat and Reagan day wasn't me\nMy my ending is that he he he donated against Reagan twice and and I can only assume voted against Reagan twice in eighty and eighty four he was not known for being someone who spend a lot of time in Republican circles when Reagan was the uh the man of the hour\nYeah he he wasn't a and M. I. interestingly enough though a history reveals that Ronald Reagan to was once the Democrats ... ... you know yeah yeah I mean he looked up for a while to uh\nTo Roosevelt and from the referring fireside chats and many other Americans did so um I think in some respects that's where he picked up the value of telling a story in painting a vision for the country of stuff you know where a talk show as president\nAnd that's where I think a lot of people find our current president a bit lacking if you can imagine that uh you look at you look at Reagan and he really had an overarching narrative and whether you agreed with this policy positions or not you could see them feeding into\nHow that overarching narrative was being rolled out you don't give that was strange inexperienced\nActor who's able to communicate that narrative seeing the cool here in a regular basis and I think that's right I think Trump has a ... largely similar\nAh agenda but virtually no ability to communicate it or or do anything consistently social creatures of television though this is where the comparing reality television versus General Electric ... yes presenting yeah prime\nTime yeah yeah you know Reagan he understood how to tell a story and he understood the value of a story in terms of capturing ones and matching nation and he was able to since they put\nThe United states it's a it's a context that's a story and he was able to bring people along with him as he told his story and a and I think you're absolutely right I don't think Trump has for a moment to ever\nGiven a darn about telling stories are being taken visions um [noise] you know you couldn't turn away from Reagan because you wanted to know where the story went you can't turn away from Trump because you don't know what he's going to say next you know he's able to capture\nPeople's um you know attention not because almost you know what it is I think he favors the\nWorld of surprise and you know you're always hang on the edge of gear ... if he's going to say something outrageous or something incredibly politically correct incorrect so well as a result the here and Reagan are like in the sense that they know how to get an audience that's just the way they unfold their stories in front of the audience\nIs very radically different ... Reagan Reagan drew you in with he has a twinkle in his eye or in a charming little smart Trump's just got that hair it's fascinating that hair\nAnd that orange glow about\n... and I don't I don't think Reagan and I appreciate or the ... John your thoughts on that I I don't know the Reagan would have done well with a hundred and forty characters I I think the tweet storms or I don't\nThink Reagan would have done well in that sort of a circumference around what he could do or say he was more of an advantage I wouldn't have John ... I think he would\nDump periodic well constructed you know short bon ... yeah you know patriotic short he would not have like been spouting off at three in ...\nIn fact I get that question more than any others you know if we could have tweeted in the answer is obviously yes and and you know with\nThat fact just because if you look at Reagan's career you know we started off in radio he migrated to to television as it came out and he went to in Hollywood in the movies and uh you know the game and he he was a master of speeches he got David\nAh well you know yeah they had a whole crowd of guys around them and I knew how to stage a script the moment\nBut I Would say that I and when Reagan was tweet\nHe would um [noise] you know with speechwriters what ... what right the hundred and forty characters and give them several options and Reagan like he worked with his speeches were perfect the hundred and forty words\nRather than to his own voice but he absolutely what a ... disorder tweeted sure you know inside of a strategic communications plan it has\nBeen well crafted haiku when a hundred and forty characters with new exclamation point no all cat\nYeah the the ... so I mean there are a PHD\nTo see that are being written now about Donald Trump's use of\nAll caps and exclamation points and the ability to reduce all these argument there was something aspirational about Ronald Reagan I mean pointing a vision of the way we should be living our lives that was a distance away from what we were ... you get with Trump that it's much more ...\nThey were taking what we're doing now is the deal better D. S. it's very transactional deal we could do better were being taken advantage of we can do better now I've got to ask\nYou John I Know you write on this topic a lot or your author of of a couple of a a great great books and the topic how would you advise people to kind of bettering\nGauge with the Trump Administration better understand the Trump Administration based on the comparisons that you've made to Reagan and earlier administrations\nWell uh you know again I'd uh having worked on Capitol Hill all eight years of Reagan Administration and study them very carefully I never I was at every one of his state of the union address is um you know I Know I got into public service because of Ronald Reagan and I run his foundation today because\nOf my respect for him and so um you know like I've studied the man and I can I can tell you it's almost it's uncomfortable um you know when you're in making comparisons between the two because you just this is ... ... difference on\nIt's just difficult to imagine them in the same on politically they just they couldn't be more on a light can throw in that respect\nThey both face a lot of animosity I I remember when when Reagan was elected and then re elected\nThat the Democrats the people who left the political discourse demonized him and I know I Know people ... Nixon but there was a particular way in which I felt that at the time they demonized Reagan that puts them in this kind of loop then just repeated every\nIn a kind of built up arguments that that that resonated in and Trump I think he's a creature of our time I feel responsible I said this on the show before I think we all are a little bit responsible for Trump because\nThis is a level of conversation we have now I I I got to ask you Jim ... does Trump resonate\nUp in the great state of Washington or are there are there Trump hers up in that part of the world\nTrade I live in oh I
