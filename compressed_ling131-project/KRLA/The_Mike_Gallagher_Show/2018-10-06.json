funding needs to at least the private jet\nGary ago I donate I donate please I we we got listeners joking that the president said Airforce one bring everybody to Washington you know a lot of them all up have a big party\nMilitia ... we're we're having a party philosophically about the jobs numbers and and of course job creators network has been such an integral part\nOf the tax cuts the good news today the loser ... announced the U.S jobless rate dropped a three point seven percent it's that's the lowest it's been nearly fifty years Elaine such great news you guys have got to be bouncing off the walls\nWith the job that the job creators network has played with the these tax cuts in with this great news about jobs jobs jobs in America\nLike a real winters here are the thirty million small business owners\nThat continue to thrive under the economy and the program but how is that the administration\nEarlier this week I had an op ed on real clear politics\nWhich actually get in on how women are flourish so under the economy and more and more women start businesses and re enter the workforce a pilot the mom you know historically childcare has has acted as a barrier for women and look the workforce and entrepreneurship\nAnd now they're a benefit of the tax\nCuts and job that you know not only have we reduce tax rates across the board for everyone\nBut we also doubled the child tax credit and that's where an adoption and that's an absolute reduction off your tax\nBill right and then for those who are at the lower end of the spectrum there's a fourteen hundred dollar refundable tax credit that natural payout for that like that and and in many cases that can help offset a lot of your child care costs\nA huge benefit\nThat is indeed and and job creators network has been in the in the front ... on the front lines of so many of these important issues I Know that you guys have put on your radar Amazon and and they're lobbying for a higher minimum wage and some of these protests around the country\nAnd of course there's a real simple formula that's happening in ... for example in the service industry McDonald's fast food they're they're being confronted with the demand for a higher minimum wage\nMcDonald says you know what we're ... that that we're not going to make a profit were business to make a profit so you know we'll do five will replace all of these human beings with kiosks\nAnd we're seeing this all across the board where companies have to wisely invested in technology and and you know robots an automated systems and kiosks because when you're demanding Fifteen Eighteen twenty bucks an hour it doesn't work Elaine\nLike and that is true or a bad\nThing and I think any company said have\nThe right to pay their employees whatever they want and I applaud Amazon or wanting to pay their employees more money from where I draw the line is for wary but they said that they want to um help increase it and work with legislators and lobby then to increase the federal minimum wage pundits what hurt\nMany of our thirty million small businesses out there and certainly pulling the impact of that in cities like Washington Penn State and the adult we want people that all these hours and and the money that we think is closed their doors\nYou know they just don't have the resources that that kind of waiting\nRight you're right and I'm Glad

nomination could be derailed\nLike she's a yes this could this could portend\nVery favorably this could be a good day so we're not going to know don't believe anybody who protects what's gonna

got to get reelected in twenty twenty garbage nonsense he says he's a yes vote\nHe's I don't think he's changed his mind but then again if any of them could change their mind we might be
