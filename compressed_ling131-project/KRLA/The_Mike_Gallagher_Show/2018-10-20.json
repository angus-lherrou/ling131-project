a look at that it was filled with a with the charm and authenticity like when one point B image is kind of went sideways you had to mess with that for a little bit but it was a it was always straight shooting from dead we talked about a\nNumber of things going on in the end be cruising O'Rourke race I give you from taxes my honest take which is unwavering and that is the cruise wins and it is not that close cruise wins and it will not be that close now\nDon't messed me up your taxes\nThat everybody listening I'm a huge would affiliates through the great state of Texas need to make sure that I'm right about that it's not about me but it's about our state it's about our country and that means that if if if that because I I think the blue wave is already dissipating\nBut is there a Democrat enthusiasm in Texas of their Democrat enthusiasm all over the country in the first opportunity that Democrats have to interrupt the Trump agenda for the most conservative governance we've had since Reagan you bet there's Democrat energy\nBut the good news is there is Republican energy and it is freshly motivated the cabin on the hearings absolutely\nHad an effect it made us enthusiastic about the way we acted I I mean when when all of a sudden conservatives on their list of heroes\nList Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins you know everyone has been made better there has been in a conservative spine infusion and Lindsey Graham I I I I Can't not love the guy\nHe's dead wrong and immigration maybe we should check back maybe get better on that too but on a whole lot of other things especially\nIn a war on terror national defense national security he's he's inspiring way correct and wonderful Lindsey Graham ah is it has been a joy to behold for these last few weeks since that moment of magnificent righteous indignation\nThere in the Senate Judiciary committee when he just gave it to a Democrat America for what they've done gave it to the Democratic colleagues for what they've done absolutely great and then Susan Collins a ... a wonderful woman\nOr a New England Republican meaning Swiss cheese conservatism but unless they we don't we don't do Republicans in New England the way we do Republicans in taxes or\nYour or Mississippi or Utah right it's a New England Republican we used to have Democrats in Texas were more conservative than some New England Republicans but as I said I'd rather have an are by somebody's name in the state of Maine\nThen somebody in the state of Maine in the Senate with a D by their name so I've never sat at home drop in my fingers on the table going oh says invalid I've never lamented that you take what you can get and all we got from Susan Collins is magnificent clarity\nEd Sheeran ... two principal and the vote that got us justice Brett Kavanaugh I Will be for ever grateful and meanwhile she better have food tasters and I am not kidding\nI mean they're they're they're mysterious packages being center her home Lindsey Graham is being being spat on everybody's being dogged and screamed at an airport and I know it's a long walk from being screened at an airport to being shot\nBut today's violent left\nIs something that cannot be ignored the unhinged left exists and I've I've just flat got to tell you if you were in the Senate and you were a yes vote on Kavanaugh a you better but I think our security is a very good idea and I am not kidding yeah\n[noise] um here's an example of a of of of someone who was getting a little I guess\nThis is that the Al Smith memorial foundation charity dinner in New York\nAnd a ton of money gets raised mostly for children's charities it's absolutely great and it tends to have a political keynote speaker engaging in moments that are not so dry and political science last year it was for example house Speaker Paul Ryan\nAnd this year they secured a keynote speaker who is certainly attracted some attention of light and that would be soon to be former UN ambassador Nikki Haley so think about it okay Nikki Haley is your keynote speaker in the first time and she had last evening was about\nThe selection process that led to her\nSeries about what Paul Ryan is a boy scout and that's fine but lumbering [noise]\nHere he wanted to buy things again right\nNow that he wanted an Indian woman\nOne day and\n[noise]\nHe okay [laughter]\nTime up of a brief worried about Nikki Haley I\nJust love her\nShe will you know when I make my list of my favorite un ambassadors ever which I guess I'll do if I ever had some time I buy and uh you know John Bolton on that list probably at the top of that list\nOr their her and she's she's just great at that as governor of South Carolina great I think one of the things I really like about her especially in this era

just go in there if you're going into private life just don't do that and go do whatever you want to do\nAnd just did just leave me alone with his hand wringing self lower the navel gazing you know conservatism is bad under drugs drugs the ... just just take that and and walk down appear alright hum\nBut Nikki Haley as an example speaking of governors so is my other good friend and former Texas Governor Rick Perry in so many others I could name\n[noise] of people who who not only didn't know what to think about Donald Trump they flat out didn't like him they opposed modulate the concept of his presidency the concept of his nomination and you know what they did\nThey came around they came around they open their eyes they open their minds and said wow okay maybe there are some stylistic things that I didn't love about this guy but I sure a lot of the results I Love this economy\nI Love are stronger borders I Love the dismantling of the regulatory state\nI Love the tax cuts\nI Love it

quickly gotta move briskly let us stipulate you love you and I love you you it's so far so good Oh yes oh\nI Love you so much that I started to care about the Cleveland Browns that's how much I Love you I offer that is tough line because my friend than yours you has never been as misguided\nTea is about first man this is a magnificent film it drips with American achievement there is I Want to describe a non existent creature sunny a nonexistent creatures like a ... a Jeb Bush supporter is nonexistent the person who has seen first man actually seen it and believes that it is anti American floor\nYeah absolutely I mean look this is a uh there there is a controversy that has been picked up a about first man and it is largely the fault of the star we have to ... to do with your uh you know at a conference at the Venice film festival Ryan Gosling\nSaid something really do is that he's got a dumb thing we can all agree that this was a dumb thing he said that uh Neil Armstrong thought of himself\nNot as an American hero but as a war hero now ... what kind of couching and in his own experience that Canadian Canadians of course don't have any heroes\nSo they have to the world's heroes I Know I understand I understand what he was doing and look it was it was a mistake\nAnd instead of putting out the fire the the the director even doubled down exactly but you said at truth day which is that a within the context of the story the actual planting a flag I mean again what we're talking about here is the planting of the spring of the hole\nIn the moon rock they do not show that that ... second clip of the moon Germany okay\nUm but within the context of the film it makes perfect sense why they wouldn't do that uh when they get to the moon the film which is to kind of a more subjective experience that kind of puts you in the edit Ryan Gosling\nUh Neil Armstrong and\nAnd it is it is designed that way and it works I mean look you see you see the flag on the moon everyone is talking about how the flag it's been a race from this movie insane new uh everyone everyone who talks about how this movie downsized American achievement or or suggest it's not about the space race is insane\nEveryone who talked about how this is not\nA an event that had fired the rest of the world to follow American achievement in American greatness is is just wrong I mean there's ... after\nThe moon landing takes place there's literally a montage\nOf people talking about how great America is there's a French woman says the French we could never do it but America could do it I always believe that now but I mean it's like it is ... ... anyone who actually seeing is the movie I don't know anyone who actually goes to see it in and out of just relying on the uh angry uh\nI mean and I get it I totally get it because Hollywood is a snake puts a snake ... filled with America hating Dennis all I Know it's so it's an easy target bill is alive so I just I'm I feel I feel cleansed ...\nIt was great and it also by the way all this crap aside it is a magnificent film ... does an unbelievable job putting you inside the sole inside the helmet inside the spacecraft is a remarkable movie\nYeah I I I thought it was quite good I mean look and there are reasons to criticize the film I read a plenty of negative reviews that that had an intelligent accurate things to say about the film\nBut if you really are avoiding the movie because you think uh that it ... you are you're doing it wrong as hard as we as a kid in fact\nI Know we've got at least one or two new ones but give me thirty seconds is star is born as good as certain people I Know say it is\nI mean look at its high melodrama it is a it is you know we've seen this story before so it's not like there's going to be anything

of the first twenty months there too great pieces I have in front of me one by Fred Barnes ... Weekly Standard and the other one by John Dempsey\nAbout how Trump has freed the Republican Party from the media I Want to start with a few I Want to start with a Fred Barnes piece over some facts because I like to argue with knowledge I Want to make sure that his you vote as you encourage your neighbors to vote as you get ready to go to the\nPolls don't believe the lie but somehow but rock Obama\nChef the groundwork for this tremendous economy that we're enjoying right now\nFred Barnes says in his column ... is a must read we're going to posted it Mike online dot com if you want to read it Fred Barnes rights but rock Obama is a proud men\nAnd it was somewhat in Deering when he ... to to claim he had created the ground on which Trump's economy was growing the media sided with Obama no surprise\nTrump counter punch no surprise there either if the Democrats won the election twenty sixteen Trump said GDP which was about one percent and going down would have been minus four percent instead of up four point two percent Trump tweeted\nHe's referring to Fort Point two percent he's referring to the growth rate but the second quarter of twenty Eighteen\nI opened up our beautiful economic engine with regulation in tax cuts are system was choking and would have been made worse still plenty to do read Barnes writes the Weekly Standard Donald Trump is correct\nAbout the condition of the economy and late twenties sixteen it was weakening the shift in economic policy to the right change the direction of\nGross from down to that's what tax cuts deliver and tax hikes do not here's a Fred Barnes writes about Obama and this lie but Obama is the reason for today's economy and again it spread puts it Obama's proud man\nIt's kind of in Deering that he had such a head makes such a silly claim here are some facts ... Obama's successor Trump and the Republican Congress reverse Obama's policies\nThe fact is Obama had to struggle so hard to spur the economy and allow it to grow more than two percent a year that was the high watermark the bronco bomb in the last quarter of Obama's presidency growth has slipped to one point five percent\nIt's obvious what Obama's problem was he got the wrong policies lots of wrong policies from the day Trump was elected\nWe've had a more will best robust economy\nNearly four million jobs have been at it for a million jobs unemployment is dip to the lowest point in nearly a half century Fred Barnes says let's compare what Obama did with Trump and what he's doing Obama raised taxes Trump cut that\nObama was a regulatory sell it Trump is passionate about deregulation Obama's clean Power Plan killed the coal industry Trump is reviving it\nObama downgraded the role of entrepreneurs and free markets in boost the economy and lauded the wonderful things government does Obama's bring his biggest breakthrough as we know\nWas the Affordable CARE Act a big step toward a single payer government run health care system Trump got rid of the individual mandate that forced everyone to buy expensive insurance or be fined a big step toward a return to free markets in health care\nBill the entire Obama economic agenda was systematically reverse says economics writer Stephen Moore whose new book Trump ... we've gotta get Stephen Moore and Arthur Laffer Lance on the show one of\nThese days presidents loved to tell their achievements Trump's case a White House report issued recently said his administration\nHad produced two hundred and eighty nine accomplishments in twenty months we all know Trump exaggerates and brags Fred Barnes rights but many of the economic gains will impressive\nEspecially the fact that job openings out number job seekers for the first time on record being liberal himself Obama relied on liberal economists they let him a stray\nAs they did president John Kennedy in the Nineteen sixties they favored higher taxes to they favored increased spending\nThose policies created an economic downturn but Kennedy was smarter than Obama\nSays Fred he finally turned to his Republican treasury secretary she Douglas doing who recommended tax cuts JFK grabbed on to them and the result was an economic boom the roaring sixties wages advisors persuaded him the tax cuts championed by Jack Kemp\nWould do far more for the economy than spending cuts\nThey even use JFK's as an example the sweeping tax cuts of Nineteen eighty one brought about years of strong growth notice the Reagan Revolution Trump didn't need to be convinced obviously he and Republicans led by Paul Ryan believed it was time for deep cuts in the corporate tax rate the Obamas school of economists\nAnd commentators embarrassed by anemic results argued that economic growth was stuck perhaps permanently at two percent annually that metal\nBottoms doing the best any president could do certainly far better than Trump would have done right all kinds of dire predictions Washington Post that Trump could destroy the world economy Jason ferment chairman of Obama's council of economic advisors said Trump's budget assumes three percent annual growth that is extremely unlikely\nMichael ... sick the Pulitzer Prize winning economics writer for the Los Angeles times said if Trump thinks he can get more than three percent growth he's dreaming\nLarry Summers the former president of Harvard and treasury secretary said under Trump I Would expect a protracted recession to begin with and Eighteen months the damage will be felt far beyond the United states Paul Krugman\nNobel winner and New York Times columnist under Trump\nWe're looking at a global recession with no end in sight I suppose we could get lucky somehow but on economics as on everything else a terrible thing has just happened\n[noise] wrong wrong and wrong they're all they were always wrong about Trump's economy as they were election night\nWe know the trumps economy is going to grow by well over three percent this year\nFred Barnes is peace lays it out beautifully which is not for rock Obama's economy and to suggest so he's a ghost of a proud man like Iraq Obama and the Democrats who are ashamed to admit that Donald Trump has revitalized our economy\nHas turned this giant ship around and we're headed in the right direction and we've got to keep it going on November the ... you got to vote Republican across the board\nEighteen minutes past the hour welcome in this
