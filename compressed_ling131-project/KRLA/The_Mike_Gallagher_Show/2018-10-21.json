million visitors a year and then during\nAh during the how Halloween falls on a Saturday in October we can have like a hundred and twenty five thousand people and um so we're always prepare it and trying to make things better bring people in and out as far as trials all my God uh\nEverybody comes it's so funny we are not the first to do what Europe does it we execute twenty people but everybody comes here but we're glad they do we love telling them about it and that's a compelling story\nI'm sure than there has to be on the Salem historical tours and the haunted footstep goes to a lovable\nUh they're the oldest walking tours in Salem, Massachusetts from what we understand your tourist they operate combo of history with a dose of those grim details in keeping with the Halloween being so for listeners around the country who might want to come to Salem at this point hoping to see her experience it goes what can you tell them that do come away with [noise]\nUm well you know we're a combination of a lot of things sell the witchcraft trials everybody knows about\nWe're also the fourth oldest city in Massachusetts we are older than Boston um we are the logo is great stories begin here so we were an\nIncredible the port a we had over two hundred and fifty ships going around the world during Seventeen Ninety to Eighteen fifty and it's um the wealth of the nation was here in Salem in the early Eighteen hundreds we were the one perhaps\nA but it all comes crashing down due to various factors how dumb incredible revolutionary history as well and they've combo tours they just kind of 'em and pick a combo get the ghost stories get the stuff you get the pay for history\nRight now it's looking on your website and I thought gallery episode out of the people that have taken the tourists [laughter] when or Arabs then goes I mean these are that's an awful lot of the oddities I'm these tourists I have you ever seen a ghost or what you think might have been against\nOut absolutely I'm definitely Santa go um\nYeah so we ah well one of the house ... ... the lowest haunted house I'm In the city and that's where the corps when family has lived\nOn those grounds house is not there anymore it's another house but I was there telling a story and something went through the tree um we have stuff in our office who were on the old\nCustom house oh several custom houses were in the second to last so my daughter got started here where I live ah found his voice is behind her head so she got a little freaked out so yeah but I slept in my own building because sometimes you know\nI got stay overnight waiting so I've never had anything happen then but like apple I have had stuff happen on like horse\nYou know I think the part of the country that you're in and for folks that haven't been to Salem, Massachusetts I mentioned a just a couple of minutes ago when we were\nAbout to introduce you that you know it's easy to get to I mean you're thirty forty five minutes I guess depending on traffic from Boston northeastern right there on the coast as you said and also this time of year I mean I guess the folks want to go about forty or forty five minutes south we've got plenty of it can kind of hit an all with their\nUh you know I got a few questions right now for years so tell us do the tours run during all types of weather and how often do they run\nAnd do you and your team you know do you ever get that real fright or scare while you're out on the tours [noise]\nOh yeah we're on every day I'm through November fought here and then that

are rich in history and our our one of the oldest part of the country so um but yeah so it's um it's it's a great combination all around when\nPeople come there for the tourists uh what do you find it what surprises them the most when they leave that to you you're always going to chuckle about because you thought they would know where they just don't [noise]\nI think one of the biggest things that we are older than Boston and everyone doesn't realize that and then when we tell them or stuff\nLike Alexander Graham Bell lived here for three years and ah we had a very famous revolutionary I'll say a conflict I won't say battle that preceded Lexington and Concord and it's actually the confrontation the\nRevolutionary War so there's a lot of like stuff like that that wild with them and then we
