around the U.S Tom I Am I right but you have a great job I'm guessing you either have a ton of friends who get the candy with you or maybe no friends is they're all envious\n[laughter] uh you know you're right I think that the job you know we worked for ... some candy or across the country so it's a blast to come into work everyday or and it it just you know you get hit with a blast of sugar air so it's kind of cool\nRight said time since we only had to see a mass media today let's say sort of divide the country and the section since we asked listeners all over the U.S why don't we start with what's America's favorite Halloween candy on the west coast and maybe a scene from the south west and the mountain states [noise]\nOkay um so in the west coast it there's not really sort of a west coast consensus it's um it's it's a little bit divided state by state Skittles or the big one in California\nUm and that's because it's the most populous state out there on your head north to Oregon and you've got the cubs Washington and the salt water Cassie\nUm candy corn and do well in Idaho in Nevada and that's kind of a trend that's been a little bit controversial a country or even in New Mexico there's the candy corn is the number one can self interest me\nWhy why is that controversial to say\nOh you wouldn't believe people either really lover candy corn um we did we did a lot of the list who did a survey of the forty thousand people from what what I'll eat candy they don't like\nAnd candy corn was number two not less two of the candidate they don't like so it's a real lover a
