got their full of rage after judge Kavanaugh\nWas confirmed to the United States Supreme court they can't believe they didn't shut him down they can't believe some of these poll numbers and they're

kids these days and and I don't mean that within ugly I mean I don't have any dog and I don't care who wins the cable news wars but it's a Fox News MSNBC cable news world right now she and others at a distant third and you're about to see why\nThey put their faith in a guy like Don Lemon\nWho is just as it becomes unglued when a guest rightfully points out that Democrat activists in protesters who chased a U.S senator out of a restaurant or indeed\nA mop Don Lemon doesn't think that's mob mentality Don Lemon is a Democrat period\nBut let's listen to the lady who almost became president ever so close close she could she could feel that she could taste\nBut alas she didn't make it across the finish line the American people rejected Hillary Clinton and she still can't quite get over it evidently listen to what she said about Democrats Republicans\nAnd civility this is a cut number eight audio courtesy of CNN\n... liberal ... political party that wants to try to than for what you care about that I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the ... or the form of ... ... the only thing that the Republican whom to\nRecognize that same [noise] you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nReally demeaned the confirmation process\nDid you hear the lady who would be president just threaten the country does that's what she's doing she's threatening the entire country\nYou better understand she's saying that you can't be civil with Republicans not until Democrats gained control of the house and the set of she almost became president\nWith that kind of mindset and of course thankfully the voters saucer or hurt or call them deplorable hurt or demean\nMore than half the country with the wave of her hand knows who she is and what she is but you're not going to have\nIn today's party condemn Hillary Clinton's comments you're not going to have a Democrat condemned\nThe behavior of these protesters who are hounding Republicans and conservatives in the public space chasing a Fox News channel personality through the subway in New York\nHarassing him trying to get people to to try to incite people against him\nLove to know what would happen if these two so called Democrat liberal comedians who harassed Brian kill me it on the subway with the video rolling 'cause they think they're so cute if somebody stuck a knife in Bryan kill made what they'd be saying that they took the video down by the way from the stupid no nothing cowardly site\nBut these are Democrats here's a Democrat John Lennon looking check this video out last night he's got Matt Lewis a Daily Beast columnist talking about the behavior of today's Democrats again don't get don't get\nFooled or snow covered by labels like and chief uh or\nFascists or even protesters right these are Democrats who are ... hounding and harassing people in public listen to Don Lemon with Daily Beast columnist Matt Lewis listen very carefully\nTo what a liberal Democrat host like Don Lemon it has to say about this mob behavior from the Democrats\n[noise] was it my behavior no it's not ... ... people who are upset and angry with the way the ... the way the country's going and the policy you know they do is we now have before you jump into okay I may go why I Can't make it interesting that\nYou know you're you're making a point or are you the moderator or the host or are you are giving\nA liberal moderate or and the host of tell you that you're giving up on it saying\nThat I'm like look up the word mob and the dictionary yeah I definitely\nLook up the word ... in the dictionary and you should also as a Republican look at the count the number five and look at the ... or whatever it is you are whatever it is you are look at the constitution of the United states and it gives people the right to protest\nYeah and it doesn't say where you can only do we blame\nOkay it's okay if I have a great so you can do whatever you want and you can leave the show if you want but let me I'm not well maybe my point okay well then set up and let me do it\nAll right thank you very much\nIn the constitution you can protest whenever and wherever you want that doesn't tell you you can't do it at a restaurant it doesn't tell you that you can't do it on a football field will tell you that you can do it on the cable news shows you can do it wherever you want them to call people mobs because they are exercising their constitutional right it's just beyond\nWhat a jerk\nAnd more importantly he reflects an attitude of today's Democratic Party because nobody's condemning\nHave you seen that way the condition that that these women's march protesters and all these antifa protesters and black lives matter protesters and all you see what they do to the streets
