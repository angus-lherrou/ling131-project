loves the space program and NASA [noise] but I'm not I mentioned to him but I saw his tweet about how\nRidiculous she thinks it is those of us who won't go see the movie because we know that they didn't include Neil Armstrong planting the American flag on the surface of the moon as part of the movie and mark is just furious that everybody who wants to see the movie and his trashing it because of that\nAnd I have no desire to see the movie he he's a great movie he said we have this big argument we had a ... it was a knock down drag out he said I don't know what I'm Talking about and making a fool out of myself how can you not see the movie and say I'm like Mark I Know that they didn't show the scene that I remember my my dad one of my few memories\nOf my dad was she tears in his eyes of are the sun room of our home or we had our both black and white TV tears in his eyes when that American flag was planted on the surface of the moon and they kept it out\nAnd mark is just on fire we ought to play the audio of the uh back and forth mark and I had this morning\nUm because there was also an explanation that was so convoluted Ryan Gosling and the filmmakers when they were asked about if they had some dopey explanation of why it wasn't part of the story it's about Neil Armstrong and the first man on the moon oh but let's not put the scene of the flag\nAnd I don't care what the reason is march says what you're saying it's a it's a anti American global estimate done I don't know what their\nReasoning is I just know they did it\nThey kept to see now I don't want to see the stupid movie\nEven though I hear it's a great movie\nNow the Connors a little different last night I watched the episode without Roseanne only because I Know that Roseanne wants her fellow cast members and and the company of that production to do okay I don't think she wishes them any ill will over what happened\nWith her being fired over a few words in a tweet they were offensive words they should never have been sent out she was immediately remorseful they didn't care they fired her ABC executives have recently been quoted as saying maybe we acted too hastily\nUm it'll be interesting to see how many people watch last night if it did well in the ratings it's probably a curiosity factor but if it did well in the ratings and people a lot of people watched they'll probably stick with it because it was a really good episode\nIt's a great ensemble Laurie Metcalf and John Goodman headed up this really fine ensemble of of of actors and it was very much like Roseanne without Roseanne it was weird\nBut it was sort of understood that and they told the story that she died of what they first thought was a heart attack and then they found out she overdosed on opioids she overdosed on pain pills\nAnd it dealt with the whole drama of Dan her husband played by John Goodman dealing with uh the grief the anger the confusion he wanted to blame a neighbor woman who gave Roseanne the pills to help her with her akin aching need um\nIt was it was it was a it was great TV\nDid they overreact of course they overreacted do they have a right to overreact of course they do it's their company is there is there a play patents their candy store if they want to get rid of her because they don't want to face the heat that they would have gotten over her tweet about Valerie Jarrett like I said from the outset well that's that's their choice\nCould be a bad choice but Roseanne herself\nWanted her long term longtime cast mates and company members to be All right she didn't want she did not wish ill will on that show\nShe said she wouldn't watch it I saw something on vice news last night or run HBO [noise] that was so riveting were trying to scramble to find the the video and the audio and it's powerful stoppage Roseanne today and we have it in a few minutes we'll play it for you wear Roseanne is in her Los Angeles home\nJust kind of ruminate about what happened\nIt's a powerful monologue if it's the way vice news did it um they just it was all her just talking\nJust short of unplugged you know just her ... talking about what what she experienced in and and what she went through and and and what happened I'm going to play it for you\nBecause I'd like to get your reaction there's a lot of other stuff going it's valley uh of course Saudi Arabia turkey this mess with

supporting Hillary Clinton or even Bernie Sanders\nThey would have fired her immediately for one tweet have you seen the stuff that Chelsea Handler has written about Donald Trump you listen to that

going to be shovel I guess they're never gonna\nEver have a\nCivil adult exchange with those with whom they disagreed\nThen a large sums president\nFor many Daniels for space in a tweet yesterday to the righteous indignation cue the screaming cue the yelling how dare he I mean what a shocker President Trump called somebody a name we haven't heard that in two years have way\nLindsey Graham I saw him on TV this morning saying he's the president he shouldn't do that now first thing when Senator Graham said who is a staunch Trump defender and supporters seems supports the president as a president's agenda to do right by the American people which I think\nAll decent Americans should should be the way that's the way most decent Americans should feel Lindsey Graham started by saying he's a fighter remember she has said awful things about him\nNobody ever notice is that nobody ever remembers when he call somebody a name they have said plenty about him\nPreviously and\nThat's what people mean about a fighter here's a here's our Ari Fleischer he was on Fox News later this is cut number eight or here's Ari Fleischer\nSaying that how Trump hurts himself when he calls a porn star like Stormy Daniels a name like horse race here's cut aid from Fox News and gravy\n[noise] you know center this is where the president at his own worst enemy he's in the middle of a victory and he takes it down if you're not just by engaging and that kind of unnecessary rhetoric\nThat call anybody horse face you just don't do that when you're the president or am I in some ways of the way they put out about Mika Brzezinski [laughter]\nYou know it's just the president counterparts so hard hit off on his himself as something he's actually pretty just for that for the last eight ten twelve months here and again returning to that type of mistaken over ...\n... case like that to diminish says what the proper victory a set of hitting home right\nNow I I don't say this to be disparaging about our our Fleischer I think he's a nice man I met him a few times and ah he served of course in the Bush administration [noise]\nUm so he's a an establishment guy he knows the establishment world very well but don't you find it fascinating and again I don't mean there's just respectfully towards Ari Fleischer but isn't it isn't an intriguing to listen to a hundred and that's what he is now he's like means like me and he's a he's a he's a guy with an opinion\nWe all have some of them have some of us have platforms whether it's already a appearing on Fox News for me with a radio show we're we're we're basically just guys and gals with opinions so we are\nWe're not we're not really that we're not certainly an elected leadership were not in the government\nWe can impact people I guess I suppose it's fair to say we can change hearts and minds but in the scheme of things we're certainly not as an we're certainly not as important as the leader of the free world don't you find it fascinating that Ari Fleischer thinks he can tell this phenomenally successful president\nHow he's making mistakes in other\nWords those who writes or who opine can sit on the sidelines and say oh you're making a mistake you're wrong here for doing that\nListen I wouldn't call a woman horse race I admit it I'm not like Donald Trump I don't have this kind of personality frankly most of us don't\nThe guy I keep calling him as a cookie call him the beach forget naming the the the limousine the drives that he drives around in the stretch Cadillac limousine called the beach that's the secret service nickname he's the beach\nBut here's rule is kind of simple\nYou come after me I'm going to go back after you tenfold I don't care if you're a woman\nI don't care if you're a man I don't care if you're a gold star family I don't care if your Mother Teresa I can see him calling Mother Teresa a name if she said something derogatory about him every body he\nAttacks everybody he calls a main everybody he just marriages has disparaged him first\nAri Fleischer knows that Lindsey\nGraham knows that that's what Senator Graham that when he started out the clip I don't know if we have do we have the but Lindsey Graham cuts somewhere guys I just kind of rushing around in the hotel room this morning up here in Florida on uh on TV religious that he's a fighter he's a fighter\nBut he ... he shouldn't do this you shouldn't say that when he's the president but we're not going to accept the fact that he's not going to do things that traditional past presidents have done me while\nI don't know there's a couple of pieces of news you might find interesting if you're worried about the president calling a porn star horse race\nThe U.S is back on top is the most competitive country in the world regaining the number one spot for the first time since two thousand and eight it's and it's the index produced by the world Economic Forum America climbed up ... one place in the rankings of a hundred and forty countries\nWere now I had a Singapore Germany Switzerland the Japan we are the most we have the most competitive economy in the world\nAnd the fact of the matter is\nIt is likely due to all the economic policies the tariffs that are starting to pay off more good news about the terrorists are terrorists are controversial we can have that debate I get it All right to have the dialogue\nBut the United states steel Corp workers or about to get the biggest wage increase in at least six years\nUnder a new deal to go she had with the company and according to Reuters\nThat's a sign that the games from President Trump's clamp down on foreign imports are starting to trickle down and impact American workers so he cares about American workers so he cares about American companies solely cares about\nAmericans wow what a what a novel idea an American president worried about American workers\nOh wow I it's been a long time since we've seen that it seems\nWages were frozen in the last contract with US Steel\nPittsburgh based company\nTrump's trade policy coupled with a strong economy has sent domestic steel prices shoring helping US Steel posed a near sixty percent increase in pre tax brackets in the June quarter now the left they hate that they hate companies making money may\nHate companies passion that profit on to their workers but normal Americans normal people appreciate\nThe fact that the thousands and thousands of US Steel Corp workers who are about to get the biggest wage increase they've gotten him six years are thrilled with that news\nAnd guess what that's due to that's due to\nPresident Trump's economic policies including the tariffs including international\nTrade including domestic policies that are making a huge difference so while the media gets all hyperbolic and hysterical about something like the president counter punching a porn star\nWho he defeated incidentally in the courts remember this week and the reason there's been such an animal is there's a court of a federal judge ruled that Stormy Daniels lawsuit against the president tweeting about her\nHer defamation suit was thrown out and she has been ordered to pay his legal fees which according to the president are substantial [noise]\nThat's why this has got this got such contentiousness around [noise] but well the media is laughing about horse race [noise] name the horse race name [noise]\nUm and I know his rule I told you all about during the campaign I send it over and over again when somebody comes after him\nHe runs over him with the with the proverbial with the car he backs up over the body and then he goes forward again to make sure they got the job got done in the first place that's who he is that it's not a surprise in fact I don't even think people are all that shocked that he called Stormy Daniels or set or horse race or whatever\nHe says he's greatly offended Steve I hear your very offended at President Trump's calling Stormy Daniels horse race\nAt first I Want to keep up with it or like you're saying I just saw that brings us to say yeah what's what's about this or that\nA Trump salt that horses and all the women
