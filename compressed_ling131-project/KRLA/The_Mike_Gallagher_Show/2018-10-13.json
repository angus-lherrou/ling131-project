and we think to ourselves are they\nAre they able to handle the crisis and you've been doing this a long time now but but speak Richard Cordray your your opponent had been a lawyer and a lawyer and he's been a lawyer or how about you [laughter]\nYou know I've really tackle some tough problems and the interesting thing\nAbout if you compare Cordray and and like why is that we both were attorney generals and ah you know I beat him eight years ago close race\nBut I but I beat him but what we inherited a was a real mess attorney Joe ... runs the state crime labs and when we took off as a court right left us was if there was a rape or serious crime that occurred in Ohio the\nUnknown DNA was taken to the state crime lab\nA it was sat there if you didn't believe this for a hundred and twenty five days without him by overlooking that that's how far back law that they had\nAnd a court right left that mess and so we fixed it we turned cases around now\nA twenty four hours if it's an emergency uh we're doing four times as much DNA as we did the day he left office and you know our average times about three weeks but we can turn case around very very quickly and the other thing that he couldn't fair\nCordray and what we've done now he left\n'em and they were they were all rape it's sitting and police departments all over the state of Ohio law states that have this problem\nOr he didn't do anything about it what I became attorney general we we started hearing about that and we actually have tested every single one of them we went out to the police say bring it to us\nAh we want to get this evidence are tested and we've tested as I said close to fourteen thousand uh some as these are all cold cases old cases\nUh some there's some Fifteen Years old and\nWe've got hit or matches and thirty six percent so we've gone back\nYou know and better than a third and told the local police who then turned told the victim hey we got you're right that we got your rapists\nAnd in ... county alone in Cleveland where we had a large large number of them\nAre they they have a indicted over seven hundred and fifty people rate while as all of that so it it's it's a great lesson and you see a problem you go after it a court right just just sat there and didn't or\nYou don't do anything and and don't forget of course his time ah heading up Obama's consumer group out in Washington if you if you recall\nUh we we saw for example because of overregulation we ... we saw the number of our community banks down significantly in Ohio I'm sure that occurred\nIn in other states as well just because of the over ... over regulation a quarter a and others had in place\nNow I got to ask you a general DeWine the idea that Ohio which is\nDoing well in this recovery I mean we've got I Know north eastern are pretty doggone well I Know lords down is cooking I Know that that's kind of country as well up in\n... county Cuyahoga County it's cooking why in the world would we turn the state over to the left the uh the laugh I mean what in the world well that people they think about\nThat that look that's absolutely right we're we're we're doing well and Ohio uh we do not want to go back to where we were ... years ago\nEight years ago when Cordray I'm a ... you know was was attorney general and a ... you know he was the attorney general state of Ohio we had had lost a\nClose to four hundred thousand jobs\nAh and you know we were not moving a or unemployment rate was high and in the last eight years under Republican conservative leadership uh we've kept taxes out cut taxes\nAre we seeing the economy move forward and so you know what I Want to do my running mate he used to take a while to the next level or we've come a long long way we do not want to go back\nUh we've got we've got a couple of challenges out there we got an opiate problem that we we have to get in front of and now instead of a you know people not being able to find jobs and not\nEconomy not moving for our biggest challenge now for employers is to find people who are qualified or people who are able to pass a drug test so\nWe're really focusing on you is is two things one is tackling a drug problem we have a twelve point action plan that which makes makes real sad it's realistic a similar things I'm already shirt has already started to do is attorney general but there are things I Can't do it until\nTill I I'm governor I mean one of the things that we want to we think is very important is education prevention for young young kids in regard to drugs or you know I started my career as a county prosecuting attorney I can tell you that I don't know in five years or\nIs it will have an opiate problem but it there's always some drug problems and so we prepare young people starting as early as getting a guard K through twelve so the age appropriate every year every or something that's been proven to to actually work\nUh we will implement that\nAnd it will make a huge difference the the other thing that we're we really want to do a is doubled out on President Trump's opportunities out a were have opportunities zones at Ohio oh this will mirror the tax cuts uh and and the job act\nThat the president and Congress put through a we will make it so that ah\nSomebody looks at the state of Ohio they say well that's the place to invest that's where I I Want to take my ... capital

of war and we talked a lot about what kind of war might come here's my conversation from yesterday afternoon with Ambassador John Bolton\n... thanks for talking to me she or he I'm Glad we were hit a use for your entire life for this job and you were right with the most disruptive presidents as Andrew Jackson in the world or to that is collapsing the job or not I wouldn't be given all the years that you've studied the ad I say\nWell I think it's a it's a it's a job that really gives you an opportunity to serve the president or who's who's in office and every president has a different style or I think good job of the national security adviser really is to make sure that whatever the style of the president that he gets the information he needs\nTo make decisions or that he has the range of options that he needs and then that those decisions are carried out so that's my job I think it's fine that we've got a disruptive president even a kind of chaotic world because there are a lot of changes that need to be made\nStood up to it now's the time to do in\nChina to weaponize we export of commercial technology in recent reports were Bloomberg and elsewhere was there an arms race which we were completely unaware of not participating\nWe were being taken to the cleaners for decades ever since China came into the world Trade Organization\nOr they have pursued American tell us the economic policy and what should the free trade environment and they've gone well beyond that they've violated rule after rule after rule and they've they've defied the production of those who advocate admitting ... to the WTO that if they came in international pressure\nWould make China conform to these rules and norms of behavior they've done the opposite they've gotten worse\nThey steal our intellectual property so they're able to compete with us without the investment that's required and research and development they forced technology transfer is from American and European companies they discriminate against us in terms of their domestic policies\nAre and and because of the economic growth that they've sustain\nNot only by abandoning their Marxist principles but basically by violating the international norms we expected them to comply with\nThey've gained substantial economic strength and on the basis of that economic strength they've built military strike I think what the president's doing because of his business background a among other things things challenging him on the economic grounds\nAnd if they're put back in the proper place they would be if they weren't allowed to steal our technology or their military capabilities would be substantially reduced out a lot of the tensions we see caused by China would be reduced\nSitting right there America when I come
