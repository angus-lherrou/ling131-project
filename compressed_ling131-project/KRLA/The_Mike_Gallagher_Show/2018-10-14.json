perspective how would you say you know the Caribbean is doing these days is a rebound from the twenty Seventeen hurricane season [noise]\nI think what we have found and in fact I spent a good part of the very late spring traveling among some of the most damage to Ireland and from the twenty Seventeen hurricanes and\nIt's hard to believe it's been more than a year but in September of course as we all know two enormous hurricanes plowed across the Caribbean and then did also significant damage to the mainland United States Irma and Maria and several of the island groups and islands of the Caribbean\nOr ravaged I'm In ways that we haven't seen in the Caribbean in a very long time and so we do really important for us it cost of living to go down we wanted to cover the recovery we wanted to inspire our leaders who love the beach and of course and loved the Caribbean\nTo go back and spend their money and share their love and help these islands were cover up really great to be there and see that a lot of these beautiful little boutique hotels resorts beach bars are back and they're ready to eat and they can't wait for you all to come down\nFrom well that's very good news Tracey I Know you were recently in one of the U.S Virgin Islands St John is the one I'm thinking of some particular can you let us know what's going on it's a popular island prevent that or it's what's going on St John\nJohn has pushed back very quickly um cruise bay for anyone who has been to that beautiful little island of St John\nCruise bay is a is a darling little port village it's got great shopping

favorite St John for many many people but now it's even more\nKind of warm and loving and heartfelt than ever before\n... not far away from the U.S Virgin Islands course of the British Virgin islands like a you know Peter Island tore totally Cooper Island ... we didn't get much ... we haven't gotten much news about to be the British Virgin islands what's the situation there\n[noise] the situation to be the guy yeah we have to remember that they were hit with a category five storm you know when Irma came through and then Maria followed but Irma set off seizing seismometers\nIndividually either intended for earthquakes that's how bad it was I mean it picked up shipping containers and salute them across the parking lot and it was just\nHorrifying to hear from locals what happened deep several
