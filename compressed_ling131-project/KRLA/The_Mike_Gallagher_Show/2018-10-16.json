Erie, Pennsylvania I Love the fact that President went the area to my summer camp as I told you can't let her name but you sat down with the president and luckily stall sat down with the president politically solve drove me crazy 'cause she wouldn't let him answer did you let him answer\n[laughter] I did let him answer a fact you can listen to the audio amateurs wet bite of of all the answers like you know nice to talk a lot I I I\nThat's why he's a great and it's the best interview in America he will just say the most astonishing thing if you don't stop them\nExactly and that's exactly what he did when when we sat down in Erie in ... uh uh Erie insurance arena and I haven't really find peace about it tomorrow or I take you inside the whole\nOf that and it's kind of it's kind of call a lot about\nIs his interaction with you because I found in my interviews in the debates he's incredibly interesting to listen to\nIt because he yeah he reads a narrative and he ends up where he wants to go but you got to give them two to three minutes to get there\nYou are given faith because he will not only answer your question but also bringing up three more if you're a reporter to follow up with\nYou know he knows when he wants to tell you every reporter goes in there and knowing that\nNot just with him yet but but any savvy politician is going to take you where they want they she gets it is very different way which is sort of driven our profession a little crazy but it all on a\nKey actually like ... he actually like to talk and have you seen it fast\nYou press conferences that eat out and he joined it and and you know he doesn't mind a tough question that same old hurt\nIf you listen closely you also give you leads but but that would be unfortunate dynamic in the blue bubble newsrooms is if you don't interrupt them your seem to have been a roll over what in fact you're being a good reporter and so\nThe Lesley Stahl I think she interrupted him fifty or sixty times and they use voice over as opposed to just raw footage it's so fundamentally erroneous approached the reporting\nWell your job as a reporter is not only to ask questions to find out whatever you know whatever it is you want to find out more so in that sense\nRight I mean and you do that not just with politicians but you do that with people to people will tell you their story if you give them enough room to do that\nAnd and President Trump was very willing to uh to to tell his story in in our interview in a you know and I and I think that you hear that\nUh if you listen to the audio and if you still see that in the in the end it written I'm part of the of the interview and he won the things I thought was so sort of fascinating and this this is just a silly little nugget but it's important when during the interview he said you know veto\nThere's fourteen thousand people or is it can hit ten thousand people outside and you know there there's a part of it's like yeah yeah okay\nI but then after the interview we let the a lot of talk and I left that then you just a little bit early so that we could go wild story there was no cell service inside we walked outside you know chit chatting and all of a sudden\nThere is a crowd of people not exaggerating ... and ... and it's like what I told reporters\nBefore and they didn't listen to it sort of a combination of a tailgate party and getting up at concerts very their same\nScreen their front of it they're all happy there's there's beach ball being down back and forth to sort of riding a crowd and this ...\nNot leaving it was happy and it was it was in China shame thing to see because you can't say it\nBut you don't ever really have the ability to see it as a reporter because you're stuck\nInside I was like whoa\n[noise] the answer is by everybody Springer here than a Springer show\nBecause of the media being on the left the whole thing is somewhat of a forced because he can't really ask are probing questions flushed he looks like a

the optics as they call it would be appropriate so they gave it all over the woman they racial Mitchell who is a sex crime prosecutor can have her ask because after all she's a female and the

by Robert top that\nHere's the host of Washington weaken review on Friday nights on PBS she is a Washington Post reporter uh park so all the they probably got mine at MSNBC a regular guest Robert good morning ah what do you make of the news from Britain I just announced that a magazine that are not Maggie Theresa May is coming to address the parliament\nStriking news it just another example of how the\nBalance that Theresa May has tried to strike\nA someone who can be both in the ... camp but also work with and then they go she ate has tried to have some kind of agreement\nWith the Europeans just not working as an appetite against globalization and the ranks of the conservative party they want their their the heart act I mean the ...\nWalk of the Tory party is really the heart and soul the Tory party and there's still a lot of anger about Theresa May what she's trying to do and maybe salvage the relationship with Europe rather than moving away\nThe I Will watch that story very closely on to another story and I I think this has ... for last night's interview when the president brought up secretary of defense Mattis suggested maybe he's not long for the administration\nRobert I Am stunned that were Seventeen twenty twos left behind ... air force base their presumed damaged at least and perhaps destroyed they can't get into the hangar that's eight percent of our strategic weapons are number one the greatest fighter ever made we only have two hundred of them or something like that [noise]\nThere will be accountability here is this going to be the occasion for the secretary of defense to fall in the short and say the buck stops with me I run the department of defense those planes were my watch than Mr President here's my resignation\nSecretary Mattis has signaled to a lot of people inside of the Pentagon and the administration that he's probably going to eat after the midterms that this is someone who's on his way out so\nThis whole situation with with the planes\nCould prompt sooner but it's always been really heading for the ... and the president is kind of like a democratic the meant was revealing it as a secretary of defense is really worn out is welcome highly respected by the president and others ...\nBut not the one who's going\nFor your secretary of defense\nHe's also a huge proponent of accountability and they they fired five senior admirals last year over collisions and grounding and I think this is a way for him to send a message about accountability that it's just a huge strategic blow to the United states if that is the early reporting is correct [noise]\nLet me move to Maggie Haberman you and Maggie you know the president about as well as anyone and she interviewed a bunch of rally at tenders a four story yesterday\nAbout why they love Trump and then there are four things quote he wins regardless of how fungible the definition of winning maybe he takes the directly to Democrats unlike previous Republican presidential candidate to prefer comedy ever controversy\nHe does not bow the politically correct culture and he does not condescend to them and to quote it is that last thing Robert Koester that I think is so critical\nPeople really resent the blue bubbles of Manhattan and Washington Silicon Valley in Hollywood they really have gotten in the sense in the first man plop the movie flopping confirms that send me the elites do not know or care about them you're on it [noise]\nI saw her and why I mean the I thought it was a really inspiring film or about the country and about\nThe space program that was very accurate and it in about it is the courage to go to space uh but I guess that there are different issues surrounding that film and\nThe American flag and different things that led to it not being successful at the box office\nBut I think you're right Maggie ... story is strong and that it shows that I was just on on the trail and the president last week I was on air force one in Erie, Pennsylvania and at the rally the crowd are still there and he is an answer for you they they see him all the problems and controversies that he hasn't gone swam\nIn their eyes and he's still the Warren sided establishment and that really more than any ideology is what seems to attract them and President Trump\nYes yet he hasn't gone swamp by the way that is a great phrase I I Will give you credit for that he hasn't done so I I Know you're pretty well that's where I went to summer camp um ... Notre Dame and it's a\nIt's a part of the land part of the northeastern Ohio western Pennsylvania beaver falls Joe name as you named Bernie caused our land and they love Trump I mean they just I Can't stay how much he loved in my home town of war in Ohio but I'll talk to you about first\nFirst man plop a Robert Neil Armstrong grew up in order to how he wasn't born there but he grew up there\nAnd I really was looking forward to I Will not see a movie that does not show Armstrong the iconic moment the picture we all know of him planting the flag they made an artistic choice\nBy having two hundred about that choice that decision to serve the world rather than the American audience and history and therefore I'm not going to support it and I think millions of Americans into it at the same I guess it's sort of contempt for our intelligence do they not think we will react this way\nSpeaking regard here I I was\nI saw the movie and having not seen any article about that the American flag controversy that not showing Armstrong with what\nThey do show the flag on the moon I guess they don't show Armstrong putting it into the ground and the moon I thought the whole movie was about American perseverance and grit and so I was actually kind of stunned when I saw that a lot of people will say oh we'll never see the film\nThought the film was terrific but I I understand I guess now looking but there are some that that's not\nThere's not that the flag being put in the ground but [noise] I don't know you I mean it's a good movie but I I'm\nA moviegoer and sunny bunch says it's a wonderful you might movie reviewer right at the Washington pretty big and he's a great man and he is with you that I'm a lunatic pronouncing it but I Am into it and how can you take the central moment it is the iconic picture why would you exclude that Robert and I would expect\nThe president and to eventually get around to this\nI Would they exclude that plan thing of the flag because it's a moment of American trial and western trial [noise]\nI I I I'm Still surprised by that controversy because the movie shows why in the moon just not the plant a flag\nSo that like it doesn't mean the whole thing\nAbout the American space program at all the old movies about the the American flags everywhere throughout the whole on but\nI Would I don't understand\nThe filmmakers knew it was caused that started the whole movie almost\nPatriotic team it does not have that that scene because it makes\nSense because you're you're really Venice film from having tracks and so ...\nSo predictable and yet\nArrogant to continue on in the face of the controversy which has been six weeks and I could've cut it in I mean it just wouldn't have been hard [noise] let me talk to a little bit about it ... what's coming ahead or in these elections as I read\nThe tea leaves in Ohio and probably going to Tampa on Thursday\nTalking to people across the country I've got Kramer winning in North Dakota Holly

think Jesse Ferguson is veteran democratic strategist has good reason to be nervous\nLast night the president I watched his interview on sixty minutes with Leslie stall I thought if somebody was in a coma and they had woken up from a coma yesterday and turned on sixty minutes and just watch this president for the first time\nThey'd be in love with it\nThey wouldn't do they couldn't they wouldn't be able to believe that America elected a guy like this I mean he was he was on point he was so calm and confident uninsured\nAnd he was he he takes on the swamp he takes on the establishment it was a it was ... it was a splendid interview here's cut number five sixty minutes last night and this is not the first time that the president has as a you know visited with Leslie stall\nAnd he talks about the swamp I loved his comments about what Washington DC is comprised of this is why he got elected this is the reason this this will likely president\nThis unlikely guy won this unlikely candidate won ears cut number five as the president spells out for all the world to hear\nWhat Washington DC is made up this is audio and video courteous is courtesy of CBS sixty minutes and gravy and listen\nTo the biggest surprise and what have you learned since you've been president\nOkay so I always used to say the toughest paypal or Manhattan real estate guys and Bob now he's saying that they don't pay for this is the last ... world\nIt is and ... it's full of allies to seat and deception team make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with at that table\nI mean this is why he got elected it's just disgusting the way the establishment operates in Washington DC\nAnd then you know there's always a Trump moment there's always a moment something he says that the media houses on during the Kavanaugh hearings it was at his rally in Mississippi where he\nSort of mimic door mocked or or or\nQuestioned the veracity of Dr Christine Blasey Ford's accusation against Brett Kavanaugh Lesley Stahl asked him about it this is cutting number for when the president acknowledged that for the for for the first time as far as I Know why he said what he said about Dr Ford cut for [noise]\nHave classes for I think we\nMade that speech we would not have one that I was just saying she didn't seem to know anything and you're trying to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary why didn't you have to make fun of\nIt didn't really make fun of that is the person that we're talking about didn't know the air the time the place by the four and got before the Senate and and that clip from worst moment and she said when the two boys who laughed at me at life\nAnd then I watched him in a car and thousands of people were laughing at her [noise]\nThey can do what they tell you the way [noise]\nNow justice Kevin who was traded has become a big factor intimate terms\nI mean he he he addresses it had on now ... ... what do you make of that explanation of his comments about Dr Ford he he's he's making the point that Kavanaugh was treated so horrifically and incidentally Dr Ford was treated terribly to she wanted was an additive in\nAll she wanted was confidentiality she figured she could she thought she had a way to try to stop Brett Kavanaugh from being confirmed to the Supreme Court in her own way on her own terms none of that happened because the Democrats leaked her name and her story to the media and it was out there for all the world to see\nAnd then of course President Trump said the Leslie stalling to repeated a an a message to the gate when the gives on the stump all the time\nAnd frankly it makes people hate him cringe\nIt makes those of us who support him we have a we have a real knowing understanding of why he says he says this off and on the president I got here in other words I Won and they lost his number six from his stripped down last night on sixty minutes with CBS is Leslie stall cuts sex\nAnd the thing I really learned\nHis I never knew how dishonest media was I I I really meant it I'm not saying that as a soundbite fighting now I knew how to take out well not even that way you asked me a question about separation happen\nWhen I say Obama did it you don't want to talk of them out on a second line your answer but you did it for a time I'm just telling you that you've seen it to me much differently on the subject I disagree but I don't want to have that type of hey I had a fight with the cat and then not hang on president and you know\n[laughter] I Know again I Can't do anything but laugh because you know you can't you can't really dispute that hey Leslie on President and you're not he says there's all the time and so that leaders rallies if you watch his rallies that's\nNot a new talking point for Donald Trump I'm
