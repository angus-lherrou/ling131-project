I'm a an agenda for murder rate is and I think as a result Reagan conservatives are very happy\nI think Reagan would have been surprised by how conservative journal truck has become I think he was a pretty sturdy Democrat and Reagan day wasn't any ...\nIs that he he he donated against Reagan twice and and I can only assume voted against Reagan twice in eighty in eighty four he ... he was not known for being someone who spend a lot of time in Republican circles when Reagan was the uh the man of the power\nThat he wasn't a and I'm like hey interestingly enough though by\nHistory reveals that Ronald Reagan to was once the Democrats ... ... yeah yeah I mean he looked up for a while to uh\nTo Roosevelt and from the referring fireside chats and many other Americans did so um [noise] I think in some respects that's where he picked up the value of telling a story and painting a vision for the country of stuff\nYou know where a talk show as president\nAnd that's where I think a lot of people find our current president a bit lacking ... if you can imagine that uh you look at you look at Reagan and he really had an overarching narrative and whether you agreed with this policy positions or not you could see them sitting in a house\nThat overarching narrative was\nBeing rolled out you don't give that was strange inexperienced actor who was able to communicate that narrative seeing the ... here in a regular basis and I think that's right I think Trump has a largely similar\nAh agenda but virtually no ability to communicate at or or do anything consistently both creatures of television though this is where the comparing them reality television versus General Electric ... yes presenting yeah prime time\nYeah yeah you know Reagan he understood how to tell a story and he understood the value of a story\nIn terms of capturing ones imagination and he was able to since they put the United states it's a it's a context that's a story and he was able to bring people along with them as he told his story and a and I think you're absolutely right I don't think Trump has for a moment to ever\nGiven that darned about telling stories are being inventions um [noise] you know you couldn't turn away from Reagan because he wanted to know where the story went to you can't turn away from Trump because you don't know what he's\nGoing to say next you know he's able to capture\nPeople's um [noise] you know attention not because almost you know what I think he favors the world of surprise and you know you're always hanging on the edge of your seat this if he's going to say something outrageous or something incredibly politically correct incorrect so\nAs a result they he and Reagan are like in the sense that they know how to get an audience that's just the way they unfold their stories in front of the audience\nIs very radically different ... Reagan Reagan drew you in with his twinkle in his eyes a an a charming little smirk Trump's just got that hair it's a fascinating that hair and that\nOrange glow of that [laughter] and I don't I don't think Reagan and I appreciate our appreciate John your thoughts on this I I don't know the Reagan would have done well with a hundred and forty characters I I think the tweet storms or read it I don't\nThink Reagan would have done well in that sort of a circumference around what he could do or say he was more of an angry\nWith John ... I think he would dump periodical well constructed you know short bon ... yeah you know patriotic short yeah he would not have like been spouting off at three in one day when I in fact I get\nThat question more than any others you know if we could have tweeted in the answer is obviously yes and and you know ... that's a fact just because if you\nLook at Reagan's career you know we started off in radio he migrated to television as it came out and he went to in Hollywood in the movies and uh you know the ... and he he was a master at speeches he and a day that\nUh well you know you had had a whole crowd are guys around them and I knew how to stage a script the moment\nBut I Would say that I mean when Reagan was tweet\nWould um you know we speechwriters wouldn't you know what right the hundred and forty characters and give them several options and Reagan like he worked with his speeches were perfect about a hundred and forty words who wrote it into his own voice but he absolutely what a tweet he just would have tweeted sure you know inside a strategic communications plan\nThan well crafted haiku in a hundred and forty characters we knew exclamation point no all\nKept yeah the the use of wraps I mean there are a PHD feces that are being written now about Donald Trump's use of all caps and exclamation\nPoints and the ability to reduce all these arguing there was something aspirational about Ronald Reagan I mean pointing a vision of the way we should be living our lives that was a distance away from what we were ... you get with from that it's much more ... they were taking what we're doing now\nIs to be better ... it's very transactional deal we could do better were being taken advantage if we can do better\nNow I've got to ask you John I Know you write on this topic a lot uh your author of of a couple of a a great great books on the topic how would you advise people to\nKind of better engage with the Trump Administration better understand the Trump Administration based on the comparisons that you've made to Reagan and earlier administrator ...\nWell you know again I haven't worked on Capitol Hill all eight years of Reagan's administration that study them very carefully I never I was at every one of his state of the union address is um you know I Know I got into public service because of Ronald Reagan and I run a foundation today because\nOf my respect for him and so um you know like I've studied the man I can I can tell you it's almost it's uncomfortable um you know when you're in making comparisons between the two because you just this is ... ... different time\nOr a ... I may bring as sacred hair known really they're really amazing but there are similarities I I I Know our last guests was pitching the differences but\nYou know there was a night sheen eighty campaign buttons from the Republican National committee in the Reagan campaign and what did you say it said ...\nIt said did it make America great again Trump was listening he he he was he was listening but second note rate Reagan Reagan you spoken paragraphs [laughter] in a kind of built up arguments that that that resonated\nAnd and Trump I think he's a creature of our time I feel responsible I said this on the show before I think we all are responsible for Trump because this is a level of conversation we have now I I got to ask you Jim ... does Trump resonate up in the great state of Washington\nOr are there are there Trump hers up in that part of the world and I live in\nA big we've lost Jim I think we've lost him let's go ahead and thank you Jim for calling all the way from
