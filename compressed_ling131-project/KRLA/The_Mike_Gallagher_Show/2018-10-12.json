earthquake in Ninety four the LA Riots I commanded forces in northern San Diego in the San Diego fire crisis in two thousand seven\nSo you know I I I I've been in the middle of these but nothing nothing like this this is going to be incredible and\nThe the devastation or military families are military equipment\nUh and and of course the the people on the Florida coast is it it's going to be credible and we're going to see a huge effort a huge collection of a military and civilian efforts going into a relieve all I think I think this is one of the things that Donald Trump has done very well Hugh\nWhich is a focus on these disasters course sky help Rick Scott too because this shows confidence I mean would you would you trust Gillum with is a kind of recovery ... it's a real test of seriousness for the people for it\nRight right and and I think seriousness is on the ballot in fact after Eric Holder yesterday to talk to you about Eric I got a plan for people so that if they're just turning and this is the former attorney general now presidential candidate Eric Holder caught on a cell phone video at a small gathering ... number eight\nThey have to use the power that they have gotten for for the wrong things they want to keep themselves in how they want to teeter to special interests me this time for us as Democrats\nTo be as tough as they are dedicated as they are

[noise] it was selling says you know when they go low we don't know [noise] they go low we\nClicked or what the militant normal ... think about that\nWell or militant normal are saying yeah I I Know you know I guess I guess when we go low you're running guns to Mexico and get held in contempt of Congress you or a sick the IRS on us it looks like they sick the uh\nUh FBI on our leaders are the folks we elected I mean ... really Hugh how how did these guy\nHow are these guys start playing hardball did they resurrect stuff from nursery school I mean we're already at ... with that Stephen Miller article about eating paste as a kid I mean we're already at third grade I mean how deep do we go\nIt's triggered some CNN anchor as like Don Lemon you're not allowed to use the word mob around them are they going to melt there and you went to a limited mix it up before but I get to a more profound thing right now the media is trying to say how long will the cabinet backlash yesterday I saw Chuck Schumer come out with a bunch of Democrats they didn't mentioned Kevin I'll watch that tells me\nThat Martha McSally surge Marsha Blackburn surge Matt Rosendale surge the surge of my Bronx that it's very deep and wide\nWell look it's so bad for the Democrats the Dino Rossi is starting to win something in Washington yeah that's how bad it is\nThat fair that they do everything to make sure dino loses yeah that's like a certain number one thing jak dino out of a win but I think it goes to this military normal phenomenon that you've been talking about and and explain for people who live in a cave what a militant normal it's\nOK normal people you know she were or are the kind of people who don't spend all their time on politics they're too busy building this country feeding it fueling it even defending that\nTheir regular folks who who process the elite to go you know run our country runner institutions I Want security and prosperity as long as you do that you know you take a little off the top of your power your prestige your money\nThat's fine I Want to live my life I Want to do things like teach by kids basketball team go to church even enjoy the occasional beer but when they screw up you know the normal come back and react the silent majority throwing out Jimmy Carter\nBut the problem now Hugh is not only are leads incompetent or refusing to accept any kind of accountability they actually hate normal people\nAnd you you can see the I mean you get Amory Clinton interview the other day saying well you know there can't be any civility I I mean until we're in charge that's the civility of the great pass\nIt it is and I I Do believe that when they asked the question how long will it last they're attempting to message Democrats not to talk about this [laughter] I don't think you forget getting mugged a month\nLater I really don't think you put\nThe mugging behind you are getting hit by a car or watching someone get murdered ... event plot over in a month and a and I don't think the militant normal are going to forget cabinet Chuck Grassley a funny though you might be said yesterday remember cabinet that is the militant normal rallying cry\nWhat look is is the ah you know as the hip kids say the militant normal Scott whoa by Kavanaugh we're kind of OK things are going good we're we're just going to go back to our life and then they realized what complete lunatics the people on the other side we're in and and frankly\nEvil lunatics I mean you don't do what they did the Kavanaugh to any way that is unacceptable every every normal man out there thought\nWait a minute this is a license to destroy anybody pops his head up and opposes\nThe elite this you know in every uh every woman had to think quite well I got a husband and I got a brother I got a son he can be destroyed in an instant by these people if we let them go there for ...\nIt was a cookbook and if it had worked there I you know I I joke to some of us that there will never be another white male Supreme Court justice but that is probably not true because it didn't work\nBut all of a sudden if we've got Stephen Miller third grade picture posted then we know the extent and depth to which they will go and I this is not political ... isn't the way we do things like there\nLook like I write a militant normal we've really got two choices we can accept this and say okay you're beating nuts [laughter] I'm I'm taking this whole infatuation with participating in my own self governance off the table you can do what you want or you can say no\nNo I'm not going to do I will vote for the Dino Rossi or what the hallways\nAnd the blogs and and the ...\nI'm not going to let these people\nWhen and and we're seeing that it was last week when we talk we talked about anecdotally we we both talk to you talked to a bunch of people on the radio I I talked to a bunch of people in real life and I was treated to such amazing insights as conservatives calling me and say

establishment Democrat and Eric Holder Eric Holder is often\nMentioned as a presidential candidate Eric Holder the former attorney general under Brock Obama said something this week that I don't hear many Democrats condemn\nUm in fact we squeezed into the show up and you might have heard a bit of it a moment ago I'm not certain that there is a Democrat alive who has a problem with what he said and therein therein lies the reveal\nI Need to I Need to spend a minute and reveal and and and let's let's just bask in the transparency\nOf the bad shape the Democrats are facing that they're in right now I mean Democrats still remain the favorite to win back the house\nUm they always had a long shot bit of taking the Senate that was what they had hoped\nBut now that appears to demean even further\nPolls are suggesting that Republican voters are re engaged over the Brett Kavanaugh battle\nMaybe even by the way Democrats are behaving these days and manner they behaving badly and for some

[laughter] make no mistake about it that'd be a problem that would be\nUm I I catastrophic is an exaggeration but it would be really really bad for the Democrats to take control of the house
