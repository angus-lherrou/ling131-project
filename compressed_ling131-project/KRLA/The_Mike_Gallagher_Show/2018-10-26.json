great leadership stuffy\nStores conclude one last question about leadership and turbulent times has to do with Donald Trump whose numbers are improving views change the Supreme Court is one of the third year battle for the Supreme Court military being rebuilt the economy is harming along\nWith of course we're divided country and I'm just watching the news is when he was blaming Trump for the pipe bomb that cetera what do you see emerging which way as his reputation going to go based upon extrapolating the first two years in the next to impossible sex I think\nThe main question will be is there a point in which he will recognize that he has done a lot of things that he hoped to do and that and try and he has to reach out to expand the base not just up the base and try and become the leader of all the people that is a huge transition that still has not taken place\nAnd the question will be yes people are feeling better about their jobs they may be feeling better and that's important they may be feeling better even about the confidence in the silicon and may\nDo they feel better as citizens right now they feel that the country it's more a better place the way the language is going the way people are fighting the way the polarization is deepening the way they wake up every morning and they see something on television that they wished they weren't seeing\nThat sense of feeling good about being a citizen as a country is another level I think of judging are you a better or worse off having been here for two years\nThan simply the material goods that are at the bottom which absolutely important as well so we'll see what happens if that shift if that gets worse if the polarization deep and as if it leads into even more violence as we might be seeing

British troops and you get one of ice cream Senator Graham artist to do this last last night I mean here we are in Dallas texas and here's hundreds\nAnd hundreds of people roaring their approval for just for your name were so appreciative of your voice and and I I just got to get the Lindsey Graham\nThirty five thousand feet view of of what the of the time we're living in this investigation is intensifying these suspicious packages CNN's Jeff Zucker immediately blamed President Trump's what is what a Senator Lindsey Graham say about the last twenty four hours of this very nervous a dangerous time\nWhere you take your frustrations out at the ballot box for support you're saying there's a portrait causes appropriately I don't blame President Trump for this any more than I blame Bernie for the guy who shot\nState Scalia and tried to kill a bunch of congressman Rosa Bernie supporter but Bernie doesn't support that this person is obviously sending bombs to critics of the press that\nThat's not the way we do business in America hope that get caught I Hope they go to jail and I hope and about Thirteen Days recover when at the ballot box because we deserve to get reelected\nAnd that's the answer the only answer we have we got to be the the the we got to have a big boy pants on we can't Flay all around and and point fingers of blame the wrong time to do this because frankly Senator Graham seems very clear Republicans have a great deal of momentum heading into November ...\nNo question about it I'm so Kevin I think for people who are trying to say to you and to my cell phone I made them is it thank you for speaking a thank you for speaking in a in a fashion that if I were there I Would have said the same thing\nLess than what they were kind of data Brett Kavanaugh who I've known for Twenty years is destroying his life to keep the seat open to make sure that Democrat could say within twenty twenty they actually said that\nThey play dirty and they lost I'm Glad I called them out I had all I could take at thirty percent of them aren't taken now because how 'bout chose them because I thought they were qualified Thurman butter pecan spurts a ... to people from South Carolina the game's played differently now\nAnd what they were kind of due to Brett Kavanaugh all that I Hope there's a backlash at the ballot box and I hope we pick up seats and they get punished for what they're trying to\nDo you mind if I asked if I go a little personal with you because of known for a long time and I respect you at all on ... you know that all the years that I've been on the radio I said Senator Lindsey Graham is a good and decent man I met you in Washington DC changed it early in my talk radio career you told me something that stuck with me you said\nMike I came to Washington not to say no to everything I Want to get stuff done I Want to get things across the finish line there's a belief and I and I hope it doesn't hurt your feelings are a big because I respected admire you and I know you for a long time there is a belief that with your friendship with the late Senator McCain\nYou were sort of restrained a little bit and with his passion is like Lindsey unleashed its Lindsey Graham the way South Carolina south Carolinians have known him for many many years he was there any merit to that Senator Graham\nAnd now people are thinking way too hard ah here's the deal or if you know anything about and they have tried to be a supporter of an independent judiciary part are traditionally needs to be independent of politics\nJohn McCain was not dares friend he voted against so tomorrow and cake cameras heart asked when it came to judges [laughter]\nSo the bottom line as I could have never done to set them aren't taken what they were doing to Brett Kavanaugh they were misrepresenting his life\nThey trade that for it and there's no doubt in my mind something happened to that report but I don't believe Kevin had anything to do with it or they tried to ruin his family\nAnd they said if you're really innocent or not you ask for this charade continue and that's when I lost it as in Durban ask Kevin out attorney Don McGahn the White House counsel if you really have nothing now I wanted to ask for this to continue they present him guilty not innocent\nEverything that I Believe in as a lawyer or was was basically trampled on\nAnd I pushed back and it's no more complicated than that\nWell we're ... on a nation is grateful for you and your push back many believe I mean as it is it an overreach to say that that that that your voice your speech your passion helped the confirmation occur\n[noise] well here's what I Would say number one I Want to congratulate President Trump for picking Brett Kavanaugh who's the great lake amount of his generation his resume of being a judge was unquestioned his integrity he's just a great guy I think what happened is that\nBut I discovered relief factor I
