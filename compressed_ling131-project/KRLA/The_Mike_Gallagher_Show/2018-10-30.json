McCarthy and then I submitted the Republicans are responsible for violence but there's not a bomb or a semi representative of Trump people\nI think that blows up in their hands and I don't mean the bomb I mean the rhetoric because ... the idea that this crazed killer would be killer is somehow representative of Trump supporters or West Virginians is to me going to drive people to the ... more see a vote check what do you think\nWill look I think that's right\nWhenever people are seeing these ... I think they're beginning to associate with the with the crazy what happened because you have people literally going not on the other side of the aisle and more and more people now is Joe mansion or to get elected again\nHis first voters for Chuck Schumer that whole shoe we're close to the Clinton obstruct resist impeach mob that's what it's all about it\nPeople can connect the dots now and there's more and more activity occurs where people ceased crazy behavior on the part of the liberal leadership and the people that are trying to gain control of the house that\nI think that's a very motivating factor more and more I think folks are understanding\nBut these are not West Virginia conservative values they don't buy records\nAnd the conservative fighter took on the Obama administration repeatedly it'll warn protect coal fighting substance abuse at standing up for conservative values are Second Amendment and coal lifestyle you\nJoe matches the opposite and even more importantly when he votes for sure it's a vote for the mob mentality\nNow now to finish on that point pat more than she does the average voter connect Joe mansion with Chuck Schumer because we all know what matters most is the majority in the Senate when it comes to judges\nAnd while Joe mansion may have voted for Brett Kavanaugh his party didn't they did everything they could to destroy him and he tried to stand aside from that wreckage but do voters know that if you vote for mansion you're voting for more of the cabinet or attempt to take out\n[laughter] well we just started a couple of commercials on that I think they are or are they do that at soldiers are smart\nThey know that the craziness they saw that didn't come from the Republican side of the aisle they know that it's not always Schumer's polo see it's Hillary Clinton I mean Hillary Clinton said that they kept the civil I mean that's a quote from Hillary Clinton\nI mean people can connect that and obviously Joe mansion doubled our support Hillary Clinton even after she said\nShe was going to put a lot of coal miners coal companies that works I think they are you there bring it together because they know that this side represents a complete a hundred and eighty to return to go back to the Obama era the Hillary Clinton era which they really hate it so\nI feel that the energy on our side we're seeing it at all the surveys it's growing and growing\nAt what Joe ... as a problem as voters up\nIt's just sort of be a big issue for me it is a long day but it will fly by good luck\nPatt Morrison sprint towards the
