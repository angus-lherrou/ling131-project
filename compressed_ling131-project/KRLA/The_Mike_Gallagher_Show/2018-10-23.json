really silly how what was it Ninety two percent was the likelihood that Hillary was going to win a court in New York\nTimes and I kept looking for a sign\nI kept saying something's going to come along right before the election but it's going to give me hope but he's got a chance of winning the other word somebody's going to know something that we don't know and if you listen to my show in twenty six team you remember what it was there was a little blurb and the New York post\nReported that Hillary Clinton who was going to have her big victory celebration at the Javits convention center because if it's big glass ceiling you know a woman breaking through the glass ceiling and be elected president of the United states and all of that\nShe had a fireworks display plant they were going

happening unfolding before our very eyes I like our chances\nAs we somehow saw Brett Kavanaugh I'd get confirmed I like our chance as we see people yelling at a leader McConnell in a restaurant in
