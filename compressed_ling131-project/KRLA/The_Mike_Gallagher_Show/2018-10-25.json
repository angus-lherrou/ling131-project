in Cleveland, Ohio go right back to the phones a eight hundred five to zero one two three four especially with the caller that I just cut off momentarily but what a great piece in time magazine at time dot com\nOr you know especially as we talk about the president probably declaring his status as a nationalist which he very clearly contrasted with out of a global list and then you listen to the American left being intellectually dishonest and that's a big part of this\nIt it's not just reprehensible to suggest that the president meant to say white nationalist instead of just nationalist\nRather than just to follow up on your comments about being a national is there is a concern that you are sending coded language for a dog whistle to some Americans out there that what you really mean is that you're a white national hate I I just cannot believe that somebody\nCan actually call themselves a journalist a credible journalist in good standing\nWith such a question there are some who think that what you really mean to say is if you're a white match it's just so beyond\nI Would like to say beyond the pale but that might not do us any favors here it's just ridiculous is it not a but that's the gym a cost and the left or ... or a convenience to act as if the president was somehow using that inter racial way not in an America First kind of a way compared to the global global ... at one time magazine nationalism\nHas gotten a bad reputation but it's what America needs white now just a couple of lines from this today we hear the sloppy miss conceived term white nationalism more often than we hear about American nationalism\nAnd whatever the term nationalism and raised is raise it as often quickly conflated with racism for instance that in October twenty third rally president Donald Trump declared that he was a national ... he used the term in contrast with global list who he called a person that wants the globe to do well frankly not caring about our country so much\nMany commentators quickly deplore the president's statement has a dog whistle admission that he truly supports white nationalism once again suppressing legitimate debate over the value of American nationalism while insisting that racial is white nationalism is what we really should be talking about\nThis is a problem because it's American nationalism that the U.S needs white now never in our lifetimes that we see in America's various tribes so divided so intolerant of one another\nSo quick to de legitimize and even threatened violence the mutual loyalty that has about Americans together as a nation seems like it is disappearing the bitter argument over ongoing large scale immigration is only a proxy for this deeper issue\nCan Americans every night again around a shared national story\nCan they ever see themselves as brothers again that's just a very small part of a very very good article that I read last night actually and ah it's a time and I tweeted follow me on Twitter you can read this for yourself I'm going to put it on Facebook as well on Twitter you can find me at radio Don ... radio done rights and yes that's a double entendre\nAnd then also or on Facebook I Will put this story as well that France radio the last name is ed for eight and ... all one word France radio and read that story for yourself\n[noise] All right let's go back to Kaylan who called us from Oregon last segment and he's now on the Hugh Hewitt show Kevin go right ahead\nHey yeah so I was just calling because you're talking about the caravan earlier [noise] yes um I just had a couple of thoughts on that the first being I mean I'm sure a lot of people think it it's just amazing how the left media will spend countless hours trying to make it look like it's um\nSome good things like that for example they say that uh the president is wrong and saying that there is some bad people and it even though they've actually literally arrested people I talk to people that were bad in that group um but they'll sit there and try and there\nAre others yeah not only that there are others were being interviewed by some media that is walking along with this caravan who're admitting yeah there's some criminals among us we don't know who they all are but we know they're here that we don't know how many of them we are we but we know they're here they're admitting this there's there's a you know on camera interviews with these people so that even they know\nThat while the vast majority of them might just be coming to the United states to take jobs from Americans there are also people there who are\nYou know who are criminals and who were there to do bad things once they get to the United states\nExactly um and then my other thought wisdom about this interview with Jim Acosta\nOr are you familiar with the a funny thing going around and keep the\nLaw was going around the un PC\nThat the anti the like jokes going around I don't think so um so basically and then the the isn't any video game it stands for non pliable character and it's and oh\nYes yes yes yes I've seen that that that you know just a non non a defined a drawing of of someone yes I'm not a video game or but I did see it and PC yeah so what about Acosta\nAlong with any offering reason is you know what I mean several thousand dollars for half price only thirty seven mountains life

eight hundred and five to zero one two three four to talk more about the caravan to talk more about nationalism notice I did not add the model fire white\nThe wage him accosted in the way that those on the left have really just\nIt is so intellectually dishonest that's what they've done it's one thing you know it's reprehensible it's disgusting it's despicable it's all the ... it's just so intellectually dishonest I thought that last caller was brilliant colors said it reminds me of Google Search\nAnd you know you type in the first few letters of what you're searching for on Google and then they complete the sentence for you did you mean this did you mean that President Trump said there's globalism\nAnd then there's nationalism global is don't really care how well the country does they care about how well the globe does I'm In the other camp I care about my country first I'm a nationalist compared to global is\nSo you type in national did you mean white nationalism you your dog whistling right now it's just so intellectually dishonest I mentioned in the last hour for the first hour a ironically enough\nThat time magazine or time dot com did a really really great piece American nationalism is exactly what we need right now nationalism has gotten a bad rap and that's gotten a bad rap by the left who want to try to do everything they can to paint Donald Trump\nDonald Trump's administration Donald Trump voters supporters as being racist and as being in some way shape or form a hostile towards people of color especially people of color who want to come to the United states\nIllegally wow that hostility simply because of your white nationalism was it was it Hillary or was it I'm\nNancy Pelosi I'm trying to remember\nWhen the president unveiled make America great again back in the campaign neither in the spring of twenty sixteen before that election or maybe even in the fall of ... twenty Fifteen\nBut when he unveiled that it was either Hillary plus I can I Can't really distinguish there to screeching voices from one another sometimes who said what what Donald Trump really means is make America white again\nTry and they try so hard to make that that can spike all of their very best efforts as I noted in the first hour the president's still enjoys\nA two percent higher approval rating them Brock Obama had at the same point at the midterm election a point of his first term back in twenty times it is an astounding thing it really is it's it's a modern day miracle it's something that should be studied by scientists how\nCan Donald Trump better we have a forty seven percent approval rating with all of the negativity all of the claims of racism and worst\nSo at any rate I promised I Would take that time dot com peace and share it with you and I

R. A. N. T. Z. is the last name France radio on Twitter and Facebook you can find that uh that time article and and and it really does a great job of explaining the difference between nationalism and globalism and it has nothing to do with race and white nationalism\nSo not to hear from you know the eight hundred five to zero one two three four or by way of the social media platforms and I will read some of the best uh thoughts on the air next hour we will be heavy with gas Rahim ... author\nAnd Claremont Institute fellow will join us to talk about this a caravan Stephanie rural MSNBC will be joining us as well ... Massachusetts share of Thomas Hodgson\nMan I met by the way for the first time last month in D. C. when I broadcast from the I'm a feat hold their feet to the fire event a which is I Believe the twelfth I think it's the twelfth annual\nI'm fair um conference affairs the federation of Americans for immigration reform and I spoke with a sharp Hodgson as well as a a former acting ice director Thomas Homan and and a number of other law enforcement\nUh and federal border patrol people and so on and so forth and a ton of such and this fantastic and he is going to\nTry to dispel the myth that all of this illegal immigration and all of these thousands and thousands of people which by the way collectively add up to millions and millions of people if you're doing the math at home ah the idea that they are not impacting your life\nThe idea that they are not impacting or community in a in and oftentimes very very negative ways is simply a just that it's a myth and he's going to talk to you about exactly what it means even you know people think that it's uh uh the impact of illegal immigration has only felt in the border states it's only in you know Texas or New Mexico Arizona California but\nNot or even the western say no ... he's in Massachusetts for goodness sakes\nBecause they do they filter and they spread through all over the all over the country are you know you know again some of them just simply for looking for economic opportunities and taking jobs and so on and so forth but others for nefarious purposes and Thomas option will be joining us in the third of our of the program to discuss that for now let's go back to your phone\nAlso and it looks like our next

listening to many times in his time as a fairly well not about uh the uh integration program I mean out of the shower\nSays situation which is extremely desperate by point ages that are like we did and turns a ship on the Japanese during World War two ship them off to a a various places some got little villages and so on\nA you know there's that involved that can be usually done we spent trillions of dollars and everything else that we have the most important dire situation that as probably call on this country\nAre and who knows how long but it's a desperate situation where you have these people that we're having a desire to get away and get a life and get some kind of spirit back\nIn the world and they don't have that are marching on to do it like the ... and they came out of England\nOkay well let's try to fix it by doing something with the red cross or something to make them with food and water and medical supply or that they desperately need and shut up and down the border away and then fix up something here in this country\n... in Nevada or whatever how much land we have got tons of it\nShow or let them build their own ... a village or their own homes or their own town help the local government and then shut them up with something to do to make them understand how to work\nAnd make some money or make a living out of China let them deal with or\nThe wanting this whole thing the Democrat new some great great to only one debate on a Monday morning at ten am on it [laughter] well I cashed five one at them station\nJust where they are and what we're really motivated to a lot and it totally looks\nWell I'm Glad I'm Glad to hear about the motivation on here's what I Would say in response to your your production of the blue wave is is just a made up media ... um ... the reality of the situation is that historically the party that is not in power in the White House does gain a significant number of seats\nOften times as many as twenty twenty five thirty seats in the next midterm election it has happened that way historically throughout you know a recent ... you know American uh uh uh elections mid term elections so the idea that the Democrats are going to pick up a bunch of seats is not a myth based on history is a fact they are\nThe question is will it be enough to actually take the house back to take over control that is not absolutely not guaranteed um and and I'm not suggesting that it's guaranteed that the Republicans are going to hold on to it but I look at all of these ... nobody does is better than you\nAnd I say there's not too uh you know just the you know suck up to the namesake of the show but but nobody is on top of these national racist and where the battleground races are and which ones are the toss ups better than he does and it is you know you see that generic\nDemocrat lead over Republicans and the generic ballot of would you prefer a Democrat to leader public in the lead a and it's around plus seven to plus nine Democrats right now which would indicate holy cow the GOP is in trouble or give the gavel back demand sea and let her a letter get ready because they're going to win\nBut that's when you count all of the very decidedly blue areas and again I'm I'm I'm learning from the professor Hugh on this the decidedly blue areas you know in in New York and California and other places those were all added in but when you narrow it down to the\nSixty or Seventy closest races the ones that are toss ups hideous literally I toss it is literally a toss up between the reading the candidate and it is absolutely imperative that the Democrats want to when they when the vast majority of those to overtake the Republicans in the house and\nHold so much more coming off opera and sitting in for you if

know that right [noise] you know that\nThis show called migrant caravan which is really\nMore accurately characterized as a a a marching um invading group of illegal\nMigrant caravan sounds so nice doesn't it oh it's just it's just poor misguided people who are a little lost in their trajectory and they're they're just happen to be headed towards the southern border the United states of America there just migrants gonna care of a caravan of such a nice warm feel to that word\nCaravan second movie caravan touring the country in a caravan look look there's a Grand Canyon because big you know\nThe truth is Americans are seeing these video images\nAmericans are set up and\nAmericans are going to go to the polls and pull the lever for Republicans on November the ... it is unbelievable to see the way the media is desperately trying to make\nThe the invading illegals story work to the Democrats advantage there is nobody sitting around and say boy I'm so glad the Democrats want to open borders\nNobody's setting or no one's saying that no I mean I'd I'd say no one a few probably a Bernie Sanders supporters or whatever but I guarantee you this is the October surprise\nThat is going to make all the difference in the world\nAnd if and when the Republicans win on November ... less than two weeks from now it will it will have started with Brett Kavanaugh and ... will have been slam dunked by the illegals coming here from Honduras El Salvador\nGuatemala et cetera are witnessing history this isn't supposed to happen nothing the Democrats have been doing has worked nothing the Democrats have attempted has succeeded over the last two months three months finally their luck has run out\nAnd the Republicans\nHave the momentum now don't get complacent don't relax do sit back and say oh good we got this Gallagher's talking about the October surprise I don't have to go to the polls you do\nYou do you got to fight you got to fight you got to pray you got to go to the polls\nThen you've got to vote Republican across the board you cannot go there isn't a Democrat on the ballot anywhere in America\nWho deserves your vote\nI Love the exchange last night between Tucker Carlson and Jorge Ramos because the folks that are open borders and have such a pro\nUh illegal take they're never going to open their homes to these people\nAnd they could they could\nJorge Ramos reportedly lives in a big big mansion in Miami, Florida he is a very successful Hispanic broadcaster 'em by all accounts he's a pretty nice guy he is staunchly anti Trump he staunchly\nOpen border bring in all the illegals come across the border coming to the United states last night on Tucker Carlson show he wanted to know why aren't you bring in some of them into your home\nWhy aren't you open up your beautiful mansion and letting twenty thirty maybe forty of them\n... why not\nWhy not open your doors and put your money where your mouth is here's cutting number five is this your last night's Tucker Carlson tonight\nAudio and video from Fox News and gravy and as Tucker asked a very reasonable question of Jorge Ramos of Univision\nEfforts to answer this question we can end and that's how many hands migrants knew personally take responsibility for how many are going to or his place in Miami at the end of the day when the specific\nYeah well I think that again these are nothing to do with individual nothing to do I wish I could have\nAll of them running right now right now seven thousand care about twenty five hundred kids is it possible for an individual to deal with a crisis like they have a presence on the immigration policy has been a company donated money personally but I I Hope that I Wish I could have been to\nDo that I Wish we could do something like that but I had the kids were in danger of being raped or being raised in a robbery or being a\nThreat than we are joined in a lot on or I Do I mean\nAgain I Would say probably not without him I noticed that why thank you so much\nShit isn't that a pathetic Hampshire I Wish I could help them\nI Wish I could help them all you know I Do a stupid thing and I know you're going to make fun of me for doing this I share this with you before I live in New York City and in midtown Manhattan Times Square area upper Upper West side all over the city by the Port Authority there are homeless people there are street people literally living on the sidewalks\nMany of them have a little signs I Do a stupid thing and I know people say to me don't enable them don't help them I keep a wad of singles in my wallet\nAnd to just about every single person who I come across I give them a dollar bill\nJust stupid little thing I'm blessed\nI figured maybe they'll go get a cup of coffee I Hope they don't use it to get drugs with which is I I Know it said he ought to please don't lecture me but it's just me it's just something that I feel I Need to do I I got to rules in life or in that area I give every homeless person I see a dollar\nAnd it certainly by you know how this all at one of these days one of them will stab me in the neck and it'll be all over and they all say she dummy we told her not to do it you know we told you not to do it my way of doing that for sure but but that's OK at least I'll do something that I feel\nI'm making a difference I'm a helping all homeless people [noise] but I'm helping some I'm helping some shoe rules\nI have I have that role and I have a rule about doing one\nRandom act of kindness a day I read that years ago and I just feel so good about being able whether it's bite a meal for a family in a diner and not letting them know who did it and stuff I just try to do one thing a day for somebody and I've tried to actually since my wife died ten years ago to do that every single day\nYeah let me let me answer because there was an analysis I was just reading from the Associated Press and it ran on Fox News\nHeadlines Democrats are remaining silent on the caravan of thousands of immigrants on the march from Central America and unwilling to get into any kind of a debate with President Trump the terms are just weeks away that the answer\nEither way on him to step up and they're waiting on him to step\nUp the the answer John is that the Democrats are saying a word of condemnation of the thousands and thousands of illegals they're heading towards the border the answer is they don't condemn that because it's it's if it's in ... they implicitly supported\nSide to me a Democrat and you know maybe the easiest things to answer your question with a question which Democrat\nIs expressing concern and fear and worry anxiety\nUm over the thousands of illegal short headed towards our border name one they want because they are in favor of open borders they've all set it in various ways and and sometimes you say something by your refusal to step up you're talking about stepping up John\nHow about a Democrat stepping up against the kind of violence we've seen directed towards Mitch McConnell in restaurants and the mob mentality of Boulder thrown through a\nHouse majority leader Kevin McCarthy his office in Bakersfield, California how about some condemnation none of what we've heard is getting Republicans faces go after them create a scene create a crowd that's that's your answer they are not\nUm uh expressing the will of the people in concerns and and and frustrations over this uh this angry banned the people heading our way eight hundred six five five might will your next doing well\nFor him to make it really thing that I haven't heard a lot about it and it's a little bit frustrating is where does it say\nIt in our constitution and our laws or whatever that we have to pay benefits to people who are here illegally [laughter] I mean well it's just it's almost like people assume that well when they get here it doesn't matter if they're here illegally and I were given benefits or why don't\nWe just you wait a minute what's wrong with you you mean you don't want to give in state tuition benefits to illegal you mean you don't want to get driver's licenses to illegal you mean you don't want to give free health care 'til illegals what are you a racist well\nWhat are you an honest to goodness you're right where where in the world does it say we should be given folks who come to this country illegally and tried to steal residency and that's literally what illegals or doing any kind of benefits whatsoever [noise] that's the kind of reasonable question that you don't hear too often from the Democrats thank you will

Honduras and in a merica\nAnd we have these job openings that American businesses simply write in\nAnd say I need for people to work in my hotel and the three people talk to my body shop I Need one person in my landscaping crew there right in with a bona fide job or\nWhen we set them up and they get they get screened and get bigger print it and they get checked that makes your background checks and so on and then the last thing is we matched the worker with the job I think we give them the temporary job\nSo that they come to America and is the best part\nPart of their earnings has a small tax on and the taxes used to pay for the wall street and that's that yeah\nThey did did I mean and you're and I love the way you laid it out on Skype there in your in your impressive set there at a Mac American job openings interviews match with the tax I mean you lay it out this way and that does all the time\nAnd and and when people say to me I'm so proud that I joined a Mac it's because you guys are show proactive if you're fifty or older it used to be there was only one game in town it was the AARP to Dan I daresay AARP doesn't have this kind of response\nThe thoughtful presentation the way you've laid it out that just isn't what they do\nRight and you know we're gonna do like we're going to take this broadcast we're going to send it to the White House\nAnd wouldn't that be nice if we turn this caravan into a a great job thing we have all these jobs that need to do no we need machine is we need welders where the hospitality that everybody needs needs workers and they we have people marching looking for a job so let's screen them match them up and do it legally\nDo ... do it the right way to do it legally Ryan do you guys let's remind everybody you have a presence in Washington DC right you guys are constantly advocating for the millions of seniors who belong to a Mac and and and the seniors in this country at this great country of ours that\nWe have lobbyists then next month or active in December the first week in December we're going to have the delegates throughout the country are you a deli and somebody who represents a congressional this\nOh yeah that's yeah them by now that our they legislated by an early December we're going to go to Washington how wrong lunch or is that some other ideas on how to save Social Security or the ... health care or health costs and things like that but there are less than they were getting a lot of traction\nWell I I'm I'm thrilled to hear from people almost daily who say thank you for telling me about a Mac ... thank you thank you for letting us know that there's there's something other than a A R P and I don't I never want to visit with you without would reminding our listeners why the AARP as a bad idea because frankly many people don't even know they are\nEssentially a giant liberal lobbying organization\nThat things are there for Medicaid and Medicare for all which would be a disaster that socialized medicine that'd be horrible where against that when we know how to fix things\nCome\nTo Christ our climate phone\nTake time to be a very very learned more at eight seven four four one one or a father about what are you by the U.S department\nAnd Human Services and he had counsel\nKaren suspicious packages mega millions winter term elections ... in the world series using talk you can trust [laughter] I Am a Seventy the actor\n[noise]\nNews at breakneck pace this is Mike ... show\nWe're not going to make America great again was never that\nWe've got a crucial midterm election coming up in November ...

New York which is a leafy suburb north of New York city\nUh they've lived there for a number of years or to the home of Iraq and Michelle Obama in Washington DC they have not lived there for a long time that's post presidency and of course this coming on the heels of a package of bomb package being sent\nReportedly to the home of George Soros who is the billionaire liberal activists\nI'm who funds a lot of anti conservative causes and ah and movements that this is a disturbing story um it is evil it's wrong and it it just has no political story a component to it it just doesn't\nUh and it shouldn't or not at least in the in the uh in the trajectory of saying oh is this something that takes people's attention away from the the caravan of illegals marching towards the United states and has no one has nothing to do with the other\nAnd I don't believe for one minute that somebody is sending bombs to prominent Democrats as a way to divert people's attention away from real issues\nNo one's going to not vote or vote because an evil\nPerson or persons is sending\nBombs to the homes of the Obamas the Clintons and the Soros says show but I but I you know it's a it's an important story
