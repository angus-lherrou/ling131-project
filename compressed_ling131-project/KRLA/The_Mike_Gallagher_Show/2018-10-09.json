thinking a lot about Roseanne Barr over the last couple of days\nBecause it says is for the first time there was a push back to the left ... demand that somebody had to be on a platter\nOver something but in this case wasn't corroborate first time there's this happened I mean normally careers are gone lives are destroyed people's sliver away into the darkness never to be heard from again this time Brett Kavanaugh fought back\nThis time Republicans were unified on the political front we witnessed a unification within the Republican Party that we haven't seen it a couple of years\nOr more and I was thinking about\nHow somebody can be destroyed over something like a tweet\nAnd you know at the end of the day maybe maybe\nThe push back on behalf of judge Kavanaugh and the Republicans deciding no we're not going to destroy this man over this one accusation\nI Know there were a couple but the the first one was the one that was deemed credible you noticed that you hear the Republicans who read the FBI report the word credible is used for Dr Ford she seem credible is what all of them said\nIt just wasn't corroborated so you couldn't ever ever\nTake him down over her testimony alone\n\nA couple of times I've seen some references to Roseanne Barr evidently that show that she created and return to is going to be back I don't think it's returned yet to the air isn't that next week or this week we're going to call it the Connors\nAnd they apparently killed off Roseanne all because of her tweet about Valerie Jarrett and it was make no mistake it was a terrible sweet\nBut it was a tweet one tweet and her lifetime of work was suddenly consumed by the fire of the rage machine PS she's a Trump supporter\n\nI saw over the weekend there was a a an NBC reporter I Believe a young NBC

your die\nAnd maybe after\nKavanaugh\nWas pulled over the finish line by a unified Republican Party in a fight or of a president air fighting spirit on his part\nMaybe just maybe mob rule\nWill be
