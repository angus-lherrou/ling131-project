and judge and defend judge Kavanaugh is Joe McCarthy resurrected Tammy in Illinois you're on the ... morning\nI really appreciate your taking the time ... will quit because I it ...\nThe that and they were just great I Love hearing what he had to say I've been watching it process at the beginning of his confirmation hearing court judge have and I don't believe a doctor for it I think in fact saying I don't believe her as [laughter]\nYou almost have to be brave to be able to stay that out loud but uh what I Want to ask you I was really not that familiar with senator who up until that process and I heard you\nKnow that he's a good guy and I think that's good guy and can you address that foreign\nSure I've got that question a lot because he's been on my MSNBC show when it was already been on the radio with me he is a good guy I Know when I talk with them I'd love to have dinner with them so we're talking about doing that I Am deeply deeply disappointed in that he did not rise to the defense of judge Kavanaugh's anger\nBecause he said that like I said I understand a dad who has been accused of horrific\nSex crimes or when the ten year old and a fourteen year old and friends and neighbors not able to respond pretend to because they delayed it and because apparently judge because apparently Dr Ford's lawyer's misleading or we're not sure that yet it appears as though they miss letter\nAppears as though they purposely delayed it it appears as a just monstrous orchestrated hit and everybody knows that\nEverybody knows it there and ... on the committee and he knows it\nAnd Jeff Flake went with him and they said let's okay I Will give you this will call for an FBI to make sure the judge is telling the truth and then Jeff Flake did not I mean they just\nDid not rise to the defense of the judge when our righteous man would be as angry it would be angrier than judge Kavanaugh was\nLet me ask you something that you watched by the way a Gigi when Dr Ford said she escaped to the second floor bathroom and then down the stairs in ... she did not apparently alert her best friend ... of the danger get her out of the house nor did she checked later to see if she was okay\nTwo teenage girls act like that\n[noise] I think I had a similar experience lane mighty they've been getting a little worse [noise] um\nThe majority of homes sell for a price that falls short of what sellers may have been led to believe fix one hundred percent of asking price guaranteed solve this dilemma when you\nCall ... mark Harry and help prepare a total market analysis of your home\nAnd

because you can't really ask her probing questions left he looked like a bully so one woman with not a single cooperative witness can have the ... the nation's attention the fortified by every democratic senator in us and not one Republican senator\nThey're all male that feels that the optics as they call it would be appropriate so they gave it all over the woman named Rachel Mitchell who is a sex crimes prosecutor fan have her ask because after all she's a female fans the reduction is among the left where truth is not the issue of gender is the issue\nFor your show we said nine and

your calls last week I get it\nI Know you're angry\nPlease allow me please allow me to to to give you a gentle reminder complaining about Jeff Flake is linear equivalent of complaining about the weather\nOh it's too hot well it's too cold man it's ... it rained too much today too humid\nIt doesn't matter he's leaving he's leaving he one of the shocking admissions from last night's conversation but he engaged in on sixty minutes\nIs that he would never have pulled what he pulled friday if he had been up for reelection I mean he he did say that he I don't know if you watch the sixty minutes interview it was painful\nEverything about Jeff Flake is painful but\nAnd but you have to at least acknowledging peddling that it's just cut number eight from sixty minutes\nI'm Senator Jeff flake who stunned the world with his painful change of heart over Brett Kavanaugh friday\nAfter he was yelled at by a couple of progressive activists in the elevator and I I'm not trying to minimize or deny that one or both of them were sexually assaulted I don't know\nI Know that they are both activists with a with George Soros funded\nOrganization that's a fact I mean you can look it up after names and I we can get into all that if you want so Jeff Flake gets yelled at in the elevator kept looking up and so that leaves you saw that video cameras painfully aware that it was all being recorded\nKnew immediately it was going to go viral because it was what they wanted\nAnd they got their wish they got him to change his mind and say okay well I voted out of committee but I'm not going to vote to confirm unless there is a one weekend visit investigation limited in scope and time that's already been shredded by the Democrats they were barely out of the room before they started calling\nThe limitations on scope and time\nA joke a sham a farce they started moving the goalposts before they got out of the room fried okay\nHere's Jeff Flake on sixty minutes last night admitted that if he had any accountability whatsoever to his own constituents in the state of Arizona He would never have done what he did on friday\nSenator Flake you've announced that you're not running for reelection and I wonder could have done this\nIf you were running no [laughter] no not a chat and not a chance\nBecause politics has become too sharp\nTo ... there was no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nThat's one way to put it another way to put it is I have no accountability anymore because I'm retiring from the Senate so my constituents don't matter doesn't really matter what they want from me back home on quitting\nThat's one way that's another way to look at it but again I jet Li remind you it really matters not\nWhat he did friday in terms of getting this done\nThere are lots of things you can do today to take some action I'm going to give you that information as the show unfolds but it's futile to rage against a man like Jeff Flake remember the bottom line and this sounds callous this sounds\nCruel this sounds heartless this sounds [noise] um wouldn't perhaps but it is a fact\nWe still need his vote we still need his vote he still has to vote to confirm so to to rip him\nFiguratively apart isn't really that productive you want to be productive colors office in civil e and respectfully demand but he vote to confirm judge Kavanaugh\nUm\nI don't know what the FBI ... seven FBI background check is going to unfold\nUncover I Know that the left and the Democrats are already dismissing what Jeff

assault victims\nHas corroboration and we just have to acknowledge that unfortunately ... and and and what the what people don't like what activists she don't like is that\nUnfortunately it sometimes boils down to he said she said no way around it if there is no cooperation if he said she said and then the senators are going to have to decide\nWho do they believe the senators might say there is no corrupt ration therefore I have to confront him loose senator's might say I believe her all the Democrats believer and they're going to say they vote against him\nIf there are fifty one vote split say there's not enough corroboration he was credible you know I I I'm also fascinated by the the pushback against judge Kavanaugh's emotional emotional um\nReaction to this Friday um it was so powerful\nAnd to those who say he's on hinged and he's emotional when he's not fit everybody knows that's just another talking point to try to prevent his his confirmation because\nThey're trying to

Gingrich writes a piece for Fox News dot com and asking is there even one Democrat who has the decency\nTo to to end it is just one\nHere's what Newt writes about the testimony and with Dr Ford said under oath\nHe writes Dr Ford has been manipulated by the Democrats who hit her letter making uncorroborated accusations against Kavanaugh for over a month director into the national limelight and urged to avoid meeting with the Senate Republican staff members at one Point New rights\nToward said she couldn't meet because she was afraid to fly\nAlthough it was revealed at Thursday's Judiciary Committee hearing that she has flown numerous times for vacation Ford was put through all of this even though she could not remembering what House the alleged gathering an assault on her took place or whether it occurred at the same time no one she said was present has core operator her story\nHer testimony was emotionally compelling it's clear that something happened to her\nNewt Gingrich rights but she knows as a professional psychologist uh thirty six years after an event people can vividly remember things that didn't actually happen if Kavanaugh he says can be defeated by this kind of manufactured in manipulated evidence free process than one reasonable conservative would ever put his or her name up\nFor some Senate confirmation Newt Gingrich asks the real question is this are there any Democrats you are disgusted by this process\nOf dishonest character assassination and manipulation or any upset that this is becoming their party's operating pattern are there any Democrat who sense of decency forces them to vote yes for a decent man and brilliant jurist whose entire public career\nHas exemplified honesty sincerity sincerity and patriotism are there any Democrats you understand\nThat a thirty six year old on supportive allegation cannot possibly be the standard for blocking a U.S Supreme Court nominee if no Democrat has the courage to vote for decency honesty and a sense of fairness you said\nThen we are truly in deep trouble as a country the focus for the next few days ought to be on the Democrats\nLet us see what kind of a party they have become the answer to Newt Gingrich's question I fear\nIs no there will not be one Democrat who will pull a Jeff Flake not one the Democrats are unified he tried to stop judge Kavanaugh by any means possible it

huge victory and as a Peter Navarro put it\nThe president has put together the best performance on the economy and trade of any president in modern history that's not high purple\nAnd it matters because it affects every single one of us it affects every one of our bank accounts it infects every one of our retirement or or for one case our paychecks\nHere's a Peter Navarro this is a cut number one again just two minutes of good news agency of bad news 'cause there's nothing really good about the capital shore nothing all we can do is hope and pray\nThat\nThe senators come to their senses the capital gets confirmed\nAnd it's crucial because this involves way more than just one man has a lot more to do\nThere's a lot more at stake than just Brett Kavanaugh will get into that and just a

Know Trump haters hate to hear that\nI Know it makes you crazy to hear that\nIt's a fact he keeps winning he's not pulling the Dow out of his here okay he's not making up the unemployment numbers which is not a tweet from the president at midnight\nWe use are facts and um [noise]\nIt's part of why they're threatened by um it's part of why the left is so desperately trying to stop Brett Kavanaugh they figured this will be a major defeat for the president it will be incidentally if Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed let's start with one of the big takeaways of the last few days which one of the biggest takeaways is\nWatching the stunning\nUm crowing by leftists and activists and progressives over the weekend on social media about how getting in people's faces screaming at them shrieking at them cornering people like Jeff Flake\nEffect change this is why we do it that's what they should Ana Marie Cox all these other folks got on social media this is why we get in your face is because
