Ninety three to when you got to have to Eighteen\nAnd it just so happens right now that are about two hundred are solid Democrat or a lean Democrat\nMaybe a little more than two hundred about two hundred are solidly Republican or lean Republican maybe a little less than two hundred and maybe two oh five one Ninety five so in the middle there are about thirty some that are toss ups\nThirty some

ideological they don't spend all day maybe listening to shows like this are watching Fox News or watching anything and they're they're just they just look at the country and they say you know what the

uh the tree of life sitting out in the shooting a condemning anti Semitism and an understanding that as an organization\nUm we do a lot to condemn the other boycott divested ... in the United states a lot of this anti Semitism on college campuses which is exactly what it is in the form of being anti Israel\nI and then ... and these distinctions that that these groups try to make which are just absurd um is getting something as organization we combat some of these individuals we should all combat\nAnd acknowledged it is an issue that's been a in the United states as it is in most of the world unfortunately I'm as just the beginning of time and ah today on the broadcast Russia focusing in on what Israel has been doing in response to\nAttacks on the Jewish state of Israel I think it's a unique time to point out there has been an escalation over the weekend in fact just this weekend\nIn Israel out of the Gaza Strip so targeted Israel thirty rockets were fired by ... based militants have this group is called Palestinian Islamic jihad or sometimes just referred to as Islamic jihad that Israel as a government holds some moss responsible\nFor Islamic jihad activities at ... am Austin Islamic jihad work together often but there are times when they are separate\nAnd so you'll see that Islamic jihad is also based in a Damascus is where a lot of their leaders are headquartered to get protection a so that they are not actually in harm's way directly I so I ... that their leadership there see a mosque leadership\nWill some brother ... leadership both groups emulating by the way from the Muslim Brotherhood out from a mosque but interesting enough even though it's coming out of the Sunni world\nGetting a lot of its funding from the sheer world in Iran so first let's talk about this weekend I'll go to Henry Hudson Harry this weekend we saw really the escalation ... just specifically between\nA Islamic jihad and Israel says comes out of the Gaza Strip but thirty rockets being fired at the state of Israel and Israel responding back with us specific attacks on eighty targets\nAbsolutely so this is an important ... an ominous development\nAh these attacks are coming from gossip suggest that Hamas is working with the Islamic jihad it's working with Syria and ultimately it's working with Iran which is the source of much of them is just\nA in the middle east so in response to provocation\nEssentially by Iran and its surrogates including the Islamic jihad Hezbollah militants are in Syria\nIsrael has conducted an aggressive military campaign across\nA Syria against Iran backed militia groups and in Gaza which is highly necessary Israel cannot allow a these militants to build up an arsenal a as a basis of continued attacks on Israel\nAnd it could lead ultimately to another outbreak of a small or perhaps a large war\nYeah I mean you're talking about a ... again organizations that it made out of again the God primarily here you've got the Gaza Strip though the Islamic jihad group unlike Hamas operates pretty heavily in the west bank as well so that is why they are or do a mosque because they are the governing power\nIn Gaza Strip so if these are rockets are large Israel holds for mosh responsible for not preventing the rockets from being launched by these other groups\nAnd sometimes working in tandem so I Know that the again it's the middle east things get complicated but I understand Islamic jihad group also operates in the west bank are controlled by the PLO or the Palestinian authority and so the date but what is unique to uh to what kind of ties them all together\nIs the funding that they receive from Iran and specifically Iran's revolutionary guard forces where those funds flow through they flow through Damascus now even at a time when you would imagine that Syria\nIs extremely unstable that has been one of the headquarters\nFor these Islamic a Palestinian Islamic terror groups SOS we're seeing an increase not just between the attacks in the Gaza Strip\nAnd Israel but specifically over just the past Eighteen months uh the really an escalation what Israel is doing in Syria and and targeting the Iranian forces there have been one of their primary goals is to prevent Iran from ... haven't got to have an occupying force inside Syria\nYeah exactly I over the last Eighteen months uh Israel has lost they think about two hundred airstrikes in Syria or in what really Israel is trying to do they're trying to to head off\nWhat would be a major major war in the middle east and they're doing that or do these air attacks first of all they're trying to stop Iran from having a permanent military base near the Israeli border they're trying to to head off to a major war because they realize\nThat if Iran had a permanent presence there and they vowed to destroy Israel or if they hit the good increase weaponry to Hezbollah in Lebanon that again could lead to a major war\nAnd uh they're trying to block weapon shipments coming to Lebanon ah there are a lot of ground convoys going through Iraq across Syria into Lebanon to arm Hezbollah and also to to arm Iranian backed militias so he was trying to stop that but the frightening thing you're talking about the the missiles being fired from from the Gaza Strip\nOr just last week Israeli intelligence or released a report that once again\nAround is using civilian airliners to ship weapons in weapons components the missiles that have been fired from Gaza and Israel and from Lebanon in Israel\nThey have nothing guided missiles there sort of blob into the territory hoping that they will hit something however last week\nIt was revealed that some of the civilian planes are now delivering sophisticated guidance systems to Hezbollah so they can take these guidance systems install it in the missiles so that they can actually pinpoint specific targets in Israel that is a major game changer in this conflict\nIran is really a behaving in a dangerous in reckless fashion\nAnd uh the terror groups in that you and here he talked about they could not do what they do without the financial support of Iran and also the weapons that are supplied to these groups by or on\nA Iran they tried to use their proxy so they can have plausible deniability ... but their goal is the destruction of the nation of Israel\nYeah and they receive guy to shows like they just gave all these resources if it's if you do what you want their kids\nComing with that that's kind of the parents so that Iran is able to control these groups whether it's Hezbollah or you're talking about a group like Islamic jihad or even a boss I they want to be able to control them and their actions so they do this at the ... you talked about the weapons as incentives\nBut understand Iran's role of this I think just to underscore what ... talking about using the civilian aircraft\nA as a military a way of a delivery military goods to recognize terror organizations take a listen to the general Jack Keane as well he was just discussing how this has been uncovered and\nThis is something newly uncovered that Iran has started to do what's happening\nIs Iran is very aggressive because Syria means so much to them so they fly on charted airplanes or their military aircraft in in the ... uh missiles ammunition commodities they also use commercial airlines to do the very same thing and then they're driving\nThrough Iraq into eastern Syria and bringing also ammunition as supplies to that\nThat goes from Iran through Iraq through Syria all the way to Lebanon injured the border of Israel and it's really a malignancy in the region Jordan\nAnd that's why Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states Jordan Egypt quietly support Israel because they do not want this cancer to spread in the area and it is a true malignancy their Israel is trying to to to toward what would be a major war by these attacks trying to stop Iranian influence\nListen to this I mean this tells you a lot and Mohammed is Aaron ... is the Iranian foreign minister he was on CBS\nFace the nation just yesterday I remind you that even the day before our mid term elections there the the increase sanctions on Iran kick back in ... Iran is is you will see this kind of PR move internationally by Iran a now but listen to their foreign minister or just yesterday\nOn an American a Sunday news program CBS face the nation tasteless\nPricing blankets important that the U.S provides was how they view than to Israel has enabled them to caddy atrocities that will do\nThem all to exist this package\nAnd Harry I'll go right to you there that is the Iranian foreign minister tying\nThese two groups that are two countries together as the U.S works with it in different and unique ways but trying to tie publicly what is it not putting knowledge by Saudi Arabia publicly but that they are somehow a that working together against Iraq that's why he's trying to go after them obviously\nYou're absolutely correct essentially what the Iranian foreign minister is trying to do he is trying to deflect attention away from the Iranian\nMalignant to be a reunion atrocities in the middle east by blaming the cross cities that are on going in the middle east and Saudi Arabia\nAnd Israel also essentially it's outrageous oh Ron is the number one state sponsor of terror in the world period\nAnd it's clear beyond question that Iran has a plan in mind they are attempting to master mind control of the middle east in Syria and Lebanon\nAnd in Gaza as a launch pad for future wars for control of the middle east or extending to Yemen and essentially to the Saudi Arabian peninsula\nThe lot of people also started asking on Facebook and we've got a call about it as well we'll get to our second half hour of the Russian role in this

of the broadcast let us just hang out with once again and condemned the attack that occurred in Pittsburgh on Saturday\nAh you've said Jewish community there at the tree of life synagogue was eleven innocent people killed six or injured some critical including law enforcement officials who bravely responded to a a lone gunman who was fueled by anti Semitism something we must always condemn\nAnd um we work on it the American civil law and justice our work gives the boycott the vestments sanctions moving in the United states in on college campuses as well and this idea ideological anti Semitism uh but that doubts you could see how that again that ideal ideology can beat a turn\nUnfortunately into this horrendous a to fuel this kind of horrendous attack\nSo we condemn that are in condemned fight anti Semitism wherever we see it but also I again must be praying for those who have who have\nBeen innocently are those people who were killed uh uh who were there to uh at their house of worship for various reasons that day um and so I get a thoughts and prayers with that a community and as we focus in on what is happening around the world but there's\nA we've seen you know whether that was the the Bobby incidents that occur to you know explosives\nPlease do was injured that person gets apprehended in Florida who was responsible for that there's been a lot going on in our own country that is taken away a rightfully so to some extent obviously you've got to focus on what's happened to your country\nBut to understand what's also happening around the world because we had a ship back into politics as well mid term elections but all of this affects us as Americans so what is happening inside Israel what is happening in the middle east very important has it got as much attention\nIn the last few weeks I think it deserves so today because this increased by Israel and their response to a radical groups are operating out of the Gaza Strip many who are headquartered in Syria and also it increased their their Israeli actions\nInside Syria big backed by the White House be backed by the Trump Administration wanted to go to the phones about this as well because there's another factor this\nWe have a yet address on air or we should just during the break because we got comments coming in from Jason on Facebook and also call coming in from Phil in New York I'd like to feel welcome to Jay sexual alive if\nYou're on the air much for taking my call it means to me and my question my question is is close to Ninety percent they cushion they well they say it's a theocracy and\nYeah so what I Would say you've got to kind of divorce the people oftentimes from the government especially in\nOr we see this off the ties in countries like Russia or where the foreign policy of the government often Dodgers don't match up to the views of the people so that that that the idea here again\nIt's not so much Russia's be anti Israel west it's rush or the Russian government aid for because they work with the Israeli government when it's in their interest is the Russian government\nAre working for their own interest there they like China I Would see more and all these countries\nUm they they are not ideologically tied to a anymore this idea of spreading around this view of communism or they don't have that anymore so it's all about their own interest or fear that they don't have the other ties of a like A Rod's got the ideological tired to to why they want to support these groups it Russia's doing it for themselves absolutely\n... their opportunistic you know they're looking for what will what will you forward their own national interest in Russia what they're looking for in Syria to the ... to the caller's point first of all\nThe while the people of Russia or Ninety percent orthodox Christians the government is not a Christian government but in addition to that Russia they want to have a warm water port permanently in Syria on the Mediterranean so that's part of their strategic interest\nBut also Russia is supplying Syria they're trying to prop up the Assad government with anti aircraft missiles [noise]\nIt's so volatile part of the world and maybe we can talk about that in a moment but it's a tinderbox [noise]\nAh it's it's it's hard to predict exactly what will happen there\nYeah I mean she got a lot of different layers
