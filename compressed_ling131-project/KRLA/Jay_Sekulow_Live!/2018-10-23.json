United nations I joined decide this during the break through the two that are always the most anticipated at least for the media or the presidents and the prime minister of Israel\nThat's usually it for me to hear the United states that's where the focus goes up because you will see a lot of controversy surrounding the prime minister of Israel from march in the crowd\nThat the United Nations General assembly inside the building and then of course we want to see our president\nKind of lay out the foreign policy issues that are the most important but also what we're doing is seeing our presidents speak to the world this is a unique time when it's not the president just addressing the nation he does that he addresses our nation regularly but this was an address to the world and world leaders that's his audience there\nAnd of course there are there are things for everybody to pay attention to her Americans\nTo understand the thought process going behind a our foreign policy but\nThis is really a statement to the world on where America's going into the Eighteen twenty Nineteen\nAnd where are they focused and we're seeing a lot of focus on Iran\nWe're seeing a again I'm the focus on the middle east of the reasons the world that is again still the most uh turmoil I'm ... and then obviously a lot of economics or we haven't gotten into that there's a lot of economic focus in this speech as well and the idea of the America First idea\nBut also saying you should be doing this in your own country to yeah should be looking up your own people's interest stop just joining these global institution\nLetting them decide for you your trade deal\nHarry what would you say that you took the biggest takeaway from the speech will\nAmong other things uh one of the biggest takeaway that I took his the rejection by President Trump of the advice and the approach taken by global\nGlobalization are quite willing to prop up horrendous regimes for instance like the Iranian regime the number one state sponsor of terror and so the question then becomes how does that approach advance human rights\nCoon by ya he's not a solution maximum pressure in principle realism is a solution\nSo the president offered a clear message to global elites who are often willing to trade human lives in pursuit of the illusion that all of the world's leaders are actually\nInterested in peace rather than expanding terror and so one of the messages that was clear\nAh to the world and to\nGlobal leaders was we are rejecting\nPast approaches that have failed with respect to Iran with respect to Syria and with respect to any ... regime that ... it's um people's hopes and dreams instead of advancing a true peace schooling for\nAmerica is governed by Americans that's where the

protecting here our sovereignty and our ability to determine our own fate it was very strong and very much in distinction the previous administration\nWill and quite frankly gay that approach is necessary if you want to restore American leadership around the world I mean the president I thought uh you know he'd back that up by saying if their program is not helpful not only to the world to American interests like unreal like the human rights council we are not going to go along with it just because decades or tradition said that we have to you\nAt the same time gay he issued the red lines for Syria we've heard red lines before but I think the rest of the world knows that this president\nUh now means in won't dare crossed it so again American leadership in the world Jay if you can be resolved to restore that but unless you're committed to back it up with words it won't go very far this president will back it up and I think the world knows\nWe're taking your phone calls at one
