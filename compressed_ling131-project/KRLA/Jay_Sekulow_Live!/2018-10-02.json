{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "Initially President Trump talked about terrorists in order for uh for national security member that never mind that we produce most of our studio here and the two other major suppliers Canada and Mexico are friendly countries so the national security stuff with the U.S and you know if he's not saying that\nNow if the goal is to reduce tariffs with our trading partners I'm all for in the short run doing something to make them stand down\nThe question is is this going to benefit the American consumer and extra early to tell that\nThe New York times called it a victory for the president and it is they did as well and it is because the campaign to reevaluate their to renegotiate NAFTA the question is is it going to be positive for the American consumers for example [noise]\nNew York times points out there for the first time the new agreement mandates that an increasing percentage of parts for any tariff free vehicle must come from so called high wage factory\nAgreement says they'll sacrifice pay a minimum sixteen dollars an hour in average salaries for production workers that's about triple the average wage in Mexico right now and the assumption is that division will force automakers to ship supplies from Mexico or Canada in this country\n[noise] but there is to that automotive Alice had warned that the British and could have a damaging effect for Americans by raising costs were American car buyers and incentivizing automakers to move production to low cost countries outside of the country like China\nSo we don't we don't know yet and I want to find out more about it before I determine whether or not the president has done the right thing with NAFTA and know what's popular\nAmong the base especially and now that the Bernie Sanders has become a anti free trade and um the Republican Party also anti free trade are both parties now have pretty much the same position on trade\nOne more time this is about consumers and tariffs\nIf they're designed to protect industries that are that are failing all they do is prevent the business people from doing the kinds of things that need to do in order to make those businesses competitive and if the idea is to retaliate against or the or the country for so called dumping products on us dumping simply means of other companies are are being subsidized by their government\nThey're not making money but they are being subsidized by government and and if that stupid why should we would retaliate by doing something equally stupid I still feel exactly the same if however the\nCanned it is to cause our trading partners to reduce their terrorists in our goods\nOpening up their markets for our manufacturers inspires that's good but if ... if result in higher prices to the American consumer explained to me how that's a good idea\nSo it's too early to a a do a victory lap as far as I'm concerned I Want to find out more about it anyway thank you very much for uh for the call appreciate it triple eight nine ten one S.

I Want to get into the specifics of what that allegation are but everybody saw him last week the allegation at the university uh event party if those allegations prove to be true which is no evidence of and other than the one witness I mean that's one that's if that ends up being cooperated\nSubject to review instill and is credible whether you think that does to the nomination\nWell I think the nomination is in deep trouble and I think at this point in time it's very possible to speculate\nThat that allegation a remains a the most serious hurdles to his confirmation\nUh it's important to realize that we're back on Mitchell the prosecutor who ask questions at the hearing suggested that no reasonable prosecutor\nWould bring a case against judge Kavanaugh based on the testimony of the two witnesses last week so I think if there is some ... cooperation with respect to the second allegation a bat could pose a a real hurdle for judge\nHave enough that if in fact there's cooperation absolutely huge question\nYou know and I think one of the most interesting things about Mitchell's report to the Republican Senate and she sent all the Republican senators and she said that this is a matter of he said she said but\nThis case is even weaker than that in her report that's a very telling statement about how she views of the witnesses that have come forward\nBut here when you've got that the Democrats are looking to stop this nomination let's be clear none of these ... none of the Democrats maybe but on the committee ... especially when you're talking about individual Democrats than a minute and on the Senate but nobody on this committee was going to be voting for cabinet before this happened absolutely not\nThey'd already announced their opposition to him so uh and it's they were going to vote no on the committee that we're going to vote no on the floor of the U.S Senate or there's a handful of Democrats left I think ... basically it's Joe mansion\nHeidi Heitkamp I mean I I'm not even sure who else pass that I mean because you had Joe Donnelly come out and say no no I don't know if the FBI change\nIt's possible that this FBI investigation has changed the mind to reopen of a few of those uh a moderate Democrats or read the I ... I saw a red state Democrats are not so moderate like Doug Jones in Alabama is does this change his mind if the FBI comes back\nAfter the potential to vote or we will see\nBut so far I think it comes down to Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins maybe Joe mansion thing is I I don't think you get Susan Collins without Lisa Murkowski and vice versa I Can't imagine\nOne of the voting yes one voting no so yes Joe ... could be important to get a kind of over the line with a Democrat and I'd have to have my you see any democratic support right now do you think Joe mentioned doing it only if this report comes back\nIt's crucial clean and that would be a ... and because of internal pressure\nAnd he would do it only if Murkowski and talents were there so it was already over the line so he's not doing anything to get the nominee there I don't think he would be the vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh let me say if if it came out to him no but he's not going to make the calculation that way\nAnd he had his grew with Jordan I don't think you mentioned is going to be the one that pulls the trigger for Kavanaugh I think if he sees that the Republican senators Murkowski and Collins or going for him then you'll throw his hat in that direction\nLet's go ahead and take a phone call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten if you want to talk to us on air yeah let's go to Phil in New York are you talking about a little bit but we can talk about sort of fill in New York on line one feel welcome to Jay secular life I felt\nLike it very much appreciate it you're very much anticipated my question my question was going to be I think there's any chance whatsoever that even one democratic votes for confirmation\nI think what they did what we just said is right I mean if if ... if he was the deciding vote probably not if it had already fifty one votes there may because it helps them in the Senate seat how close is that said at the end Virginia West Virginia right now I Know it was\nI think he's looking to rock the boat there I think he's got an okay lead an okay lead a similar but let me take so you probably get your vote against a reward nominees for President Trump and um [noise] those Trump voters combat highly camp same thing you think or say but I think not maybe not a\nIt's a I think now they could all rely on this report but they will not be the votes to get him across a lot so it's not like Heidi Heitkamp in Joe mastering uh come saving this if Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski vote no\nYeah again I going to be the ... the the fiftieth and fifty first vote 'em or even the the forty to fifty votes so that a vice president Pence could be the fifty first vote\nI'm Joe Main she's got a nine percent lead right now he says it so you're not going to do with Iraq that you don't want to get into five percent\nSo because it becomes a whole different issue for the national parties when you start dropping lower than that he's right on the line of it should be a pretty easy race unless you awake in some Trump\nBase there they get so upset with you I don't know but if something comes back about him\nWhich is why the Joe Manchin is looking at I don't think that it that way can face I think that the nomination gets both right now matches up by nine percent but ... yeah I'll tell you something that could swing down to five percent pretty quickly I got a real race All right let's take another phone call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one time Mary Ellen in Illinois on life for Mary Ellen welcome to Jason ...\nEveryone yeah I have a question about this thing on we've evolved and saying this many people that the FBI has carrot sticks and say why are we wasting time going through this again let that get like\nWell I ... the first of all this and you understand something they don't have the authority to investigate it as a crime but any they do have an authority to investigate it as a background check\nThat dances is that's exactly what it is this is not a federal crime this is a state crime in other words it as a state based if in fact he is a has committed in the fans then it's under the laws of the state in which he committed these offenses allegedly\nBut this is being done not as an investigation of a federal crime which it is not and cannot be but as a background investigation of a nominee to the Supreme Court and that's how he the FBI gets there a presence into this case\n[noise] now that that what's that means if this is not a criminal investigation no so this is not a situation where a file as an open at a U.S attorney's office and the case moved to determine whether he qualifies for background to be on the court\nAnd I think what's happening right now you've got allegations you've got to that they're considering they're not reviewing the one raised by my carbon out his client\nThe reviewing the two now you've got Dianne Feinstein saying the White House and the FBI should release details on the scope of the cabinet background investigation keep Congress and foreign run any changes this needs to be a real investigation must get all the facts the president's just end the president said wow\nJust starting to hear Democrats who are only thinking obstructing delaying are starting to put out the word that the time and scope of the FBI looking to judge Kavanaugh witnesses is not enough\nHow low for them it will never be enough stay tuned and watch what's your ... the way\nI Would just say that she said to how how do you think that if I'd seen him in and her own are going to react when I I think it's likely that in the Dr Ford\nMatter they're going to come back and say they got nothing right so the prosecutor who asked because last week is right everyone's right it is a he said she said she said has is full of holes\nIncluding the fact that she never named him in to anybody until now I'm even when she brought this up years ago um uh the for the first time in twenty twelve did not name the per se um that doesn't know how they got there doesn't know where it was has no idea has afraid saying no it didn't happen so\nUm I think they are never going to be convinced\nThey never were going to be convinced they were always a no vote on Brett Kavanaugh they're doing everything they can to buy time to find more dirt to throw more dirty I what I expect is not so much what comes to this investigation even um because of this for themselves the FBI is what else is going to come out these next let's just Monday\nIf it delays it I mean that's what I'm saying they will take anything to delay this because they lay it through making a political issue of the midterms\nAre they think that that's a benefit to them they're making that calculation that this is a political benefit for Democrats to continue this process on I I think that if the FBI's heads to an extent that does that but do not expect whatever they find even if it's positive for Brett Kavanaugh to influence a single Democrat but\nWe also process wise if that's what it is his ... nomination goes is that the Florida Senate now yeah so the for the ... FBI report could come out you've got but you've got to have at least the vote could be\n\nYeah so there's yeah I mean this is we're it's impressive territory so during the break but for everybody who's on the air right now I mean it it would finish our first half hour this is this is not like there's some rule book for this exactly is the president just said in a press conference literally while we're on the air or you know they're they're handling this wow this is what the city is requesting\nUh and then the White House has ordered and so it's it's not what Dianne Feinstein is requesting that what's what\nRepublican leaders they leave the Senate\nIt's what they requested yeah we've got a lot more head we're going to be here for thirty minutes if you don't get the full hour the broadcasters go over to Facebook periscope or a C.

Ramirez that's the Yale University allegation I'm not going to get into the\nTawdry details of that investigation but that's the two they're looking at they will either find cooperating evidence for those witnesses lost a cooperating their stories or they will not if they do not they're not going to say either one of these are lying you know what they're going to say where we have not been able to cooperate that testimony\nDust Brett Kavanaugh also in that case would not have been there's nothing to prove that he was making a misstatement or a false statement for the um Senate Judiciary committee and it would be drawn to be a vote on the floor of the Senate this week\nThe FBI could be done as early as to date with that examination with that inspection or investigation but I think it's important for the economy or former U.S attorney or the set out what this investigation is and is not the investigation\nIs ... is in tended to to make granular fine details from these\nPeople who are making these allegations with respect to uh to judge Kavanaugh it to ask me I investigations three oh two sets the name of the form number do not reach conclusions they don't say and therefore we believe that\nOr we recommend that that's not what it does it simply sets out facts\nAs they find as the agent and they're usually two agents by the way who interview these witnesses not just one but two agents who go in an interview these witnesses and come up with a three oh two that they then give to their supervisor is reviewed and then it is set up the channels and eventually will reach the White House\nBut that's what they're supposed to do and I hope these field agents who are doing this do the right job and and our faithful to their task of finding facts as they are and don't do the things that FBI agents in the past on this program we've talked\nAbout doing All right let's go right to the phones Jennifer calling from California on line one Jennifer welcome to Jay Sekulow lot Jennifer go ahead you're on the air\nIf you're on the process by which I think it's going on but I had it any further allegation there's other further than that I haven't\n[noise] that's right so he's already cleared committee so that was part of the deal they will continue the investigation but he cleared committee so he's out of committee it's the floor of the Senate\nThe question will be if there is no cooperating evidence of the allegations I think he goes to the floor and I think he's confirmed if there's cooperating evidence of the others I think then and that that's a credible credible cooperative evidence\nThen I think it raises a different issue wouldn't go back to the committee or still on the floor of the Senate yeah that's right I mean there's always the committee really work is done although report and probably go to the committee\nMitch McConnell could I mean this is a heated Vancouver back but I I think if you're at that point the nomination is pulled 'em that sign up to the Senate now they can inform the White House White House would make that decision ultimately\nUm ah we we've got to a while we'll take this we come back a cause that about you know how the votes will work will explain all that we come back\nFrom the break if you talk to us on the air to one hundred sixty eight four thirty one ten or twenty a hundred and sixty four three one zero but this this will drag out at least through the week yeah I think we're going to be covering this most of the week I mean it'll be on the other news will cover it all the report may get ... you know if\nThey had the report finish ... there's a chance it's released to the committees and to the Senate and it's a relief to the public and if there's no cooperating evidence I think he goes forward on a boat now with all due to vote Thursday or friday or Wednesday at the Senate will decide what to look that\n... that investigation is winding down Clarence Thomas who took getting two or three days we're kind of in the same point here I'm going to go quickly around here to get everybody's ten second assessment passing cooperation\nOf these witnesses he's confirmed\nVarious types of yes\nOr no I think is a very good chance of confirmation if if there's nothing and the FBI robbery anything you know cooperation I think changes as well I think it'd be ... operating evidence I think Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed as a justice of the some ... associate justice to the Supreme Court or the United states\nThe investigation's ongoing so we'll see what happens when we come back we'll take your
