the answer\nOn Facebook rice said if the Republicans can't keep the house for\nDo main control in the Senate would you consider that a win for the G O P listed a few weeks ago maybe\nBecause it was look he likes to sit it could be in jeopardy which were twenty six days out something could change that's why we're going to keep doing these shows an update you are not every day but we will update you as we get closer and closer 'cause things do change uh that have an impact a few weeks ago it was like to sit it could be in jeopardy for Republicans right\nNow it looks like the Senate um a is a is not that it is a pretty firmly in control of Republican series of factors talk of adding more Republican seats I mean David it's fifty one forty nine so any kind of positive ads would be good now it's still very tight\nBarges ... six days out so take nothing for granted a because so much connected so quickly in politics that being said because\nIt looks like the ... is is we're relatively safe for now twenty six days out\nFor Republicans up that it really the victory would be I think than can they could maintain control the house even if it's the slippers to march is I don't think I think keeping control of the sit at a or should not be so overly celebrated a\n... it's ... it'd be great it's obviously important I think for conservatives are especially with nominations and things like that but it's really the house here at least twenty six days out\nYeah the Democrats chance in the Senate Jordan or a really long shot him and you're going to have to pull off an upset in you know either Tennessee our taxes and then his sweep all of the contested races\nThe Democrats are defending I mean if you just look at the wrong numbers of the three five seats up in the Senate Jordan twenty six of them are held by Democrats in ten of them are in states that Donald Trump won so that's a very unfavorable math then I think the Republicans are going to control the Senate and I agree with you I think they're going to expand their majority there\nIn the house Jordan um I think all the pressure honestly is on the Democrats day they assumed they were gonna flip control of the house\nA historical data says that you would their bases animated because they don't like the president and by and large although I Would tell you in specific districts that is very much not true in seats that they need to win so I think they might be over selling\nA their advantage in that regard but look the pressures on them because if if House Republicans can maintain eat any one seat majority\nThat's not just a victory that is a huge a monumental victory for them and honestly the Democrat Party or the demoralization they would take place in that scenario Jordan it's almost hard to describe\nThe here to me is what is most shocking is the vitriol going into this from our former\nCabinet members of the Obama administration and attorney general member that such as the OJ were told not supposed to be partisan a everybody should be able to be treated fairly and it's not really under even though it's part of the executive branch were told that really supposed to be independent of president shouldn't order the attorney general around\nTake a listen to Eric Holder on the campaign trail in Georgia\nListen to the words he uses the former U.S attorney general who is supposed to be the ... was the top law enforcement official for the whole country not just for Democrats but he weaponize that do the OJ ... and that kind of language he uses once again take a listen hey have\nUse of power that they have gotten [noise]\nFor all the wrong things they want to keep themselves in how they want to cater to special interests is time for us and Democrats\nDedicated his army is emitted as they are\nMichele always says I Love my wife like really tight with ...\nIt was selling says you know when they go low\n[laughter]\nThey go low we [noise]\n\nThat again folks where we've seen violence out of the campaign rallies you've seen the anti ... we've seen a again a Trump supporter of being attacked or you know they don't see this kind of violent language is good for either side but from the nation's\nTop law enforcement official couple of things in that state but one he criticizes the other side you know conservatives Republicans I'm for a warning power for all the wrong things and the first thing he says they want to keep themselves to power\nSo if you really think about that if you believe in the policies that you want to implement of course you need to remain in power\nBecause you can't implement the policies you believe in if you don't remain in power so this idea that they want to stay in power is somehow a bad thing\n... that's a good thing if you are trying to implement your policies you have to stay in power if you lose you will not be able to implement your policy second kicking people uh again this idea that uh we're going to would they go low Republicans are that we are going to kick them\nI Know he's not probably say actually kick them out if she's saying it verbally so don't you know but again people here that\nDifferently than Eric Holder tended it especially coming from a top law enforcement official but saying to me it sets the tone and I'd love to hear from our callers is well this idea that the attorneys for return Joe the states is telling a tally Democrat activists to kick\nThose are Republican activists or would they go low whatever that means and how they define that up and say that is tough tough rhetoric coming from our nation's a former top law enforcement official\n... it's tough and I would argue inappropriate Jordan given the political climate that we're in right now where threats of violence an actual violence have been taking place look I mean I'm Glad you made this distinction because our founder set up the way of government Jordan that was intended to have tension and you wanted to have tension you needed to have power\nThe idea was that the best strongest ideas would prevail but what you see in that quote\nAnd I think one that you might be playing up it had to many here is not I'm looking for ideas to prevail it's looking for the preservation of political power at any cost and\nUsing any form I Would say including forced to keep it Jordan that is not what our founders intended there should be tension\nBut it should be tension over ideas ways for a stronger government waste to advance the the American people and then at the end of the day coming together around those ideas Jordan a that sounds from Eric Holder or it perpetuates um what I think is a dangerous atmosphere we hadn't society right now and and quite frankly he should be ashamed for it\nAnd then it gets even more unique from Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton of course can't stop or getting a getting involved in politics take a listen to what she has said she former secretary of state former first lady who lost the presidential election to Donald Trump take a listen\nYour camera ... political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nHouse formed a word\nThat Clinton ... started down\nSo you can only be civil with people you disagree with if you get power back ah\nIn either the house the Senate Hillary Clinton uh you can't be civil with on policy disagreements\nBecause the way you describe policy disagreements are destroying what you stand for and care about 'em that's not very civil so the only way to get back to civility is to have the Democrats take the house or Senate because they're really civil river Brett Kavanaugh's hearing\nReally civil people on that other side of the aisle let me tell you I mean let's let's let's just stop there this is politics it is tough but the language coming out as we can only be civil\nIf we get some power back is what Hillary Clinton said kick them is what Eric Holder said let's go to your phones one eight hundred six eight four thirty one tenth and then I Want to contrast\nIs in fact let's contrast and now President Trump uses a lot of tough language on the campaign trail he does\nAnd he's known forty tweets tough tough language as well he's passionate and and he speaks the way that is unique ah for any American president\nBut listen to him last night this is at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania\nUh and and we talked about why he was there there are a number of a house seats there that are are either leading them like Pennsylvania Seventy feet or or a Pennsylvania six Pennsylvania five out of open seats a toss up in Pennsylvania seven then Pennsylvania ward Pennsylvania so I mean it in Pennsylvania sixteen\nSo a lottery is for him to be an eerie Pennsylvania last they take a listen to his right or\nA family and what kind of country you want to leave for your children\nAbout ... ... ... ... am\nUh he also announced a that he would have voted yes on Brett Kavanaugh now easy for him to say that when he's not actually in the Senate ah he he is a Democrat um he tries to play very much to the middle\nNow the latest poll that just came out from CBS or between just a a this was October second to October fifth\nHas black burn up eight so I was a ... a big swing but the other polls have showed at a much much closer to some of the earlier post so it's really within the margin of error I'd still I treat that as a margin of error\nRace than uh the end and and even in North Dakota treated very seriously because um if you could hold on to Tennessee and flip North Dakota that's a big went\nWell and I would say just one thing on each of those races Jordan first of all in North Dakota part of the reasons the races ... runs so rapidly towards Kevin Cramer is because of how few votes are cast there I mean you're talking about only three hundred thousand votes\nA state wide in that race or a league can open quickly it can also close quickly Jay or Jordan so you know the ... the advice he would spend in that state can move a lot of votes\nIn Tennessee I I really think Phil Bredesen got hurt very badly this week because while he did say that he would vote for cabinet if you were in the Senate he\nAlso got caught us some of his staff on under camera undercover video a door and saying that that was a not actual true that that was just a political statement and then if you were actually casting a vote he would oppose Brett Kavanaugh so look I think he did make a politically motivated statement on Brett Kavanaugh\nI think that video coming out really hurts him I think Marsha Blackburn was probably the political favors certainly going in any way I think feel Britain is in a while he's run a good race joined I don't think he had a lot of margin for error and this was a pretty big air coming down the stretch\nAnd of course we're not getting into all the gubernatorial races out there Tennessee does have one of those where the Republican is far ahead in the polls for the Democrat so there's a there's that also\nGoing that affects things certainly I mean all this\nAll these different if you got a governor on top if you've got set it on top if you've got lots of\nA contested races in the house level driving different kinds of her now\nDepending on where you live we're going to take your phone call second half hour basically if you take the second half hour on politics don't always do this on this broadcast but today is that they were focusing one hundred percent on politics so give us a call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one time we open a couple of lines up\nAs we go through these important racist can the Republicans maintain control not just that the U.S Senate\nBut even the house of representatives tough\nWe believe possible twenty six days out\nI'll tell you why one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten will\nStuck in traffic we start dying person for all five north

...\nI mean you might be shocked by hearing that right now because you've heard so often that I Know the Democrats are definitely going to take control the house\nRepublicans are right now twenty six days out that could change Eighteen days out you may hear something different for me but that's why we do the show staggered as we lead up to the election day uh but as for twenty six days out it looks like Republicans were really just seeing\nHow many ... extra seats they could add to their majority in the ... some of that is just based on how many Democrats are up for reelection out of the thirty five races a it is a twenty six\nAre Democrats so that's a lot of seats just to to to focus on and then you've got to work on the addict I'm so that makes it just tougher mathematically and also the states hit of those states are in states that are a Donald Trump\nWon so it makes it even that much tougher which is why I you've got a a leading a GOP leads GOP at a democratic commit like Heidi Heitkamp\nUm ads or you've got a toss up Democrat races in Florida\nIndiana Missouri Montana Nevada ah and the only true toss ups on that list uh offer Republicans are Arizona\nAnd a and the bad and Tennessee and I think to the sea they're starting to see this move kind of a a better polling we'll we'll try to see if Marsha Blackburn gets kind of a to point range or not a ... latest polls show that\nBut again that's a big difference when you've got that many ... it'd be so we'll go through all of it for you right now uh let me play for you to get fifty get re sets the stage\nDo what we're going to be facing from the other side's kind of leaders former leaders here's\nEric Holder he's at Georgia campaigning when he makes this comment take a listen he used to be the former top law
