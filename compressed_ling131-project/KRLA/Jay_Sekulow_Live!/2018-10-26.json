A. C. O. J.\nThat diplomatic negotiations are in essential in resolving this crisis we have suggested that such efforts should be aimed at stemming the flow of migrants slowing them down and finally stopping them before they reach us ports of entry\nAnd so late yesterday CNN reported on negotiations between the United states and Mexico on how to handle the migrant a caravan\nAnd I'm sure there are additional negotiations and discussions better ongoing or between Mike pump pale and his Mexican counterpart\nAnd between the president of the United states and the leader of the Mexican government\nOr so as you correctly suggested Jay ... the focus of that discussion now is on a process called metering which would indeed slow down the flow of migrants\nThere's some evidence from news reports about the number of migrants has actually dissipated which would be a helpful or a ... outcome\nUm but uh it's still potentially a future crisis and we need to uh maintain a clear focus on negotiations with Mexico and these other countries\nWe also should continue to place pressure on the Honduran afloat or forties or the ... uh and the leaders of the Guatemalan government um they receive huge amounts of aid from the United states and I think it's correct\nOr to tell them that there will indeed be consequences if indeed\nAre members of their country ... attempt to migrate illegally to the United states and last by the way I was\nJust fabulous or we should ... uh ... maintain our focus on the rule of law that individuals who wish to come to the United states as refugees should go through normal channels\nYou know it's interesting you say that Harry because he was one of the things I I'm I'm I'm I Want to say I'd opportunity to be with a secretary Pompeo interception on Tuesday for um\nA Andrew Brunson and um it was ... and it was a it was beautiful then by the way and and the pastors expresses appreciation again to our audience and to media outlets around the country that have Kerry has\nA story and ultimately gun resulted God allowed the freedom of ah Andrew Brunson and the the ... you always look at it that way it's always the way I said these are people released from captive\nUm because of what the lord does and um there are people that are still kept and we need to pray for their release too are of course we appreciate everything the administration has done in that regard but\nLet me say this when I was with them you could tell in the state department and this is a these kinds of issues are very significant\nMarried very significant a and then you take that I think to the next step here and understand that early intervention want to avoid a confrontation at the border and new to me that is the key issue\nThe whole idea is to prevent a clash that could be bloody that could be horrific that occurs between the United states forces whether it's the armed forces or the border patrol\nAnd these migrants at the borders so the thing is that we want to anticipate\nAnd intervene before this uh curves thousands or hopefully hundreds of miles before it occurs so that it could be a averted has Harry has mentioned the news reports have\nIndicated the numbers of migrants have fallen to about half of the Seventy two hundred\nThat were originally said to be moving toward the United states\nAnd therefore there has been an attrition which is to be a really a ... who were happy to see that this has happened where they've gone and I don't know we have no idea\nBut at least that has indicated that there will be less of a confrontation because you've got fewer number of people who are attached to this caravan as it is moving toward the American southern border\nLet me play what a President Trump had to say about this and working with Mexico\nIs working with us\nThere is a movement toward our country is a while before they get here [noise]\nAnd his group that has around the say no I'm involved and others ... a week and people come into the early\nSo I think look I we we were early advocates Harry of the intervention issue with Mexico or in country there to see what can be done to avoid a border confrontation\nApps absolutely and that is highly necessary so one of the things that you should do to show true leadership is that you should anticipate problems before they reach a climax before the clash or ups and clearly we have had time we've been caged in\nPreparation and we've engaged in hope fully proof pull negotiations with the Mexican authorities to avert a crisis\nAnd it's important to know that this crisis was initiated at least in part by individuals left us individuals in Honduras or who's a basically initiated this caravan movement\nOr not the last the the Trump Administration has engaged hope pulley fruitful negotiations to avert the crisis at us ports of entry\nAnd that is necessary because you want to ensure that the integrity of the U. S. borders is a respected\nIn addition you wish to prevent crime ... ... there's evidence on the ground that some of these individuals in the care man are indeed gang members paving caged in a human trafficking and so\nWith the five hundred million dollars in the United states aid that was given an twenty seven inning\nWhen those that that's that's a significant issue and and I shouldn't have a problem\nIn April of this year there was also a caravan\nAnd that caravan which followed a similar past reached a about their their peak point was about Fifteen hundred members as across Mexico on the way in the United states by the time it reached Tijuana San Diego border crossing the Carolina dwindle down to a few hundred\nUSA Today reports data from the government agency showing foreign one members of the caravan requested asylum at the port of entry and Ninety three of those\nPast initial asylum tests and additional hundred and twenty do you remember the caravan were arrested for attempting to enter the United states illegally so it's if the numbers on ten thousand you can handle it and that's the the issue here but again avoiding a confrontation working with our counterparts\nIn the region this particular case in Mexico is critical but from Honduras in Guatemala is well Eric's\nAbsolutely so one of the things that we should focus on is the source of the problem and if we look at this from a global perspective or a broader perspective on many of the problems arise\nInternally with the Honduran government with the Guatemalan government with the el Salvadoran government\nAre they taking affirmative steps to improve the lives of their own people are they using the resources that they receive from the United states government and the American people appropriately\nAnd I think the answer to those questions is at the moment I'm no they are not ah advancing the interest of their own people so we should work to ensure\nThat the governments in those countries actually improve the lives of their people or indeed there will be consequences in terms of a reduction in funding from the United states\nSo Pam on Facebook asked this question I heard there's a second care about which started in Honduras\nIs that true and pay and the answer is yes there's a report right now that another caravan of about a thousand people has started making a point of exit out of Honduras oh that is happening or as well pat on Facebook says it this way isn't deterred would set a bad precedent\nOf course it does I mean you can't have your borders overrun but again I Want to I I think intervention here was smart early in Mexico I think that is the appropriate way that this is going to be handled I Want to close this segment of broadcast south of turning back to the pipe bomb situation I Want to make a position very clear we believe these are acts of terror\nThere's some people are saying they really are they real bombs we know if they're if they're not real bombs that would still be acts of terror\nSo let's take the politics out of this and and that's what they said these are acts of terror there they're designed to provoke\nTara and there are federal and state laws anti we've set it once we only got thirty seconds left but said again\nIt is a violation of federal law of course to engage in acts such as this and it is also a violation of the law of every state in which these five bombs\nOr whatever they're these these explosive device was are they can be aggravated assault that could be assault was intend to commit a serious disfigurement volley disfigurement which isn't aggravated assault they could even rise to the level Jay of attempted murder\nAll right we're taking your calls one eight hundred sixty four three one zero that's eight hundred six eight four thirty one tent we come back to the right where for another thirty minutes you're not getting all broadcast go to Facebook parents go for a C.
