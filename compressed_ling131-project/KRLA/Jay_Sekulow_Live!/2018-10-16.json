freed and turkey the prayer the pastor Brunson gave a knelt down and prayed for President Trump our senior counsel see see how it was with the Bronx and family\nFrom the time they landed at joint base Andrews through uh the oval office of their time in the White House joined us so if you miss that earlier the broadcast to be really encouraged you go back and listen to that account of what it was like\nFrom one of our senior attorneys and then shifting now into politics pastor Brazil will be joining us\nOn the air uh tomorrow to discuss the experience that again so he'll be joining us alive tomorrow but I Do want to get in politics where you take your calls one eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten oh let's go to Rick in California on live for Rick welcome to Jay sexual alive you're on the air\n... great thank you very much for taking my call I really appreciate it say strict um\nHe might concern with comments about the Republicans taking a more aggressive about shifts in the polls is is that they're going to become lazy and lacks a day in terms of their vote it getting to the polls [noise] I'm more concerned with what we do to get people out what can we do as local guys I'm a guy that drives a scooter [noise]\nBecause I have MS and I don't I don't pass anybody anywhere\nBefore I ask them what their stances and why is it the case of who they like and the election to the like and the judge Kavanaugh situation um than in trying to ah\nI'm Sara Lee preached to them but certainly wanting to get into a dialogue with everybody I mean on the streets but it seems like there's just not enough to be doing just a little bit more\nThan ... you know ... a lot of these uh depend on where you live so California's state wide very difficult for Republicans\nAnd there's a gubernatorial race their eyes and his contested I'm not saying that it's not money being spent there is but it is very difficult for Republicans federally statewide um and then uh so you look at to grad school districts there's plenty of congressional districts so it really depends on where you live but uh just to give you a a a an indication Rick\nScott the tossup races\nIn the house include let me just count one to ah\nThree four or five five different California uh seats\nThen if you actually six that if you move into leaning a Republican it includes a few more well leading democratic who's a few more I mean is there a lot it just depends on what district you live in a if you are seeing those kind of efforts um and I run by those campaigns because then it is these are turnout\nElections I don't say this on the air to to uh listen I I think you always want to run a campaign like you're down ten um uh but you got also got it you have to be able to encourage people to vote they don't want to feel like they have no chance of winning and the big picture to say it's a balance between ... between\nAlways feel like you're in the fight but also the idea that you can win the fight\n[noise] yeah I'm In California is a good example of this door and I would say a couple of things first of all I mean I think you're right that you could probably looking more than a dozen races there is being at least somewhat competitive\nBut if you're going to if you're going to paint them all with one broad stroke you would paint them as seats that are currently occupied by a Republican but in traditionally Democrat territory and I I Would wager that probably eight or ten of those districts that you rattled off\nMeet the criteria to get a Republican that either running for reelection or Republican that's running for election as the currently held by Republican\nBut it's a district that is usually won by Democrats that's the economy and it's going to be decided in this midterm election and just to the caller's question Jordan whether you're a Republican or Democrat\nAnd the reason that a mid term is typically one by the party out of power is because it is much easier to motivate that voter to go and make a change in the seat that they are casting a vote for so I think it's natural that Republican voters\nUs started behind in the enthusiasm gap but I Do think that the Brett Kavanaugh thing really close that gap but the colors correct\nThere's always going to be a disadvantage as far as the enthusiasm goes for the party that is in power if the party in power though Jordan closes that gap in the enthusiasm gap is essentially equal going in the party in power is going to win that seat then\nYou know folks we've got a lot to talk about\nHow we're going to take your phone calls one hundred sixty four thirty one time we got a couple of lines open 'cause we have some calls already on politics on the midterm elections\nYou since Republicans\nWhat
