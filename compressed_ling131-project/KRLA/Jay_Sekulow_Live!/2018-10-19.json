not leave that conflict\nAnd the reports are that he was killed inside that conflict that's raised a whole host of issues we did that Bruce on Facebook say why are we involved with this at all he was a Saudi national not a U.S citizen well let me tell you why because Saudi Arabia is a critical ally of the United states by the way that does not accused ... but my compare the secretary of state has said that they give it a few days\nOf turkey we can't blindly take the word of Saudi Arabia we have to come to our own conclusion and what happened\nBut didn't J I think it's very important for people understand but ... there's a whole range of very punitive actions of the United states can take if they deem that action is taken\nAnd I think it is probably smart to start with the economic state

facts Jamie look like I I think there is inappropriate role for both the executive branch in the legislative branch I think it's probably good that legislative branches hung up so that that that Saudi Arabia takes it seriously and so that it fully equipped to handle the president doing do you deal with Foreign Relations but\nAt the same time the constitution gives the president their responsibility to balance all of these measures so I actually think it's good right now that you have Lindsey Graham and others in the Congress or just sounding the alarm and how serious this is and then at the end of the day the secretary of state and the president well they have to balance all the things we're talking about income to a conclusion I think\nIt was and I think dispatching Mike Pompeo to meet with them was there an absolutely appropriate incorrect thing to do anything cancelling a secretary ... participation in the uh Saudi Arabia investment forum for some it was the right thing to do as well and I think giving them a few more days to respond is fine but understand\nSomething happened and something bad happened here give me a Fifteen seconds on the importance of ally here we got to
