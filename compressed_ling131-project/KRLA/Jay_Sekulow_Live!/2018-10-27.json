speaking at University of California are\nThey actually did property damage and they rioted and are there is no question that the left has been far more guilty of actual violence trying to shut down

of times on this show to um [noise] things that President Trump has tweeted that I think are not constructive uh this is a tweet from a couple of days ago before they saw this a crime\nThe series of crimes actually President Trump tweeted a very big part of the anger anger capitalized we see today in our society has caused by the purposely falls and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news and it's gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond\nUm then he says mainstream media must clean up its act fast and fashionable capitalize with an exclamation point\nUm [noise]\nWhat's my big problem there is just one word which is purposeful\nPurposely falls and an accurate reporting\nIn other words this is not to say that there isn't an accurate reporting there is such say there is unbiased reporting there it was the idea that it's purposely falls that as part of a conspiracy that I honestly journalists don't go into the business and this is true for people on Fox News history where people on CNN\nIs to have a right and left you don't go into the business of journalism or commentary to get things wrong\nDoesn't help your career it's embarrassing or let's\nAlleged perpetrator has been apprehended he has been interrogated a the proof is accumulating\nAnd the prospect is he will be going away for some forty years but meanwhile the\nPresident of the United states charged us earlier today and I think in an appropriate and dignified way with the necessity of people actually coming together and transcending some of the bitterness and viciousness of our politics recently\nAnd I want to speak to for a few moments or with a friend and somebody who I I view as a very significant ally for constitutional causes his name is Michael Ferris he is the president the c._e._o. and general counsel of the alliance defending freedom\nAnd uh and and Mike we were just talking off the air for a moment\nOr I think we agree that one of the essential elements of trying to\nTo reduce the levels of polarization and hostility and viciousness and meanness and craziness that has afflicted American politics\nIs to affirm freedom of speech and freedom of conscience freedom of faith and that's exactly what the alliance defending freedom as about we agree with that proposition when did you\nSee the American army disagree with everything you say but on the right to say [laughter]\nAnd we're losing no particular although there are some of the right but the left delivers power what can the jak Philips case\nWhere they tried to shut down or should they didn't want to use his creative skills to speak of message in favor of same sex weddings\nAnd the California case we did in the spring were last year were California to force pro life centers to pro abortion message people aren't willing to let people have their own opinions and say them freely\nAt you know can we go to the California case for a moment cause I follow that very closely and it was extraordinary an extraordinary victory seems to me for the alliance defending freedom\nOr this was a I've spoken several times for fundraising backwards for um for crisis pregnancy centers and what crisis pregnancy centers tried to do is to give people an alternative\nIn a crisis pregnancy is where a very often people are on Mary they have no funds that rather than terminate the pregnancy getting an abortion or that the centers will help you ... the bear the child raising the child and and deal with all the challenges involved\nAnd they were being forced by legislation in California to put up signs that said if you want abortion services [laughter] go go to this address go here go there um and that's about right isn't it\n[laughter] yes I'm I argued the case in the Supreme Court myself and you got it exactly right California's real to them in their papers passing a law that this is a part of their progressive vision to ensure that the correct pro abortion message was given everywhere I'm\nIncluding these charitable private crisis pregnancy centers that were set up by donations from people who are pro life\nYeah exactly and so the they were not willing to let people have a different opinion on\nAbortion if if if you are on our side of the issue of the other side of course I wasn't required the Planned Parenthood has not affected by this law it was only they claim that they only wanted\nAll women to have a view as well that didn't work that way\nRight now the NBA comes just to get this so people see it so clearly in other words you would have been fine with is is that a Planned Parenthood they had said well if you want an alternative to abortion and then go to a crisis pregnancy center\nIn equal actually I Would have ... I Would take the position that Planned Parenthood shouldn't be forced to give our message and we shouldn't be forced to give the pro abortion message but the the lack of a quality shows what the real problem here is is that people want to silence\nTheir viewpoint that they don't agree with and I think that that's that's where the lack of civility is really coming in its were saying that there are other people don't even have a valid point of view I mean we can there's a difference between saying\nI'm you know you're you're entitled to express your view\nAnd saying I agree with your view and you know it's it's okay to disagree in this country but to some people are not allowed to disagree anymore and they will fight with you if you disagree with the progressive viewpoint\nWhat uh what is the story going on right now with Blaine Adams and who is a proven does promotional T shirts a case\nCases pending in the Kentucky Supreme Court [noise] um the local officials there went after him because he wouldn't print T shirts with a gay pride to them\nAnd he will print teachers for a person but he will deliver messages there's other messages these turned down over the years\nHe found them another T shirt shop to deliver the exact same shirt and the exact same price but that wasn't good enough it wasn't that these people want it to be entitled to have their shirts which they clearly God\nThey wanted to have a pound of flesh to go with it and so they're trying to punish planets and hopefully we won that case in the Kentucky court of appeals [noise]\nUm and hopefully that will be for him to the Kentucky Supreme Court if if not\nWe'll be taking that cases frequent yeah\nI I just saw an unbelievable number um how how many uh different attorneys do you put out in the field to defend these cases with with the ATF the alliance defending freedom\nWhat we have a sixty attorneys on staff and three thousand allied attorneys that I'm not mature their time sometimes at reduced rate sometimes absolutely free but we have a big team that are willing to come in and help Christians and other people all over the country\nWho have a real religious freedom and freedom of speech problems\nWell that's a that's a very a very significant um army if you have three thousand volunteer attorneys and by the way we're we're talking to you because right now today is friday we are going into the weekend you will feel great and you'll have more reason to celebrate and feel great all over the weekend\nIf you can do something to um\nTo help the alliance defending freedom go to our website of Michael midday dot com you can read more about their fascinating work and some of these important cases\nAnd see what this great organization led by Michael ...

... student at Cal State University in San Marcos and he's the president of a pro life group on campus that she thought for a pro life speaker of the student body has a rule and the process where they found all\nOrganizations all all groups supposedly non equal basis but as it turns out normally equals not equal the pro life groups was in any funding for speaker but the gay lesbian groups who received over ... about a quarter of a million dollars in round numbers\nWave of quarter of a million dollars for ... years and\nAll the other groups combined received around thirty thousand dollars\nAnd so the groups that are pushing the progressive message [laughter] to really two groups who received\nThe lion's share of the money and this is money taken from every student in student fees is like a tax on public school ... college campuses\nAre so so what what are you suing for what's the relief you're seeking ...\nLower seeking equality of relief butter over these kinds of cases is to end the practice of collecting student fees for for these kind of purposes that they just need to stop there there are being administered such uneven fashion\nThat they've become nothing more

in the United states the chances are very large that you have at least one generation maybe two maybe three maybe ten generations of people work very hard for this country and that\nGives you more of

truly open borders policy has no constituency in the American electorate\nBut it's the implicit philosophical framing of most news media stories on immigration which tend to focus on the Mike Rowe problems of the individuals not the macro problem of just how many of those individuals the country can admit\nShe says this is easy to say\nNo of course we can't let in every single person who wants to come because doing so would transform this country\nInto one the few Americans or any political persuasion would want to live in the United states would be vastly more unequal and income and opportunity migrants would languishing the kind of swallowed poverty\nThat the United states hasn't seen for a century in numbers a doubling of the U.S population is probably a conservative estimate that will defeat any conceivable taxing transfer program\nOkay this is the core argument simply allowing people\nIn is a disaster for the country and it's not a a blessing for the people who are
