joined the Dewey team today shady dancer [noise]\n\nOkay so the FBI report has been delivered from the FBI\nThe White House to the U.S Senate senators are reviewing it right now some already have the word out a from both sides is that there is no information to operate any of the allegations gets spread capital what does that mean\nLet me as as of now as of everywhere they distributed so far the public has not been able to we have not been able to review that yet I'm this information has at least as being kept a very close to the vest or by the U.S it\nIs that this will now interface three of the attack on Brett Kavanaugh is it do all this doesn't matter we don't like his temperament we don't like the fact that he was tough on us because we made allegations that we now know could not be cooperate\nBy our nation's top law enforcement agency the FBI and a ... and uh and they didn't like how Brett Kavanaugh active when he was being accused of that by those Democratic senators who made this extremely partisan process Beverly on Facebook writes this though now the cloture\nVote that motion has been a a filed\nThat should happen tomorrow the confirmation votes should happen on Saturday but Beverly on Facebook rice as we're getting the phone calls ready to go what can the Democrats do now to obstruct or has their game run out there and I think their their games close but I stayed very guarded ... vigilant if you are Brett Kavanaugh supporter because\nThey'll Susan Collins has made what could be interpreted as positive comments after reviewing a the reports say you know it's just seems to be very thorough I'm incomplete that's the opposite of what Democrats are saying so she's not calling for more investigations I'm Jeff Flake said that there's nothing there\nBut but this war is not yet over we talked about this phase three which is already happening this was still face to the the sexual allegations faced three is temperament and they're still focusing on that I think that we'll see that shift happened in the next few hours\nYeah and and look the the the Senate Democrats aren't going to be convinced on his door and so they're not going to stop the targeting and they know they know just as well as as as you and I do that the three Republican senators that they need to convince they need to go to the three there Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski or Jeff Flake and Jordan I don't think it's going to stop all the way through Saturday and here's why\nI think they will make an argument to those three senators that even if you vote for cloture tomorrow you think there's enough information out there you think there's FBI investigation was Thoreau that's reason enough to stop debate but we want to convince you that this is not the right nominee for the court and and I think they will still continue making those arguments\nTo those three senators all the way up until Saturday but Jordan at some point those three senators have to step into the well the Senate and do the job to their constituents elected them do and by the way\nThe job that the constitution requires them it doesn't require a yes vote or a no vote but it does require that they provide advice and consent so at some point or come Saturday they're going to have to come down and put their money where their mouth is yet\nAdults who writes on Facebook will McCaskill vote for capital she is a close race that's right but the real clear politics average has her down a half a point somebody in a very close race in Missouri [noise] that being said than\nWe don't believe that that like Claire McCaskill would be the vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh or the vote to get it to ... so the vice president could be the vote confirming what we do believe is that if you get flake\nCollege Murkowski that it's very likely that you'll get maybe a a job at should and Claire McCaskill because they won't be the deciding vote but it will make their constituents back in ... better vote for them to take in a red state like West Virginia and Missouri yeah politically\nSpeaking Jordan all three of those states I I think the constituents of those states would prefer the senators to vote yes I mean the polling we have out of North Dakota in West Virginia is overwhelming a judge Kavanaugh has a plus thirty favorability there which is almost unheard of\nYou know you've got Joe Manchin probably up by six or eight point you've got Heidi Heitkamp who's racist really falling away from ... in the last poll I saw a she was down twelve points are there in North Dakota she would really like to be a yes vote\nA Claire McCaskill the same way that the races running towards a Josh Holly there I think she would politically benefit from a yes vote but here's just the reality you set it and I think it's basically an ironclad truth\nNone of them are going to provide the forty ninth or the fiftieth vote for judge Kavanaugh\nAll of them might be willing to provide the fifty first the first ... fifty second or the fifty third but ultimately Senate Republicans are going to have to deliver fifty votes on judge Kavanaugh if he's going to become justice Kevin Oh\nAll right one eight hundred sixty four thirty one tend to talk to us on the air that's one eight hundred six eight for three one zero the breaking news here is that we are moving very close\nTo actual votes on Brett Kavanaugh votes that matter the cloture vote matters than that vote is is it let's explain to people get um I Do it throughout the show but a couple of types of people understand what's happening this cloture vote that will happen tomorrow or how many votes required to move forward\nAnd and what happens in the meantime between that cloture vote and the actual final vote to get Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nSue the only way you can in debate on any measure in the United States Senate or Jordan he's either by unanimous consent or by taking a cloture vote which is a vote to agree to end debate now clearly there's not unanimous consent to end debate on this nomination there never would be so\nLeader McConnell had to file a cloture motion last night under rule twenty two of the Senate there has to be an intervening day which is today before he can take that vote on the cloture motion so tomorrow\nAt any point and he has said it will be before one o'clock he will call the roll on that cloture motion so centers will go down to the floor and a yes vote would mean yes we are ready to end debate on this nomination a no vote would be we want to keep debating this nomination so it takes fifty votes\nYou have a tie breaker from the vice president so you really only need fifty votes to end debate on that cloture motion if it's approved Jordan it immediately sets the clock to thirty hours you can have thirty hours of posts cloture debate before you take the final vote so you know hypothetical if that vote was at noon tomorrow in theory\nOr the Democrats could continue debating it until six pm on Saturday Night or they could use some of that time back but at the bottom line of vote tomorrow morning or up to one o'clock on the cloture motion which will set a thirty our time clock in motion before the final vote\nGood question coming in from Mike in Pennsylvania on lied five talking about the process here we also talked about what do you think is\nComing next I don't think the Democrats are ready to back to uh get Chris ... codes kinda sounded like that that he expects the confirmation by slip a majority but I think you'd get they would like you just to put your guard down there like Brett Kavanaugh seemed to put his guard down bike or for Pennsylvania you're on the air [noise]\nThey might [noise] you're like oh it's great that I\nHave to think that way but I Would get curious if\nThey tried to take it out and act like they were actually going to change their mind the last man which would vote but not the confirmation that legally or could they do that\nYou could absolutely have more votes were closer than for confirmation than I mean uh uh it's unusual\nAh but ah but I I think that would be unusual that so it gets through and\nEnough would drop drop through a but there are there is always heard that argument that you should have up or down votes and that would be that vote to cloture vote to allow the up or down vote of but things have changed since we went from a sixty votes threshold and the filibuster to a fifty ... vote threshold\nYeah this is a conversation I've had with a bunch of people today Jordan and typically you're writing cloture vote or the ... the tally on that is going to look very much like the final confirmation that is not necessarily the case on this because I see a Heidi Heitkamp\nWhere Joe Manchin saying look I really wanted a thorough investigation the FBI gave us that so I did think it was time to wrap up debate but ultimately I couldn't just I couldn't get there and I think the same thing is through a truce for someone like Jeff Flake you you might say I got the investigation I wanted so I'm good for\nFor cloture don't assume that means he is good on his final I think both of those hurdles or wants to watch on this one Jordan\nAlright I mean so there you go Mike I mean I think very good question and I say it said I like the past very possible that this is one where you could see people voting different ways on the first vote for culture so don't take things for granted right now\nThat yes this was the best case scenario for Brett Kavanaugh nomination to move forward for him to be confirmed was it the FBI report came back and there was nothing to corroborate nothing to raise suspicions of any of the allegations of gifts of that has occurred\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
