[noise]\n\nWhat am I guess everyone I was out in ah Arizona over the weekend and\nSpoke at a big crisis pregnancy center a banquet and uh it was the day of the confirmation there was a Saturday when Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed and that was very interesting to see the reaction of the folks there he's now hearing cases so every case it forward he will be a part of\nSo they will hear cases oral arguments close courts closed today they'll hear oral arguments tomorrow so uh that's moving forward having said that\nThere's already been a pivot and I want to kind of set this up and go take some phone calls and we want your comments about this\nThere's been this pivot since his confirmation we told you went through the pages they couldn't get it into face for baseball would have been run out the clock for three more weeks a politically that was what they were trying to do but it just was not work but couldn't they got the phase one face too and that was stopped at face three is that a fair way to say it man [noise]\nYeah absolutely I think they tried every phase they could Jay but ultimately they they're Republicans held in the Senate they only last Lisa Murkowski on the final vote and how many times and we said on this broadcast if the Republicans could deliver fifty votes\nThe Democrats could try anything they want it and it wasn't going to stop them only losing Lisa Murkowski a ensured that did the judge Kavanaugh was going to be justice Kevin ... and then J I think it took about thirty seconds after the Republicans delivered that fiftieth vote and Susan Collins speech that Joe mansion said he was also a yes or it was essentially J uh fifty one to forty nine margin\nIs going to and I think it's important to actually I think this is a good call the tickets were while we're talking about this margin gym in New Hampshire as a direct question on line three Jim welcome to Jay sexual alive gym [noise]\nLike you know we still like to ski\nAll right so let's talk about that go ahead oh what happened was one of her ... Republican colleagues Steve days who voted yes on culture and Murkowski voted no on culture and and that's what she would be a no vote on Brett Kavanaugh uh her reports\nPolitical action committee they will start moving out if there is no chance of of if they're wasting their resources that doesn't mean that the Democrat won't continue to run ads because they've got their own resources is in Tennessee they happen to have a personal resources in pretty well funded campaign but they won't have the onslaught\nOf of not just adds but people on the ground on election day yeah coming from the national party\nIf the polling is continues to ... point lead so by a by their their ... Republican opponent when you have that kind of lead um again you've got to move on how you think this place we got a minute forty four seconds your how big than you think this place in the house\nUm I think it's ultimately be deciding factor I mean it it will depend on in some of these swing states how many of these democratic members really really make it an issue but the M I n J just the overall tone nationally I think that I think Mitch McConnell put it right when he says the his opposition really played into\nOr the Republican Party's hand so you're down to thirty or forty competitive seats in the house I think it can be the decision maker\nAll right we're and talk more about this we come back from the break we'll have our full panel with us as well we're taking your calls at one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten it's eight hundred sixty four three one two one zero so we'll take some more calls when we come back from the break I think look a Britain you saw the you saw the

the executive the legislative in the judicial branch and um there was a multi pays attack\nOn bread cabinet it didn't it didn't work this time they couldn't get it they were trying to get it to face for which would have been there have been enough to Malta coming out of those investigations to have people saying we need more time and then there was a round the clock out when the FBI did the investigation they cannot cooperate\nAny of the allegations made against judge Kavanaugh and in fact the ones that were raised by one of the other lawyers late in the game a gotten a sweat next I think the inconsistencies in her own statements that came out so just the evidence wasn't there to to move it forward and that's what happened\nAnd then you saw the voting the confirmation will be back with more including your calls and just after the break\nStuck in traffic downtown LA the one ten passing through way south ... planes block\nBecause er tractors low from Sunset Boulevard just

not enough just to apply incentives and disincentives but we also have to do is make sure that we shorten the approval brain when we got to make sure that we uh what do you do well I think we we work

and justice secular oh\nRight so I called the ... and that's the second place right now judge Kavanaugh is now justice Kavanaugh will here's first cases tomorrow as they support and so she adjusts isn't a springboard\nTo the United states and me we are now less than a month out of the midterms and all of a sudden the cabinet combination becomes it costs a lab in the sense that you have some Democrats saying\nThat they are going to if they get the house they're gonna open up an investigation with a possible impeachment of Brett Kavanaugh on the other hand does it unite the Republican Party has well Supreme Court nominations\nTend to do that so we want to get your reaction to this we're taking your calls an eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten we've got our full panel joining us now\nA senior counsel for the ACL jaded director of policy\nA professor Harry Hutchinson colonel west Smith\nOur director of military uh fares are are joining us as well as a thin and myself and Jordan All right so let me uh we've heard from the three of us let me go to a ... a professor Hutchison\n... being just confirmed what do you think it's the after effect of the confirmation well\nFirst it's important to note that despite the fact that a justice Kavanaugh has indeed been confirmed that the political fight\nOr is not completely over so there are twenty nine days oh to the mid term election\nA conservative voters are mobilized they're energized and they're energized for good reason the cabinet nomination in my opinion has United conservatives from all political spectrum\nBut be sure of one thing opposition is also energized to some extent and people on both sides of this issue are fundraising like Matt\n... no question about that so whether you're a group this week and I was in a group this weekend\nDifferent parts of the same I Would put everybody within the same a political philosophy corrected very diverse group what was kind of the reaction but here's what I saw I ...\nThere were we were at a table actually at the table we were at one of the couples that we're seeing with me and Pam I'm\nHe was an independent registered independent or had been a Republican had been a Democrat had been a Republican kind of back and forth basement pushed him into the Republican campaign and you know what you that that would they did to Brett Kavanaugh was so outrageous that kind of\nVisceral attack that he's you know this is just eat it just wasn't going to accept it and so he was making ... what was your reaction where you where\nYou are very very similar you know the the ugliness of what happened the last two weeks is on everyone's mind and and the I think the consensus was the Democrats just made it much more difficult to ... to take the house or they probably were never going to take the Senate anyway and in spite of the polls\nAre indicating that white suburban women are moving to the Democratic party and they were mainly against judge Kavanaugh\nI believed that Americans in general and Republicans in independent voters in particular they were disgusted by the behavior of the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee and the blatant means steer spirited attacks from Kevin now I think it's going to be very very difficult for them to have this blue wave that they've been champion\nToday overplay it oh well they overplayed so round and round was heavily over played by Democrats the Spartacus fine but I think to a point where it was almost kind of some law that they were the only ones making news and that wasn't really going to impact the election\nThen you get around to wear a so that the Democrats really embarrass themselves in the judicial philosophy section of the hearing and then we get through this personal attack\nSection and and again what ... what are Democrats left with\nA judge Kavanaugh who had to go through a horrendous experience for his family is now a U.S Supreme Court justice they're all just sitting there are still in the ... committee um they did everything they could and they they failed a yet again I'm so\nThese tactics if they use the courage serious question when the and the people\nThat they're aligning themselves with like you mentioned one of the issues that well you mentioned the lawyer by name but it's like if you're going to start taking info from people like that ... it means you're not doing your ears due diligence before you bring these attacks and if people see that and you love your cat like that against someone\nCriminal yeah allegation against someone serious wanted that hot then then it's the American people what question you're serious disability and leave the u._s. government\nThen they're more like a twenty six seconds or they're gone now right I mean everybody's out\nOn the Senate will be back tomorrow after the holiday okay so it's going to be interesting to see come back to down in this atmosphere I mean I knew they were out to be very interesting to see the return what it's like\nWe're taking your calls one hundred and sixty four thirty one tend to be back with more in just a moment eight hundred sixty four three one one one zero your reaction to all of them back more inside [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jay Sekulow Live!", "city": "Glendale", "day": "09"}
