client a pastor Andrew Brunson who is now back home in the United states was at the oval office with the president's you see I was there as well on Monday through Sunday and took the day off\nOn that one Saturday Sunday and Monday kind of took a day to recover and then I did so many interviews this morning we're thrilled that he's with us\nA massive before I did you say anything to you let me say what Pamela on Facebook says so thankful for your freedom pastor Brunson Andrew welcome to the broadcast thank you very much\nI Want to I wanted I think we're on behalf of our entire audience um let you know and you know just as we talked about this is you literally had the world praying for you and the books that are listening does the millions that listen this broadcast every day and we're praying for you without the U.S ceasing but can you describe\nFor folks I think this is important for everybody understand you were in Turkey for a long time twenty three years what you were doing in Turkey and and what your activities were and then we'll we'll we'll bring your current but what were you there as a mission can I\nCan I first say something that we are so grateful to people prayed for us and we are so grateful for a field day a such a tremendous job fighting for us and uh the the uh high elbows tireless and advocating for us\nAnd you also J uh effort see see I Know she's a ... lawyer but she was also\nA personally involved calling Noreen encouraging her and so many ways and a and you also Jay and we are so grateful that ACL J\nUh took this on and we want everyone to know what a what a tremendous uh uh help is was and then out great for where to\nLook we are thrilled that the result was as it was we got another case right now where do we haven't had that result right now and that is representing is helping to see a Bebe in our office in Pakistan but uh your case ended successfully but you were there in prison\nIn Turkey and very difficult circumstances but I think is I'll take the call them and many here but I I Andrew set for the folks what you were ... how long you been there and what you were doing\nIn Turkey what was your call to go there\nSo we were there for twenty four years before I was arrested and our main goal was to go and Christians as Christ one of the main things we were involved in with church planting where of all that several church plants\nAnd then in the last couple of years\nWhen there was a surge of Syrian refugees because of the ISIS attack has area\nA number of refugees came into turkey and we saw an opportunity not only to show the love of Jesus by helping them a humanitarian aid but also people who never had access to the gospel most Kurds have never met a Christian or in their lives and in Syria is kind of preach the gospel it was forbidden\nSo we got involved with a Syrian refugees and\nWe're a started a meeting among them and we're doing evangelists and what's that\n[noise] so you were there as basically a missionary I mean we can safely say that no we could not say that while you were there um obviously because of the situation you were in but you would they're sharing the gospel that was what your job loss\nWe did it and we did a very open late we ... we did everything they opened our churches were open to the public the ... a mission work to Syria's what it's all done out of the open\nBut before we take costs has to run to the question over those twenty three years any serious issues with the government or local uh style regional government or the national government in Turkey and all\nWell there are cycles sometimes are\nThere more accommodating the churches and to Christians that sometimes there's a bit of a a tightening up\nUh we had a they're often rather than from the government it's from a uh other people who will sometimes there'll be threats bomb threats death threats that we were attacked once in our church with a man came with a shotgun\nSo that's always a possibility is that just does anybody who was involved in church planting a turkey can have those kinds of dangerous but\nIt's not from the government so\nThis was this was in a sense a new effort to arrest you and try you know one of the one of the charges was Christian position so nothing nothing like this ever experienced these threats experience we understand that and that part of the world but but what happened to you was something that has not happened over twenty three years\nNo it was an unprecedented thing\nYes so you there's one follow up thing we're doing you know I said you can't disclose and that's a great thing 'cause you're home and and and we're going to get into what's what's next for you but see so you've done and we still one legal issue we're going to finish up with and that was the un commission on arbitrary detention ... we talked about that yeah they engaged in\nThe working group on arbitrary detention on engaged and pay a ... percent of the whole case to ban they're still making their decision and then I have to finalize ... than what the decision was went to court that he's fact\nI'm at a family with actually that decision and the conviction and and what can release conditions where\nOh here's what we're going to do there's a lot of you called me I mean our phone lines are literally Jim Facebook comments coming in Allen her since God is so good so happy to pastor Brunson is free Christine says welcome home pastor Brunson you're truly here due to answered prayer so we give all the praise and Thanksgiving the gun I said that the beginning to broadcast\nA Andromeda Buchanan I said this and I I met her I mean I'm I'm very happy with the legal work that was done by a team that was led by cc I'm thrilled with the work that they invented in Washington and government affairs shop and Greg or ...\nWho runs for office in trust for France and and it's just a great job in the end and the circumstances of that I was representing you and then ended up representing the president I mean you'd none of nobody could have put down altogether at the end of the day\nThese though I I Believe that with and you got to take nothing away from any one\nThat uh the lord was in this and that's that's how these things happen and I'm Glad that uh everybody I'm Glad for the ... because he by our legal team by the president by the secretary of state but we do also have to give credit where credit's is also do you know that's just the way we feel as it might additionally\nBut let me do this we we've Andrew we've got a lot of people want to talk to you so you stay on that phone and we're going to start taking calls\nYes Karen is calling in from New York on line to Karen welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nHere in your own bathroom right ...\nThank you for taking my call and I did find that ... for him to LA I'm so thankful for prayers answer\nAny harm and I wanted to let them know what an inspiration ... testimony as a Christian to other Christian throughout the world and on the light that he was in the darkness\nAnd I just thank him for that um he really inspired me as a Christian to um the mole\nAnd preach the gospel time there's that's what were called to do so I Want to thank can only tell him how happy I Am to hand him back in the United states\nWill do what you're talking right to um Andrew ... what do you what do you say to Karen\n... are we are very grateful for parents prayers and for a number of people who create for us and we believe a obviously a God uses the people\nBut I think that uh what was moving that's what brought our name up to this level with the president a it was was periods of God's people and but I also think that\nAs we look at it we think well we're we're not very significant or importance for our name to ride for so many people to pray for us we think that there was much more that God was doing and I look at it as\nA almost like we're looking at a puzzled but from the bottom side\nAnd someday we will look from the top and all actually see the picture right now we don't see the full picture but God was doing much more than just using ... to release me from print prison a I think there was\nHe was just pouring prayer from God's people into turkey and then to the middle east and that there's going to be\nA great harvest from this we haven't seen all of what all of the results yet but I think there there was much bigger than us\nI think you're right and again I I think the confluence of events that took place here was was pretty unprecedented I say that\nI mean because when we representing you as I said I didn't know and be written up representing the president of the United states and then you had the ability to use this platform to and that we're doing right now we're talking to millions of people and on Facebook compare scope and all these social media platforms\nWe believe in our prayer we believe also and and partition that as we pray for people God can a pass something spiritual onto a spiritual blessing on and so we we ask God to give us had opportunity and when we asked the president and if we pray for him he was very receptive and\nIt was a great privilege for us to do this\nLet's say one more call before the break here Julie California on line six Julie you're on the air would pass the Bronx and Julie\nI encountered in tough to burn coal because of all that's why I don't remember the hail today they care about one individual and they care about us and for the whole world\nAnd passed it on purpose like question who is the king will occur are so people around the world bank Cleveland ... and it's hard to tell their shrimp Corey\nOK so first I Want to say something about it so they said they they care about the individual and so my wife told me how cc would stay up sometimes through the night monitoring something for us the hearings and then the next day goes through a whole day at work\nAnd just the personal care there was a really phenomenal uh uh the question I just forgot what the question\nWas you know no no the question was did you feel the prayers in God's people\nYou know I was very encouraged knowing that people are praying for me one of the fear that I had it set a rational thing perhaps but when one one is isolated the way I was is it would be forgotten and that people would not pray for me and I desperately wanted that for her because I I felt very weak\nAnd so uh as I look back uh on my second year of one God was rebuilding me\nI did it feel God's presence very much\nBut uh I I Know very well that it was a person of God's people that was a\nThere was a grave coming to me that often was not felt right with like a hit and grace and I wasn't aware of it at that time but then I Would look back and say well I came through these difficulties and I know that I'm too weak to do it myself you know I Know that it was great\nYou know you're absolutely right and we're taking a break we'll come back with ... runs the moment but interesting statement\nWhen you said where you felt like you were alone and there were those times we we've had other cases where people say the exactly the thing was that they feel even though it's irrational they know it's a rational in those situations there can be completely forgot I Will be back with more than Andrew Brunson did just a moment\n... five Senate
