competitive now [noise]\nFor the first time in a very very long time we will get to that story [noise]\nAh there's also a very good news just grow moments ago [noise] uh from\nThe White House about fulfilling something that I had been pushing for for a while on this show\nAnd I'm very glad to see it it's a cold and across the board budget cut spending cuts for every federal departments that President Trump is apparently planning to demand\nAnd as president he can demand it uh starting tomorrow and that is appropriate meanwhile continued ramifications about this horrible murder\nIn Turkey and it appears pretty obvious that it was a murder is Trump responsible that's what a lot of people on the left and in the media ... sometimes means the same thing\nAre saying uh plus uh we we really do need to go to a\n[noise] some of the other media stories\nAbout media malfunctions including an attempt to us slime a great American just moments after he died or we will get to all of that on the med show one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nFirst off this very positive story\nOr and and again it's a story not based upon\nA conservative source it's based upon the world Economic Forum which every year does a rating in terms of the most competitive countries in the world\nAnd the U.S had not been doing badly compared to most other countries in the world we've been fairly competitive but we moved up very dramatically and we are now number one of the story is it's covered in uh on line of the wall Street Journal\n[noise] uh is US's world's most competitive economy for the first time in a decade the last time we were the world's most competitive economy was two thousand and eight\nWhat us two thousand and they'd have in common with a two thousand sixteen Republican presidents and yes that does make a difference when you have a pro business guy in charge\nThe U.S is back on top of the most competitive economy in the world are gaining the number one spot for the first time since two thousand eight and an index produced by the world Economic Forum which said the country could still do better on social issues okay\nAmerican climbed one place in the rankings of a hundred and forty countries with a top five rounded out by Singapore number to Germany number three Switzerland number four and Japan number five\nFive countries scores rose from two thousand Seventeen with us not seeing the second biggest gain\nAfter Japan's\nNow all of this is good news is good news for us that Germany is more competitive that Switzerland is more competitive particularly that Japan is more competitive\nThese are American allies and I know Swiss Switzerland supposed to be not aligned neutral it's effectively because of trade and economic matters it's an American ally it's tied into the west\nThe top spot hasn't gone to the U.S since the financial crisis of two thousand and they sold output and triggered a global economic slowdown\nEconomic recovery is well underway with the global economy projected to grow almost four percent and two thousand Eighteen in two thousand and Nineteen said the report that uh was published\nA last night by the organization that produces the Davos conference on global politics and economics okay you may say well what does this have to do with my life everything because a more competitive economy means more jobs that means higher wages\nAnd means more prosperity it means more freedom\nBecause frankly if you have more options in terms of the jobs you look for in the way that you are in your living in the way that you can invest what ever dollars you can save if if you have more choices that is the equivalent to more freedom and then there's this uh President Trump\nActually just talked about this at a a White House meeting and a ... this is uh what what President Trump because the media was just held he announced in advance\nThat he was going to make a demand from his cabinet secretaries and here is what that demand sounded like just moments ago\nI'm going to ask each of you to come back\nPay five percent budget cuts [noise]\nFrom the various departments whether it's a secretary of the British straight or whatever I Would ask everybody to come back with a fiber so cuts for next week I I think you'll be able to do it they may be a special\nExemption perhaps I don't know who that exemption would be if you can do more than five some of you will say hey I can do much for those of you know\nI heard about the penny for Fifteen Years\nOne Betty every year\nFor a dollar one Betty every year after four or five years the ... and go to Jay\nJay with us or the ... of the five but it but\nI think you can do it so I'd like to have every woman sitting around the table for your incredible domains you presided over so we're really in some cases some cases very well some cases where there's a link [noise]\nAh I Would like you to come back with a a ... percent got\nOf the way\nThat I'm sure you can do it I'm sure everybody has to say look at those\nOkay this is terrific and this is one of the best moments for the president so far in my opinion\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six the only thing that I Would add and and I feel kind of emboldened to do this because this is something that we've talked about on the show was told that recently we've talked about a month ago it was necessary it was great the president is right on target\nThere's one thing you could add which is I'm going to set the example and I'm going to cut my White House budget I'm going to kind of right now\nAnd we're going to come back to you at the same time on all of you to come back and show I'm not cutting just five percent on cutting ten percent and by the way it is easy to cut the White House budget by ten percent\nThere too many darn people who work in the White House and their stumbling over one another by the way one of the good things about Trump is he has an appointed people to fill all of those useless jobs at the White House wants a useless jobs\nYou have a whole offices with a a director and then and associate director and then various secretaries\nFor things like the office of White House liaison to this disabled community now this is not that this the disabled community\nBut there's no reason there are other government apartments to deal with that health and Human Services has a huge commitment to that you don't need a special White House office there is a special White House office it was established by President Clinton\nTo deal with the algae Beatty community why it's not necessary that doesn't mean that access should be divide the denied the algae Beatty people look there's this special White House office to deal with the Jewish community\nAnd I benefited from it because I during the Bush administration they would have a Hanukkah party and it was a lovely thing\nKeep up the Hanukkah party but you don't need a special White House liaison you don't need a special White House of pulling teeth you don't need somebody drawing a government salary\nThey can talk this back we have a deficit right now seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars it went up Seventeen percent since last year it's not because of the Republican tax cuts\nIf you actually look at this and you read some of the hysterical democratic articles\nThey make it clear revenues have not gone down sharply if anything they may have gone up very slightly they basically been stable what's gone up has been spending\nAnd yes it's true as Mitch McConnell made the point yesterday that much of that spending about half of it is three big federal programs Mitch McConnell made a little bit of misstatement he said that the Seventy percent of the federal budget is Medicare Medicaid and Social Security it's not Seventy percent it's about fifty percent\nIf you add on an interest on the national debt and a bunch of other social program than it gets up to Seventy percent but still the the point is that there is room for cutting the federal deficit we have the highlighted some of the programs some of the stupid spending that has really crippled our country\nNow that does not include however spending to get a new ambassador to Saudi Arabia this is something that President Trump could look into a do I believe that President Trump is to blame for the killing of ... of course not\nAnd this is a ridiculous ... liberal\nBasically incantation and if they say it off a saying enough it might be true and now it's not true do I think President Trump is doing a great job on Saudi Arabia and not so much but it's going to be okay it's going to be OK if he keeps in mind certain facts and priorities about our\nRelationship with this desert kingdom by the way that desert kingdom for those enlightened slate tonic wonderful but no this is a brutal and corrupt autocracies so how do you deal with it will get to that and your calls coming up on them at that\nNobody ever and nor should people talk about cutting back what's already pledged in Social Security but it's considered a cut if you cut the rate of increase but you're entirely correct I think what President Trump has in mind here\nIs each of the federal departments is a lot of a set amount of money and let's say you have a a government bureau department is is a has a budget of a hundred billion dollars well that budget cut would mean you find five billion dollars to save\nBut you're you're right to bring this up to and thanks for the call let's go to um [noise] mark in Columbus ohio mark you're on the Michael ...\nThank you sir I really appreciate your ah your bipartisan or ... or your uh your regular view of America really appreciates thank you [noise]\nUm yeah when you say a President Trump should lead by example he really are far I mean what you said yourself are you he's already left opposition is open field as a\nAs a some people would say and and ... them alone I think she she yeah I mean the numbers are incredible it's something like a a the previous administration had a hundred and twenty five and blow away when in fact\nI was going to bring us point up the your ear entirely on the right track I'm Michelle Obama had a staff of sixteen to twenty four people depending on when and her eight years as first lady lung has a staff of nine\nBut you don't want ... Milan you could make do with a staff of seven [laughter] don't you think [laughter] and ... and and seriously because this whole thing about getting first ladies big staff\nIs is relatively new and uh and the point is you're right Trump has left a bunch of White House positions unfilled and good for him but I'm ... the whole idea when people talk about turmoil in the White House\nThere would be less turmoil if there were less people working there fewer people working there and I I I think that's very very clear I um\n[noise] I wrote a book about this a long time ago it was at the time that it came out which was a very long time I was forty years ago the time it came out yesterday not the time that shadow presidents came out it was the first comprehensive history of the White House staff up to that time\nAnd it's shocking a President Lincoln won the civil war\nWith the White House staff of two [noise] that's right too it was him and to assistance because he had a candidate as well I'm not saying that presidents should try to deal with the White House staff too but he could probably make do with the White House staff of two hundred we'll be right back [noise]\nMichael ...

front page of the New York times with everything else we have going on and budget deficits in foreign policy crises and the midterm election coming up what do they focus on the fact that the President Trump\nKilled and it's quite ugly it's it's disgusting in fact but the idea that this is somehow associated with Trump is ridiculous what President Trump has done since he's been president has been to encourage exactly the kind of change in Saudi Arabia that we have known that we've needed for a long time and you know who have knowledge\nIs is it's a Tom Friedman doubled Pulitzer Prize winner in the New York times big liberal but he at least is honest enough to recognize\nThat ... all of a sudden saying oh we have to blow up our relationship with Saudi Arabia and who cares about their oil he's right the biggest thing is in their oil the biggest thing is Saudi Arabia's role in reforming\nIslam because while hottest Islam which used to emanates from Saudi Arabia was precisely the kind of danger that led to the worst thing that's happened in most of our memories which is nine eleven and right now say what you want about him\nMohammed bin Salman NBS has been working to rein that in and to change it let me read you some of what Friedman rights today in the New York times\nHe says I defined our most important national interest in Saudi Arabia since nine eleven and it's not an oil is not arms sales is not standing up to Iran Islamic religious reform which friend come only from Saudi Arabia the home of Islam holy cities make and Medina\nI Believe nine eleven was the worst thing to happen to American my lifetime writes Tom Friedman\nWe'll spend thousands of lives in some two trillion trying to defuse the threat of Muslim extremist from ... to ISIS dollars that could have gone to many other needs in our society\nAnd I believe the roots of nine eleven came from too terrible bargains one was that bargain between the Saudi ruling family and the kingdom's religious establishment where each bless the other\nThe other was America's cynical bargain with the Saudis\nWhich went like this guy's just keep your oil pumps open your prices low and don't bother the Israelis too much and you can do whatever you want out back preach whatever hate you want in your mosques print whatever conspiracy theories you want in your papers and treat your women however you want\nAnd he says so what caught my eye\nMost about Mohammed then Solomon and made me most hopeful was this tentative willingness to engage in a war of ideas with his religious hardliners declaring publicly do not right that we are re interpreting Islam we're restoring Islam to its origins Mohammed bin Salman was the guy who saw to it that women can suddenly are allowed to drive\nIn Saudi Arabia but that's a a big big deal he um he also has argued publicly that Islam and its origins was tolerant of others face and are empowering of women that opened a new ideas\nAnd the whole idea that somehow whatever follows Mohammed bin Salman is going to be better\nI think it's foolish and yes there has to be a strong response and this has to be condemned and they're going to have to be people who are punished for this this was a gross crime but the idea that somehow you're going to create instability in Saudi Arabia the cost would\nBe terrible not only in terms of our foreign policy and our confrontation with Iran but in terms of this entire need that Friedman is right to point to which is the need to reform Islam's most destructive tendencies oh let's go quickly to Jason in Honolulu you're on the Michael Moore

substantial agreement with Camille ... and her new book it's called provocations is a collection of her pieces and observations\nFor twenty five years and by the way one of the observations that she makes with which I agree very emphatically is the notion that we have a problem in our higher education system and an education at all levels because of the blind spot toward religion\nAnd she takes that position\nWell it was to me and you describe yourself as an atheist right\nCorrect I I'm an atheist but I I I completely respect religion as a profound system of meaning okay but there is a metaphysical system\nAnd I think that one of our the major problems right now\nIs that in our in our era of secular humanism we have our most educated elite having transferred out the need for religion into politics so people look at at their political affiliation of party affiliation is in some way\nSalvation oh are they they they see the world in terms of of good versus evil and and

the other end you stop slamming religious people and finding fault them because there are no more right than ...\nA Camille yes I I absolutely agree with that and what and what is tragic about the new atheism is that it is that it it means that people have no contact with a group with great literary works like the Bible\nGood lord a that is like a credible Hebrew poetry that parable Jesus is

absolutely fantastic but don't agree with much but I was recently joined a conversation which we are in a darker beer Canada\n... was a real poly or a thanks for being on your obviously an order any conservative or Libertarian Party leaders that you admired today or follow and secondly\nYou feel in the Democratic party that you are somewhat alienated nowhere to go on I was a Libertarian Party\nWell let me just say that my my problems with a with a Democrat um political correctness I I I I Would express those a warning stay about the direction of the party in my column\nOn salon for for many many years and I've included that material in the new book and provocations to show how how ... how many warning signals to work\nOut how the Democratic party was running running off the road long ago ... ... people only people who have been ignoring the problems within the party could have been surprised by Trump's when I I certainly was not surprised I I I knew in these problems are building\nAnd then they have a sub had\nAlarm bells in two thousand ten but now talking about anything but what if this is not true there are plenty of Republicans including this one\nWho has talked about the problem of overspending and that has just pulled the Ryan and Republicans rose to power in two thousand and ten in part by right raising an alarm about the deficit now that's true and Paul Ryan is still talking about it and President Trump was talking about us today\nAnd uh then they have right below that is another headline add one more insult to presidents catalogue of attacks on women now tax on women sounds like stock or it sounds like a new Halloween movie psycho 's [noise]\n... I mean is it are the attacks on women are they are attacks\nOn his opponents who happened to be women and then there's this in adds some Democrats are being cast as terrorists\nAnd um\nThen they say ... a Democrat running for Congress in California has been portrayed as a terrorist sympathizer okay\nThe headline says are being cast as terrorists this is a phony headed is ally there are no as out there that are saying the Democrats are terrorists they are making a point that this guy a mark ... who's running against Duncan Hunter\nIs a is a terrorist sympathizers or how do we know because he donated money for the cause\nLook I I\n[noise] first of all his grandfather was one of the masterminds of the Munich Olympic massacre is his grandfather and he used to praise his grandfather and their stuff on the Internet about him calling his grandfather a legend which he has since deleted\nAnd now he apparently converted to Christianity good for him but even since his conversion to Christianity or he has continued to give money to donate money\nTo uh the council on American Islamic Relations\nWhich is not a terrorist organization but it is an organization that justifies and sympathizes with um Muslim extremism I had a brain Hooper on this radio show\nWho was head of the time of the council on American Islamic Relations with fishing rational candidate donated to\nAnd um I was trying to put it brought him who were on the spot\nAnd us saying did he prefer would he liked to see ... replaced the constitution of the United states it's kind of straightforward question and I said that a simple answer is no absolutely not would suffice he wouldn't give that answer\nAnd I pushed and pushed and pushed and then eventually said yes well if we ever get a majority of Muslims in the United states it would be appropriate to uh to have sharia replace the constitution sorry that's an extreme position\nAnd it is worth it is perfectly legitimate for I'm Duncan Hunter and for the Republican campaign committee which is working to defend that congressional seat to make it clear that the\nThe candidate that they are running a mark ... who by the way he's changed his name to make it sound less he he he used to be\nHis middle name used to be Yasser and that was changed um [noise] ... the entire thing is is is crazy now the reason by the way that he is even the Democratic nominee is no one wanted to run against Duncan Hunter because before he was indicted\nIt was a looking like this was a slam dunk for Republicans and by the way it should be\nAnd for people who are listening to us down in San Diego county where there's congressional seat is I've I've been very critical of Duncan Hunter I don't think he has a big future in politics he he he does need to respond effectively to the charges against them but\nThat doesn't mean that he shouldn't be re elected to Congress he has to be re elected to Congress because every seat is going to count and you're going to be making a choice in this election between Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the house and Kevin McCarthy you're going to be making a choice between\nA complete gridlock and an ugly situation in Washington DC and one
