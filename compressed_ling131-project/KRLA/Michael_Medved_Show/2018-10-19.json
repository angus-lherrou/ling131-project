to be speaking to Stephen Moore the author of a new book called Trump's ... about some of the lives about the economy\nAnd what happens next after the November elections to help but Trump fulfill his America First vision of economic reform one\nEight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number but first up\nLast night the president gave a a a rally speech and he was an extraordinarily good spirits he seemed extremely jolly\nThe one aspect of his speech that has gotten all the attention I don't need to play for you because it's in that CNN and CBS and NBC or all over it\nAnd let me just acknowledge\nI think it was unfortunate I don't think it was a good thing that the president said that it was a praise worthy or a vet that basically congressman Gianforte Greg Gianforte of Montana he was in Monday's in Missoula\nAnd Congressman John forte and at the time I I thought that John forte handle it very well he lost his temper he body slammed reporter he knocked off his glasses\nThere were charges brought against him he pleaded guilty he apologized lavishly he made a legal settlement with the reporter read assaulted and I've spoken to congressman Gianforte this was one of the most embarrassing moments of his wife\nAnd I don't think it's a good idea for president from to make light of it I don't mean cars when John forte would think that however what struck me about this is this is that that was a tiny segment of a very long and very substantive speech actually with Trump was doing and I think in a fairly effective way\nWas laying out\nThe way he's going to be campaigning and very close Senate races in very close governor's races as a Republican try to help other Republicans and Trump last night was in Montana where the Senate races become unexpectedly close\nBetween our candidate Rosendale and the incumbent Democrat Jon Tester who pretends because he wants to last a finger in a farming accident\nNo there's no solidarity there was to show the we're not talking about it because he was lost a finger in a farming accident he is really a moderate Democrat he's a a good old boy that he's not he's a big liberal\nAnd a Trump was speaking on behalf of Matt Rosendale and other Montana Republican and he had this to say and defining what this election should be about\n[noise] [noise] of cabinet all [noise]\nLaw and order and common sense that's what it's going to\nGo to election those\nOkay he's talking about the cabin on the caravan and common sense and I think he threw in off off script the idea of law and order but that that do fine I'll look in terms of Kavanaugh\nObviously because of the treatment of a justice Kavanaugh that has mobilized lots of Republicans and there are lots of congressional races they are now the official people who do the polling in the ... and things like that said there is a one out of three chance that Republicans hold the house\nIt used to be down to one out of six so right now Republican prospects are surging even in the house of representatives and that's a good thing and part of it is because yes\nWith their response to justice Kavanaugh the Democrats show that they're not the party of jobs they're the party of well we'll let the president delivers on line\nFor the choice but not any more clear Democrats but just mobbed\nRepublicans for jobs [noise]\n\nFancy\nShops [noise] and the Democrats they want to raise your taxes they want to impose socialism on our incredible nation they get Venezuela because that's what's gonna happen [noise] they want to take away your health care because you won't be able to have in our country will be able to afford it [noise]\nDestroy your Second Amendment and throw open your deadly drugs and vicious gangs because for any of them are coming across a lot of drugs\nOkay and this is a problem for President Trump because guess what he's president United States Republicans control the Senate in the house they feel the harm of homeland security they control lights and he is right that there are a lot of people\nComing across the border I just looked at the numbers and their set\nOf the number of people entering the country illegally is not going down and went down in the first year of Trump's presidency or the first part of the first year of Trump's presidency\nSound like tripled where it was when Trump became president of the rates in September ... angry\nAnd that's why I think President Trump is absolutely right to make an issue of this caravan and by the way the evidence appears to be as of a half hour ago that there was some progress getting Mexican authorities to move troops\nTo try to block the advance of of what looks to be over four thousand people waiting Honduran flags by the way\nWe're marching their way through Guatemala and then through Mexico and they say they're headed to the United states what do Democrats say we know where Trump stands\nTrump stands on a common sense principle which I honestly who who can disagree you cannot let this caravan in you can feel sorry for these people\nBut if we go ahead and say oh well All right you march told his way will come in and we'll process your your applications for asylum that there will be no end to it it will\nEncourage more and more and more and more and look it's it's a question here not of whether we rearrange our immigration system to make it more sensible maybe even more compassionate\nBut right now the question was this caravan is whether we have an immigration system at all\nOr whether we simply raise the borders any kind of meaningful distinction\nAnd ah I think frankly President Trump is looking at this thing going on how is this going to work out either as he is going to win victory and turn the caravan back\nWhen there's going to be some kind of awful disaster and I think the incoming president of Mexico on race Lopez Manuel Obrador um\n[noise] has a ... actually is shown some willingness to work with the Trump Administration on stopping this caravan which is crucial\nI've been a from a said this about the economy\nAnd related it of course of the fact that there are more and more people coming across the border\nBecause it's such an incredible autonomy money [noise] [noise] [noise]\nOkay [noise] uh probably the rhetoric I've created so much I've done this and\nYou know and that's not ideal rhetoric but look the fact is the economy has done better that's what we're going to be talking about with Stephen Moore coming up and and just a moment\nThe point over here and I think it's very striking is everybody knows what Trump says everybody knows where Trump stands everybody knows what Trump has to say about this has anyone heard a any kind of meaningful democratic response on this issue of the caravan\nBecause I've heard nothing all they do is they attack from and that's not a policy being anti Trump is not a policy and last night\nBeto O'Rourke the new democratic superstar the great hope for Democrats not just for two thousand Eighteen but for two thousand and twenty and beyond beta or who's a talented politician but he\nBlew up his his own campaign and frankly I think his own future with a one answer that was just a home I Will get to that and that to your calls coming up we'll also be speaking with Stephen Moore\nThe author of the new book Trump ... of course one of the leading economic thinkers at the Heritage Foundation behind the America First economic reform we'll be right back [noise] one\nAbsolutely right yeah yeah I mean we we are absolutely agree on that let me let me go back to to one thing that the Democrats have been lying about and they literally lie about this every day and the media never call them on and they claim that the tax cuts that you helped to write and help to design\nThat those tax cuts that have been passed have caused this exploding budget deficit because they've reduced revenues that's just a flat on line isn't\nYeah revenues are actually up this year so we passed the biggest tax cut and three years and we actually have a slight increase is not what I Would like to see revenues higher and I think by the way as we get you know as we continue to see this economy\nUh continue to grow you you know the best way to get tax revenues headed for people in the work at ... businesses profitable businesses back to the United states which is happening uh but yeah the problem is spending and you know people say oh you're just about Republican I'm not a rubber Republican the Republicans\nAnd Democrats this bipartisan spending spree that's going on my caller both parties deserve a lot of blame for this\nAnd you like a President Trump's a idea a vast amount every department to five percent yes\nI Love that you know that's what businesses do you know that that's the thing if you're running a business and you don't have enough money coming in and your expenditures are too high you got to go to your agents and this is what businesses did during the recession they talked in their stomach they tighten their belts\nThey got rid of an efficient workers and inefficient services and things they didn't need and they save money and they became profitable getting we never do that and government and by the way I Would like to hear one listener\nOf your show Paul endear show and tell me you can't say five cents on the dollar\nThat right it well exactly ... what about the one aspect and you mentioned this in your book Trump ... posted up at our website at Michael ...\nThe one aspect of Trump's America First program that he talked about in the campaign was infrastructure that he's really done pretty much nothing to implement a where's the money going to come from to do the big infrastructure improvements that we need\nWell let me go back to what I was just saying about this construction boom that's going on in this country factories and and warehouses and and apartments and that\nThat isn't the structure and what we need pipelines we need ... terminals we need oil refineries we you know the point I'm making is\nA lot of that infrastructure and we need in this country you know rebuilding our ports a lot of that Michael I think can be could be done with private money it doesn't why what where does it say that the government has to pay for all this stuff\nI think that's a great ... points

may have wondered when he fired James Comey the principal investigator in what happened in that election whether that was an attempt to obstruct justice but win by broad daylight on Twitter he asked his attorney general Jeff Sessions to end the Russia investigation always say that the structure and inaction\nOkay goes on and basically what he's saying is yes he would go back to the house of

where American student Otto Warmbier was tortured to death\n...\nTwo years I've seen ...\nWe have some serious political get protests here at home\nTone it or not\nWe are blessed with the political system that allows us to resolve our differences peacefully\nWhen my recognize\nThat we are all American family are stronger and health care one way or you know [noise]\nOkay I think it's tough to disagree with that\nAnd particularly in the context of what I began by talking about which is the case of a Christian Woman whose name as I see a bb\nShe's illiterate but then a lot of people in Pakistan are particularly women\nAnd by the way that's not an anti woman comment that's a pro woman comment I mean one of the things that is deeply dysfunctional about a lot of the Islamic countries in the world is that that they don't provide any education for the women\nIn any event she's Christian and uh\nShe has been on death row in two thousand ten what is your crime well here is the other way it's described in the wall Street Journal\nUm it it it turns out that are troubles began and again this was eight years ago with a squabble over a cup of water on a sweltering summer day in Punjab\nTo Muslim women accused ms baby a farm worker and a a mother a mother of five and the fact they accused her of polluting the cop that they were all drinking from on this hot day bingo she drank from it and she's not a Muslim\nSo in the midst of this argument allegedly ms baby told them Jesus died on the cross for the sins of mankind what did your prophet Mohammed ever do to save mankind\nNow it's not even clear she actually said that because under Pakistani long\nTo talk about blasphemy is blasphemy so all you're allowed to do is say she committed blasphemy you're not allowed to cross examine witnesses she's been condemned to death since two thousand ten\nShe lives in a windowless cell there have been international efforts to free her and um [noise]\nIt it's just unbelievable they're already people who have died in her case a shortly after the span villagers accused ms Bebe of blasphemy and they had or imprison\nThe following year court sentenced to death she lives in a windowless L. where she cooks for herself for fear of poisoning by prison staff or a fellow inmates against this backdrop a standing up for his bb requires courage in Pakistan and two thousand eleven as a year after she was condemned\nThe governor of Punjab governor Solomon tests here\nI've visited her in prison to try to show some sympathy for her and right after that visit and his expression of support for us the a bb his bodyguard killed him\nTwo months later a gunman killed Shabaab bought see that's another a Christian politician\nWho also opposed Pakistan's blasphemy law\nIt's an unbelievable thing this is a nuclear power now why am I talking about this right now not only because there was attention to her case and there's a new president of Pakistan ... who says he's a reformer he's a former cricket star\nAnd maybe just maybe he will show some mercy on this poor woman the problem is that President con\nSupports the blasphemy law the idea that someone should be executed for saying something that disagrees with the religious beliefs of Ninety seven percent of Pakistanis\nOr the entire thing is mad and it's difficult and it brings us to this um [noise] ... incident I uh I have been troubled by some voices on the right who want to say that to show the at one\nTime and his wife have been sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood he clearly moved away from that if you read his last column that he wrote before he died that was just published earlier this week in the Washington\nPost he was no Islamist he he was calling on Islamic countries to allow more press freedom ironically\nThe the idea that anyone would try to justify or minimize the hideous nature of what apparently was done to Mr show he is sad I actually think President Trump and secretary palm pay on particular have been getting it about right\nYou can't go off and say well are we support other reforms that Mohammed bin Salman is doing therefore this is okay we have to look past it\nBut you also can't say we're going to blow up our entire relationship with Saudi Arabia which is a regional power and it's a very important ally the United states over this one\nEpisode and it's it's a\nRemarkably important that we move forward we will form of some unity and not make this into a political issue one of the things that the Democrats do wrong as they want to make every last thing about Trump\nAnd or do I think that Trump made a mistake or comparing well saying that they he should be innocent until proven guilty of like Brett Kavanaugh comparing\nThe potential murder to the uh legit at I Believe imagined a song by a Seventeen year old high school guy who I and and the ... and it was all that the whole ... roping\nAt to compare that to a brutal murder and dismembered meant and torturing a guy and cutting off his fingers and and then slicing of his body to transport out of the country [noise] this is not comparable\nAnd it's also not comparable because this was done in the name of government I'll tell you what scares me most about the show good story\nIs that\nStupidity if sometimes more frightening than arrogance or pure evil\nAnd how stupid do you have to be if you're planning to murder some journalists to try to do it in the consulate in a foreign power\nWhat do you think is going to happen how can you imagine you're not going to get caught maybe they wanted to get caught they wanted to send a message but that's evil to send a message\nTo murder and torture is hideous and it's evil and that's wrong\nThese stories the one from ... just on which is hideous the one from\nSaudi Arabia and or the murder if it occurred and I think it did is actually from turkey they're very alarming but they have one\nLesson that's profoundly important the lesson is

what happens next what happens to address the concerns of this brave mother indicator Georgia\nI think first we're hoping the department finds that the school it violated federal law and hold them accountable for that\nAnd to the school has to revoke this policy this is not working it is causing harm like what happened to\nPass his daughter there are better solutions but the common sense solution should be never allow a boy into the girls restrooms or vice versa and those are supposed to be private intimate places that are reserved for students that designated sex they're better

attorneys that I've told you about who um I give heart and soul to this cause now not everybody is in a position to give heart and soul and legal skills of this cause but everybody's in a position to

the club is about I Would say kids around age twelve\nS hill about Seventeen or Eighteen is hell pre college they did the diving at UCLA on campus and they use their facilities and the locker rooms UCLA has a a a gender policy that is very open to everyone\nThere is a transgender boy and on the dive teams that uses the girls locker room and it was very startling when she came out of the stall one day when they were changing it's bathing suit\nAnd which is why she's twelve and I assume he's Nineteen\nNo no my daughters actually sixteen but at the age range is that the kids are about wealth to about Seventeen or Eighteen I think the boy is all I think the boys sixteen that the girl that changed before getting into the pool and that's our after\nSo so your your daughter was uncomfortable with is what happened next\nWhen they finished diving and and that got out of the water to shower he was in their souring girls and so instead of them calling debating it down everyone kept their data is that they're not comfortable situation Oakland UCLA title nine department and\nI assume he did not he did not keep his bathing suit on\nI think he did I did not I think he ... the\nOkay I I just do the stupidity here it's just so unnecessary so she spoke to the uh people at the diving program and what they say back to her\nWell we didn't actually at herring because those free online ours are down they were very very ... they have never experienced it before it this year before and um anyway when they wound up addressing it with the rules for UCLA\nUCLA than than their guidelines that

for the girls\nHad any that very backwards and I don't know if\nYou have said that that's exactly what when you say it's backwards is this is not to say that we should have no compassion are no support for people who have gender identity issues people who are transgender\nGot it and there should be a place for them but that should be a special place for them for people who have gender confusion or gender identity issues or our transgendered however you want to say it but the idea that that's small\nNumber of people should be made completely comfortable at the expense of everybody else is backwards and and again\nThere is a possibility if if this was going to be a serious issue then you have a separate time to shower or separate time to dress up if if you if your gender identity does not conform\nTo um you were at the moment physiological identity and the entire thing is madness I'm Sorry you've had to go through this with your daughter I Hope it works out and I hope

I had been unaware of this I guess I missed out because I don't know maybe I had a sheltered upbringing or did you know the man sized clean ... was a thing Greg did you know about ... you're a man's eyes guy and a\nAnd you know no man's size Kleenex for for okay well no man's highs clinics anymore for anybody I'm Kimberley Clark the parent company ... said it received a consistent increase of complains about the branding firm in science Kleenex\nKleenex man's eyes to shows have been on shelves for the past sixty years at a statement from the company over that time the brand has always been characterized by a much larger tissue size which is both soft and strong the company said understatement\nKimberly Clark and no way suggested being both soft and strong isn't exclusively masculine trait nor do we believe that the man sized branding suggests or endorses gender inequality\nHowever they are dropping man's eyes clean accents they're not going to be called Kleenex extra large\nDo I believe that this is a tragedy know do I think that this is a raid on our cultural patrimony no\nBut is it silly and stupid and pathetic and strange to think of a company wasting serious money to respond how many complaints you think they received on the issue of Mad Science Kleenex how many complaints does it take to get you to change something like that that's been there for sixty years\nI mean so now you just say Kleenex extra large I guess it's more descriptive she had men had [noise]\nOkay um [noise] ... that gets us back into this whole transgendered issue and we're not going to go there right now I'm another bit of political correctness I Can't believe it I you know dear Abby has continued despite the fact that Abigail Van Buren\nA desire to the column anymore the original dear Abby now and the call has been taken over by genes Philips who is the daughter of the original dear Abby but she was asked a question about a very complicated elaborate foreign sounding name\nThat someone was considering giving a child and dear Abby said this\nNot only can foreign names be difficult to pronounce and spell but they can also call a child calls a child to be teased on mercifully\nSometimes the name can be a problematic word in the English language and one that sounds beautiful and a foreign language can be grating English by the way when I read that I immediately thought of a problem that some Israeli Americans have\nA very common popular a Hebrew name Israeli name is ... and uh or moron I mean but seriously you don't want to name your daughter\nOr your son moron and not not in in this country and not in this culture that probably better named to choose now the point about this dear Abby thing is all\nHell has broken lose for dear Abby people have claimed that she is affirming white privilege that there is a racial thing and there's no racial and what she said but of course the New York times is ready to make it racial\nThey have a column that says I'm the heated reaction to the column which has been a staple in American households for decades\nAnd was started by miss Philips mother who use the pen name Abigail Van Buren this she'd reaction has inspired a fresh debate about identity acceptance and racism\nAbby's column was deeply infuriating and also revel at Torrey said a a a woman named uh Valerie cower\nAbby as clean to an old America were white\nIs considered the norm and everything else deviant an inferior Musk our added that she and her partner believed it was more important to honor a child's heritage and to connect them to that heritage then for a name to be easy to pronounce\nOkay fine and he was not suggesting that anyone is just giving advice do I think it's reasonable advice sure\nDo we have very very dear friends who have given or their children very difficult names we do absolutely and you get used to it\nAh and now I'm not talking about you Greg a though Gregg is laughing here can I mention the names of your children [noise] okay they named their kids after inanimate objects penny\nA river and Jonas but none of those names or that hard to spell or they'll I don't know may be probably people there are probably people spelled penny wrong\nBut not many uh okay that's the point about the point about this it it just seems to me is why is\nEverything about race well because people make it about race lay a quote someone named a non zero right is he's a writer who writes about socialism and about the evils of capitalism he says is the reality that a lot of this has to do with names\nBut more with white and is there a lot of complicated names from polish in Russian and Italian and German backgrounds that have become second nature to Americans\nThe unusual names referred to in the dear Abby column aren't unique in their complexity he said they're unique in their complex and they tend to come from places where people aren't\nWhite that is nonsense\nI I mean I I think it's very difficult if ah if somebody and they're all kinds of names that you could understand would be would be difficult and challenging and by the way my last name is difficult and challenging my father's older brother\nMy uncle ... or ... his his name was Moshe method and he changed his name\nTo ... more stuff and that was the way he did business 'cause it was easier for business a dove Hebrew or the Hebrew word for bear is dogs and the Russian word for bears ms it yet so okay\nThis seems to me inane but then we have we have this and this is a piece in the Washington Post\nAs sexual assault survivors continue to

kissed Snow White without consent\n[noise] a bell who provide voice of Princess Diana and Disney's animated film frozen\nTold parents magazine that when she read Snow White two her two young daughters she poses the question [noise] don't you think that is weird with the British prince kisses Snow White\nWithout her permission [noise]\nBecause you cannot just someone if they're sleeping well she's not just leaving she's supposed to be dead in that movie right she's been buried they've had a funeral she's in a coffin and the prince brings her back to life okay then you have Sleeping Beauty is also kiss without her permission but also brings her back to life [noise]\nUm [noise] is this really something we have to be worried about [noise]\nI have a lot to say that little girl in the bathroom you don't think that even without that little government that that comes from politicians politicians are going to be able to do that now you know God's now\nYou know gosh now as evil but does now is a killer and and he actually went to prison for being a killer\nAt him the the idea of equating one thing and another\nIs is simply wrong and I I Do believe that one of the terrible things have politicians do sometimes they don't take evil seriously enough and I think that's true with our whole criminal justice system we had here in the state of Washington\nA a terrible Supreme Court decision where the Washington state's Supreme Court\nAh basically said that ah they couldn't give life imprisonment to people who had committed murder before the age of Eighteen no it's a life imprisonment that's the more reason they not only struck down the death penalty for people who are convicted of murders as adults\nBut for people convicted of murder as adults who are convicted for crimes committed before they're Eighteen\nYou can't give life imprisonment anymore\nNow that is a manner of coddling evil and then you hear some of the stories of this then I think it's profoundly wrong but see we we lose the battle to him if we lose the language\nAnd evil loses all of its meaning if you're talking about silly stupid are irresponsible Maxine Waters\nAnd equating her with a these people in Pakistan who are literally committing murder and wanting to execute a woman because she said that ah Jesus died for the sins of humanity and the profit didn't\nI'm OK you could argue with her and that's fine but the idea of putting someone in jail and are threatening to execute her and then murdering politicians what a defender that it seems to me is a very different manner\nAnd this is also one of the problems that the people had an and there were people of this nature a stolen was evil Hitler was evil\nSo why is it that we sent millions of dollars billions of dollars worth of equipment and support and supplies to stall and so that he could beat Hitler answer\nBecause it was necessary for saving the world and uh there was one danger that was more immediate at the time
