this experience we will\nAll have a memory of a time when this body failed one of its own she went on to call the threat Centre cowardly weaken worthless okay I Will go with that\nShe said you may

inappropriate now look do I think that this was\nA high level meeting a no but it any president would do this ... major celebrity he is breaking ranks to show strong support for the presence of course the plans but I Do encourage it and the idea that how can the president do this when people are suffering in Florida\nThe president's been very outspoken he's spoken many times about the horrible devastation from hurricane Michael\nAnd I actually think the president's also done a fine and preemptive job\nI'm preparing the relief agencies for dealing with a situation here was that Chris Matthews on MSNBC was\nAttacking Trump for doing something else while this Florida thing was going on we will will play that in in just a moment but the whole idea that somehow because we have this hurricane\nOf the president isn't allowed to do something else or somehow shows disrespect look\nThis entire obsession\nWith President Trump I think isn't working for Democrats and shouldn't be 'cause we're coming up to an election it's going to decide the direction we want to go\nAnd honestly I think that when you take a look at situations like this hurricane and a lot of Republicans up there on the Florida Panhandle but there are a lot of Democrats too and there are a lot of people don't really care that much about politics they all need help and support\nAnd I think they're getting that both from their state government under the great governor of Florida Rick Scott\nAnd they're getting it from the federal government doing a decent job\nSo the freak out and the attempt to make this count politically against the president seems to me utterly inappropriate when we come back\nA player with um with Chris Matthews has to say no thrill up his leg but he is um he's angry at President

Bush President but in his new book\nIt's called to the ram parts\nOr the subtitle is how Bush and Obama pave the way for the Trump presidency and why it isn't too late to reverse course\nOr Ralph Nader has very harsh things to say about President Bush\nAnd about President Obama\nAnd about President Clinton I'm a ... Ralph is\nFirst of all thanks for coming on the show we always enjoy having you work but I you you are I'm much more than Trump kind of the ultimate outsider politically\nI you don't you're not a big supporter of Trump of Bush of Obama or Clinton or who do you like in presidential politics recently\nBernie Sanders did very well in money from contributors and two girls and sixteen [noise] on call Twenty one years but [laughter] I dunno\nThey learn when did you vote in ...

popular vote in the state but the person who wins the national popular vote\nSo would suddenly make the electoral college would still exist I guess but it will become irrelevant\nWhat show excess event neutralized\nOkay I Do you know I I Do think there are people who are already preparing legal challenges to that compact idea plus right now all the states you mentioned are very very blue stage very liberal state do you see any support for this compact idea from some of the more conservative states\nYeah next time Republicans won the popular vote for president and lose the electoral college will get the rest of the states and all and fly\nBy the way you know that's never happened the only popular vote losers who have ever been elected I'm actually are a Republican and John's on the

turn your telephone into an instrument of revenge\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six whether it's over the Supreme Court generally and its proper role in society whether it's over the Brett Kavanaugh nomination and all of the controversies surrounding that decision to confirm his nomination whether it's over the Washington Supreme Court\nToday saying that the eight murderers incredibly brutal murders all have them who are on death row in in the state of Washington are they all instantly\nHave the death penalty withdrawn they are now going to spend life in prison but probably knowing the way these things work that won't even be held true I mean the only reason people spend\nA life in prison today as if they are really notorious killers like Charlie ... who died in prison of course or Sirhan Sirhan we just have the fiftieth anniversary he\nShould receive the death penalty but that was another Supreme Court decision that spared their lives and that was a federal decision by the way by our old Supreme Court ah one\nEight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number you can also reach us\nBy Twitter and we've had a big upsurge in our a Twitter activity recently I think a lot of its surrounding the Brett Kavanaugh issue but uh you can reach us with a tweet a disagreeing tweet\nBy going to a at met that show on Twitter that's at Medford show one word on Twitter okay\nThis came in from John in ... Washington he says yesterday a caller proposed that we are in a Cold War and the political sense you rejected it and he had trouble defining you stated that the object of a war is to defeat an enemy\nActually I didn't say that I said the\nObject of a war is to destroy an enemy is to kill your enemy and wreck his stuff to wipe them out\nIt's not just defeat\nJohn says this is exactly what is going on meaning to defeat an enemy not to destroy and the Democrats have decided to use any means necessary to defeat the Kavanaugh's nomination they've abandoned all decency\nIt is a whole war because bullets are not being shot but there is no question the Democrats mean too politically professional and socially chill Brett Kavanaugh it is a Cold War\nAnd now ... and his family are getting death threats is this is not a Cold War Michael I don't know what would be a Democrats have Declared Political and professional war against this man looks the term Cold War is also misunderstood\nWhat people mean by Cold War is limited war\nIt was not bloodless we lost fifty eight thousand Americans in Vietnam we lost almost forty thousand and Korea\nOr during the so called Cold War we lost countless other Americans and different hot spots around the world uh there were very certainly an episode of the Cold War was the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and the push back against that a lot of people who died\nAnd I do think is wrong to analogize the\nIdea of of trying to smear and discredit somebody and wreck his career I think it's despicable I think what the Democrats did was despicable I think their whole handling of the capital matter was shameful and unconscionable and wrong and his right to\nBe condemned but to call it murder\nIs also obliterated distinctions and I think ... need to be restored to our public debate I'll give you one example\nI woke up thinking about this is people are now talking about everybody has a survivor\nRight and anybody who has ever complained about sexual misbehavior some guy no matter how far in the past or how limited that misbehavior is now\nA survivor of abuse and I was thinking of Anita Hill and this is not to say that if Clarence Thomas were guilty of the things he's accused of that it would be justifiable indefensible would have been wrong\nBut the idea that Anita Hill a survivor what did she survived exactly\nShe survived um some rude comments that made her\nAnd I'm from that song\nNo charges any workplace consequences to her work by Clarence Thomas and no charges that he ever touched her\nI I mean to say that\nIs a survivor and somebody who's been raped at knife point is also a survivor of there's a difference and yes there's a difference between Bill Cosby and Les Moonves if you want Bill Cosby drugged people\nThat's more serious\nAnd to lose all perspective to say that we are now dealing with the civil war because we're dealing with a moral issue the equivalent of slavery ... it's it's just wrong and no one expects that there are big parts of America that are going to have their duly constituted governments\nLeave the union form armies and we're all going to be finding one another and they're going to be hundreds of thousands were killed\nSo the analogy with a civil war I think\nDetracts from people's engagement with reality\nWhere you can make a real difference in bringing America to a more constructive place by voting in this election I Hope everybody does\nAnd vote for sanity\nInsanity mean stop the talk of impeaching Kavanaugh stopped to talk of impeaching Trump stopped to talk of oh my goodness this is the ... total nightmare of The Handmaid's tale we're losing all our liberties and the women are being ground down as the end of the world\nGet a grip we have some problems in this country but hysteria doesn't help and solutions let's go to North ridge California Eric you're on the ... that show disagreement day\nMike I'm a longtime listener conservatives here\nAnd um how I Do agree that this commentary about the civil war is a over rot in its comments but I disagree with you you\nAre in that I Do see a future of separation coming [noise] I've mentioned the tree reformed called and what's actually coming to this coming on the horizon for our country is a divorce\nThis idea that there's gonna be a war you are yourself or just building this up with this idea that there'd be hundreds of thousands of people killed we have a great separation we have a mechanism available to us and I'm Wondering why what what\nIs the ... what's the mechanism\nOh say they're just what ... said if we talked about before why would you deprive be one of the great rights provided to me in the constitution and that's the freedom of association\nI Know you'll have you'll have you'll have you'll have come to find more than don't but you you live in the same country with them you live in the same country with them there is no right in the constitution for secession it doesn't exist no and\nThat's like we discussed before it's not a session what it is is this illusion of the union which has provided through article five the mechanism is available through article five would not be a war\nOkay how what how was how is the mechanism provided for dissolution of the union they never anticipated that and it's not there there's an article five a convention of the states is who proposed changes in the constitution that still have to then be approved by three quarters of the states the\nMike I called in about a year ago you had a constitutional scholar on in here to greet you you simply don't\nWant no no no no I it's it's it's if you believe a convention of the states could provide for the dissolution of the union or you just have to then get three quarters of the states to vote to dissolve the union and they want\nAs a student of history Mike I Want to quote something to win in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the bands that bind them to another\nThat have had that African academically now there are some buying disconnect in them but but go ahead okay so ...\nDeclaration of independence and our great founding fathers realize that these things happen in the\nCourt okay so ... tell me what you believe is the issue that is worth dissolving the union over\nWell you're in you crush me on that before in a habit for you and you've never wanted to answer and that is the\nKilling the murder of over forty million American Babies can't actually written into the Democrat platform\nOkay again that can be a reason you don't want to associate with Democrats but frankly right now we have made tremendous progress in reducing the abortion rate\nBut if you think that somehow it will help to save lives to save the lives of the unborn by breaking up the United states of America which is the greatest force for good in the history of human kind [noise]\nWe what do you mean they're not being dealt with in other words the two parties disagree and it's a tough time of tough time to find middle ground but you say that are are medical care system you don't think we spent\nA long time over the last ten years arguing about that it's more than ten years when Bill Clinton was first elected president he came into the Nineteen nineties yeah\nMichael who's working for working for the medical industry the insurance industry of the attorneys fickle stylish is\nThis is great for them to have gotten extremely wealthy and doing nothing except tried to opt for the courts weren't sure the executive branch out of the laws talk\nOkay well wait wait wait wait wait I again when you talk about some kind of establishment conspiracy was the establishment for Obamacare or was it against Obamacare\nSport [noise]\nOkay ah then with the new you will agree with me that there wasn't a very significant difference of opinion between Republicans and Democrats or wasn't a single Republican not even one in either house and Congress who voted for Obamacare\n... there's not an issue there but I don't know wait\nWait you're saying that they ignored this issue the last had their own approach to medical care\nWhich I think was the wrong approach which is that what about medical care needs to improve his more government involvement I think we would all benefit from less government involvement\nAnd art and people having more freedom of choice in getting their own insurance arrangements that it it seems to me is going to be one of the challenges for the next two years for President Trump and the Republicans if we maintain our majorities in Congress we we've got to continue moving in that direction\nTo the idea that these issues that you bring up\nA little aren't instantly resolved ah it it doesn't mean that there's some kind of establishment conspiracy look there are a lot of people in the United states of America who are doing a lot better in the last two years and it is not just rich people\nThe ah the fact is that if you look at the wages that have been going up I mean even Ralph Nader acknowledge that when we were talking to him on the economic growth that has happened in the last two years\nHas benefited everybody in the country\nAnd look we've got two bad days on Wall street I Hope that won't be the end but you see the the problem with all these ideas about some all knowing establishment is it trying to put some order some fake water into what is by its very nature a very this orderly and sometimes chaotic process\nI it is disagreement day on the Michael ... bed
