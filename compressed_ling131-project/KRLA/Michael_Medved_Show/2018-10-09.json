uh\nMy coat in Tampa, Florida hello Michael Bennet Prager\nHigh so I agree I think you're selling the American people Donald Trump won a majority of the boat excluding California and these people want freedom but the government works in mission basically making us cry uncle\nAnd my health insurance premiums have double since Obama Care how would you like to live in the ... and the county where no health insurance and then you know people who say single payer Medicare for what we found very clearly literally\nWait wait wait that's my point ... wait wait forgive me that's what people would like they would they would like single payer for all I I I Would be very interested to see if we took a national vote only on that question would you like to nationalized healthcare everyone is covered and doesn't have to pay dues\nWould just take it out of ...\nPeople now\nWant that because the health insurance premium had double double\nRight oh no no no All right so you have no no no no no I hear what you're saying so you have very articulate spokespeople on the other side saying folks don't vote for that your premiums will go down if we have medicine the same way we have food and everything else competitively priced\nSo we will have articulate people argue I I hear you perfectly\nThey'll say no no no don't worry you will have premiums obviously because it's going to be a private insurance market\nAnd then the other side will say folks don't you just want to be taken care of and not have this worry every civilized country in the western world after all has nationalized healthcare they're doing fine just ask your Canadian friends\nAnd I I I Would be very curious to see what the vote is\nWhat I mean that's the direction we're moving into Michael that's the point I'm not selling the American people short\nThe American people are ... are people and they have been the Americanized in terms of values that's what's happened American people who still from liberty in God we trust the pluribus unum the American trinity aren't going to vote for nationalized healthcare\nBut people for whom liberty secondary to being taken care of they will and by the way and that's part of the reason is that people who believe in ... more government than liberty walk more immigrants because no matter by the way it doesn't matter where the immigrants come from\nIn every immigrant comes from a country in a society that values being taken care of more than liberty\nBecause there's only one country on earth that values liberty more than being taken care of and that's the United states\nSo it doesn't matter where the person comes from from Asia from Latin America from Europe they\nAll the immigrants the great majority of them not all by any means ... dropped the word all the great majority come from countries societies mindsets that value being taken care of more than they value liberty\nThat's one of the reasons for the great yearning for more immigrants if it is more people\nVoting on behalf of bigger government the bigger the government the less you have to take care of yourself half of Americans are now I'm not what is it I don't remember what is the ... from

of the Trump Administration she has been outstanding as our ambassador to the un\nWhat is really going\nOn behind the Haley resignation which was announced today she isn't a resigning immediately she's going to stay on at the un ah for her sons I Know I'm again I'm not as some implying that there are any sanctions on the part of Nikki Haley as she has been a a terrific UN ambassador\nIn fact one of the best ever and um we will see what comes next with her and what her resignation is really all about ... who is likely to replace her and the United nations\nWe'll also talk about a new poll which shows what seems to me to be a contradiction to CNN poll and it shows that support for President Trump is going up\nAnd going up fairly dramatically at the same time support for Brett Kavanaugh's going down so what's the story\nThere we will get to that and also to the arrest of a a teacher for something he tweeted\nAnd it's something that is very very much Rosie is whoa I he is clearly on the left\nAnd uh he also is just lost his job what could he possibly said that would cause him to lose a job we will get to that as well and to a a stay at home dad\nMiddle aged sounds like a very nice guy\nWho confesses that um he's a pot addict and I tried marijuana addict and he makes the case that marijuana is a profoundly addictive drug or we will get to that as well but first the reactions to\nWhat is going on in our country right now to the swearing in ceremony last night a judge Kavanaugh was already sworn in as justice Kavanaugh on Saturday Night so he's been an official member of the Supreme Court for a while\nBut President Trump I think very rightly wanted to stage a formal swearing in and it was a wonderful occasion\nHe had a judge Kavanaugh's family there he had all the justice of the Supreme Court with their Ruth Bader Ginsburg was there dancing and celebrating and hosting a few ...\nUh no that's not true that part but she was there and uh that's\nThat's appropriate and that's important and I think the judge Kavanaugh justice Kavanaugh spoke very well\nAnd President Trump a\nPresident Trump did not speak as outrageously or as badly as a liberal media to try and suggest and we'll get to that place for you and tell you why but first off on this issue of civility which remains a very very big and divisive issue in the country there was a contribution to civility\nFrom a contributor over at MSNBC and this is very much appreciate because it puts the situation and such good focus of this is a big contribution from Eli missed all\n\nAbout making a deal with the devil\nBacks up his Vargas by a double does not\nDelivered for these people on the things that they care about most of the of the liver racism for these people to delivered massage any for these people and now he's delivered the Supreme Court for these people which is something they've been trying to get for a generation we're going to see if\nIf this way they now have control over all three branches of government we're going to see if it's raining slash for three days for two years\nFor\nA thousand you're right that is a house in ... vice that's of course what a Adolph Hitler proclaim than his house in ... guy lasted exactly twelve years a\nLook at ... ... ... when he says has delivered for these people are we back to the basket of deplorable\nIs is that where it was only who are these people to whom President Trump is delivered racism and massage any\nAnd where is the son Janine American Life right now is it a the idea that there is a lack of civility on the right how was it civil\nTo suggest that a President Trump\nIs making a deal with President Trump is a deal with the devil\nOr that the people to whom he has delivered massage any and racism and corruption and horror and misery and and just general awfulness are actually diabolical one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and then there's this\nUm Tom Sawyer who was invested I think it's upwards\nOf twenty million so far I think it's way above twenty million might be upwards of fifty million so far he spent on ads pushing the impeachment of Donald Trump he spoke out on who to blame for everything that is going wrong in America here's Tom Sawyer\nThe group of very rich very entitled white men wanted to tell the rest of the country we are going to have our way and if you don't like it\nThat is too darn that say as far as I'm concerned the only thing everybody else can do now is the rest of America to go to the bulls eye November Six Flags tell those rich entitled white men that we exist and democracy exist\nOkay just to question um is Tom Steyer a man answer yeah he is I think he currently identify as a as a male even assist gender ...\nIs he white yeah he's white is he rich yeah is he entitled yeah so\nI I don't understand this is this is all the fault of rich entitled white men\nAnd was this kind of thing going on on the left basically suggesting that its rich and title white men who were controlling things against the public interest\nOr it doesn't it seem a little bit bizarre for the defeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to say that well we need now is a new civility but there's only one way to achieve civility you know what it is\nHere's what she had to say on CNN\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start a dance\nBut until then the only thing that the Republicans team to\nRecognize and respect is strength\nAnd you heard how the Republican members led by Mitch McConnell\nReally demeaned the confirmation process\nDemeans the confirmation process\nWhere they are the ones who brought up by drinking games in high school\nWhere they the ones who are brought up obsessively looking at a high school yearbook and even at general references in the high school yearbook\nHow is it that Republicans demeaned the confirmation process and and what about this notion that the only way that we can restore civility\nIs um is somehow to or\nHave the Democrats back in control heaven forbid one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six she also in the same interview Hillary said what was done last night and the White House was a political rally\nIt further undermine the image integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional government\nUm okay\nIt was she watching what was she wants me she was watching the Saturday Night live cold open\nWhich showed people celebrating in our locker room if you actually watch and we should posted on our website Jeremy if you actually watch the ceremony with President Trump and justice Kavanaugh and Justice Kennedy very much in evidence the mentor of justice Kavanaugh who sworn and again\n... ... why was that unsuitable I I I honestly\nA jump was asked about this briefly and about Hillary saying that the swearing in ceremony was no good it was a political rally it was inappropriate here's the president\n[noise] here's what\nI guess that's where she lost\nShe doesn't get it [noise]\nShe never did I knew that a long time\nHillary never got it [noise] that's why she lost [laughter]\nAnd and by the way when you talk about political event [noise]\nWas uh what judge Kavanaugh said\nPolitical about wanting to be a justice who is fair [noise]\nHe said all nine of us just as the Supreme Court review of the constitution and yes that includes Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan Steven Brian [noise]\nFreed North Korean sanctions\nGeneration down

a huge difference and us\nAnd the U.S is the way they should make all American very proud\nI Am this is I'm about as as strong a case as you can make and none none of what she said can you argue it it's all the truth and yes she was part of it\nBut all of this did happen under President Donald Trump\nAnd this is one of the reasons I suppose that on the CNN poll a despite the fact that there has been so much hysteria on the left about Kevin on and the the various horrors that are alleged to have been perpetrated by old white males led by Donald Trump\nThe President Trump actually saw his approval rating rising look as far as Nikki Haley is concerned\nThere's a lot of talk about her replacement\nAnd some of the talk that as most inflammatory is the idea that the president is going to appoint his daughter Ivanka\nWhy would that make any sense ... has traveled around the world uh she speaks very well she has dynamics you certainly would have the president's confidence I should also be a\nTerrible choice because it would be very easy for the rest of the world to see a look uh America is becoming like a banana republic or like a dictatorship or clip talk or see where\nThis family

use marijuana\nThan alcohol\nBy the way it doesn't mean that alcohol is a good idea for teenagers isn't it isn't and no don't somebody bringing up Brett Kavanaugh\nLook at it most parents understand that it's not great for kids had fourteen Fifteen sixteen to be using alcohol\nBut it's even worse for them to be using marijuana yes even in states where that might be legal by the way I don't think there are any of the legal marijuana states where it's legal for people under Eighteen\nOr is this is um the peace in the New York times when I'm Talking about his by a guy in Neal Pollack\nWho's a

heading I'm just a middle aged house dad addicted to pot\nAnd he writes about going to his first marijuana anonymous meeting in West Hollywood that it'd be\nAlmost a year ago it was friday night in the room was packed with addicts semi age with most younger struggling to recover life lost to weed\nAnd then he writes this and I think it's extraordinarily powerful\nI mean seriously powerful he says uh there's a reason that Alcoholics Anonymous started in Nineteen thirty five what's the reason that was two years after the end of\nProhibition alcohol abuse became rampant and the country almost rank itself off the rails well the same thing happened with marijuana now\nBy the way this is really important because it's historically true most people think oh you know prohibition was a gigantic failure people drank just as much under prohibition and then they ended prohibition and everything was happy this by the way it was a big Republican democratic issue was one of the first things that Franklin Roosevelt did when the Democrats came to power\nA was end the prohibition amendments to uh go ahead and repeal the prohibition men\nBut the truth of the matter is drinking did go up when prohibition went away it did go down when prohibition was imposed now was it worth it I'm not suggesting prohibition of alcohol I'm also not in the midst of fighting a war here to reimpose prohibition on marijuana in Washington state\nBut here's the message from Neal Pollack says marijuana is an alcohol or an opioid you cannot die from an overdose it doesn't really events physical cravings so is it better to call my problem marijuana dependence doesn't matter\nThe study could not tie alcohol to negative effects is among teenagers and by the way it is [laughter] it come this conforms\nTo my own recollections in experiences in college\nBecause what I'm Talking about okay if people were were teenagers in late teens\nAnd basically my freshman year in college pretty much everybody did beer that was the drug of choice and then all of a sudden boom it's ah Nineteen sixty six sixty seven and marijuana\nAnd there is no question that the cognitive impairment particularly things like short term memory loss and problem solving there were there were many people including one two three of the people that I ruined with where\nIt was it was a visible problem if you could see it immediately wasn't subtle\nAuthors examined four thousand students and the Montreal region over four years starting when the average participant was about Thirteen Years old the students took yearly memory tests and self reported their alcohol and marijuana use those reports were kept confidential\nBy the fourth year three quarters of the students and consume alcohol at least occasionally well only about thirty percent use marijuana regularly but this study observe more daily marijuana users and alcohol abusers the study found some of the marijuana is negative effects were lasting\nA particularly troubling finding young cannabis users may cause long term damage to a brain function associated with substance abuse\nWhen studying response inhibition that's an individual's ability to change their actions tell me the goal researchers found the teams using marijuana cause long term damage to their brains\nLet's go to John in Ventura, California Don you're on the Michael ...\nMichael

this particular kind of addiction done I appreciate your calling and I appreciate your perspective\nLook this is one of those things I mean there's some things that are really really difficult to

their phones right now and saying hey I've been smoking pot for years and years and I'm a sharp has ever\nOr out and let let other people not just that that it ... whenever whenever we do this and this issue on the air and it's an important issue because right now there's a very very big industry that's involved in trying to get people to think oh this is just harmless good fun\nThat I learned that I Want to share with everybody and it's a lesson about\nWhy some people are so indignant\nAbout fake news [noise]\nAnd that's not to say that I'm not in the ignorant about I'm indignant about this I just that we've had bias in the media for a long long time but sometimes it's particularly egregious and I'll give you an example\nI um had watched the news coverage early this morning about the ceremony last night which I had not seen in life\nAnd the ceremony last night was in the White House with a President Trump welcoming the whole Kavanaugh family the two daughters who are so proud of their dad and his wife Ashley\nThat's a judge Kavanaugh his wife Ashley and just all the judges justices or the spring court were there\nAnd\nWhat I heard about this event was oh it's too bad it was supposed to be such a nicer than ruined dead as he does because what he said was outrageous and he was so off the rails any ruins and never before any spoil that and that's disgusting and horrible\nAs you know what when you watch it that is simply not true\nAnd let me tell you one area where I honestly I think most of the coverage that I saw on NBC and very much on CNN was deliberately misleading they made it sound\nAs if a justice Kavanaugh spoke and spoke with dignity and then Trump spoke afterward and then ruined everything the justice but it wasn't like that because President Trump spoke first\nAnd he welcome people introduced every they all walked in together and then the president said thank you very much thank you members of Congress members of the cabinet honored gas and fellow Americans are my privilege to address you tonight from the East Room of the White House\nAnd then after a welcoming everybody he said joining us for tonight's ceremony as every sitting Supreme Court justice chief justice Roberts thank you Justice Thomas thank you Justice Ginsburg thank you Justice Breyer thank you Justice Alito thank you\nJustice Sotomayor thank you Justice Kagan thank you and justice Gorsuch now why in that order that's the order in which they were appointed to the court\nAnd\nThen he said this in setting up how his particular performance of his duty in helping to watch the swearing in of the justice either a appointed how this was going to be different\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude\nOn behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure [noise]\nThose who stepped forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation [noise] not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception [noise]\nWhat happened to the cabinet family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process is our country and man or woman flushed always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty [noise]\n\nOkay and then he goes on to make the most controversial declaration he made in this statement he goes on to say that\nThe justice or capital was proven innocent now okay he's not proven innocent but he was certainly judged\nInnocent by anybody who's reasonable enough to look at this and to look at the ... of evidence\nWas that anybody who was there at the time any of the name the witnesses agreed with him\nNot in saying that I Know this didn't happen button saying no I I don't remember this at all and I don't remember it at all like the way that\nChristine afford described it here's what President Trump said that you share\nThunder historic scrutiny were proven innocent thank you\n[noise]\nMargaret analyze your father was a great man here's a man of decency character kindness encourage who is devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens\nFrom the bench of our nation's highest court\nTheir father will defend the attorney\nReally is that is that fair do you think\nWhen President Trump's concluding his remarks said um\nIs that to us to read a ourselves to the traditions and wisdom of our founders and a desire to us to renew the bonds of love loyalty and affection that Lincoln altogether as one great American family\nOkay he acknowledged that it was unusual what he was doing\nBut I Do think that the process that victimized both Dr blessing forward and justice Kavanaugh that the process was unusual and not admirable\nLou and Cherry Hill New Jersey Lou you're on the Michael Mann that show [noise]\nSure Hi you're on\nBut yeah um I mean I I don't\nYou know when I look at what what he did he said he was completely um yup proven to be in a sense\nUm he didn't he didn't investigate all the people who work actual witnesses that we're likely witness at more information\nIt was not a thorough process so for him to go around and do that slap it in our face okay the the lawyer they voted in two thousand twelve for Obama didn't get Merrick Garland slap it in our face and say it's proven innocent didn't even have a really the only investigation and all the way when\nYou say when you say phony investigation what do you mean who who are the witnesses or that\nThere were several there were several witnesses that Ramirez woman\nBy I understand they decide they made a decision they made it up because that was not their job what they were asked to\nDo was to investigate Dr Ford and as far as Deborah Ramirez concern I mean come on\nCome on it's it's the idea but in other words what they didn't do the FBI and I think are right not to do it was go through a whole investigation of I'm Brett Kavanaugh is drinking habits when he was a freshman at Yale\nOr when he was a senior in high school\nWhy because it was irrelevant the question was if Deborah Ramirez has some magic witness that you could could uh from the fact which she even said by the way Deborah marriage she said I was too drunk to really remember this is what you saw it happen and it's a recovered memory and it was after the fact\nAnd this is pathetic what relevance does it have to his qualifications to be on the Supreme Court low\nSo my feeling is you were treated ten times better than Obama but and then Merrick Garland was\nOkay I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I guarantee you that Merrick Garland would prefer what happened with him which was great respect no one spoke harshly about and no one's smearing him no one came up with things about his high school days or college days\nAnd probably because there is nothing but he did not get a hearing that doesn't mean you're treated horribly we'll be right back\nHe but
