I'm ... I'm a nationalist too I I Am and I I don't understand why people should have a problem with that word if you want to try to answer that question you can one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nLook I Am I just finished my\nVery [laughter] lengthy too lengthy I'm afraid chapter on Theodore Roosevelt and Theodore Roosevelt is regularly rated as one of the greatest of all American presidents he's on Mount Rushmore when he ran for president in Nineteen twelve\nHe called his program the new nationalism\nAnd uh that was and then and then ... Woodrow Wilson who was running against him was so a compelled at Theodore Roosevelt campaigning on this idea of a new nationalism that he came up with his own program called the new freedom\nIn any event there is nothing wrong with the term nationalism is there but if you look at the dictionary or you just Google it or anything it look it up what are the synonym for nationalism here the first three sentence\nPatriotism patriotic feeling and flag waving okay\nIs there something wrong with that I I Am not\nEntirely comfortable with President Trump using the term global as derisive way I don't know anyone I honestly do not know anyone who describes himself or herself as a globalized\nUm and at a a ... and ... and that's a word that's problematic that that's but that's not what people are freaking out about\nWhat people are freaking out of that as President Trump saying he's a nationalist for instance here is Don Lemon reacting almost in real time just moments after President Trump dropped the N. word Don Lemon on CNN [noise]\nI'm a nationalist\nUse that word we're going to talk about that word tonight it is a favorite of All right and is loaded with native is a racial undertones and global as well global is\nOf sorts sometimes even against those and the administration often with anti Semitic overtone\nWhat just happened to make the president come right out and embrace national as\nOkay what is the problem with nationalism\nA a nationalist or nationalism and this is a again common definition a\nPersonal advocates Political Independence for a country patriotic feeling principles are efforts an extreme form of this especially marked by a feeling of superiority over other countries\nAnd then a patriot her patriotism that's listed as a person who vigorously sports their country and is prepared to defend it against enemies are detractors vigorous support for one's country in other words that's why patriot patriotism is listed as a synonym for nationalism\nAnd um\n[noise] do I think this is may be part of a political strategy for him to help a push the Republicans over the line and hold the house of representatives and some of these furious house races\nI kind of think Trump just set it but maybe it is maybe it is and I'll tell you why because for ordinary Americans I I mean basically the\nPeople who live in this country and yes that includes those all important suburban women you hear that the president said I'm a nationalist ... what is so terrible about that\nAnd uh the chrysalis are rights on his face Trump seemed to be simply saying that well past presidents and politicians cared a lot about other countries and what other countries thought about the United states that he cares primarily about us and what is good for us\nThe problem of course is that words matter and the American president referring to himself as a national says all sorts of problems wrapped up in it\nLet's start with what nationalism means\nHere's the definition that he found and it says quote a sense of national consciousness exalted one nation above all others and placing primary emphasis on the promotion of its culture and interests as opposed to those of other nations or super national groups\nProblem there\nBut we do not elect a president of the United states to be a citizen of the world or a public servant for the world we do not we elect a president to represent the United states\nAnd to defend our country and to defend our constitution and yes to defend our culture and there is such a thing as American culture now the term white nationalist\nOr if I dare say so the term black nationalist which is also Jim ... that's a problem let me tell you why it's a problem because what that suggests is that your real nation as something other than the United states\nThe United states obviously has nationalist about America patriots who serve our country who fight for our country who worked for our country\nOf every racial religious\nAnd or ethnic background it it it does and the idea that there is something racist about saying I Am a nationalist America specifically and from the beginning has always been a nation\nThat has not define our nationalism or our nationality based upon race or blood or where you were born\nI mean going all the way back to before the revolution the idea was you could become an American by choice by picking yourself up and moving here and embracing the American idea\nAnd we've always had that we've always had that\nAnd you know we have we talked on this show many times and and it is true it is documented nobody argues against this close to ten percent and maybe over ten percent of the continental army that fought with George Washington for our liberty\nWhere people of color they were black people mostly former slaves because that's why they were here and the idea of this but the French there actually recorded descriptions of when the French arrived to work with the Americans at Yorktown\nOne of the reasons they look down on the American army was not only not speak the uniforms and the French were about nothing if not if uniforms\nBut because there were so many people of different complex and in that arming one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nDo you have a problem with nationalism\nSaid not that no and we have to come together and fight it and\nThat's why this rhetoric about jobs not moms and that's also why the rhetoric about nationalism it seems to me\nI don't think there are many conservatives who are troubled by the idea of being a nationalist and let me explain to there's a new book about nationalism by an Israeli writer named ... zoning\nAnd it's it's worth considering because one of the points he makes is that nationalism goes pretty directly\nWith the idea of democracy because if you're talking about a nation state is your real tried\nThat and the ideas and that's been very much the way it is in America is what patriotism means is that I find myself as an American\nAnd going back to Theodore Roosevelt again in the new nationalism the whole idea was if you are an immigrant you drop the idea of carrying the flag of your former country you carry the American flag and your nationalism your tribal affiliation which you care about when we even give your heart to is our nation\nNot a race not an ethnicity and the fact that that\nThere are so many people out there and the commentary and so many Democrats who don't get that who are offended by the term nationalism I honestly don't think that's helping the Democratic side\nI think of anything it helps on the conservative and Republican side by the way if you're one of those people just offended by the word nationalism give me a call and tell me why\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six uh Michael in San Diego you're on the Michael Mann that show\nLike I I'm a I think that America is neither a a a country founded on nationalism nor international is globalism\nAnd how can you say that we weren't hounded on nationalism\nWe weren't found it on an individual is nationalism\nOr no no I'm Sorry we weren't we were founded by a lot of people who came together to a risk their lives and in many cases to give their lives at twenty five thousand people who signed the revolution give their lives for the cause of the ... a nation not not a school board a nation stay with\nMe if I Want to let you answer back a will continue much wrong with nationalism honestly I think it's a beautiful thing and needed in this

anyone listening to us right now in one of those thirty eight states and you probably are us don't wait sending your ballot get it done that way you make sure you're making a contribution\nTo this important national decision the consensus seems to be on the part of everybody who's looking at this John Fund is that the momentum seemed to turn around in a Republican direction after the Kavanaugh hearings you agree with that\nWell I think a lot of people had baked and the cake any negative attitudes they had the President Trump\nAnd I think that Trump's antics as a personality that depressed part of the Republican base\nBut the Kavanaugh hearings brought out the ugliness of the left their complete disregard for normal procedures and rules and the rule of law and I think that\nAt best that show the Democrats to be the equal of Trump in a violating norms and politics and a word almost extra constitutional so I think that Tom managed to succeed where nobody else ever thought he would he managed to get the Democrats to\nDrop their own to block to re surprise on their feet to blow up in their face\nAnd yeah it's it does it does seem like that and I know there are a bunch of people like

politics Michael you and I are into politics\nThe average voter doesn't pay attention to much closer to the election so when they actually look at the issues the ... center right country and if the Republicans frame the issues property they tend to close the gap in the last two weeks unless there's some extraneous event like the truth of the financial meltdown\nOkay two two issues which are very

that old and a black face hasn't been okay for a long time I really and people know that it was a stupid thing to say\nEspecially given her history and this is unfortunately what happens with this

conference this morning she is already apologized\nUm one uh\nOne source at NBC says many seasoned journalists felt main Kelly's comments or an insult to the profession okay what happened is she is already apologized and do we have the text of the apology somewhere here I'm\nIn any event she regrets it deeply and I think we can go on from that\nParticular harm to um to more\nControversy and uh and and there's this um [noise] there's\nA great deal of controversy about Stacey Abrams who is a candidate for governor she's the Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia and she's running as Brian Kemp who is the Republican as the states ... states Stacey Abrams a state senator and a\n... here here's the problem is a two fold problem one\nOf the items that seems to me is more of a problem than the other\nAnd ah the one that's getting all the attention today is a CNN is reporting democratic candidate to be George next governor explained her presence Tuesday at a Nineteen Ninety to protest that included burning the state\nFlag she said that was part of her opposition to Confederate symbolism her a involving came to light on social media and\nTo CNN Abrams campaign said that the actions in college were part of a permitted peaceful protest against the Confederate emblem in the flag as part of Georgia State flag\nAt the time of the protest in Nineteen Ninety to the states ... states flag contain the Confederate battle flag emblem which had been a prominent feature state flag since it was adopted Nineteen fifty six when the battle over the segregation was raging in the south\nOr the Confederate battle flag emblem wasn't fully recover removed from the states flag until two thousand three\nAnd then the statements and the uh Stacey Abrams campaign says during Stacey Abrams college years Georgia was at a cross\nOvercome racially divisive issues including symbols of the confederacy the sharpest of which was the inclusion of the Confederate emblem in the Georgia State flag\nThen it uh goes on to say a crunch time in public service as deputy city attorney in a state legislative leader of all been focused on bringing people together to solve problems\nOr educate the fact that back in Nineteen Ninety two she participated in a demonstration against the state flag\nThat's not a problem it seems to me and shouldn't be a big problem in our campaign it's a long time ago and the flag was changed anyway she's not burning contemporary Georgia flag I'll tell you what is a problem\nShe has gone on record and she is standing by in about basically blowing up the largest Confederate monument of them all\nAnd this is one that I've spoken about this before on this whole issue of Confederate monuments\nI I Can't understand why you would decide not to blow anything up but to move a statue for instance the best example is in New Orleans\nThey had a statue of Robert easily on top of a pillar and it really looked over the whole city and it was sort of like the Nelson's statue on top of a pillar into fog or square in Great Britain in London\nAnd having Robert de Leon such a prominent place looking over the whole city I get a problem\nDon't blow it up but they and I don't know what they're putting on top of that pillar of anything made it took the whole pillar down they move all the statue okay\nBut when you're talking about Stone Mountain I actually looked it up the Stone Mountain memorials bigger than Mount Rushmore and its carved into the side of a mountain the took about Thirty years to do all the carving it was a very very big undertaking\nAnd in the side of the mountain is an image of Jefferson\nDavis president of the confederacy Robert The league commander of the army of northern Virginia and his chief lieutenant Thomas Jonathan Jackson's Stonewall Jackson and they're all riding along\nAnd Stacey Abrams is taken the position that that monument has to be removed and crashed and honestly I don't understand it\nThere are lots of African Americans in the state of Georgia so mountain by the way it's over three thousand acres of beautiful beautiful park\nAnd it is owned I'm pretty sure by the city of Atlanta is three thousand acres and their trails they used to have a whole neo Confederate theme park is the New York times points out where they had a plantation house that's all gone\nIf they put up appropriate signage that looks at the side of this mountain as a historical symbol wouldn't that be a better way to go than simply sand blasting it for ruining it are knocking it down and because of the size of Stone Mountain\nHe put in mind that the Taliban remember them they blew up these Buddhas because they took over the Buddhist were over twelve hundred years old and they blew them up in the ... valley\nAnd uh basically that was a that was before September eleventh\n[noise] and I went on the air and I talked about it and I said this was an act of terrorism against the past and\nLook I understand that you can move a statue but the notion that you have to blow up a whole mountainside\nIt's it's a little bit nutty in uh the New York times\nThey point out that the David Huckabee who is a Georgia syndicated columnist no relation to the White House press secretary\nAssailed Missouri rivers position writing that she intends to run the most racist and divisive campaign history of Georgia politics\nRemoving such symbols won't keep one black father at home with his family won't take a single illegal weapon off of a single street in a single black neighborhood\nAnd a ... ... ... look I I understand\nThat the whole history behind the Stone Mountain monument\nIs a a a it is a terrible thing because they started putting it up started plans for Nineteen fourteen\nAnd it was associated with the rise of the clan all of which of course was presided over with great approval by a southerner Democratic president Woodrow Wilson and yes Woodrow Wilson was a ... Virginia I Know he was governor of New Jersey before\nBut uh the idea that you have to blow up that memorial ... why would Democrats want to be the real Taliban of American politics I don't get it one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number ... we'll be right back\nThat ah these are people who fought against the United states\nAnd in context of this entire monument was put up\nWith a at a time when white supremacy and neo Confederate apologetic were held to be the case but we're very different place in our country right now\nBut to literally blast away the three acres the image of Jackson Lee Ann Davis covers three acres on the face of this mountain\nAnd the idea of just blasting it up it it seems to me that a ... a number of black leaders in Atlanta\nWho do believe that that it's a new sleep polarizing and pointless to insist on blowing up a a beautiful city park let's go to John in Kansas City John you're on the Michael ... show hey\nYou know my garden on well you're very good over it and I listen to listen to your eggs in the bucket again okay maybe inside their heritage you\nKnow no I never I never say that this is their heritage I never say that because the heritage of treason should be rejected\nAll right okay okay but you're in the outfits you find it so beautiful historical and all that I Would you feel if there was a Stone Mountain of Adolf Eichmann I'm Rick killer and all that they don't they lost the war to they were fighting for their country that their character\nBut again and again I I I Would I Do not use the argument of heritage I that's not the point the point is if there was if there is an artwork and piece of art is carved into a mountain that can't be moved because you cannot move aid three acres culture that it took Thirty years to make\nYou only blow it up or if there's something like that it's different from moving a statue and again I Do not believe that they're at I think it's important to preserve for instance I don't think that outfits should be blown up\nI think it's important that it be preserved date is part of the record of history\nAnd they didn't have any statues and outfits but if they have them there that should be preserved is part of the historical record as well and given the fact that ah they've taken out some of the they used to have a plantation house\nAt a Stone Mountain I think they still have a place I was there recently they still have a place called Confederate house but Confederate house doesn't have anything inside it any more they just have T shirts say Stone Mountain\nAnd or should it have anything inside it's a vet so people Viet Confederate souvenirs no of course not because you're right this is a dark chapter of American history is not one to be celebrated\nBut that doesn't mean it seems to me following the Taliban example of blowing up monuments from a different era we will be right back on the ... that show\nRight here on AM eight Seventy
