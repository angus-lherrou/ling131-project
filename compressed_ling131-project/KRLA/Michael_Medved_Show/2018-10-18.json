thought he was going to differ with me and he didn't mention it folks please for the good of the show\nOne politician who gives you a different point of view\nWho says hey guess what we've got some problems that politics alone can fix\nIs the junior senator from Nebraska who I think has become by a large margin of advantage\nOf one of the most indispensable voices in the United States Senate his name is Ben Sasse a senator Sasse it's great to speak to\nMichael thank you for the ... and you're right about those words if I said anything like that a my BS meter would go off I wouldn't be able to protect you can save the world by politics but my wife would just walk me upside the head\nOkay and this is not to say that politics is unimportant in your new book which is hosted up at our website the book is called them\nWhy we hate each other and how to heal and it's already a best seller and it should be because of very important book but one of the points that you make again and again and again is politics didn't get us into this mess\nAnd politics isn't going to get us out what do you mean by that\nSo I'm sure we're gonna talk something today about politics and what does matter so I don't want to mislead and have your audience and saying that it doesn't it surely does\nBut what we're going through right now even in the chaos and our politics really didn't originate in our politics I think we need to know kind of where we are an economic and cultural history and we're going through a digital revolution which is awesome and lots of ways\nWe're going to produce more total goods and services around the world has ever known and all of human history partly because of the digital revolution but one of the things that it does is it enables humans to think that we can be ruthless at exactly the same time that we have lots of social science weather turnout confirming what people have\nKnown for millennia a through philosophy and be allergy which has been rooted makes you happy do you have a family\nThat you have a few deep friendships do you have meaningful work do you have shared vocation do you have some projects with co workers and your community the local ... community if you have those things you tend to be happy\nThat's about rooted nuts and yet our technology of letting us be ruthless and we haven't figured out the habits for this digital age this this ruthless age and so traditional tribes good tribes family friends workplace et cetera\nNearing collapse and so we're trying to find meaning brand good and evil meaning of politics and it's not going to work\nAnd and this is I think an important point that I can of emphatically agree with is that part of what has happened here with a Americans believing that you're either all on our side or you're on the other side and the other side as pure evil and our side as pure good\nThat kind of political talked flows from the fact that people don't have more what used to be called normal uh relationships and support systems and so they look to politics I was thinking\nI did you follow the story senator I'm sure you did a of New York in Portland, Oregon there were fights in the streets between Proud Boys and antifa\nAnd and the two groups of of dogs who seem to get great pleasure about actually being violent with one another they follow that story\nI heard little bits and pieces of it but it's just so weird [noise]\nWell it it seems weird because again the question is what are you going to accomplish how does it make life better if you beat up some uh if you're from antifa new beat up somebody from Proud Boys or if you're from ... and he beat up somebody from antifa\nHow does how does that help anybody it's kind of like the jets and the sharks except those gangs are kind of lovable\nRight exactly and they could sing uh it it turns out that you know if you if you beat down people who disagree with you about politics you don't necessarily accomplish anything that's lasting by doing that but the great cricket a takedown it's good to just sort of\nA pontificate in front of an audience of people who already agree with you but you don't persuade anybody by and so when people use all these worn metaphors for politics I think it's sort of miss understands what we think of the American tradition politics are supposed to do\nPolitics may paint a framework for ordered liberty so that the really interesting communities can thrive and flourish the things that matter are the communities of love and your neighborhood where you persuade\nPeople to join with yet in a project and there's a lot broken in our politics politics isn't serving those local community as well\nBut a lot of the political chaos and discord we face really is downstream I think from the collapse of these more natural tribes of affection and community and you know your your point about um about the loneliness a lion you use there are half\nAs many friends in America\nAre in the last twenty seven years what does that mean social science data showed that in Nineteen Ninety the average American had about three point two friends the average American today has about one point eight friends half as many forty percent of Americans have either zero or only one ... into all there was a loneliness like out there\nAnd a whole bunch of people go to politics say at least I can figure out how to have a um an enemy with somebody else and that will make me feel like I'm On a team but it doesn't really work\nWe're speaking with Senator Ben Sasse a senator a Republican conservative Republican from Nebraska\nHis a book a new book is called them why we hate each other and how to heal\nUm let me try to make a case and you can ... down if you choose a ... that part of the healing process has to be making sure Republicans when the house of representatives this time I think we're going to hold the Senate\nOr where you work but we need to hold the house of representatives and the reason that I Would put that in terms of healing\nIs the Democrats have already announced that if they take over the house they're going to be pushing the impeachment of justice Kevin all they're going to be pushing the impeachment of President Trump\nThat we're going to have investigations and politics of destruction and this incredible hateful bitterness that we all saw during the Kavanaugh hearings\nThat's going to go on and on and on so the only way to prevent that is to make sure that you don't hand over the house of representatives to these ... mean spirited hostile and very destructive votes\nYes so let me uh overwhelmingly agree and then also offer one tweak so the the overwhelming agreement is I'm I'm Out there raising money for Republican candidates I'm I'm writing checks I'm campaign and what people are so I absolutely won the Republican I'm One of them not just\nAh expend extend our majority of the fact that I Want the Republicans do to win and the house\nUm but at the ... fell to say I'm the second or third most conservative voter out of a hundred in the U.S so that so if you look at anybody score card on\nOn the most conservative senator I'm always on the top half dozen of everybody's scorecard so I'm not in different uh on political matters and this is not an argument hey let's just all thing could buy off and how much your mental there's really nobody more conservative than I Am but\nI think we need to recognize that because the Democrats in the house might do something incredibly stupid and tried to impeach everybody under the sun or if they take the house\nStopping that from happening is not actually the same thing as healing it's just stopping a further slide into this political tribalism I think that the healing that's going to satisfy people is\nIn a world where job duration is getting shorter and shorter and by the way economically that's pretty great we're producing more and more a smart humans with brains are figuring out ways to produce more goods and services are more cost effective way that anybody has in the past that's great but it means average duration that uh from I was born in Nineteen Seventy two\nAverage tuition at a farm in the seventies was about two and a half decades for a primary breadwinner today it's four point two years and getting shorter\nOne of the things that means is you don't have relationships with your co workers that last over the course of a lifetime and nails in particular aren't actually good at forming new relationships after about twenty five to Thirty years old and so we've got a lot more loneliness and the country\nPolitics can fix that problem rebuilding your neighborhood is what we have to do to fix that problem and this book is about fifty percent constructive about what do I do to rebuild in my neighborhood like how do I joined with\nA local civic organizations that made them more likely to know the person lives two doors away from me because that's actually highly correlated with being happy\nAnd and that's one of the big focuses in them or the new book by Senator Ben Sasse it's post on our website at Michael midday dot com or a senator you you're also a very outspoken very deeply committed Christian man of faith\nAnd you do talk about a ... the need really for people to go to the center of communal affiliation which traditionally has been congregations here in this country\nWhat's gone wrong with the church do you think and with with synagogues or have that that has caused this sort of this affiliation particularly among young people\nWell said so I think there are two or three different things happening at the same time\nI'm In the same way that deep friendship and sick um nuclear families and shared work\nAre heavily connected to place worshipping communities are as well\nThat we we know the literature now what makes people happy do you have a family do you have a few friends do you think your work is meaningful and do you have a philosophical or feel logical framework to make sense of depth are suffering that drives happiness but one of the other things that happens in your local worshipping community is you're with people in an intergenerational context over time\nAnd it turns out that I've got two teenage daughters and then the younger side as well but teenagers live the most generationally segregated lives that anybody has ever lived in human history\nThey really think the accident of birth year defines almost all the people they should associate with\nHow how do we fix it I Want to get to that was Senator Ben Sasse his new book is damn why we hate each other and how they feel there's so much in this book about where we can go not just in politics and force but in our personal and economic lives will be right back with Senator Ben Sasse\nI really do think there is a desperation for some of our political addicts and Washington to try to act like blood sport politics\nOr forever more is what they want what they don't really love their neighbor they don't really care about your listeners kids and grandkids because they're not trying to solve a long term problems they're trying to make all the ... center of the gladiatorial fight and that's not going to work in a republic\nYeah I mean somehow World Wrestling entertainment is not what you want for uplift of of your kids or for the American future a speaking speaking of which is one of the things that last night I I I gave a talk or to a neighborhood group bleed and had a couple of hundred people there was great\nBut there's this general sense that our politics is broken and I found myself ... when does to you today on talking a little bit of a would I be wrong to say that the Nebraska Legislature which is non partisan and you and a camera on there's only one house and the legislature\nAnd the things work a little bit better in your state than they do and many others\nThey do a ... there's less sense of printing constantly for the cameras and even though my status you know one of the four or five most conservative states in the union and that's one of the reason we buy as one of the most conservative or rather than the United states elected from here\nEven though we're a very conservative place probably two to one Republican in the legislature people did not officially ... really parties and argue that camera or one one house a state legislature and so what people are mostly doing is wrestling with Walker term pragmatic question how do you get a good infrastructure and\nI weigh and bridges bell that's cost effective uh they're less certainty that you're going to find the line between good and evil\nOf for people who might have slightly different priorities of which bridge in which highway to find it's a much healthier thing to do bridges and roads by politics\nInstead of trying to do a good and evil heaven and hell by politics if the federal politics do what they should American constitutional cook them wickets maintain a framework for ordered liberty appropriate idea that people are created with dignity the image of God and they have rights by nature and government is our shirt project to secure those rights\nGovernment ... the author sorts of right then government could do a small number of big thing\nOut we need to build the fibers strategy for the digital age et cetera but then most of what's meaningful can happen back in communities where people actually live next door to their neighbors\nWhat ... what a concept change from the bottom up not the top down that's part of the theme of them why we hate each other and how to heal\nIt's the new bestseller by Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska all I can say is keep it up senator we need you there in Washington

uh oh my goodness the tax cuts and created this soaring federal deficit we do have a deficit is going up at too much and going up dangerously\nAnd President Trump addressed that yesterday's asked every federal department to do\nI ... percent cut which should go a long way to at least slowing the growth and the deficit but one of the things you hear is a line which is that because the tax cuts the government is taking in less money than the tax cuts of a lead to less revenue actually revenue went up\nRevenue when I'm not much but it was already high but revenue went out of the most recent since the tax cuts of of come in by zero point four percent increase\nIt's not a reduction how do I know this it's in the New York times okay it's in the New York times in their official government numbers check it out tax cuts do work go to tax cuts work dot com right now send a message to your members of Congress\nTo preserve and protect the tax cuts and or not to kill prosperity\nIt now turns out that uh if you look at the number of birds that have an outside marriage [noise]\nIn the United states we are beyond forty percent\nAnd were perhaps approaching a day\nOr the statisticians say\nNot so long from now where the majority of children will be born uh in to unwed families now there are a couple of reasons why this situation is dire\nAnd they're in a couple of other reasons why it may not be quite as dire as we would suppose\nBut let me first I give you some of the background or that is put together through a new report from yup you've got to the United nations the United nothing and it also puts America's problems in the context of the rest of the world if you believe it's no problem at all\nThat we have almost half of the children born in the United states born into a non married couple or you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number\nAnd the story from Bloomberg an increasing number of birds happen outside of marriage signaling culture signaling cultural and economic shifts that are here to stay according to a major new report from the United nations\nForty percent of all births in the U.S now occur outside of wedlock\nThat is up from ten percent in Nineteen Seventy would that means to put it in context\nIs that in in less than fifty years the rate of out of wedlock birth has grown up four hundred percent\nWhy would that be\nThis a report was issued by un FDA that as the United nations population fund it's the largest international provider of sexual and reproductive health services says\nThe number is even higher in the European Union and the European Union already sixty percent of birds occur outside of marriage\nThe eat eat you report says likely sees more birds out of wedlock because many member countries have welfare systems that support gender balanced childcare\nSo said the senior advisor in economics for the un FDA his name is Michael heroin and in an interview\nHe said a public health care systems paid paternal leave early education programs in tax incentives give on where parents support beyond what a partner can provide\n\nAnd is he saying from the un this is a good thing in Europe that you have sixty percent of kids born out of wedlock\n\nThat a good thing you think developmentally the government can do a better job than parents\nOr even the government can do a better job than some parents by providing these services one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise] look the problems with a single parent families\nAre fairly obvious but one of the things worth noting here with these numbers the reason that than I Am indicating to you that that forty percent number born out of wedlock\nThe maybe a bit overstated at least in terms of meaningful consequences is because that includes couples who are actually living together but have decided for whatever reason not to get married\nAnd it is unclear what percentage of people who have a baby outside of marriage then follow that up by getting married it's not a small numbers at least twenty five percent\nAt least one out of four people were a baby is born to a couple of outside of marriage ended up getting married and particularly if they do that while the child is very young and has no recollection of and it it can provide some of the same benefits of marriage by the way what are the benefits of marriage\nWas one of those things if you've spent any time at all in your life around the baby you understand\nImmediately it's an extra pair of hands to an extra pair of eyes it's a extra love that can be provided to the child and if you have one person who was also going to be responsible for trying to provide an income\nWell what happens to the child or two children\nAnd this is not to blame the single mothers it's not to say that single mothers are terrible people or that because obviously there are wonderful wonderful results that do occur sometimes was single mothers but it's very\nVery difficult and single fathers same thing it can happen that that things will work out beautifully but the idea that this should be putting up as an ideal or isn't acceptable ideal\nI think it's very destructive and if you take a look at the vastly greater likelihood of being involved in poverty criminality\nSelf destructive activities like opioid abuse every risk for bad outcomes with the child is increased by a child who was raised in a single parent household\n\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and somebody can say well what about gay marriage why uh what's what's been the impact there the fact is that gay marriage his remains so rare in the United states such a small percentage of the population one of the stunning things in this sort of the Census Bureau\nOf the marriages that have taken place in this country since ... decision that basically authorize gay marriage for every state in the union\nLess than one percent have been same sex couples yeah it's a shockingly low number\nAnd that's shockingly low because a lot of people it assumed though there will be pent up demand there will be all these couples have been waiting to get

percent\nOf all the marriages actually were marriages between a same sex couple\n\nThe data shows such births in the U.S and in the e or predominantly to unmarried couples who are living together rather than to single mothers the report says\nThe data suggests that societal and religious norms about marriage childbearing and women in the workforce of changed said Kelly Jones the director for the center on the economics of reproductive health\nAt the Institute for women's policy research is it a good thing is they've changed I I I don't believe that it is in other words it was it fairly common in American Life to have what were called shots done weddings where a couple\nActually concedes the baby before they're married not recommended but they do but then there's social pressure for them to get married so the baby is welcomed into a married home\nOf course that's more desirable and and by getting married you are making a commitment to that child into each other\n\nJust someone down the idea that in most cases then of course I understand there are exceptions there are some times spouses who are abusive and self destructive and terrible and that can be a terrible situation for a child but in most\nCases it's better for a child to deal with both a loving mother and a loving father let's go to your calls to Andrea in Columbus ohio and ray you're on the map that show\nThanks for taking my call you back on 'em for me um I have a wonderful thing and um\nI I think that parents have to be mentally credits and they have to be physically present they have to be mentally president and whether you're a single parent or whether you're fortunate enough to have a child\nUm you have to be there for them and and unfortunately when it's just one person that half he'll carry the burden of thing they're physically and emotionally and spiritually um you can't do it all\nI guess especially if you're earning a living and allegedly and look at its it's very difficult and this was not to say the preschool is important and doesn't represent an important alternative it's just that\n... you see if we have in this country such a a an inclination to not make value judgments\nIs that leads us to be blind to the fact that it is more desirable for each child to come into the world in a married household if we can establish that and agree on that then\nUh we have lost the whole idea of constructive social norms one of the construct of social norms that is worth\nMaintaining it seems to me is not applauding open racism or open anti Semitism or open racial or religious hatred of any kind so why are Democrats still applauding and open hater we will get to that question to coming up on them and that you [noise]\nThat often a parent would die and the child would or maybe you have to wait what their grandma parents or relatives or other relatives show I think this could be gone successfully as long as we are open minded to capture these tranche\nWhat does that mean I Know it sounds good and adapting to trends are it sounds very open minded and terrific [noise] what does it mean\nI wouldn't say that we need government programs horse\nThat would help that would a specific group the terror alert to kids living in a single parents situation\nOkay what kind of programs are you thinking of you want the government to send babysitters you want to establish government day care centers\nI think the ... would be one way I think men are where are you do you pay people who are professionals to go in and spend time with these ... these children and help them out\nOkay let me just mention something to you Bob I I understand that sounds very generous and very nice\nBut you know what they're sometimes families who are married to each other who are raising children sometimes multiple children\nAnd their financially press is it fair that people like that who are having a tough time financially with their own kids at home should have a bigger chunk taken out of their income to provide for other people who may be struggling with only one parent\nI I Know you're going to hate the fish but ah\nI I I'm going to push\nWere cut their parents parenting because it's just\nIt's just not necessary and we should also leash characters on the rich\nOK well of course when he said I'm going to hate this I'm a shout you down but the idea that cutting defense spending is going to be an answer right now we are spending more on interest on the national debt\nThan we are on defense and in my opinion I think the ended opinion in most Americans the defense spending that we spend is the best investment we could possibly make\nAnd some of the very ambitious social programs are the worst one of the things that has happened in this country and

it was literally several times in our disrupted the Kavanaugh hearings who flooded congressional offices one of the hallmarks of the Tea Party and I saw when my own eyes\nThese are people who clean up after themselves they wouldn't have giant rallies and a giant march on Washington one that was run by Glenn Beck I think that two hundred thousand people there that a ton of people\nAnd they made a

I'm Sorry sir they are\nFrom the church it started from the church fathers\nOkay it it did not start from the church fathers it started long before that if you read about the book investor which dramatizes events in the ... century bc of there was a very classic anti Semitism by Hayman who wanted to wipe out all the Jews\nAnd the notion that this is all about religion would not explained the fact that very secular Jews\nHave also been targeted by anti Semitism ... leaving the Jewish religion\nAnd taking the Jewish religion very ... seriously or did not protect people at all from the Holocaust or from the ravages of plastic anti Semitism or to say it's anti Judaism I'm also would ignore the fact\nThat I um I I people who have converted to Judaism by the way of sometimes been punished by death what's happened in Poland to count a lot of them are are not blood Americans from your Pataki ski but that's another story in the uh [noise] Eighteen century\nWe will see ... disagreements about the ... his last column was just published we'll get to that someone else [noise]\nIs not great uh I think people get very dependent on alcohol I was reading a they have a thing in the New York times I have a advice column called sugars and somebody was writing in and asking for advice\nAs saying what should we do our children are are talking to my wife and myself children are nine and seven and they say hey mommy and daddy you drink too much\nAnd he said one of our kids set of the the other day when my wife was having a second bloody Marriott month at lunch\nOkay and of course in the answer to them they never said you know maybe you do drink too much I mean it's and it turns out that they have a family history of alcoholism they got to be careful but the ideas look life life has all kinds of challenges\nAnd sometimes it does make sense whether it's with marijuana or with booze certainly with opioids or any other kind of prescription drugs anything\nDon't make things more difficult for yourself then is absolutely necessary let's go to a Lauren in Houston you're on the Michael ... shows disagreement day\nHi Michael I'm my ... today is that we should be hoping are Saudi Arabia why\nBecause it's carrying on hundreds of thousands of Yemeni people and bad and it's not a good influence for the United states towards other country in\n'em and because you already jeopardizing my eyes and bomb okay what what what I think what we were really just taking are and we're in an art leadership position in front of other ...\nOkay Lauren and Lauren what do you think would happen if a President Trump all of a sudden it's announced okay okay uh we're canceling this arms deal with Saudi Arabia where they're buying a hundred billion dollars worth of our arms that we make here what what what happened do you think they would get their arms from somewhere else\nThat's for sure\nAbsolutely they would they would probably get them from China or Russia and a ... again what have we accomplished ...
