I Know that yet finished let's finish the things that ... really interesting okay because what they basically want is they want a mathematical equation to explain where our universe come from if our universe can be shown to be a reasonably probable outcome of what they called the corn and have a question or the quite ... corn way function\nThen they think they will have explained the universe but one of the more astute proponents of\nQuantum cosmology Alexander ... said well wait a minute math\nWere were saying that math is basically producing material universe but he says math is something that exists in mind or we therefore saying that all the material universe there's actually a mind\nAnd that's not a very congenial a conclusion because there's basically a materialistic Lee inspired cosmology the other thing that's really strange is that in order to solve the equation that gives you a universal wave function which our universe might be a reasonably probable outcome\nThe the the a theoretical physicist has to impose were called boundary constraints on the degrees of mathematical freedom of this equation which is actually in hurting information into the math\nTo get the outcome they want so they're actually modeling the need an unexplained infusion of information to get the universe so even if they get mad or out of math you you still can't get the information needed to produce the universe anyway you're kicking around a man in the beginning was the word\nSo go on on the big bang yeah yeah so there's there's a number of these materialistic cosmology that are trying to circumvent\nThe clear an obvious implication of the big bang which is that the universe the material universe physical universe had a definite beginning in time space matter and energy hocking in ten rows approve this with something called the singularity there I'm In the late sixties there's been an additional proof of this called the board goose the Lincoln tear him\nAnd the citizens and cosmologists have been going crazy trying to stretch tried to find a way to circumvent this conclusion hawking himself worked on circumventing his own proof\nHe was the originator of this cosmological idea that crosses popularized\nBut it doesn't really work for the reasons I specified and then there's another version of this where they want a it's called the inflationary cosmology were have one big bang after another big bang after another big bank it was mainly designed to circumvent the problem of the fine tuning of the universe but what what is the odd a irony\nOf that whole effort is that the mechanism by which you would get the multiple big bangs itself has to be exquisitely fine tuned to tend to die\nAnyway there's no evidence for and there's no evidence these are entirely speculative cosmological models asked that in the multi verse are far greater leaps of faith than we do believe in God\nI gave a talk on this the other night here in Southern California and I remember the thing from Alice in wonderland says six impossible things before breakfast yeah well the the the the these natural cosmology force you to posit multiple uh abstract explanatory entities\n... ton fields ... shut up energy strings multi dimensions of space to explain the the ... one God would explain\nWhat's on energy for\nThe dentist Springer show live from the relief factor pain free studio\nDennis Prager here for ... at American federal rare coin and bullying for years I've been recommending precious metal dealers\nBut I wasn't sure where to turn when I wanted to make a change to my own portfolio strategy so I reached out to my good friend Michael ... he's been personally working with Nick ... at American federal for\nYears and I couldn't be happier with Michael's recommendation I was able to speak and work directly with American federals owner ... I'm delighted to say that Mick will never pressure you into buying high commission coins or gold but you don't need if you have an existing portfolio and make will personally evaluate your holdings before\nHe makes any recommendations mix specialties is converting them performing coin\nPortfolios into gold silver or plot ... whether you're buying or selling microwave I recommended that you talked to mix first eight hundred two to one Seventy six Ninety four that's eight hundred two to one Seventy six million before\nThat's American federal dot com American federal dot com\nLoads and get the supplies you need to repress your home in time for holiday gas welcome family or friends\nThere's also more talk of trees and in a Senate race [noise]\nA a would be the United states senator Democrat of course\nI did say and it's on radio and his on\nTape and you can hear it she did say that it was fine she had no problem with people going over to Afghanistan and fighting with the Taliban\nThat is against people like the opponents of this particular would be senator we'll talk about that race will talk about another race where a democratic campaign to re elected US Senator has just about collapsed and with it perhaps\nThe Fort Lauren hopes of the Democrats to capture the U.S Senate and meanwhile the house races very very much\nUp for grabs and are there is every attempt to try to use everything at hand right now this is like a bar fight and that's what happens in the last couple of weeks of the campaign that's what people talk about October surprises\nA because people will grab hold of anything of a bottle or its share or a ... anything that you can find an ashtray and you throw it near her let me see what hurts and you see what sticks that's the stage of the campaign were in\nAnd what that means is that even when there is a gruesome assassination\nOf a a Saudi journalist and by the way he's not an American citizen he was living in the United states he had come to we're talking about ...\nAh and I'm not even sure how you pronounce this in proper Arabic I'd always thought it was ... but a lot of people are saying ... ... but whichever way he's was chopped up into a lot of different pieces and his body apparently was brought back to Saudi Arabia\nIs not a nice thing it's a terrible thing that had happened\nAnd if you listen to CNN who's to blame wealth Trump of course why I'm Brian Steltzner was on with Fred Hyatt on CNN and this is what Brian Steltzner had to say\nTo lure someone to a consulate to December the body and to take it back to the Saudi but it is a crime of a different caliber I Wonder if you look at what's happened the last twelve days and you wonder if enemy of the people rhetoric\nNot just from President Trump but also then from other world leaders\nHave anything to do with this anything at all\nOkay what what uh this Trump's rhetoric\nHas to do with the actions of Saudi Arabia [noise] Ah yes we are aligned with Saudi Arabia and yes we need to be there's a powerful piece by Walter Russell Mead the wall Street Journal today that\nMake that case but the attempt to blame the killing of this Muslim Brotherhood affiliated journalists\nTo attempt to blame that killing on President Trump or on his rhetoric is is just absurd\nOf the people who listen to Trump's rhetoric and share it when he takes on fake news are not murderers and they are by and large not Saudi Arabian ah meanwhile this was the response from Fred Hi it on CNN too uh that charge\nIn a case like this with important through on the actual crime can focus on the actual criminal and you know the Washington Post were very focused saying we've got to get the facts and then there has to be accountability and there has to be consequences\nI think there is a larger picture which was also fair to look at which is that a dictators around the world\nFeel emboldened when you have proven reaching out to Britain to poison his enemies when you have China reaching out to Hong Kong and elsewhere to kidnap people they perceived to be their enemies\nAnd went in each case if the person enemies are peaceful ah you know for people who have done absolutely nothing wrong or you have to ask why is this happening and I do think it's happening in part because the United states is retreating from its traditional role as a leader in the world\nAnd standing up for a democratic values and including freedom of expression\nOkay that's fair enough I mean the idea that there should be no us retreat and you need to establish norms and rules of law by the way of course they forgot about North Korea is North Korea now are good buddy you\nMay remember that I'm\nKim Jong loan um it it it also abroad had his half brother or murdered because he might be dissenting from the regime look\nThis is one of those things that there is obvious concern about and it's bipartisan and it should be a Lindsey Graham who's become one of the strongest supporters for the administration in the United States Senate\nHad a had this to say on Fox and friends about the ...\nWhy no there's nothing happens in Saudi Arabia was out in the U.S knowing it who's ... who's the thirty three year old crown prince who jumped him over other people he's the son of the existing king\nAnd I think he's on a in a bad track\nI can never do business with Saudi Arabia again until we get this the highest rate and what does that mean that means I'm not going back to Saudi Arabia is longer this guy in charge so you're selling the crown prince has to leave this up to them but I'm not going to have been the biggest offender on the floor of the United States Senate this guy is a wrecking ball\nHe had this got murdered in a conflict and turkey into expect me to ignore it I feel used and abused hours on the floor every time defending Saudi Arabia because there is a good allied there's a difference between a country an individual thing NBS figure\nIs Timmy toxic he can never be a world leader on the world and what is the president did thank us up to the president but what I Would do I know what I'm going to do on fashion the hell out of Saudi Arabia [noise]\nYou know we deal with bad people all the time but this is in our face I feel personally offended\nThey have nothing but contempt for us would you put a guy like me and the president in this box for after all the press and has done this guy's gotta go Saudi Arabia the lifting there are a lot of good people you can choose but NBS his tainted your country and painted and say\nOkay this is probably not the right approach frankly because you have a situation in the country where the crown prince NBS Mohammed bin Salman\nA is a in power because his father is old an ailing and uh I'm not sure that there is a power structure in place in Saudi Arabia that can simply replace him right now\nAnd there's a find peace in the wall Street Journal and I mentioned by Walter Russell Mead the headline is don't ditch Riyadh and a fifth of righteousness\nAnd he makes the point that we have to deal with these people and I I don't think anybody would say that we shouldn't go forward with some kind of a deal with Kim Jong on which remains one of the most promising\nA diplomatic initiatives of the Trump Administration so far\nUh nor should we simply write offs Saudi Arabia or there is breaking news the Washington Post is reporting that um that President Trump spoke directly to the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman apparently he was ... together\nThe crown prince was meeting with secretary of state Mike Pompeo and they may have handed uh the phone when he was on the phone with President Trump to a modern been Solomon and according to present the crown prince totally denied any knowledge of what happened in the hospital in Turkey\nAny promises answers shortly ... disappearance\nA secretary of state Pompeo press the Saudi leaders to move quickly with a transparent investigation of the disappearance of democracy Yogi and yes it sounds like a truly awful business he he comes into conflict\nBecause he wants to get papers he needs so that he can get married his fiance is waiting in the car outside now he'd never came out of that council it or at least he never came out in one piece\nThey brought in a an expert with the bone song they brought in an expert in autopsies they apparently packaged the various little pieces of his body and sent them back to Saudi Arabia this is a bad thing\n[laughter] it offends even the norms of state misbehavior but then again\nMohammed bin Salman has a I'm a real problem also with the with the policy that's going on in Yemen\nAnd the uh yes the salaries are basically looking out for the American for American interests and standing up against the Iranians were the ones that would really stand to gain if there was some kind of big break between the United states and Saudi Arabia which I emphatically hope there won't be\nBut something has to be done with a show of arresting the people who were behind this killing\nAnd making it clear that is not approved of or authorized by the government one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six you remember may remember that um [noise] last year the Saudis kidnapped the well they arrested\nThe Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri of that was a disaster they also have this failed diplomatic confrontation with Carter which was a disaster we need a stable productive and strong Saudi Arabia but we also need a stable\nJust Qadri 'cause looted money from the federal treasury a deposit it directly into the bank accounts of their most ardent political supporters to the bay and several generations of their descendants will have the resources to maintain the GOP and political power for as long as I said\nOK doesn't that sound a little bit like a conspiracy theory\nWill it is now there's a history on this dinner [noise] this was originally called the Jefferson Jackson day dinner\nAnd named after the two founders as it used to be told of the Democratic party Thomas Jefferson\nWho started the Democratic Republican Party and then Andrew Jackson who started the modern Democratic Party\nProblem with those two guys they were both slave owners [laughter] and big time slave owners hundreds of slaves so they changed the last year the name of the Jefferson Jackson day party to another illiterate of name\nIt became the Kennedy Clinton day dinner\nOkay that's a little bit of a problem and hash tag me to do you think that I Know Hillary says that President Clinton had no abuse of power he was during the driven snow\nBut you think that John Kennedy and Bill Clinton each have a a little bit of a problem and the view of feminist by the way feminist had a very very important anniversary they celebrated we will get to that\nUm so what did they change it to I mean what democratic reach our Lyndon Johnson they they have Lyndon Johnson on tape using the N. word\nA bronco Obama's still a little bit too recent and especially if you call the bronco bomb a day and you don't have Obama there try letting that he didn't come see you know what they did it the Eleanor Roosevelt dinner\nI'm Eleanor Roosevelt never got elected anything she was very bright lady um she was a I can you imagine\n'cause you can't do Kennedy Clinton you can't do Jefferson Jackson the Eleanor Roosevelt they dinner maybe maybe they could make it the um Pocahontas dinner in the future\nAlthough actually now the the entire nickname for Senator Elizabeth Warren or who is up\nThere in New England the entire nickname should go back to what it originally was I mean the the the nickname that she was given was ... ... that's ... phony\nAs an essay you X and a President Trump should apply that name to her very directly this is one thing that\nShe has accomplished something amazing here and she really has the United the country [noise]\nUnited the country in ... against her why is that well you just have to listen to some of the responses and why it is that President Trump should not must not have heard of that million dollars which is the wall Street Journal strangely says he

Wyoming majority of African Americans there is a little bit of Native American and most people whose families have lived here in the United states for many years and that is true for Elizabeth\nWarren's family but the best case analysis for her the idea that she has one sixty fourth Native American means that about a hundred and fifty years ago she had one of her sixty four great\nGreat great great grandparents who may have been Cherokee\nAs she says family lore suggested the entire thing ... was a ridiculous claim to begin with\nAnd wouldn't it be better for her if she just backed off that no but she won't she basically insists that uh this is the way she's going to set up her presidential campaign my question to you\nWould be was she thinking why is this a good idea\nMakes her look ridiculous it makes her look like a liberal racist why do I say that because for goodness sake if you grow up in a situation where you never affiliate with a tribe no one in your whole family within memory is ever affiliated with the tribe you've never gone to India and events you haven't raised with any Indian culture you know nothing about Indian\nHe no way I think that if you say he doesn't lie he misspoke way way way out ... hold on how wide Pam\nI I Will say that President Trump has tolls outright lives things that he knows not to be true because he's been told but where is there an outright lie here on this issue\n[noise] I you know she said find out if you have I don't know exactly what he said\nBut let me play ... he he oh sorry that million dollars that way I Am going to let me let me play it\nFor you okay I just want to be fair here listen to what President Trump said here's President Trump's original offer to Elizabeth Warren ...\nMillion dollars [noise] favorite charity like Trump [noise] have you take the test of the shows your your [noise]\nOkay is it shows you are an Indian and my point here was that there is no Indian tribe in the world in the country\nWould accept her as an Indian based upon this DNA test that shows that she may have had one great great great great grandfather who was in India that's my only point\nJust want to say that I'm Trump your color and uh and the previous hour said Trump bought us down to the gutter he really has and I mean you guys I I'm I'm just\nSo I'm a let me let you let me ask you\nThis okay do you think that it is honorable or for Elizabeth Warren to have a promoted herself as a diversity hire to have contributed to an Indian cookbook to have gone through this masquerade for all this time\n[noise] [laughter] no I don't think she should have done that I look at it it was trivial and he shouldn't have done it but I'll tell you what prompted calls out women he called he said Dr for it doesn't matter and she was lying or not it well you know what do you want it that's all he cares about winning and he didn't care who he dumped on\nOkay look I Believe that President Trump does sometimes go way over the line I think it's unfortunate and I said it already on the show I think it was a big mistake on his part and it was inappropriate for him to attack Stormy Daniels who has made accusations of a intimate\nKind against him two attackers horse face at who put that in a tweet today um it's\nProbably we probably reached a point in our world where ... if you're going to be attacking a female and you can attack or the way President Trump is attacking was with Warren but don't attack or looks I think we can agree on that and Pam I appreciate your calling me\nAnd carrying enough about the show\nTo actually call even with a complaint [noise]\nYour point is that the fact that a Trump or a can a occasionally makes mistakes I Would never say he can do no wrong but it's wrong to say he can do no rights we will be right back to the myth that show\n[noise]\nGet breaking news on AM eight Seventy the answer to Tom\nIn Long Beach the seven to North ... from Long Beach harbor to just before the four oh five and a self seventh than is also jammed from before ... who just passed the four oh five no word yet why could be killed trends were one month and six he wants to no avail us that crash has cleared the traffic is jammed the back of the fifty seven\nYear down in LA the one on one cell phone right around the Eldorado got a car that's been stalled in the left lane traffic stop and go and spots back to about Santa Monica boulevard I'm Stu burger AM eight Seventy the answer\n[noise] us and Mexican authorities are working together to crack down on a powerful Mexican drug cartel we're resolutely\nDetermined to use every power of this department of justice against the cartels so it's not business as usual\nAttorney general Jeff Sessions said the C.

Republican legislative majorities matter\nToo that's good news for the Senate and house races in Arizona Florida Indiana Nevada North Dakota Tennessee in Texas to say to local Republicans and these

the right direction\nAnd I think much of the time he does\nBut the idea that his personality should be the big issue that determines how we respond on this direction I'll tell you a way that I think Democrats are going to mess themselves over by trying to do that the American people don't want an impeachment crisis\nAnd and you have Democrats and now we're promised that if they take the house they're going to try to impeach President Trump's are going to I don't preach justice Kavanaugh really\nThat helps the country how it doesn't at all and it's absurd\nLet's go to Doug in Houston Doug

she was an Indian yeah she was one one thousand twenty fourth any answer should be about nine dollars and thirty eight that\nI'm sure you've done the math ... the problem is he he basically said she needs to show she's an Indian and what that means is how do you define who is an Indian now\nIn the URL Nuremberg Laws and Nazi Germany this is something you'll find out about the ... movie or they used to ... someone who is Jewish who was eligible for execution and liquidation if you had one sixteenth\nA Jewish background now she doesn't close to that one sixteenth Jewish background means what does it it means a great great grandparents she has to go back to great great great great that's for great great grandparents a hundred and fifty years\nAnd it's absurd she cannot prove that she's in

back black yeah\nOK it would probably not be received well in the Pocahontas thing hasn't been received well but if the cold or Rachel dollars all Harriet Tubman\nOr if he called her by the name of some black hero 'cause Pocahontas was not a bad person she was a good person she somebody who's remembered fondly in American history for goodness sake if you look at that Disney movie as she paints
