I I mean you guys this is just something is wrong\nI may be preaching to the choir I understand but many of you come into my office and you talked me on the phone and you're not a monolithic die hard one dimensional a party supporters you guys go down the road and and no\nNo that when you talk to people\nThat something is wrong and yet you've consistently supported the Democrat Party some of you do\nAnd listen in a normal world the choices would be maybe murky\nJohn Cox is the only hope you have for governor\nYour elected official your state assembly men and women uh needs to be a Republican state senator if they're not a Republican guys\nShaken a joined keep your very best shelf today we're going to talk a little bit about immune health\nAnd this is really a a big deal and um most people are not aware of some of the armamentarium that's available these days are one of the big players on the block\nThat has not been available before is something called nuclear tides and these are the actual building blocks of the cell\nAnd it takes a staggering six billion be\nTo build one cell so once we had a blow an injury uh dramas surgery or even a cold or flu or anything that would damage the tissue we're calling upon our supply of nuclear times well\nOr if you've got some great if you don't you do have to wait\nFor the body to make enough and when this comes to a building new tissue it can really be a problem\nThat say you had a surgery and the body is going to pack whatever it's gotten on hand into that cut or wound or injury but if you've got those nuclear dies will uh this can mean helping the body\nDeliver or promote the best possible\nRecovery and function for your body [noise]\nYou know a nuclear Dodd's have been around quite a while in Europe\nIs sold under the name on set because they view them is so important to promote best health if you're struggling with any kind of immune issue and of course in addition to nuclear tides ... is another key player\nThat can act like a stand in immune system especially in your intestines because it is human active\nPre formed immuno glob villains\nAnd of course this is completely different than a nuclear times and was able to do and of course the needs of the time is for nuclear died a can easily be satisfied there but\nUh you can reduce the white cells demand during all of this by jumping on a little bit of clause drum really great thing to do but you know one of the big missing links we don't usually have normal levels of vitamin D three [noise]\nAnd in the last five six years\nDeeds three has been shown to be a critical player in the formation of literally all two hundred plus immune compounds that the body mix wow so this is really key player so we produce a product called the three gold and\nUh it's really good to use about probably about six drops of this and if you're under forty you can just take the drops straight preferably at your main meals so there's plenty of protein and that's the escort for the fat of the deep three and a if you're forty or over\nThen you really should consider putting the deep three and a maybe a half ounces of water and adding three four drops of an organic lemonade that's essential oil of orange stirred up good\nYou'll see that the lemon is that most of our and quickly the big droplets the D. three become tiny tiny\nSo now regardless of how your letters performing\nYour body's going to absorb this beats read just beautifully so these are to me the ABCs that everybody ought to have around so that when you need them you got him but deeds tree is one you want to use day in and day out so you don't\nChallenge your immune system or with deficiencies shelf by all means and jump on today's great specials nuclear tides\n... and our vitamin D three and

see it [laughter] it's microscopic in size okay\nSo so the first thing we have to do is tell you you're getting way too much sugar okay and so this of course is the result of not getting enough starch when we crave sugar\nWe may have depleted R B vitamins so we can't metabolize storage and or we don't have starch show they're very simple thing is for you to get a copy of the biofuel diet\nAnd the resource list\nAnd shift gears and lay off meat fish poultry eggs and dairy products for a Ninety Days and after the Ninety Days then you'll have a key usually the foods that are listed there but the

how can pay about\n... what's going on with her wisdom teeth\nFit then if they move for young the [noise]\n... why is that uh the I'm\nNot in a way I see them sauce is soft and get these really decay\nOkay well but that's not a reason to remove him because it gives you a lot of biting surface\nIn my opinion is you always want to keep every two to you got your mouth or what I Would do of course is to make sure that\nShe brushes and losses and you monitor that choose to make sure and if it does decay you can use the low fusing ceramic materials\nWhich was stronger than your original to once it's laser bonded in there and then you keep all it binding surface\nYou see the upper teeth of your mouth are used by the body to respiration the base of the brain see you don't want to lose a to Z unless it's inside ways are infected or something's really bad about it\nOkay then get it the heck out of there but otherwise you know you want to keep everything the greatest one gave you [laughter]\nTenet mediate gives you a little kicking the pants with red cells so you're feeling more alert and in my opinion is going to be way healthier for you than slugging down a cup of coffee\nSo these are some of the things that can be really neat uses for nuclear tides and ...\nAnd of course the three is something that everybody needs and I'd say if you're over fifty it'd be a really good idea to jump on co Q. ten because it's so helpful and it's on special today typically taking about for your main meal\nSo it can work it's very best and we got some really great specials out there by to get twenty five percent off each just give a bus driver would align eight hundred three Seventy thirty four\nForty seven eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven let's go right back to the phones let's go to John in Cleveland, Ohio and he's got questions about\nA dental mon augmentation All right are you there John [noise]\nCourse I Am and how old a man of you and how much do you weigh\nSix to nine to ten is is a two hundred and ten pounds so what do they want to do they want to\nBuild up an area like right I Want to build up an area that pitcher in the ... one of the sinus areas yeah it's actually a lower lower ...\nOh well that's different usually it occurs in the upper area and that would be normal and you wouldn't mean bone loss but when you're losing when they want bone on the patient in the lower jaw now you're into what's called the L. veal or bone\nAnd that bone is very sensitive to boneless so\nIf you need to build that area I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole\nUntil you first figure out why you're losing bone\nShow the normally you would get a roller ph paper in check the first morning you're in ph now [noise] this is like a dog chasing his tail though\nBecause if there is remaining infection in them out no matter what we do you're not going to get that ... to the Green Zone six four to seven or it'll maybe come in and go out\nUm show first you need to be sure there's no raging infection left in the mouth like a dead truth or\nA pocket of infection from an old extraction something like this\nSo we need to hunt that down and make sure we got rid of that then we've got to work on getting the first morning you're in ... screens don't\nKnow if you were five years old this would be usually a very easy task done but when I got five so neither your eyes so that task could be\nEasy could be hard so first we get the V. H. paper and we find out where we are now if you're already in the blue zones are in deep trouble that means you're making a Monet at a buffer your urine\nAnd you're really low and minerals\nThen when you start with the something like the coral and the vitamin D D three gold and you start maybe with a half a disease from the coral\nAnd every three days you check yourself and if it if it was blue it should drop down to the uh five or if you're a yellow and then then it should build his way back up and so every three days your jacket as long as it's going up you don't have to increase the girl\nDoesn't want to go up you could double the coral and see if it will start moving let's say it won't pay than we may have to support\nParis a road and the kidney okay so many times we can support the kidney was simply taking five ... your body size like our deejay two hundred then for the Paris I read you can use\nThe ... is one of the things that works well\nMaybe two capsules just once a day with lunch and now she will that move the ph now does the ph come up okay now if it comes up when the stage and they're great but sick comes up but it won't stay in there or you can't quite get it in there [noise]\nOkay there's still some bugs in some infection somewhere in the body\nAnd now you're going to need to visit with a Q A rape person and all this should be done before you do any kind of bone grafting okay because if you try any of this it's not gonna work good and you're not going to heal well when they do the other dental work so it's a whole ... thing is going to be bad\nSo you get a ... a practitioner and\nThey can test the teeth and the gums and especially the area behind the teeth called the retro mole area because so many of us have infection that sits there\nFrom the extraction of a impacted wisdom tooth and the ... a residual infection never being dealt with\nShown what we can do they're usually can\nLocate through the cure it practitioners are one of the Dennis and has a laser like in in the ... laser and they can crank up the power to maybe three watch herself and disinfect that whole area and you'll be able to see the ph becomes mobile then\nAnd um it might take one or two times to do it\nBut let me tell you your future is riding on is if you don't get your own metabolism going good and you're sixty nine by the time you're eighty nine you won't even be able to walk\nFor ... it's not a pleasant prospect that's offered for us as we age and part of it is our crummy mineral status food\nPart of it is our overeating oil and part of it is of course\nDesperately needing to be able to digest our food well that's the other thing you gotta do you got to make sure you're on some kind of pick red against like quantum digest into your body weight at least two of those at the start of a meal the end of the meal\nMay be five or even six between ... and now you know your digesting that we did in your twenties and if you have plaque this will get the plaque right off the teeth so\nIt's your warning and at your age or shouldn't eat cooked food without taking digestive enzymes if you do you're asking for trouble\nAnd so this little metal thing is a great adversity that you can turn to your advantage okay thank you very much for your welcome\nYou guys are do miss ... give a buzz on eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty

Saturday Night live season premiere he closed the show was his song ghost town I'm not really a big Kanye West or any other a rapper ... uh\nUh uh\nAnd you're not a matter of rap I'm not I'm not a raft guide business but at this time he went onstage wearing a red make America great ... viewers saw the musical performance only because NBC cut the rest\nSo are his his uh and later we learned that that ... that he said because he gave a pro Trump speech well Saturday Night live cast members awkwardly stood behind him let's hear\nThat [laughter]\n[noise]\nNew as you say okay this is now [noise]\nOne Super Bowl and this means to me [noise]\nMy\nDo something which are going and I don't think that helps [noise] I think the universe has [noise] Ninety One new [noise]\n[noise] and they knew were Weiner's cameras [noise] news is you need to see is so so so one sided [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nI Love me too [laughter]\nYou know this this guy is obviously one of the most influential people in the black community and this is actually huge ed he's huge it is every time this guy opens his mouth I think the approval ratings go up ten percent of the black community for Trump\nI like I like Tania now I you know there's a lot of things I don't like that he's done in the past but I'll give him credit he don't care what anybody thinks no he\nDoesn't he's got he's definitely got courage that's for sure [laughter] interesting lead us you know just going to remind you of us but we don't have his platform obviously a it is interesting that to NBC's want you to hear that the way I don't think that's a little uh yeah yeah very peculiar and uh yeah it's I\nThink there's this is what's happening in the in the media folk today so take everything you here with a grain of salt absolutely as you know we're\nCommitted to doing whatever we can to ensure a red wave in November and that means given a platform to many Republicans\nAs possible you've already heard from I just missed a couple of times who's running the beat Democrat Mark to Kano\nKano in forty first district that's a riverside Paris Marino valley in but in another part of the Inland Empire\nRepublican Sean Flynn is funding to be Democrat Pete Aguilar on the thirty first congressional district which is red ... among the Loma Linda grandparents reality show called in and San Bernardino and actually one of my a list is called in on the\nOn the a listener hotline and requested\nThat we get Sean Flynn and here so uh in the June primary offline a lead you learn by eighty three votes\nHopefully uh he'll keep up that edge although and have an easy win in November six\nFlynn welcome to the main\nGuy said give me on the you know that you're promoting Republican candidate them I Hope you don't oh me too hard here we've seen a lot of that recently\nWell we're uh we're a of the uh we don't really we don't really care what happens we just want America to ah to still be around for our kids and grandkids so\nIt's not really it's not really hey we're just trying to push for Republicans but that is actually what we're doing so ah so hey you're ... very impressive you've had a successful career founded start up businesses nonprofits you taught at Vassar College in New York\nAnd now at Scripps College in Claremont you sit on San Bernardino county pinch and boards to protecting retirement of county residents and you're the author of a book\nEconomics for dummies in your opinion what are the biggest issues at the thirty first district is that they're facing right now\n\nOkay well it it depends where in the thirty first year and I got to represent everyone and I want to take our problems really seriously so\nUm to begin with city of San Bernardino coming out of bankruptcy having to cut his police for Seventy percent highest murder rate in America and two thousand sixteen San Bernardino needs help and federal help in my opinion we can get into the weeds there later\nI'm In general we need a lot more infrastructure out here you know the the infield is happening right there's hardly any farms left\nUm we're building big box centers were building malls are building housing meet a lot more infrastructure there the schools need better funding more focus funding um and so you know I'm very big on education and job creation and vocational training and all of those are things the federal government can really help out we have here\n[noise] yeah I mean you look at San Bernardino got it looks like Detroit you know and that wasn't always the case Sanford even used to be like one of the one of the top cities in the United states to live and now it's got to be near the bottom I mean it looks terrible\nWhen was that well actually it was what about thirty thirty forty years ago Sanford and it was actually you don't even remember the Sanford and it was actually a great city um and and it just gone through the slow decline to like Detroit was almost seems like nobody nobody\nReally cares about what happens to San Bernardino you know and it's just it's an I have a good friend who's a homicide detective out there so I Know what you're talking about what the the high crime rates I mean I hear about it first hand\nI always thought a similar to you know it's kind of a designed by guys on acid in the sixties 'cause there's there's no logical reason for which way any of the streets rent but we digress go ahead go ahead Shawn what about all the other areas of your district\nWell I mean you know there are places like rancher cook among go where the schools are good and things are booming a lot of cities are like that really well run at the local level but um there's this looming pension disaster I'm coming down the line to the entire state to state pensions are trillion dollars under funded which\nAnd they will take money away from the local government they have the right to do that in order to boost the pensions\nAnd so you know I think you know we're in a nice economic boom right now and they should be like the story of Joseph reading the pharaohs dreams right you're going to have seven fat years followed by seven lean we really need to get on the ball right now and build the infrastructure really needs for the lean years get the schools in order to make sure there's going to be enough jobs um\n[noise] because yeah when that

hospital hospital so we're left to actually have one\nOf the best performing one and the entire country at Loma Linda\nThat won't happen if people are too afraid to live there too afraid to work there

shops in America Scotty we're having so much fun absolutely it could be back in the house All right so ah let's talk about so we uh we talked about we talked with Sean Flynn from a thirty first district in ...\nAnd uh let's talk about what's going on in this country has been pretty a colorful this week on a friday\nI'm kind of start and I'm just kind of starting from the from uh the end of the week and then we'll go back to the beginning weeks but uh we're kind of rewriting 'cause we ... we wrote this stuff hadn't happened yet so on friday the Senate held their cloture vote\nFor Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation which the cloture vote apparently seems to be the vote before the vote it's a vote to make sure you're going to vote exactly we should uh we should take it a tough job in the Senate and it's like when you come out and you need a weekend to rest up from the weekend but the weekend was supposed to rest up after the week\nI don't know it's something that started like Democrat so uh so uh in the past fifty one to forty nine ah all the Republicans voted for the uh for Brett Kavanaugh except elastic Congress or Alaska center or at least\nThe Murkowski who is one of the ah the for they were worried about or the other three voted for it and that would be Susan Collins and Jeff Flake\nAnd uh all the other one was was the other swing vote was a a Democrat and that was a Joe mansion and he voted for for it so so that all the Democrats voted against except for Joe Manchin from West Virginia most likely because\nHis state is\nPretty uh pretty pro Trump and he's thinking about getting re elected in four weeks\nI don't understand how we got there in the first place to be honest I mean if it's a pro Trump district wise or a Democrat even in that seat does that make any sense to you I I Wonder\nBecause he votes so often with the Republican I guess how you became was what does he switched parties that that's that would be the logical thing for me I'm not really I'm not really that versed on Joe mansion other than I see\nHe's always he's the one guy that's always split out\nHe's kind of like a um well I guess he's like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski the better than what party they belong to exactly and ... and Jeff Flake is is only a swing vote because he's actually quitting um and as I understand the stories from Jeff Flake over the years he's getting out because he hates Trump um\nHe did stand up and say we really don't have any uh we really don't have any evidence that any of this stuff that is a Kevin ... a fused up\nMeans anything so I'm a yes vote and then uh he got encountered by some uh some activists women on in the uh in the elevator and he goes well okay but I Would really like it if the if the FBI investigated we took one more week and let them investigate and they gave like foreign names\nFor names that they want it investigated\nOr talk to and I think the FBI I talked to nine or ten and a and\nNobody's happy so ah so the FBI found nothing the backup Christine Blasey Ford's claims about the party that happened sometime sometime in Nineteen eighty two and a house you can't really identify with people who also the FBI they weren't there and don't remember it uh I can tell you some parties I was that when I was Fifteen and I'm older than a lazy forward [noise]\nUm so that was a forty two years ago for me and I can tell you is pretty specifics and I had more than one beer but before we knew the FBI findings President Trump chimed in on Blasey Ford's claims at a rally on Tuesday remember he's just summarizing\nHow Dr Ford herself answered the questions that last week's hearing thirty six years ago\nThis was I had one [noise] right [noise]\nWell do you think it was just wondering how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't\nKnow [noise]\nAnd everybody seems to have their their knickers in a twist their pennies and a\nBunch they all got twisted a out upside down over this\nHe didn't make fun of her voice which I've actually heard someone on Rush Limbaugh play somebody who tweeted out a voice or some voice actress that that made fun of her voice and how she played the victim in Miami and yeah he didn't do any of that stuff\nConfirmed it out of the vote after the ... this is yeah where do you know with the cloture vote now we're going to do the real vote the real but I I think I think he's going to go because you know and we and we do is going to be confirmed yeah he'll be convert All right yeah and we just watch Susan Collins of want to have a\nBig error on for about a half an hour ... nothing if ... if not are they still standing painful to listen to that as well as yeah yeah oh oh we're\nNow you're making fun of so he's going to say he's going to so Joe mansion and said he's a he's voting as\nTomorrow I'm ... I actually liked Joe mansion um\nBecause he's got the guts to do what's right even though it's against his party\nAnd uh I thought I like that guy\nI just think he should change parties\nI agree it's like but and I do if you end up if he actually well we'll wait and see it right we're not going to probably going to count our chickens before they've hatched year well wait and see but I think for yeah for a Democrat in this kind of environment for a Democrat to come out in favor of this nominee I'd say it's pretty gutsy\nYeah and I'd say follow them I follow the money and\nMatching wants to keep his job he wants to stay in that mentioned so like a so like a Sean Flynn said there's there's a there's a sizable paycheck goes with that position so a wants to keep it\nWhere these guys supposedly make you know like a hundred and Seventy thousand a year and yet they all retired multi millionaires how does that happen at I don't know what do they get a little extra on the side there I Love it insider trading deals that they are seen to be able to\nOregon and all the all the lobbying money that they get probably\nI don't know they get all kinds of stuff the president also had some interesting things to say about uh the Democratic senators including one that just might be might be talking about is former friend or New York are crying Chuck Schumer\n[noise] you know what happened to go back to high school [noise] and they're saying she drank a lot on the evening and how\nWe you know I Want I happen to know some United States senators [noise]\nWho is from the other side [noise]\nWho's pretty aggressive [noise]\nI've seen that person in very bad situations\nI've seen that person in very very bad situation somewhat compromising and you know [noise]\nI think it's very unfair to to bring up things like this\nYou know him talking about humor as a very a player that's your assumption and I didn't hear that name mentioned either die but you know that he said he said that he's a\nA very aggressive and I'm doing and even though Schumer is a is a a raging but hid 'em I still have a I still have a hard time thinking of him as aggressive 'cause he talks like\nOh I don't know someone who's not very tough I'm trying to think of a word I could say on the on the radio but he doesn't he doesn't ... like a very masculine\nFella he found like kind of a [noise] um you know he sounded like a good man\nYou know I I think what would the more we see um things like this Kavanaugh Sacco ... we realized that this is just a lot of stupid people in Washington it just a lot of stupid people representing us and then running the country man guy and especially in states he also point out the centers like a Richard\nBlumenthal a we know him as Dick Blumenthal in a Cory Booker uh so we know him as Spartacus\nHave have a lot of nerves considering their own history\nThere man drink too much on everybody I'm looking at people I'm sort of\nLook at some of these people asking the questions fucking [noise]\nLooking Blumenthal he lied about Vietnam he didn't just say hey I went to Vietnam snow for Fifteen Years you said it was a war hero peaceful and nothing happens we call them ... what's your name is Donna he never went to Vietnam\nAnd he's just saying we need honesty and we need integrity this guy lives when he was the attorney general's can out of the line\nDon't mean a little bit and then when he got out he actually dropped out of the race and you want anyway because Democrats are always win in Connecticut we take a look at Torrey bunker here in Newark New Jersey into the ground he was a horrible man\nHow do you make statements that when he was in high school or college one he was doing he actually made the statement and now he's talking about\nJudge Kavanaugh and I could go through all this stuff OK\nYeah we've talked about a book result thing saying that he tried to get the second base or third basis and in the first base and it was unsuccessful as I recall it I had this month yeah we're wondering what mark was talking about yeah oh\nYeah you know this this ... this candidate to kind of talk has got to be almost got it bears any of these guys do you think do I cringing when the hearing this stuff coming out of the president's mouth and I really don't care I Would kind of embarrassed\nAnd you know when or donning Dick I mean they're not being a Richard\nI'm uh not to be confused with along duck Don ... law that dominate a food so ah you know when when you talk about about this\nGuy and he's saying that he was in ... in in Vietnam\nI think the military guys call that a stolen valor and they really they really it's it's really look down on that\nI Know when we were talking about ah I'm\nAndrew patrol we raise money for Andrew broke Joe ... who is a a a a\n... T that we donated money to help\nTo help build his smart home for and we did one ah one flyer for our uh for charity event and we mentioned that he was part of SEAL Team ten and he said no you can't put that that's going value goes I wasn't part of I was embedded with SEAL Team Ted so SEAL Team ten was there and\nMy and my uh my uh he was maybe\nAn explosive ordnance disposal tech he was he was embedded with them said you can't you can't put in there that I was part of SEAL Team to the town I was just embedded with him and so you know there are very sensitive about saying something you're not\nSo uh now that it's now it's apparent that the FBI is ah has found nothing to back up believe before the claims\nAre against Kavanaugh there's a third accuser and we'll we'll remember the the second accuser was a was a ... I forget what her first name is um then and she said that she said that uh we talked about this last week that\nThat are ... are that are that Kavanaugh showed showed is Anthony wiener to her at some party but then she doesn't she's got to sketchy she's not really sure taken and all this time of a\nOf a therapy to figure out if it was really him and they just convinced around with him so she'd come out she's a unreliable but now the third accuser Julie sweating next story falling apart to now we find out that she never saw people who attacks or because of the room was too dark\nBut because Brett Kavanaugh was there he had to be one of them here she is on the NBC interview this week\nI remember that I started walking ... now I was ... and I'm having my call is ...\nI was playing solitaire in every way you could possibly ... all one on one of those ...

us a quick study or to to sort of backed us up highlight the science behind the elite asked his anthem that's found in as the FX 'cause I Know there were dozens and dozens of studies maybe you can pull out and highlight a couple of your favorites\nYeah for sure so Dr Mark Miller he's a PHD a biomedical research or he explains that well he's talking here about how free radicals compromise and undermine function\nAnd sell you the performance in the body he says after that it simply heard at navigating this as evidenced by clinical trial showing improved performance and accelerated recovery in fact research published in the journal of medicine and science and sports and exercise\nFound that those who took four milligrams about this that and daily over twenty eight days scored better cycling times with greater output than those who did not take it so they fight that meat remember this after that and it's one of the few\nThat fireball antioxidants that can actually neutralize free radicals even at the site of the mitochondrial membrane it's like a sailor body armor protecting yourself your joints blood vessels brain heart and Oregon's on many levels\nValues impressive on so many levels so much information there and I know this last as Anthonette was about a dozen happens to want to hear or see there's a patent\nFor promoting I help and reducing Ice T there's\nA pattern for inhibiting the expression of cytokines in sales end up happening is on compositions were body fat reduction there's one for improving muscle atrophy an older adults Sherry I'd like to be a little bit of a skeptic here how can this one simple nutrient\nDo all of this disaster ... give us so many benefits I mean really\nYeah I Know it it sounds amazing to get to be true but it really is true many studies that I'm referencing here and there have been taught met these are reputable clinical studies conducted by leading researchers around the world that really back\nThat benefits about that than than by the way muscle I put it that are with\nUs that that that too and this comes from after that that research published in the international journal sports nutrition November two thousand and alive and this was another study done with cyclists they took for granted\nAccess than than it was a small study but very positive showing that cyclists improved their child time by two minutes and twenty kilometer bike race\nI mean that's a meaningful improvement in a race like this and the researchers said that they also burn fat more efficiently which makes sense based\nOn this research purity can actually make the claim that asked FX will promote and improve power output\nIn your muscles I mean I tell people asked\nFX in strength and power out its transformative if you'd like energy
