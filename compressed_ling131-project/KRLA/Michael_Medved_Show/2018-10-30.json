attempt at humor [noise]\nUp we will get to the um [noise]\nThe the very relevant story of a Nazi Halloween are coming up it is hard to believe the president is due to land in Pittsburgh and\nA short while to help anticipate his visit a we'll be speaking with Lou Weiss who wrote a terrific piece of Wall Street journal yesterday he's the father of New York times writer Barry wise or he is a long time member\nWas a long time member of the tree of life synagogue which was struck by the terrorist attack what does he think of the president of the United states are coming\nTo visit Pittsburg at a time when there are some folks including the mayor who is not Jewish by the way the mayor of Pittsburgh saying uh know may be the president should not visit there\nA one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six or there\nIs so much going on in this country right now to drive us apart at a time when we really ought to be trying to come together\nAnd I think that some of what is driving us apart is naked and cheap and rather ineffective politics on all sides and\n[noise] just strange strange situation because at the same time that I think many many people feel frustrated with both sides of the political debate at the moment there's evidence everywhere that the\nAmount of interest in participation and passion with this election is just Ryan Zinke and surging and may in fact set records\nAre there are elements of a recent stories that show\nObviously some of the worst in our country but there are also some stories that show the very best and one of those stories\nAs it struck me and I'd like to begin with is before we talk to a ... from Pittsburgh\nIt's another story about Pittsburgh and about the way that this entire nightmarish attack was handled which is very very much to the credit of some of the participants ah there is a I'm a doctor\nWho's the doctor\nIn chief and in charge of the hospital to which the killer\nWho is now being arraigned these has twenty nine charges against him yes he faces the death penalty and I think that's appropriate at the um\nThe doctor in charge of the hospital introduced himself to Robert ... hours after he was brought in wounded and treated in the hospital\nHe had um\nA a a a very brief word\nThat he delivered when he went in to look at the killer\nI Am Dr Cohen\nAnd this after the killer had been brought into the hospital\nOr screaming or I Want to kill all Jews I Want to kill all the Jews here here is that Dr Cohen his name is Jeffrey Cohen he is the president of the Allegheny General Hospital where some of the victims\nAnd the killer\nUs he says he when he came into the room\nWith a killer there he asked me who I was I said I'm Dr Cohen president of the hospital\nAnd I turned around and left\nAnd the FBI agent that was guarding him said\nI don't know that I could have done that\nHere's what Dr Jeffrey Cohen had to say\nProbably been invited ...\nMy inclination was I had to get back to normal life so I went to this\nI talked to the nurse that took care of him before I went down to the game\nAnd he had already broke down in tears as to\nSaw I went to the game I came back\nBut I went to see the shooter and the cops and was already\nAnd I wanted to try to understand why did you do this\nI mean I have no answers I asked them\nTime he was sort of Roger you said\nAbout the auto guys that I introduced myself soccer going Roosevelt your general\nThe FBI agent in charge will diminish as\nI did that so I'm not sure I Would have\nRetired for leaders fully\n... all the chaos and story on the gentleman didn't appear to be\nA member of the members of society\nHe was a southern noise\nNoise for soldiers were being slaughtered\nWas hard to rise up and do something\nWe would use\nThe word ... which are the words are leaving to be\nDoing things like that so far to the mall and\nOkay I'm at that as a balanced\nInappropriate statement\nThere are too many\nHarsh and ridiculous words some of them by the way many of them\nWe will get to that Dr Cohen a continued his comments he had this to say\nWe're one very simple mission trip Allegheny will take care of sick people we don't you have questions where they are\nSports is about ... to pay\nFor it so much very simple\nOr our staff to do the right job so that will tell you that are very proud of ever saw a great job you have to rebel\nIsn't that ironic that somebody who is yelling at me every once in a hospital I Want to kill all the Jews taking care of by George or letters is Jewish hospital president\nAnd there was also the attending emergency room doctor who cared for the killer was also Jewish the nurse who cared for his father is a rabbi\nAnd I'm\nColin and says Dr Cohn and we just heard from is personally connected to the shooting beyond his role of the hospital he live so close to a tree of life synagogue\nThat on Saturday morning he heard the gunshots\nAs a massacre unfolded he knew nine of the people who were killed nine of the eleven\nThat didn't stop him from going in to check on ... hours look this is America\nAnd it really is and I I was reminded of something it's not nearly so dramatic because it doesn't involve killing and shooting in horror button involves part of the beautiful part\nAbout the United states of America ... years ago I did a book called hospital which actually was one of the most successful books that I've done it was\nA big bestseller and uh it was about some of the\nPhysicians encounter and some of the problems that physicians encounter dealing with those pressures that was a profile of thirty real life medical professionals\nAnd uh when I was doing the book I I went to Pittsburgh and I was doing a TV show and I was I'm told I was going to be on the show\nWith a um a a leading expert on substance abuse who treated a lot of doctors who would come to substance abuse so I come to the TV studio\nAnd uh there is a hub Hasidic rabbi who was a sitting there and um\nI introduced myself\nAnd he says oh I'm I'm Dr ...\nAnd he is uh Hasidic rabbi and he is also one of the world's leading experts on substance abuse and\nHe is in charge of psychiatry\nAt St Francis hospital a Catholic hospital\nHe graduated from Marquette University a Catholic university\nHe's always been joy she's from a prominent Hasidic dynasty I was floored because I Know this rabbi ... from his work he's written one of the best Bible commentaries I've ever read period it's called live every day and\nAnd again there's something about that there's something about the story and it it actually move me to tears today the\nLocal Muslim association\nIn Pittsburgh has announced they raised a hundred and Ninety thousand dollars to help the people that tree of life congregation at the service that they held in Pittsburgh on Sunday after the shooting the a\nMuslim leaders of the community were very prominently involved\nAnd given some of the harshness between\nJews and the state of Israel and and Muslims around the world this is a beautiful thing and it is a great tribute to the United states of America and\nI think it's also a great tribute to the United states of America that um\nMany people most people are going to welcome the president of the United states respectfully\nAnd with dignity and gratitude when he comes to Pittsburgh or in moments frankly proven to be speaking to a Pittsburgh are named Lou whites\nLewis talked about some of the eternal evil aspects of what happened in his city\nHe was he was apparently safe from the initial response but he rushed in to a line of fire because as a physician he was trying to help people who were wounded or something\nToday that he does this must be some ... he he doesn't have any kids but what ever anyone in the community would die he would say cottage for them\nBecause he didn't have anyone to say cash for him but I Know that every Jew in the city of Pittsburgh and every Jew around the world is shipped back\nWe'll be getting up and sank cash ...\nA memorial American and honor the departed you let me let me pick up something in in some of the little time we have left ... one of the things that struck me about your column you referenced\nThe portion of the ... the Jews everywhere around the world in Pittsburgh and in Seattle and in Tel Aviv and income undo every Jewish congregations was reading the same story of Abraham bargaining with God to try to save the citizens of Saddam\nAnd a very great run by the last generation whose name you know rabbi Moshe Feinstein asked a question\nAbout it and he asked the question why is ... why is Abraham are concerned about these evil people these citizens of Saddam why is the bargaining and there'll be have\nTo try to save the whole city for the sake of a few righteous people and the answer that he gives the says look when it says love your neighbor as yourself\nIt's easy to love people share your values\nIt's easy to people who agree with you what's hard is finding loving your heart for people who are completely opposite of you and that was what Abraham was doing a\nI read something and members rabbi sack I'm not sure but he said only by acknowledging the humanity of the author of knowledge in ourselves and you said it right in the middle of mankind it's very hard to love your neighbor especially with you know might not ever not just\nKept [laughter] uh listen or is it what what\nWould you have to contribute to all of this is is so profoundly important and and again and I hope that the rest of the country can actually benefit from Pittsburgh to example and to be stronger I I didn't know that the Steelers actually showed up at the funerals\nUh today and ... and again that's that's a beautiful thing and uh maybe maybe in merits of the departed um we can\nWe can all do better in in terms of the spirit of unity larger community for our country\nWe will post new wife says information and material at our

wise had mentioned\nThat he was one of the funerals today\nAnd they they are going to be continuing funerals for the rest of the week normally in in the Jewish tradition actually in Jewish law the

of the ...\nWhen I first said that the first said it was welcome I'm I've received a\nLot of emails too numerous to account I Can't keep track for every email I read too if you're reading about one so

appropriate at this point is always appropriate to disagree that's our fundamental American right and disagree in criticized but the idea of hatred of up calling the other side of evil or a very prominent Democrats just called president\nTrump evil\nUm it is completely out of bounds\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six Jose in Pittsburgh you're on the Michael Mann that

mean\nWhat the media and the mayor of Pittsburgh and anyone else who wants to blame the tragedy on from they should just be quiet and let the president do the right thing and respect the dead I mean blaming murders for their crime and do not bring some politician you do not agree with into it\nI yeah and and again this is a time when even people who you made profoundly disagree with are are feeling some of the same things I mean this is one of the\nOne of the things about the nature of the shooting I have not heard anyone or not even David Duke or some of the prominent American Nazis or I even have a a even ISIS I don't\nThink has a commended Robert ... hours for what he did and I I mean I I don't know if you've heard the story earlier Jose about um\n[noise] ah the doctor Cohen who is the president of Allegheny General Hospital who came in and introduced himself to Mr Bowers after he got out of the emergency room it's a powerful statement ah really again we're all Americans\nAre above all we're human beings\nAbove all the um\nThe the attempt to try to blame one side or the other\nIt's it's just wrong and and by the way to blame mass media for this\nIs just wrong now having said that do I think that there might be more attention paid by a media platform like gab dot com [noise] which are\nActually had done a lot of the posting naked Lee anti Semitic pulling for death of

which really evil was displayed\nThis killing it's a double killings a homicide and low of all and they have apprehended the perpetrator and in lieu of all there was a guy who tried on Sunday to get into a Baptist church a black Baptist church he would stop the door was locked he was armed\nHe apparently had it in mind to kill some black people and then he found two people at random track them down\nOne African American shoppers sixty nine in front of his grandchild put the gun at the back of the guys had assassinated him\nAnd then they called a black woman in the parking lot\nAnd this was a guy who was\nMelting off about the N word\nAnd ah and by the way it has a history of violence in the history of psychotic behavior\nFormerly married to an African American who you'd also abused by beating her and using the N word with her\nUm this is a real problem\nThis is a very real problem\nAnd it's a real problem when you have somebody who sends out\nBombs to Fifteen people\nNone of whom are criminals\nNone of whom are evil\nBut you see this is the\nProblem it is evil to try to blow somebody up because you disagree with them politically\nIt is not evil to disagree with them politically sure you can express contempt or you can express dislike for George Soros\nOr for Brock Obama were for Hillary Clinton\nAnd there are lots and lots of people who dislike them but when you use the term evil\nIt puts it in a different category and it simply is wrong\nAnd what Howard Dean is doing here is wrong it's also deeply wrong with Don Lemon\nDid a Don Lemon\nThis to say about the biggest terrorist threat our country faces\nI keep trying to force people not to demonize I mean one group for any one ethnicity\nBut we keep thinking that the biggest terror threat of something else some some some people who are marching towards the border like feminine so we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest fear for in this country is white men most of them radicalized brought up to the right\nAnd we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere is no ban on you know they have the Muslim ban there is no white guy ban so what do we do about that\nIs he suggesting we should have a white guy ban\nWhat would you ban white guys from doing how about the white guys who work with the with CNN are they okay\nI I mean that should there be no mix dancing between white guys and other guys uh\nI mean what what is going on\nThis is this is completely\nCompletely weird\nAnd unacceptable\nI let us go to Deborah in Brooklyn New York Deborah you're on the Michael Mann that Joe\nHi Michael how are you today I'm very well\nUh I Love listening to your show I find your voice very soothing effect therapy\nThat will do\nThat to my wife was a professional therapist though but go ahead\nOh there you go fi uh I was a Republican up until now Donald Trump came along I'm now an independent [noise]\nI I I like when you are the things you say you call it like it\nI could get it back and then there's always a buck and I want to know why there's always a but he is what is he says what he said that it seems like we say oh okay that's just Donald Trump them again why can't you do you say he's evil and we wind up for a lot\nOf what to eat all you do you think he's evil\nI gave him all is a strong word and they get that part that I Would say that things he says how we say\nWell wait they'll ... they'll have two different things there are two different things Deborah and this this those the heart of your challenge and I it's a great challenge I I think there are things that he says that are outrageous\nBut speech ... in in and of itself to coal speech evil if if\nYou are saying I order you to go out there and murder these people\nYes that's evil but to make some stupid remark and and Trump makes a stupid embarrassing remark virtually every day I mean it's ... and it's it's tedious after a while because when you talk about what he does\nWhat he has achieved as president you recognize as a former Republican Deborah don't you that he's had some successes as president\nYou know what yeah his way the way he doesn't articulate radically eloquent as nothing about and that is a leader on my mind that pregnant in the United states but it all it all negates everything he does that could be cut here he expects it oh\nOkay what would you hold on hold on for a moment of an alleged bronco Obama was extremely eloquent\nHe was almost always dignified um he spoke very well and I think he did a terrible job as\nPresident of as a President Trump makes fun of himself frequently great he says he's not eloquent or he is often Arab world and and childish and all those things and but\nHe's got his record on appointing judges his record even on foreign policy is record certainly on Middle East policy\nAnd his record and managing the economy\nHas been admirable don't you think\nBut it does okay so why do you care more about do you care more about what the president says or what the president does\nAs I got very very well look what I think it is important I think it is in the more I think it is important but I Would prefer a an a president who does the right thing [noise]\nAbove a president who says the right thing\nLot of political things you know feminism or things like that and you know the normal American person whether they're white black they're under a lot of culture shock I call it a lot of stress\nIn the nineties we add diversity visas and we've short corporate landscape change and when I was at Eighteen the illusion that\nYou know the American was the minority ... American ... job and they ship than somebody and and and this has to do with the synagogue shouldn't but I'm just saying a lot of people are angry\nPeople have to understand that there's two angry group shares that just the minorities and the black men and women the regular average person white what have you been going on for far too long\nI look I agree with you I think there's too much anger in the United states so what are you saying should be done about it\nI don't think the founding fathers said beware of the factions here very smart either the constitution and the politicians should not be practicing identity politics and and showing them and we're working with these groups everybody's supposed to be equal you don't give them positive rights because this is what starting all the problems\nOf the the point is you don't give people you get people's rights based upon\nTheir status as citizens of the United states not upon special status of a citizen of a certain\nEthnicity or certain heritage and I think you're entirely correct It's one of the reasons that one of the most toxic ideas which by the way it seems that the Democrats have largely ... dropped is this notion of reparations\nAnd I'm Glad that's gone away appreciate your call let's go to a Joe in Los Angeles Joe you're on the Michael ...\nMichael ... go go ahead it\nBut I I I ... I got really\nQuick statement it this is kind of a struggle between good and evil and let me give you three quick examples you have a a left in this country that systematically not only trying to wipe out the existence of God\nBut they're trying to wipe out our Judeo Christian values we hold dear in this country ... samples number one transgender bathrooms generous um God says I created man and woman period number to talk of masculinity thoughts of I require the man be the leader of the household\nNumber free global warming God says I commend the sun to rise and set the ... and and the images from the west this is this\nIs okay hold on hold on I I Do not go with you that any of these three things are God given I don't think that God's frowns upon the fact that you may have you may offer people a gender neutral bathroom a I think it's terrible if you were making it impossible for people to go into\nA sex gender specific bathroom but for goodness sake had the idea that the global warming efforts to curb global warming or somehow anti God I don't buy it I I mean I Do think that the lord almighty wants to be good stewards\nOf our environment [noise] I think that characterizing the left\nHas evil in the United states is not productive and not like\nBreaking news on AM eight Seventy the answer dot com\nDot from\nSherman Oaks on the one on one he's found traffic is stopping going spots from the four oh five to cold water Kenyan avenue and the west one oh one is bad for the one Seventy the cold water can you know lane has been blocked off on either side for Caltrans work\nNear bell gardens for seven ten north bound slow and go from the one oh five to about Atlantic and she knows the sixty west has passed the Seventy one two lanes block for road works it's a mess stopped traffic back to grove avenue on the sixty West I'm Stu burger AM eight Seventy the answer\n[noise] president ... going to sign an executive order ending birthright citizenship for babies born in the U.S mothers who not citizens including illegal immigrants\nNow how ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to kill us as soon as that goes and it has to end\nAccording to actually goes on HBO Trump said he's talked to a council and that he has the power to change the rules he says it's going to happen he says in the full interview at that full interview a layer on Sunday birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment so the constitutionality upset you order is not clear\nPolice are investigating a body found in a dumpster near Disneyland sergeant Darren white with Anaheim police say is looking someone looking for recyclables located at this morning behind a condo and south Euclid straight\nThey did discover a body inside of a bag some sort of her bag inside of the dumpster we don't know the condition of the body yet we don't even know the sex we're waiting for the coroner's office to get here's\nHomicide detectives coming through the neighborhood checking Knicks missing person reports and reviewing it surveillance footage in hopes of getting more information on a suspect\nHundreds of people who feel the earth is flat are heading to Denver to discuss it organizers say they were still more than four hundred tickets to the flat earth into an international conference which begins November fifteenth\nSunny high sixties and seventies at the beaches mid eighties in the valleys in Westwood it's sixty eight instead in Santa Ana it's sixty nine I think he talks like a myth that continues next\nWhere were you able to hear when California deluxe window says does your new windows\nYour house can be covered but but the chips and we would crack one\nEight seven seven windows eight seven seven windows\nFolks and with my good friends Larry Elder of Dr Reddy Simon the only T.

out today we launch she can resist exclamation point this Shavers support groups creating a more just an equitable nation for assault and who are fighting President Trump's regressive agenda learn more and take action here\nOkay it's not news that Ben and Jerry's is a left leaning company [laughter] pretty direct and obvious about that but I think this is the first time\nThey've actually aimed at one of their ice cream flavors\nPresident Trump's quote regressive agenda I mean well up to the cameras is does a chocolate ice cream with white and dark fudge chunks pecans walnuts and fudge covered dominance\nOkay what does that has to do with President Trump's agenda for resisting it\nAnd uh you know ...\nAnd I'm\nA I'm I'm an individual\nFrom Owensboro named Bryant gold block\nI went to the trick or treat event a week before Halloween six days before Halloween with his five year old son he was dressed in a full ss officers uniform\nVery accurately he looks like a a\nVery determined SS officer and for those of you who don't know that said storm trooper not not Star Wars tried Nazi storm trooper and his little five year olds cute little tight was dressed with hair and mustache and full Nazi regalia as adults Hitler\nBrian Bull Bob was not well received at the neighborhood\nTrick or treating and this might be because now wait it says it was on October twenty fifth that he went there that was the same day as the synagogue shooting wasn't\nUm she'll probably not the right day to go as a Nazi somewhere but he did it anyway I have had five minutes a day [noise] please don't try this at home this this whole story\nGets weirder and weirder I'm\nIn a Facebook post rankled box tonight as we walk we saw people dressed as murders devils serial killer's blood and Gore of all sorts nobody bad at night but my little boy and I dressed as historical figures in American people not only making snide remarks but approaching us in threatening my little five year old boy\nOkay next time don't dress as a Nazi\nApparently um this pose that he posted complaining about how he was discriminated against because he dressed as a Nazi he took proposed down and now he's apologized says I think it was in bad taste for me to let my child where that\nProbably for me to wear that it didn't occur to me I thought it was a bad decision on my part\nThat's what he said but he is that it was covered on on television with Mr ... comments like this\nLittle boxes he wanted to do it for historical reasons we are only in this for living history because he came up with the idea that the last minute what started regarding his decision once others a trailer troops confronted him about what's on there in the first person ever\nManners ...\nOkay hey we should\nMaybe we shouldn't have did this um I think that's true and uh we have one more\nBut he has the devotion to living history but I have [noise]\nI don't know but [noise] as Ari [noise] a dog her law people [noise] and uh you know I'd give anything to make it right\nOkay um\nWhy why would he have this this SS uniform he has his is very accurate and again a five year old as Hitler\nOr there's a local rabbi whose name is rabbi Gary ... made though of temple adopt than a Israel which is nearby in Evansville, Indiana he made this comment he said the fact that father apologized as important the fact that he did not know the costumes would be offensive is a very sad reflection on our society\nA good rule of thumb would be\nIf your costume calls to mind and event where millions were killed choose another costume\nThat's probably a good idea\nI'm In his post Kobach says\nWe love history\nBut his Facebook profile says he likes pages such as everything's going to be All right\nWhite wing politics\nAnd a special website called feminism is cancer\nI'm Marion gold Bach\nWho's Facebook profile photo shows her standing next to her husband while he's wearing the SS uniform\nSays that the um mass media\nHas

addresses his little boy is Hitler for Halloween of the reason by the way that people respond worse to\nThis kind of address something they do to vampires and which isn't goals and goblins and corpses and et cetera and zombies I is because this is real\nAnd you would be surprised Frankel buck or how many\nVictims and not all Jewish either way\nBecause there were millions of victims of the Holocaust who were not Jewish particularly polish Catholics how many victims of a of of Hitler's murder\nMass murder on payroll scale actually live not that far away from you\nTemple that was\nConservative synagogue that was attacked by\nAn evil evil gunman who of course now is in custody\nThe president's also accompanied by his daughter Ivanka and his son in law Jared Kushner\nUh both of whom live their lives as religious\nJews and ...\nWhat is so sad and honestly it makes me kind of a bill\nThat virtually everything this president does including things that are fine that are normal\nThat aren't necessarily brilliant or D for profound but they're just normal president things ever everything is going to be controversial and I I I just anticipate this controversy coming across I have to give you a little bit of a visual description of what happened here\nIn front of the synagogue and the squirrel hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh\nA series of memorials two\nOf the fallen to to the eleven people were killed\nIn that synagogue and people abroad flowers and and by the way President Trump a and I think\nProbably through the influence of his daughter or maybe through a staffer a son in law who knows he knew that the Jewish tradition is that in in Judaism when you go to a to honor someone at at a at a grave side um\nYou you leave a a Little Rock a pebble um sometimes it can be a larger stone but it is the idea that it's not something that phase is something that stays there and the idea that um there's a phrase in Yiddish that that means that the the dead don't smell the flowers\nSo basically that's a sign of morning and the president and the first lady and the violence and Jarrett all brought they had a tray of of stones I Believe that secretary minutiae and who was also a Jewish as secretary of treasury who is with them\nOkay here's here's what I Am anticipating and honestly this is a sketch where I Hope I'm wrong or\nSeries of Jewish stars six point and stars stars David it's\nReferred to as the ... the the shield of David and okay that those stars have been set up an honor of the fallen here\nBut they have been put in front of what is obviously crosses a that you would have on a temporary grave side so what the president is seeing seeing a Jewish star but behind that Jewish stars across some idiot\nAnd it's not going to bring up a an element of controversy because what it shows is the president of the United states in the first lady very respectfully and some burly are leaving their rocks on the cross bars of the cross behind the star of David\nDo I find it offensive that they used process to set up this temporary memorial this is not at the graveyard this is that the synagogue itself where the killings took place I think it's fine\nUh let let me also say\nI think it's it's a shame that controversy has erupted over a campaign stop\nIn Michigan that I'm an advice vice president Pence was involved with an and here's the background of the story and I'll do it very quickly\nBecause we have some outrageous material to get to that that really does need attention but what happened with the vice president was he was campaigning for a a fine candidate named Lena Epstein\nWho is running in a a contested hotly contested congressional race to become a the first Jewish Republican woman in the house of representatives and that would be a good thing\nThey wanted because the vice president was making campaign appearance to have somebody say some kind of a memorial prayer\nOn behalf of the people fell\nIn Pittsburgh and that's also very appropriate\nWhat wasn't so appropriate is Lena Epstein for reasons that are completely unclear or may not seen as a member of a Jewish congregations she's fairly active she is proudly unapologetically Jewish but she apparently selected um\nTo deliver this prayer a a a Christian um\nWho actually went to a\nSeminary and now styles himself rabbi and he was there wearing a prayer shawl and he said this prayer\nIn the name of a of Jesus and no it's not a good thing\nIt it just isn't because of the people who died were not Christians they were not\nJewish Christians they were Jewish Jewish were members of the conservative Jewish congregation and this is not a controversy that the vice president needs or the administration needs or anybody needs right now and uh does that mean that Lena Epstein should not be elected to Congress of course she should be elected to Congress\nBut it means that if if we're going to be\nSerious about trying to build a broader base of support for this administration\nThere could have been much more care\nNow meanwhile the protestors who were trying to disrupt the president's visit to um\nTo Pittsburgh at just awful\nAnd and uh uh demonstrators said Trump is fanned the flames of hating us partially responsible for this tragedy and his only making things worse by coming housing making things worse\nAnd worse you have to do with this tragedy as the the person the killer Robert Bowers hated from\nBecause he felt troubles to surrounded by Jews\nAnother protester named Suzanne suffered\nA said the president's a visit is not something that people here want he has promoted more negativity than he has support and solidarity he's fostered an administration of white supremacy and he is not welcome here in our time of morning said one of the organizers I'm of the protest I look\nThis is this is all\nCrazy and wrong\nThere was a um a comment on\nThe the buzzfeed from one of the protesters who is they're trying to say to the president not to get off the plane in Pittsburgh\nAnd the protesters said uh I'm here to honor the eleventh people that were lost to hatred and to send a message to Trump was fanned the flames of hey this partially responsible\nFor this tragedy she if they repeated enough it becomes kind of a reality in people's minds\nAnd and that is is wrong and it's despicable and it it leads to to craziness\nAn ... it it truly does I mean if someone wants to explain to me how Trump is responsible for this tragedy by a classic and I ...\nAnd and somebody who was so anti Semitic city of totally rejected Trump\nIt's outrageous enough that it can lead the kind of thing that you hear from Jim Carey who used to be a talented actor\nAnd used to be a very funny comedian\nAnd now he's just won the Charlie Chaplin award for excellence in comedy\nAnd a here's the way he accepted it in his acceptance speech listen\nModern times the\nCriticized capitalism walking by drought uh challenges and that's what we have now we have capitalism without a conscience you showed the common man being fed through gears of the brutal dehumanizing industrial age\nHe took on the American right wing of his day it's worst evils hatred of immigrants in Tempe for the truth greed and the abuse of power we are fighting those same evils today [noise]\nAnd America and the United kingdom across the globe and we need to be clear shameless snus is not and will never be a superpower [noise]\nIt is the mark of a villain kidnapping children is not what great nations do\nOkay I'm there's much more\nAnd he even dedicate this award at ... has this I mean you're talking about a flavor of ice cream that is now being marketed as a way to resist\nPresident Trump because he couldn't resist the ice cream you should resist President Trump somehow by eating\nResist peak can\nHow is any of this helpful to the Democratic party caused to the country at large\nTo sanity\nIllness and it shouldn't be indulgent should be condemned wait till you hear the way the Jim Carrey dedicate his award for excellence in comedy it's not too well known comedy star will will get to that and more with your calls coming up\nThe other part of the ways who who that is the way the way that allows the wing length along the way we don't know if I'm Around the\nWay that we were going on for how long I mean I couldn't [noise] minor\n[noise] okay this is not the way he's condemned either the bomber\nOr the synagogue killer\nThis is completely unfair and and by the way and Jake Tapper was attacked for this and he's responded\nI'm somebody I'm a road in that uh this is one of the most widely responsible uninformed downright offensive things to err on CNN and that's saying something\nJake Tapper showing his true colors by refusing to put a stop to this nonsense time to label the show not the lead with Jake Tapper but the mislead with fake tapper\nAnd then Jake responded to that by saying I immediately went to Mona Sharon and David Urban to rebut it and later in the show is we just played a Julia you off he apologized and took it back well she still apologizing she was on MSNBC\nWith Chris Matthews yesterday and a talking\nI don't know which side of the issue she's on now but again talking is the idea of nationalism listen\nLet me go to a ... Julia you know I thought that's what a lot about history I World war two was the turning point that was the simulation of Catholics Jews the Dutch and we got through the door because of all the service our fathers and grandfathers fought in that war all of them you should see the\nThe star of David children articles cemetery and all those tunes it's unbelievable\nAnd along with the crush it I just thought that was the door open\nBut now I Wonder about certainly not universally in this country\nAnd it's interesting you mention World War two because when Donald Trump said that he was a national asked she didn't just off the cops have an ...\nSaid well I have an old fashioned world word and I know I'm not supposed to say it well the reason it's an old fashioned word and the reason you're not supposed to head because national haven't let us to to World War and tens of millions of people dead and horrible horrible ways including and Holocaust\nShow there's a reason for that stigma and hand what kind of dredging that up\nAnd apply it to himself as the president of the United states has you know as we used to say the leader of the free world as frankly horrifying\nOkay is it fair to compare American nationalism to nationalism for Hitler's Germany\nOr an imperial Japan\nThat an absurdity and utterly wrong\nOr we will get to that and I'm more on the ... the show plus a horrifying new poll\nThat says most college students are afraid to challenge liberal professors we'll be right back\nKeep it right here on AM eight seven events are we\nIn Monrovia and the two ten
