let me explain what I Do I've had so many times over the years that started losing need the ability within back legs however the rest of them was pretty good to be no just because they're incontinent you know that that never bothered me okay\nUm so what I Would recommend that you may want to do is take one of our old leashes go buy some ... skin is available all over the place [noise]\nTake the ... can put it on a leash and just give her a little bit more support to help her up and down now there are if you go to a uh pets with disabilities or are handicapped Hector many items specifically need for older dogs\nAnd older cats to help them in their their\nTheir chronologically challenged years to one of the things I've done with so many my dogs over the years is that they just couldn't get up and down the way they used to so I Would actually use that that ... sheep skin on a leash to help them go up and and you know it's amazing how how sometimes they come in and say wow I'm standing again I can prove began I compete again maybe there's a little life left\nBut here's the bottom line fourteen Fifteen Years old the only one that can make a decision whether or not to to say goodbye or have your dog cross the rainbow bridge burning issue and I do this every day with Cisco\nI sit down I look in the eyes I have the conversation and when you're a dog is ready to cross the

reverse sneezing and costs nose bleeds nasal discharge\nBut generally if not that that that horrible so it's something you need to work on what you've got to get onto a nasal scraping to find out exactly it is in fact nasal might but\nThat's something you'd have to talk about that that's above my pay grade his behaviors but I got to tell you over the years I worked in many dogs that they'd have nasal my thing and if you take him to the vet it's something that can easily be taken care of\nMy own home all day long long long long long long long long long Hong Kong and control\nYeah you

Manhattan beach area Newberry park we get all your calls I promise I got to answer that question eight six six eight Seventy Carol a eight six six eight seven zero five seven five to\nHer to give some of this away just a few minutes ago he heard me give away exactly some him see oil now there's all kinds of companies out there with him see oil for your pets right now\nThe company I trust is a company I've been working with well over Twenty years it's called nature that they are located right here in Tibet you California and when it comes to helping your pets and keeping them healthy I got to tell you nature that is the company to go to places when it comes to any type of of supplement for your pet\nNow here's what I Would I Want to talk about okay they have four different him see oil products is hemp seek calming oil which will actually sued upset stomachs\nAnd Egypt pets digestion is hemp seat and joined how would you just heard me give away which has the consummate NSM vitamin C. vitamin C I F ... as well as Yucca to help him you'd have\nAs well as ... allergic but I'd like you do for the local independent pet store\nAnd ask for nature that temps either oil products when you go to nature that dot com or Amazon dot com if you want to use him see oil and people are really singing the praises of temps either out the only company I recommend with them so you don't have products is nature that so check it out in nature that dot com or Amazon dot com\nThe response I've been getting his amazing hemp seeds are may be exactly what you're a dog needs more an expert in this that show\nBut I've painter she's fine [noise] but my elder kitten is not at all happy my elder cat\nI Would tell me about tell me with this market distracting me not happy\n[noise] ah first of all she stopped using her letter about okay and she went on a hunger strike for a while okay now I've calmed down said that she's using her litter box\nAnd she's eating [noise] but she won't have anything to do it this kitten and the kitten of course wants company\nTo have you done any sense flopping with the cats at all what does that\nOur okay see in other words cats don't recognize each other by looks they recognize and adjust to each other by smell so what I Want you to do is take a a either a stuffed animal or a wash bought the rubber all over the kitten\nTake a stuffed animal and wash cross the rub it all over the older cat\nThen take that take the one from the kitten and rub it on the older cat take the wants the older cat and rub it on the kitten this way they are living with each other smell for a couple of days without feeling the threat of seen each other then what I recommend doing is bringing them together for a short period of time maybe one person sitting on one end of the couch and other person sitting on the other end of the couch\nJust holding them when they ignore each other that's enough for that day the next day a little bit more if every time they are together in in something positive\nAnd nothing negative little by little they will adjust to each other listen you're talking to someone who had as many as thirty feral cats at one time I looked the way I Do is not an easy task from your diet\nAnd they all got along but it happened overnight absolutely not and then I have a glass of bourbon with when I was probably yes but the bottom line is

as I said this is the worst flea season ever you need to bottle of a fleet comb\nYou know I think it stop because I went through a divorce about showing up years ago\nAnd ... come to think of it my daughter was just asking her she's in the car with me right now I think that's one that started with my ex wife laugh\nVery very very common listening carefully I'm gonna explains exactly to you over the years I get calls like this all the time with a cat it's been perfect but all of a sudden a divorce separation comes into play and there's a change in behavior I'm assuming the cat like your wife\nYeah\nOkay so what happens when your wife leaves\nYour cat using the litter box is not going to help your wife find her way back home but by not using the litter box in ... and other locations in the home and leaving he sent there it's his way of leaving the sense so in fact your wife can find her way home that makes sense to you\nKnow you're white but she only ... only\nDoesn't make any ... doesn't make any difference pee or poop it's still a way of territorial claim okay so where is she going is there a specific areas she's going in\nYeah and there is a litter box in that location or they're they're in a letter in the location underneath the dining room table and then there's the litter box another one\nIn uh the uh you know ...\nOkay but the small the smaller cat is using the litter box no problem\nYeah no problem and then we put her litter box where the big cat does she go on go to the dining room table I heard a litter box there she still won't\nYou okay there's a couple of things that concern me at this point very often when someone moves out of a house cat becomes stressed\nWhen a cat becomes stressed they can often become constipated where they can get diarrhea\nAnd if the cat when your wife if the cat started having pain because it was constipated and had direct the litter box that's enough right there to get the cat not using the litter box anymore here's what I Want you to do what I like you to do is I Want you to take the litter box you have now put it in a garage go out and buy yourself a brand new metal box today\nI Am going to send you some Lucy pets cat incredible cap and it's an amazing cat litter when I Want you to do is take that put that in the new litter box but also what I'd like you to do is just take a little bit of the cat's poop and put that underneath\nThe cat's incredible later in the litter box or the center strong in the litter box right off the bat\nThat's why I think we should be at this time I also want to make sure that any areas where the cat is had accidents you clean up with a product called kids in pet staying in order remover you can get that Iran is on you can get it on my Web you can get a lot of different places\nBut right now the most important thing is let's change the litter let's put the scent of hurt in that new rather just a little bit of it we're just a little bit of it\nAnd I think that will resolve the problem for it sounds to me like there's some associated pain with when your wife left not only psychological physiological as well which would be right on target for divorce situation\nOkay what are just I Know that is so great thank you so much that I think I think you hit the nail on the here\nLet me ask you just real 'cause they're super busy but I'm a so get rid of so I have the two litter boxes so basically get rid of the water under the dining room table and put new litter and where the old\nWidow right when you go back to the litter box if you want but right now

repeat it for you guys grab a pencil pays hundred three hundred Ninety three hundred\nAnd you can find out if we take your insurance we do take Medicare cigna and the blue Cross Blue shield United Health care and for people without insurance\nWe take something called care credits like a credit card the we can help you get\nFor a medical issues and I think you don't pay and you don't pay any interest on it for a year [noise]\nUm no the techniques that I use her called regenerative medicine that means that I injected the body with your own cells that I take from your body\nAnd that stimulates the to shoot to grow back so instead of doing surgery [noise] like this person that question me about uh they're having problems going up and down the stairs without pain and they're planning on a hip replacement I Would tell them to never get a hip replacement\nUnless the hip is fused and that's where that happens but I Do occasionally get a patient that comes in and I tell them I cannot help them this is not a magical cure we do take your bone marrow for severe cases\nAnd the bone marrow has many wonderful growth factors in it it also has platelets in it and it also has stem cells and stem cells are sort of the talk of the town today we read about it every day in the newspaper [noise]\nWe read about I'm pro athletes that are getting it done to save their careers but\nIt's something that's so easy to do once I ... the area and we take the bone marrow from the area on the pelvis it's above the buttocks fun signed up with some light it can it generally takes me on an average patient about Fifteen seconds\nTo pull it out put a needle into the bone and has spread out the bone marrow\nAnd then um we inject\nSo it's pretty simple and um I've been doing this work in regenerative medicine for about Twenty years and I use it on my body every time I injure myself and you'd think I'd get smarter but I don't that I still overused my body when I Know I'm going to have an injury\nBut then I just inject myself I'm In pretty good shape [noise]\nSo um I Can't answer this question about um\nWhether this will work for this person until I examine them if they've got some ranged emotion and the leg and if they're going upstairs they probably have pretty decent range of motion we can probably help\nThere's never a promise in this work there's um you know you have to make somewhat of a leap of faith because we're trained since we're a little kids to think surgery is the answer for healing\nAnd now the studies show that it is not the best thing for you and it is a good thing to regenerate the tissue by using your own cells in your own body [noise]\nSo what do you think NATO\nWell I think it's important for people to understand that distinction between ... treatment that is less invasive as pets just rolling into surgery because it's been sort of the party line for many decades\nAnd uh this is a climate in which we should all be more active in our health care and research and go to different types of practitioners and find out what's going on\nYeah and um the way I woke up was in my fourth year medical school I injured my shoulder\nDoing bench presses and I was doing orthopedic surgery at the time and I could worst literally course my boss to operate on me right away because that's what we did 'em all day long and I was like this so cool you know we're fixing people [noise]\nAnd um I woke up from the surgery and my arm was swollen like a balloon full of fluids and I had a high temperature and ah it took a couple of years before that shoulder quieted down to its pre pre surgery state of being miserable and never never got better it got worse\nThan that I learned about regenerative medicine and I mean it's kind of a weird story I got a syringe full of um [noise] well we used in the old days which was the proof therapy solution [noise] and I hopped into bed with my wife who's watching TV and I injected my shoulder and she was\nNot happy about that are using some expletives about what the heck was I doing to myself [laughter] and I\nLiterally woke up the next morning completely pain free I never needed that surgery and um it healed my shoulder my shoulder was good for twelve years after that and then I re injured and the next time it took me a couple of injections healed it again\nAnd then some years later I did re injured then had to inject it several times to get it back in shape but my shoulders perfect\nAnd I'm In all my buddies and also wanted to have me do another surgery and I said I Am done with surgeries I'm going to live my life\nAnd guide my patients to stay away from surgery and uh it's been a great career I've had I still have it\nAnd I wake up every day so excited to be in my office with my patients and save them from surgery so please consider if you're considering surgery please consider doing something so easy\nAnd simple which is to just get an injection with your own blood cells platelets for if you have something that's a little bit more intense\nSome kind of arthritis you may want to go to just using your bone marrow are very simple procedure\nSeeing that fit\nSays our tenth anniversary of working together here on living pain free if you're just joining the show the fifth inning pain free with Dr Marc arrow and we are taking your calls at one eight six six eight seven zero five Seventy five to we are here at ten am on Saturdays and one PM on Saturdays\nAnd we'd love to hear from you and we know that\nMillions of people across the country are in ... scouts offhand people have arthritis the flats hip pain neck pain you were just sharing of that question with health hip replacement so to give us a call that number again is one eight six six eight seven zero five seven five to five\nJob I got one about a neat name and your age\nWe do get literally more knees than anything else uh because people have two of them [laughter]\n[laughter] that's found a\nAnyway this person's says I have chronic problems in my right knee which recently worsened MRI was performed and replacement suggested that this is a big fallacy that I Love talking about on the show\nYou don't operate because an MRI tells you something\nThe studies are replete with evidence that says you cannot believe an MRI meaning memorized show you anatomy but they can be wrong number one and number two they don't tell you where the pain is being generated from [noise]\nSo yeah I don't know what the samurai so that it might have said the person has arthritis in light of all here let me read the rest of it quite a few other arthritic problems with this is the primary issue just now please advise thank you [noise] um\nYeah so the ... not going to tell you where your pain is coming from I Am so sorry to inform you folks if you had an MRI and the doctor said you needed surgery and you have the surgery and it didn't work\nIt's because the MRI should not be the guy that\nIt's okay to use an MRI and get an MRI and I like to see them because sometimes they're hidden issues like a cancer\nAnd we want to find out about that for him or her eyes are overly sensitive many times we get people who have an ACL rupture that's the anterior cruise ship ligament and an e damn I showed it\nThe surging goes in and he goes whoa the ACL is intact\nSo the hammer eyes are overly sensitive they are not going to tell you what is truthful and they're not going to tell you where pain is coming from so be careful don't get a surgery because of an MRI [noise]\nUm but any rate uh this person with a chronic pain\nIf that news moving there is a great chance that we can help heal it up using platelets from your blood or using your bone marrow which has platelets stem cells excess almost growth factors all kinds\nAnd uh my body is a living testament\nTo um you know the fact that this regenerative medicine technique I've been doing is an amazing procedures miracle so don't think that one treatment is going to do the job [noise]\nSometimes it takes several sometimes it takes one but often it takes more [noise] uh let me think about my body I have done both of my elbows\nBest thing to do is call her office at eight hundred three hundred Ninety three hundred and get an insurance verification will do that on the spot for you and they're actually people by the phones right now so you can call during the show or after the show to see if we do take your insurance for that\nOkay sounds good 'cause it's very complex today the insurance situation how about if we let people know about the vampire facelift and idea\nThat's a great idea yeah yeah I'm the two things that I'm a I'm not directly involved with in my practice I Do the orthopedic part but my wife Michelle Daryl who is very beautiful\nDoes the vampire facelift she's a nurse practitioner and believe it or not she does it on her own face\nThat's a very simple technique we draw your blood spin it and take the platelets out of inject them into the face and the ... the college and then makes people look more useful instantaneously pretty much\nAnd then we can also takes themselves and use that on the face and the other thing that she monitors is the ideal protein diet that we use mainly for people that have lower extremity pain I refer them over for that\nAnd if you've got the pain and you're overweight don't get mad at me when I tell you that if you lose weight your knees can feel better\nEvery pound on the tongue we're above\nIs about four pounds of bio mechanical pressure on than

six six eight seven zero five seven five two\nAnd a took me five years to write that book because it's mainly a compilation of research done in layman's terms to show why surgery is no longer the answer for muscular skeletal pain\nAnd why regenerative medicine is the new up and coming healing agent\nAnd Dr down takes ... skeletal system pain thatch neck pain hip pain knee pain joint pain muscle pain Kennan pain ... pain\nFrisk pain how about pain second name on the parts of the body if you how many doctors [laughter]\nThat's good you're in an Adam is now on the show for send your yes exactly [laughter] so again you know we've actually been doing the show we had Dr gene first yes uh when you were still a baby and a show's been going on for about Seventeen years\nThat's amazing well let's see I don't I don't know I don't know how I uh [laughter] I've done is pretty amazing ... she go to Robert who has the hip pain in Santa Clarita yes\nHey Robert ... how are you today [noise] I'm good how are you doing\nI'm living it up man I'm always the [noise]\nYou sound like you're down in the well are you driving or on a Bluetooth\nOld over ... got on my own directly affect them just real quick question on experience I've ever done 'em and I wanted to find out between now and there are together and\n\nUm how long has the the hip pain bothered you for\nOh probably four or five were with it\nYeah I Gotcha how are you able to walk around she's your leg move\nYes there are going to walk around the city are you sort of the doubt for any amount of time comes back\nOkay so they're still good cartilage left in your joints so that's good news as long as you're moving the joint and this is something that you should hear about in case you do go to a doctor [noise] we get new patients every day who say they have bone on bone\nMeaning that there's no cartilage left and I move 'em around and examine them and they've got plenty of cartilage left\nIt just the doctor is I'm thinking that I have a replacement needs to be done because that's what they do for a living\nAnd it's like I always laugh and tell patients what do you get if you go to a to a a barber haircut [laughter] so you know if you if you go to a surgeon you're not going to get cells from your body re injected to grow tissue you're going to have to shoot cut out it's just with the with the rise of surgery was\nAnd it was hard wait where paint is is that is there something that goes with that I talk about are\nYou talking about waiting or are you talking about extra fat on\nYour body weight yeah\nYeah that's got to go man for a lot of reasons out so you know it's not healthy and ... the problem with weight is not only that it affects the joints negatively causes pain that causes arthritis and in the joints ...\nThemselves helpless before the laws and then jumped\nShow yeah I'll tell you I'll tell you what I what happens in my office almost every person I suggest to lose weight says okay I'll lose the weight and then I'll come back so\nThat's never happened in Twenty years because the impetus to lose the weight the artist to lose the weight this to start the treatment now and everybody loses weight that\nGuy who's a fast we have a diet called ideal protein the average weight loss is about Fifteen pounds among people said well that's too much weight to lose in a month ago why what's what's the big deal about losing Fifteen pounds in a month I did that died as an experiment for one week\nI'm pretty skinny to start with and I lost seven pounds in one week ... people goes well that's not healthy but what's not healthy about getting rid of fat\nThat keeps your insulin Hi what's actually being so high that causes the fact of physicians and the high insulin causes all kinds of diseases including cancer and heart disease and other things [laughter]\nSo we want to keep our insulin low we want to cut the ... out of our life and it's easy to do it on the protein vegetables\nAnd water that's basically it and believe it or not you can eat fat to lose weight because eating fat keeps your insulin low and insulin as the storage hormone if you're raising your insulin you're in a store fat [noise]\nIf you're eating fat your insulin is low than you are going to get your own fast and loose and lose is if there is no yeah so no you don't have to lose weight for me to treat you but it helps heal quicker\nAnd I wanted I'd rather than the weight right now it's just that I'm just trying to see if they're in that process I could also do some self I'll give you\nA call apps and not only could you but this is the time I Would suggest that you start doing it because you'll lose the weight a lot faster when you're getting treatment you have a real impetus to get the job done\nAnd then one of the quick question if someone is already out of surgery and the search yeah now if you have to have another one that that person without going through surgery then or is that something\nAbsolutely we have a female and make up a number I don't know probably half of our patients have had a field surgery and we heal them up using platelets from their blood or bone marrow

its normal anatomical position\nUm that sometimes can work and help you sleep\nBut we would probably use platelets from your blood and I said something before that I Want to qualify a little bit I said if your arm can move we can help you if you do have a he's a capsule light us for frozen shoulder we can also help you\nIt's just that if the shoulder is locked up because of severe advanced arthritis than we might not be able to help you and then I get patients like that occasionally a lot of people do come in with arthritis and we can help them the main thing that I always say is I Need

tales they have a couple of minutes left [noise] don't delay if you're in pain for hate to see yourself for another day in pain [noise] what do you think let me do this quick\n[noise] we are seeing all the money we are in a\nMan you are you have done a long well hello hello hello and welcome back to money matters more race but of course I Am your host and Malaysia and then we'll be talking about anything in the world a personal finance not met ... tax\nPlanning Social Security estate planning you name it we talk about it and we try to have more fun than a human being should be allowed to have one talking about all of this boring financial stop and this week going to be no exception because we have an absolutely fantastic show lined up for you\nBut before we go one step further let me introduce myself I Am ... writes\nThe host money matters with Ken were raped\n[noise]\nJak I've been in the financial services business now for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting you [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd I do and all of the idea that we talk about on the show these are the same idea that we talk about with our love it and most valued clients\nAnd uh as at the end of last month we not work with over a thousand families in forty three states we are honored we are privileged and recently parents named more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred financial advisors in the United states\nAnd this is actually the sixth year in a row and without our clients that would be nowhere so thank you thank you thank you I Hope you guys listen to the show right now are having an absolutely fantastic weekend I Hope everything is coming up roses for you and we have a great show so let me go over with you [noise]\nWhat we're gonna talk about on this our weekly excursion into the land a personal finance chairman show for you and I we absolutely do add so\nAs money matters are from his grown and I've just mentioned that we have a we were not work with over eight thousand families what I've also come to realize is that we have a great responsibility to those clients\nAnd you know when I first started this business back when I was a a you know I said I've been as business now for twenty nine years so I was actually four years old when we started and when I was four years old\n[laughter] yeah I didn't quite you know I I never didn't think that we would be where we are today but I actually also didn't really think about that we are going to be where we are today I just kind of went with it and you know as things progressed to just kept on going so now as it's as always would come to where we are\nI've come to the point where I realized that we have a responsibility do all these families that we work with and so one of the things that I thought about was you know you don't want your financial advisory firm to die before you do that that would be a bad\nThing right so one of the things that we decided to do was that we would have what we called decision one hundred [noise] envision one hundred is that a hundred years from now we want our for our money matters to be as strong as not stronger as it is today\nSo how do you do that how do you build a company that's going to be here a hundred years from now serving our current clients their families down the line and all of those kinds of things and so to do that\nI studied a variety of companies that have been in business for a hundred years to see how they did it because if you think about it the last hundred years have been you know fraught with all kinds of things we had world wars\nWe've had a you know bad economic times we had boom times technology's changed I mean everything it's like all kinds of stuff that happened but yet these companies endured and so what was it that enabled them to endure\nAnd so I Want to take you this uh this week on on this show on that journey but I'll apply it to you because I think the the life lessons that you can learn\nIn terms of having a business is going to endure for a hundred years or longer or the same life lessons that you can apply in your personal life and in your financial life and then you're investing life because we're a financial advisory firm\nSo it'll it sounds kind of a you know philosophical this week but I think we're going to bring it home to where you can use it in your life but I think also the lessons that we can learn from it will be will be good All right so the first thing then is I Want to tell you as a as a from\nWhat we've decided is that we have to go so I think in life for you to be able to progress in a way that helps you to be happy that helps you to achieve what you want I think you have to set goals you have to say what are the things that I Want to\nTom polish so in a financial advisory firm that would be you know what our what's our mission statement what our two goals and for us the two goals are that we want our clients to have financial peace of mind\nThat's number one we want them to relax we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision okay so we want to make sure that you have financial peace of mind but then secondly we want your money to last as long as you do\nOkay so our financial goal there is that an philosophically how that would apply to you\nIs that\nWhen you retire we specialized work with people who are retired retiring soon so when you retire it it's it's easy to be in the same mode that you've been for the last Thirty years as you've been accumulating which is growth mode\nAnd while growing is important\nKeeping the growth that you have accumulated is now even more important okay because if you suddenly take a huge loss like in a bear market or something like that or you make a bad beer or a financial decision you make a mistake you do something you invest badly\nThen what could happen is that you will not achieve the two goals that we have right one is\nPeace of mind financially [laughter] if you just lost your money you're you're you're not financially or they have peace of mind and then secondly that your money last as long as you do to be hard to do that if you take large losses\nSo that ties directly into our whole philosophy of managing money for clients and I think it should be your so if you're retired or retiring suits you should be thinking in that mode so how do you build a company that's going to last a hundred years how you build something that indoors and and and in your life it could be how do you build a legacy that endorse\nWill the important thing is that you need to have what ... what are what what I've called core values what are the things that you stand for\nYou know what are the things that you say these are ... and they stand the test of time in other words a hundred years from now they will be as true then as they are today\nAnd in your family what I Would say is these are your morals these are what you your your values you know what what what makes what what what are your beliefs what are the things that you teach your kids your grandchildren that are important if they're going to have a successful life\nOkay so in our for our we have ten core values and I just want to tell you about core value number one first and then a core value number six of core value number one is\nThe right thing to do is always the right thing to do this one was taught to me by my mom\nAnd every time I talked to my mom and I had a moral dilemma or I had a question like that her answer was Kenny the right thing to do is always the right thing to do and I hated her for doing that because\nI wanted her to give me the answer and she would say if if you have to ask you already know what the answer is you already know what the right thing to do is just do that and you'll always be okay\nSo that's the first thing always do the right thing to do is always the right thing to do\nThis the core value number six is never sacrificed honesty for growth\nAnd what I mean by that is you know everybody wants to grow everybody wants to succeed everybody wants to you know have more money or have more prestige or you know I have a successful family or whatever it may be but never ever ever since the sacrifice honesty in the pursuit of that\nNow in our world is a financial advisory firm you know I think it's all about your ethics it's about ... never putting somebody else in front of you it's about what helps somebody else eventually will help you in the in the process and not disclosing everything\nOffice skating the truth promising returns that you can't deliver all those kinds of things are not telling somebody about the downside of what their their investment strategy is all those kinds of things are sacrificing honesty for growth and if you do that will happen is eventually it'll come back to get you\nYou know so in in your life when you're looking

services business now for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years at every single one of them has had a character of its own and they've all been different and they've all been that\nAnd that this year is no exception and uh so we currently work with over eight thousand families\nSo [laughter]\nYeah yes and in forty three states which is a insane and also a you know recently a barren named more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred\nFinancial advisors in the United states actually for the six year in a row\nAnd uh I Know for a fact that if it wasn't for our clients they wouldn't even know who I Am barons and so therefore all your clients are listening right now thank you and those of you who are not clients I appreciate you listening also now on this program where we're talking about\nOur philosophy of a of a business and I think that are the philosophy of of running a business is the same philosophy that you can apply in your own life\nAnd so I think that uh this week that this week's show it was a little bit different than what I normally do but I thought it would be beneficial for those of you listening to kind of get some some\nSome of my thoughts of of the of how you do that and and to kind of frame it\nAs I mentioned we we work with eight thousand families and if you think about how many people that is\nYou know when you think of the family of grandparents do you have children and grandchildren and great grandchildren I mean ... and and spouses of all those people and and all of a sudden you're talking about a lot of people that we are responsible for helping with their finances and helping guide them and all those kinds of things\nAnd so it it dawned on me a few years ago that a ... grows we have the responsibility to make sure that our firm stays around you know the whole thing is you don't want your financial adviser for him to die before you do [noise] so [laughter]\nSo therefore uh we create it will be called vision one hundred which is we want our firm to be as strong or stronger than it is today a hundred years from now\nAnd if that's the case then uh you know our clients that we're currently serving will be taking care of and so will there down line family members et cetera et cetera so how do you do that well you have to build a company that has enduring core values just as a result of my studying of lots of companies that have succeeded to last over a hundred years\nAnd I think families so to apply this to you personally\nFamilies that have succeeded that have been healthy and have endured as well over the years are ones that have very strong morals and values that they all it here too\nAnd those are taught from one generation to the next parent teachers child child teaches\nGrant or their child et cetera et cetera and so I Want to share with you core value number nine okay so core value number nine is make a client every day that is our noble obligation\n[noise] so what does that mean well that sounds kind of like okay we'll go out and sell something\nAnd and it is I Do believe that we do need to have new clients are obviously and and the reason why I Do that is because I think what we do is noble\nIf we help people to be financially secure I think that's very noble what we do but in the broader context and how would you would apply to in your life you know I I my wife and I are about to celebrate our thirty third year of marriage\nAnd I believe in making my wife\nMy wife all over
