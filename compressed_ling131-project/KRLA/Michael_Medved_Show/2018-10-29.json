everybody wonders about what are the political implications of all this I Want to go a little bit deeper\nThan that but we'll get to that too and I want to talk about what this means about America are we coming apart are we're experiencing a total social breakdown something utterly unprecedented in and this is just the worst thing in the world\nNo we're fine we're fine\nOne of the most beautiful things I ever heard\nI really mean it was the announcement on on the media\nAnd it was based upon a statement by the Anti Defamation league which monitors anti Semitism and anti Semitic incidents they reported that the horrible attack on Pittsburgh and yes it was horrible and was nightmarish was she were evil\nThat that attack was the deadliest single attack against American Jews\nIn the nearly four hundred years that we've lived in North America\nThink about what that means\nWhat an indication of how blessed we are how unbelievably fortunate we are with this great country one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number [noise] um [noise] let me let me give you a little bit of personal perspective\nAnd I don't usually do this but this is very personal\nI'm not from Pittsburgh I'm from Philadelphia originally but of course we have friends in Pittsburgh I have war shipped at a congregations not at the tree of life synagogue but congregations in squirrel hill Pennsylvania\nWe have squirrels us as squirrels we we have friends in squirrel hill I'm sure squirrels too and in addition to the humans but um [noise]\n... ... is the the attack is devastating in this horrible and it's nightmarish\nBut uh I think perspective is a hundred percent necessary and what Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a White House press briefing I think this could be her best press briefing today\nAs she made a very important point which is when news of this attack came out the very first thing President Trump did was to condemn\nAnti Semitism extremism hatred bigotry that kind of sickness that led to this attack and the very first thing that\nMany voices in the news media did she said the media in general but it it can't generalize many voices very first thing they did\nWas to blame Trump and to blame his rhetoric and I think that stinks and I think the attempt by some radicals and they are radicals in Pittsburgh to hijack this tragedy saying that the president in the first lady won't be welcome in Pittsburgh\nBecause of their past rhetoric let me make something clear I guarantee you those people who have signed that position they're sixteen thousand of them\nDo not speak for Pittsburgh and they emphatically do not speak for the Jewish people in the United states\nI Am I found out about this\nOn Saturday morning after I walked to synagogue in and what I usually do and I mentioned this before\nOr our son and daughter in law and a almost two year old granddaughter live not far from our synagogue um I live further away so I Walk the close to three miles and then I stop in\nA with Danny in an Rochelle and Julia and maybe for a cup of tea but just to catch up on the weekend to actually see this adorable little girl\nAnd this week uh Danny walked with me from his home in the two of us walk together to synagogue\nAnd which is just literally his his houses clubs and when we got there\nOr something strange\nBecause there was a guy we know a dear friend actually Christian guy\nWho is a former marine officer a marine aviator I Know you're never a former marine you're always a marine and in Charlie's a marine\nHe's also a world famous honest or opera singer and an end or a instructor and NRA last life member and he was standing in the back of our synagogue again he's Christian he's not Jewish\nAnd I came up and bring them hey Charlie what's going on a great to see you you know what I said you haven't heard I said no what happened and he said there were a lot of people killed at a synagogue in Pittsburgh and I just wanted to come out here to help protect my friends\nAnd it was so overwhelmingly beautiful and it's such a demonstration of America\nThat this marine from Nebraska\nWould see fit now as it turns out we also have an armed security guard we also have at least five members of our congregation um and it's religiously because we have a ... an enclosure and a rover outta that they're packing\nOn there and they're also guys who are like members of the n._r._a. and they're ready so are we now\nI'm not suggesting it every congregation that country should do this but this was part of our factor and then part of what happened\nWas that um when when Danny heard the news he said well maybe I ought to go back home and tell where shall not to bring Julia because you know coming to a two year old and if you're expecting some World War three it said come on we'll we'll be fine we're fine\nAnd he said sure and and the baby came and she had a great time she played was a big girls in sort of behind the services and then we had our um our our kid is like our social after the services and everything was fine now there was there was\nOf course there are special prayers and a mention of what had happened in Pittsburgh we didn't yet know the identity\nOf the killer and this is part of of what is so horrible about this is that um\nThat this occurred on on on the Sabbath and it's ironic those we listen to a lot of this show I ended the show on friday by talking about the importance of the Sabbath and how much I was looking forward to the Sabbath and and the value of actually turning off\nA media for one day a week\nAnd it's because of turning off those media that I only found out when I actually arrived in synagogue what had happened but you know ... everybody who's Jewish pays attention to this stuff\nAnd you have in the back of your mind what's going to be necessary I I Know that that um\n[noise] to go if you ever go to synagogue in Mexico and I've gone to services in Mexico city and Los ... which is a a neighborhood with substantial Jewish community in Mexico city they're they have really heavily armed security guards and metal detectors and\nWell but that's that's basically it was Mexico such an unsafe\nWell it it's not nearly as bad as Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador and we'll be talking about the care of and in a moment to\nBut um it it is simply wrong well here's what Howard Simon said Howard find men for years of Newsweek he was commenting on MSNBC and uh this is what he said uh because I think it's it's just dead wrong and we need to answer answered back here's fine\nJust watches the Jews ... know their own history this was not a Jewish story this was an American story but says America story about the fraying of our social fabric and the rise of violence as a way of expressing yourself in this country\nThat we haven't seen the likes of modern fires if ever we've have civil wars we've had strife\nWe've never had this kind of individual violence against groups based on hey where we're seeing the bubble up now ah and that's my concern and that should be all of our concerns on this morning\nOkay that's ridiculous it is ridiculous\nThe first in modern times and still in some ways most horrifying killing at a place of religious sanctity was the four little\nGirls who were killed in Birmingham and in the Obama administration of course we have this horrible horrible Charleston episodes and then before countless Ryan said riots in Tulsa, Oklahoma\nCity killed about three hundred African American people left ten thousand African Americans homeless destroyed thirty five square block that was Nineteen Twenty one\nHave no idea what Mr find minutes talking about\nWe're both change this is not the edge of destruction or the eve of destruction

to be viewed as certain groups and certain people that that ... he he's he's correct there shouldn't be that kind of hatred toward anyone and by the way one of the names that has to be mentioned in this context as Farrah Khan\nWho recently compared a Jews to termites in infestation of past and um look at a Farrakhan for years and years and years has been spewing this anti Semitic garbage and yet he is honored by people on the left\nHe was recently seated at a place of honor two seats away from Bill Clinton former president at a reserve Franklin funeral and Farrakhan just like this guy Robert Ballard should be stricken from polite ... conversation\nBecause of course ... to to talk about\nCriticism of one group or another group that is free speech but when you go into Nazi tropes and you

community center he just brought his grandson there and the grandson was killed two for a singing audition they were doing a program at the Jewish community center yeah\nWell that's precisely what
