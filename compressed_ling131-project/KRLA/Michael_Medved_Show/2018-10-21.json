it was there was a dollar figure that had to come into his account and has to pay taxes every single year\nNow when he did the math on it\nHe said well you know what I really don't want\nFifteen thousand a year by the time he was done he was going to put about a thousand a month in his pocket I said look with a thousand a month you can do this you can do that what you know there's lots of choices one of those is to pay off your house a little sooner that'd be great\nOne of those would be to to say for your child's college because you know not sure if you're going to go to college they can set it into this account and if they don't go to college and just use it to pay off your bills half your house but a lot of ideas and so he was going through his own little plan and his\nHis ideas that he laid out by the time he was done who set up just give me a check for three fifty\nI said well you're not going to get three fifty he says yeah yeah yeah I Know I'm going to get about two hundred and five thousand by the time it's done\nI said you're going to give a hundred and forty five thousand dollars for the government\nCan hear his words folks\nAnd you need to remember these as if they're tattooed on the inside of your island\nHere says words he said\nI never worked for the money so what does it matter to me anyway two hundred thousand in my pocket is better than a thousand dollars a month\nI went whoa\nThat's it that's the ... the anthem that's the national anthem of somebody else worked for the money and give it to me because it's not I didn't work for it right\nSo be careful that you're not that person that's going to give money\nTo somebody who doesn't understand a respected you know we had a client that uh\nThat was ill in fact you're terminal cancer both her husband passed and then shortly followed but both with terminal cancer and she was fighting chemo and she was going through some of the treatment and she was at home or I took one of my assistance with me we went to her house because we knew that the kids were going to inherit about two million dollars\nAnd there were five kids and grandkids and so there was a bunch of people so by the time it was all done it wasn't going to be millions to any one person\nBut it was certainly a big chunk of money that we wanted to protect and I didn't want these folks to not think of it as valuable\nSo we went to her house and we did a a videotape we did a digital recording of hurt me asking her questions it was probably about twenty or thirty minutes long and it was what did you and Dave due to earn this money what did you guys have to do\nAll when we were working early in our industry\nWe saved we had furniture that was your cardboard boxes we got\nThe prostate and of course the lungs will start a little bit of explanation about that\nAh of course the bladder the urinary tract\nThe prostate in the lungs all have in common mucus membranes\nAnd you're going to see very quickly that support across the board and maybe the vitamin D three that you need because\nThere's been so much discovery there as to what's going on and we're going to get into that in just a little bit but let's start with the bladder and the urinary tract and many times\nPeople are getting up at night here and it it kind of disturbs sleep then it's not terrible but it's aggravating\nWhen you don't feel as rested in the morning and it starts in fairly innocuous Lee whether you're male or female and often all the body needs is a little more in the way of ...\nAnd while one of the power houses for delivering about five hundred different ... is our pollen the floor\nAnd it's the best source that I've found and this of course maybe taking two of these three times a day for a few weeks see if it doesn't hit the spot and work perfectly for you or if so\nGreat then after about three or four weeks most people can cut down to one or two per day\nAnd that can be just exactly what you need in terms of these ... who heads\nThe sometimes the bladder you've gone on a long time with this and uh the bladder is I'm not happy in fact bio films can form these are sick\nSticky sugary sex stuck on the mucus membrane like dried music is very hard and the best bet in helping the body\nTo clear this is the active fractions from garlic Alice said and of course that's rich in the ah garlic citing product so this may be just what you need is to uh maybe take some bladder support because it's\nEngineered to target nutrients toward the bladder\nAnd to provide all the broad spectrum of need for the bladder tissue and then uh maybe taking two or three bladder support right along with two or three girl aside and support\nMaybe just what you need for the cases where you might have a little bio film and of course these mild films if they do form\nAnd they form when we leave the problem go for a long time that's\nWhen we really want to and get help with the bio film and of course they can be formed by almost any age so bladder support battling with garlic side and can be a big help there and this is shifting gears\nGoing from the simplest help to a more sophisticated support for\nThe bladder and the urinary tract so today will have an special pollen deplore garlic aside and so just give a bus to our or to line eight hundred three Seventy thirty four\nForty seven eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven let's go right\nTo the phones ... about Marshall PHD this has helped line live let's go to one in Miami and he's got a question about magnesium is linked to blood pressure go ahead and one\nCommercial thank you I was going you because I had to go on our string for an Iron Man I I Do enjoy sports and while extreme eyesight developing my check and make a long story short adequate to the hospital and get a budget cuts\nAnd then after many cats they discovered that I had the crash\nAt that time I watched in their eye tremendous amount of stress and our strength for the sport I haven't read anything about ... you might get annoying about it and I I got an economic issue and I got pregnant and actually I thought that the medication\nQuestion that I had it how do I know um if we can wipe it out of high blood pressure I I got kind I don't know how to today what because I was like when I look at my cash no way to show when like me she let her\nKnow it won't end the reason is that um blood tests the magnesium are pretty much useless\nBecause I'm magnesium is held in the blood by adrenaline and in my opinion it's unlikely that the magnesium was the problem or it's more likely that you sweat very heavily\nYou depleted salt\nYou ate food that may have had bugs in it and it got carte blanche to the circulatory tree\nThat's the most common phenomena\nThat links us to a issues with blood pressure's so could it be magnesium yeah but it'd be real hard to tell you could go in a good drugstore now stick your arm in there and see what your blood pressure is no costs no obligation\nTo get an idea of where you are now what I see over and over again with athletes like you is you sweat very heavily ... and you're not paying attention to salt\nNow most Americans in my opinion to eat too much salt\nBut athletes especially in ... athletes anybody doing anything and orange often deplete salt so the way you can test this one is when you break a sweat you'll reach over to the upper outer part of your arm and taste the perspiration\nShould tea you taste slightly salty\nNot anybody else you if it doesn't you need to take a teaspoon of salt like air dried sea salt or better yet are pink so\nFor two or three days until\nYou break the sweat and you can taste it then I Would cut back and I monitor that so I always have a slightly salty taste [noise] now you have plenty of hydrogen Laura casket and no little bug can get past your stomach okay\nNow if you're still want to support healthy blood pressure and when you go and check your blood pressure\nYou may want to go on something like cardio PJ how old are you know how much the way\nI'm forty five and I weigh a hundred and eighty pounds\n... show you'd want probably about ... four teaspoons of cardio PG then you would use that for about four months\nAnd that's designed to promote the best health for the circulatory tree and then if you maintain your salt but you're getting old enough that salt might not even do the job for you\nYou really probably should begin taking a couple of quantum died just at the start of Maine cooked meals\nAnd then at the end of the meal or maybe three to four detain hydro chloride\nNow you have the ... times you had a twenty and nothing gets passed those guys\nSo I think you may be fooled by what's going on here okay I'm magnesium is famous for heart rhythm and for any issue with heart rhythm I'm but I'm not so much for the blood pressure itself\nOK okay thank you very much you can buy them\nAll right let's go right back to the phones let's go to Kristen in California and they're trying to conceive Liz nine months and the fertility ... husband has a very ... right are you there Kristen\nAnd how old is your husband\nCan so what does the doctor recommend for this\nShift our laws are falling to see\nA fairly that show [noise] [noise] [noise]\nIt's amusing to me they didn't let you know all the options\n[laughter]\nThis is because sometimes is selling one option and not another um but you know you read proverbs it says through the council of many wise men was plans of made so you know just listen to one guy\nIncluding including me okay however\nI have no financial axe to grind okay which is quite different so I agree that there could be a circulatory issue\nI don't agree that the circulatory issues solution is necessarily that surgery\nIt may be that he played sports and he's had his incurred an interference field an injury to his low back toward to the ... for it to the tail bones\nThat is the dating the normal energy flows through that area and the first thing that should be done is to look for that because what will happen if you do the surgery is you will now for sure\nI'm six four seven check it every day for a long time and it ...\nAnd then it's not possible for you to have you had so something's wrong here holding that ph with the moon new or something like that I Would double the amount of minerals and see if the ph crashes down to five\nThat does then you know you've been using ... to but for the urine and you've got a problem with that to the gum problems some\nSome chronic issue somewhere you've got to find that's holding the immune system and they show old burgers like the one you've experienced can re surface spoken\nTo see the ad him and now let's go back to the double vision them if indeed were making money and then we're going to have all kinds of problems with sensory perceptions\nAnd of course division is going to be one of the biggies so um my immediate suspicion is that something is severely irritating the optic nerve show what we need to do is get you on\nWell first of all you should be on I support\nIt because everybody needs that but that's not what we need to hear what we need to hear his nerves support\nSo you'll get on something called nerve support your very small woman so to pre meal will be plenty you should see some some help\nAlmost immediately within three four days you should also see that that your pitches a false ph show there's some rotten to something we've got to find and get rid of\nOkay\nTake care thank you come by [noise]\nAll

right this is talk to about ... health plan live and uh I Do want to cover one last aspect of today's subject and that has been to discuss the prostate urine or attract but\nAlso of course we wanted to touch on the lungs and the lungs a or giant mucus membranes and of course the actually in Chinese medicine the backup to your large intestine show when we're not adjusting well\nWe can expect jump to be dumped into the lungs and all manner of problems can arise with the lungs and in almost every case what we have to start with is to improve digestion when we promote the best\nWe can greatly reduce the load on the lungs when we get vitamin D levels to the ideal maybe sixty to a hundred ... leader in the blood just about no one who's wearing clothing\nHas a really ideal vitamin D three level and it's been shown to be involved in literally all of the immune compounds the body makes it's been shown to be very critical to the intestinal lining\nThe integrity of the lining to the health of the lungs and so much more so than jumping on R D three gold and maybe using six to ten drops a day if you're under forty\nUsually can absorb this really well\nIf you're over forty than it might be a good idea to put those six to ten drops into a half ounces of water and he had two or three or four drops of Lyman ... that's an essential oil of orange mix it really good and now it takes a deep three to ... tiny little\nDots and it makes it really is impulsive buys it so it makes it really easy for you to absorb it and get its maximum help for the intestines and for the lungs when another wonderful thing that can be done is dragging the Clintons LAX\nBecause of the extraordinary ability for the this clay to bind to a wide variety of toxins and the GI track and it can trap these toxins in about keep them there keep them from hitting the bloodstream and hitting the lungs and\nThen they can be excrete it and not re absorbed by the body said today we'll have our deep three gold on special you buy one get the second one fifty percent off\nBut also have are dragging Clinton's LAX give a bus tour would align\nEight hundred three Seventy five thirty four forty seven minutes eight hundred three Seventy thirty four\nForty seven All right this is Dr Bob Marshall pitch Davis has health mine live or answering your\nNutrition and health related calls he reaches toll free triple eight\nFive eight eight Seventy five Seventy Sixers go right back to the phones let's go to Richard in Boulder, Colorado and he's bloating and wants to track down the source of is intestinal gas are you there Richard [noise]\nYes I Am doc thanks for taking my call\nIraq I'm how old man or even how much do you I'm\nForty three about one Seventy eight\nThe odds are that the intestinal gas now is from either the gall bladder or your stomach is not able to produce enough hydro Cora gas it and those are the two culprits normally with intestinal gas does the gas you have to have an older\nWhite as it ever okay well that is going to tell you that fats and proteins are being are rotting and so we now highly suspect they she oh so do you have bloating almost immediately after you eat\n[noise] I think so I notice if I'm getting liquids for example um I'll do raw milk fair I don't really seem to have anything any of it that allows\nSmoking or non stop there say raw food does not require any digestive enzymes so that I Know no need for aid shell or anything so you got to exclude those we got to deal with the cooked food\nOkay yeah so yes so that what happened is I've been taking ac out like maybe two or three and an actor there mhm I'm immediately after eating and then if I remember I was trying to take it ends up I don't use your mother\nThat probably the problem let me tell you why [laughter] well I'm not here to knock anybody else's product but normally when you buy the chain hide record it'll contain perhaps and\nThe catalyst that make it work in the stomach we know that when you mix taps and with hydrogen gas it a Hydrox or a gas it's slowly destroys the maps and\nSo we put the taps in in digest so you need to take a couple of our diet just at the start of the meal now you have pets and now the end of the meal you take the pain had record and it works like downtown\nBut I can tell you in the whole world I Am not aware of a single enzyme that works half as good as ours and I'm really I I can tell you with search the earth to get these\nIs a Japanese company that makes these they've been making them since Eighteen Ninety eight they have three airplane hangar sized buildings they supplied China they supplied so much of the world but\nIn America we're manufacturing these and we cannot manufactured to the purity of precision that they can at this time\nSo that is why and what I'm going to say to you Richard as you try ours if you don't think it's the best year ever reuse return it will give you a refund but I'm going to tell you once you get it you're hooked [laughter]\nSet in front of call that a few of them with what the first\nOne or two died just at the start of a meal even if you forget and take it at the end works almost as good in the end you would take a couple of HDL and you know that it's working because there'll be no ... on your teeth and if you have black on your teeth you know you have low Hedrick Oric as it\nOr the other problem we have as we pass forty and that includes you is that we're facing a real gall bladder crisis in America everybody has something going on with their gall bladder and what we have the news is that much of it is from eating highly heated\nOils in any food cooked over the boiling point first of all the list it's a massive white cell response so it's going to make you tired right away 'cause you won't have any red cells left which is what gives you energy\nBut also the body is chasing the is because it sees them as a problem and meal after meal we do these things plus we're getting large amounts of oil is that we can't just well\nShow what she needs to do is get on a quantum died just for something like it will give her ... and ... and two of those at the start of the meal in the end of the meal about maybe for the ...\nAnd now there's no more rotting food\nStep one game and step to the ... back those patching laws of hair is almost Fisher linked to the ... so you want to get adrenal support\nAnd she would need to take about six of those at breakfast and she would yes and use that I got yes the news that Andrew months and during that might\nNot a wind that chick I pick up for and among both only at breakfast okay\nOkay now she's got to you got to check whether it'd be sure she sleeps five straight hours or more you got to make sure good then you're going to make sure she has enough water which would be a half or waiting ounces of water so Seventy five ounces per day and she had to build up to that if she don't getting enough\nShe can increase eight ounces a day once a week until she gets the water you got to double check salt if she eats all whole food not doesn't buy any processed food then she may need a little air dried sea salt\nOr better yet are pink salt that they're dried she's all with\nThe volcanic trace elements added to it\nSo she needs to cover all of these issues she if she worries a lot about something she may need some extra be and all these things will bring her back to the center for the adrenal function okay what about ...\nOr ... that would be if she has to get up at night tier innate like for no reason why she gets up once at night well that's not good yeah then ... would be good for her\nMaybe capsules a at breakfast and shit and usually after about two three weeks\nYou'll see that the body is then able to use it to promote the best structure there and you no longer have an issue\nFor decades thank you I'm Keith\nThank you for listening to how line with us Dr Bob Marshall PHP climate nutrition lab is excited to

then see if you can work with the family\nTo eliminate all refined oils because this will allow the brain to really get\nThe ... it'll unload her gall bladder and really changed the game in terms of

three twice a day depending on what her schedule is he's a couple of things that I Would do immediately okay\nWhen did we get rid\nOf the earlier in the day the best because\nShe'll be able to

her her a confirmation that she's a\nOne one thousand twenty four\nNative American or the next to the next fun stuff that was going on this week was the same day Monday a federal judge this you know this is like a\nThe death of Farah Fawcett you know she died at the same day that Michael Jackson happened that Michael Jackson a died and uh because Michael Jackson died Farah Fawcett didn't get any attention on the day that she died\nSo a Stormy Daniels a lawsuit I guess this is good for her because not many people thought uh\nThe judge dismissed the adult film star Stormy Daniels defamation lawsuit against ... a President Trump Daniels was also or to pay presidents legal fees [noise] the crowd\n[noise] so uh hey all you guys that went on to go to nice and you've paid money for a to Stormy Daniels are a legal Defense Fund\nGuess what now that money went towards Donald J Trump's legal Defense Fund aren't you guys have sided aren't you guys decided I think it's a I think it's pretty cool background is\nWhat appeared to be an effort to keep her case at the center of the news Daniels' attorney whack job Michael ... filed a lawsuit on details we have back in April the suit alleged the Trump attempted to punish her reputation and credibility by dismissing her account and description of a man who she says threatened her in the parking lot two thousand eleven\nUh so so what happened is she said that some guy came up behind her and said oh what a cute baby it'd be it'd be a shame if if something happened to her mother and a and took off and ah that that was somebody from Trump\nAnd uh so so President Trump\nUm dismissed it he dismissed it on Twitter and he tweeted a sketch years years later about a non existent man a total conjure up playing the fake news media for schools but they know it\nAnd uh by calling the incident con job so basically basically the or the picture that she had drawn of this of the suspect\nLooks just like her ex husband\nLike I'm looking at a picture of her and her ex husband and looking at a picture of the of the ed tech to sketch\nThat's the same guy\nI mean he's it looks just like him so by calling the incentive to con job Mr Trump's statement would be understood to state that are Stephanie Clifford was\nFabricating the crime and the existence of the assailant both of which are prohibited under New York law as well as in law the law of numerous other states having any wrote in a lawsuit Daniels was seeking damages in excess of Seventy five thousand dollars to\nWell you know for a guy who's on TV all the time and a porn star that's on TV all the stops all the time for someone who's making such a big deal\n... who's such a a pillar strength from the community that she's worried about her reputation\nMaybe shouldn't have been porn star she's worried about her reputation um by someone saying she's a liar you'd think they'd go after more than Seventy five thousand dollars because it has to pay that has to pay his piece the oil you Stormy Daniels vans that\nSent money into go fund me for her uh you've paid illegal just fantasies plus Donald Trump remember this is the attorney you can't see on TV for more than two days of the time the one that the liberals loved a few weeks ago because he was coming up with stuff the against a Brett Kavanaugh let's play this\nWoman always at least ... million dollars or so he made me just say ... ... what\nIs not listening it would seem to me to Republicans in Congress [noise] ah Lindsey Graham in particular who is out there saying I don't want to do business with the Saudi anymore if this if this is what is going on comparing that\nTo the Kavanaugh hearings I mean this is an apple and orange where we're talking about here\nAnd and he needs to act as a moral leader you know the people look to the United states from our leadership and um instead of talking about we need to get to the bottom on death cetera et cetera yet prepared with over there he's talking about well be careful you don't want to\nConduct the Saudis too quickly must be nice to the Saudis\nWell you know it uh it's it's it's all the convenience of when we want to be moral leaders in the in the country or I can I can remember when you don't want to and and Don told me that one of her uh\nOne of her uh her Democrat friends are from childhood said she got a message or as a Facebook post or something I blocked her because she just makes me mad I'm that said said look a guy who was murdered in Trump's doing nothing about it\nOkay\nThere's a whole bunch of people in Chicago they get murdered every week in nobody does anything about that and certainly not Brock Hussein Obama when he was president for eight years and that's his home town or at least that's the county was in before Washington DC uh you know before his hometown\nOf a of a bally\nIndonesia um oh I'm Sorry I mean a Honolulu, Hawaii is what I meant\nTo say I'm so uh but you know it uh it's it's convenient if we remember a Brock Hussein Obama was out on the golf course when you heard uh I forget the name that guy's first name I think it was James Byrd or maybe it was ... I don't know his last name was\nHis last name was bird he was a contractor over there in uh\nIn Iraq or Afghanistan and uh they they got captured by by the uh al ... and they cut his head off and put it out on the Internet and uh and Obama got off his golf cart with his buddies not senators or or Congress many was out the\nGolfing with some of his well some of his a celebrity buddies he got off the golf cart walked oh round a book in front of a ... in front of a backdrop set a few words and then got back on his golf cart and continue\nSo I don't know he never did anything so but no but in the Republican didn't say anything but even I mean the\nThe Democrats never said anything about that but now that it's somebody that you know the trumps in there well you know you can't just let somebody get killed and not do anything about it in another country even some Republicans are saying we need to get out of the one hundred it's one hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia here's Marco Rubio\nI don't think we should continue ... all we know exactly what's happening in your car sales are a lot of talk of the money but also provide the leverage over the future ... you know they don't need are there are so we are training and those are things we can use ... I Would not take that off\nThe table well Marco Rubio or a contradicted himself he said well I don't think we should continue doing business as usual until we find out\nI think maybe we find out first and then we make a decision what to do you know let's let's stop doing business with you let shop shipping and stop collecting money let's stop doing this until we find out whether you're guilty or not and I don't think it works that way I think we continue\nDoing business as usual until we find out until we find out otherwise and then we make a decision\nAnd this is a slippery slope here this is a this is a this this is why nobody wants to be the president [noise] um what is why I don't want to be the president 'cause I don't have to deal with this kind of stuff because you've got a lot in the balance here here's a here's why President Trump feels differently\nSo have a tremendous order a hundred and ten billion dollars every country in the world wanted a piece of that or do we get all of it\nAnd what are we going to do so yeah I mean I've had some senators come up with some Congress will decide well you know I think what we should do is we should not take that order ... who we heard it was five hundred thousand jobs will be ultimately a hundred and ten million dollars to biggest ordering the history of our country so that helps a lot of church\nAnd I said we're going to turn that down why would we do that\nSo you know who is who is he a who's who looking out for now so uh Rubio says hey you know what I'm we should we should do that because it's not just the money or these things are important it's the uh we have we can control their behavior because they're gonna need spare parts and they're going to be training there you need this or you need that\nWell that's one reason we shouldn't cut it off before we find out for sure what\nThe deal is and um because we should say until we find out otherwise we're not going to we're not going to have sanctions against you were not going to you know it's if if we know for sure that happened and we have to decide if that's really important to us\nBecause again they're important in in some uh foreign Foreign Relations with other in in a a hotbed\nOf of a of a psych psycho chaos out there in the middle east and uh\nYou gotta you gotta consider that to consider all the options and it it's going to be a tough spot\nI'm Glad a President Trump's there and I'm not and I'm Glad that he's got a Mike Pompeo in a general Madison or some smart guys over there that are going to help advise them and they're going to come up with that was going to come up with what's the best way to uh\nTo deal with this um\nI just think I just think the Democrats are making a big deal out of this but if if they were in power they wouldn't make a big deal out of it because it's one guy in Saudi Arabia didn't really have anything to do with us they're just saying hey we're we're doing business with these people\nWell we're doing business with the country and we got some bad actors over there is at ... and I'm not and believe me I'm not defending anybody I'm just saying hey let's think clearly\nLet's consider the whole situation before we make judgments so aside not ridiculously this week started out with liberals actually trying to blame Trump for the ... tragic death because he likes to verbally attacked journalists here's Obama adviser Ben Rhodes and CNN branch shelter\nMessage to the Saudis want it to us and they have found\nThat you're not safe anywhere to criticize us in the middle of the president's Hondas selling that there is no cause one just waiting for president says are also the same social values like freedom of speech in the sense\nThat suddenly are very endangered around the world\nTo lure someone to accomplish to dismembered body and to take it on to solve the crime or the government caliber\nI Wonder if you look at the top in the last ... days and you wonder of\nEnemy of the people rhetoric\nNot just from President Trump but also from other world leaders\nAnything to do with anything at all\nYeah so I'm sure the people over there are a attacking the a journalist in America because remember this guy left and he's been writing for the Washington Post and so they're taking it out because Trump said that\nThe the the media is the enemy of the state I don't know that they take they take a Trump stuff's so seriously and we lured him we lured into the conflict so he could be killed\nI think love blue or to him he was going to get a marriage license what how do we how did anybody lure him to the to the constant well you've got to where we live with him into here so we could capture him\nWe told him he had to have a marriage license to get married to someone who's\nTurkish I think he just wanted to get married so anyway [noise] hypocrisy\nSo uh in other Caribbean immigrants oh hold on I'm changing the subject and other Caribbean of immigrants from Central America as honest with us border this week traveling from Honduras in Guatemala through Mexico\nWhere does it expected that most of them will be granted passage in a series of tweets Thursday President Trump indicated he would call our military to the border and stop the new NAFTA deal which is called the U.S MCA United States Mexico Canada agreement which\nSeems like a dumb seems like a dumb name but it is what it is a NAFTA sound so much more cool um North American free trade room so you know when we talked about this about three or four weeks ago the new agreement between Mexico Canada and United States\nAnd he said he's going to cancel if Mexico fails to turn the the share of an around which I think it's reasonable\nYou know what we have leverage on these people why do we let them just do whatever they want an assault our country\nSo Donald Trump to put out a bunch of tweets the assault on our country at our southern border including the criminal elements in the drugs pouring in this far more important to me as president and the trade or the United states Mexico Canada agreement hopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught their northern border all Democrats fault per week laws\nHe continued in addition to stopping all payments to these countries which seem to have almost no control over their population I must in the strongest terms acts asking Mexico to stop this on ... and it's an able to do so I Will call up the U.S military and close our southern border in big letters\nI liked that a guy who's working from strength\nHe continues I'm watching the Democratic party because they want open borders and existing week laws assault on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador whose leaders are doing little to stop this large slope people including many criminals from entering the U.S Mexico from entering Mexico to the U. S.\nBecause you know they have to go through a border at the southern border of Mexico to get there\nAnd ah he tweets another picture can you believe that the Democrats are allowing to be done to our country and chose this just a gigantic group of people at the southern border just so you know you know this\nGuy is putting America First [noise]\nI'm trying to be the president of our country not the world anyway I'm Out of time for this episode of the main event\nGoes to work and go straight to your muscles it's absorbed easily it pumps up the Korea thing in your muscle tissue\nAnd you get

their coach is of course\nBeing do about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural for the body it was supposed to be there but there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were freed it might be considered cheating let it might be considered too much of an edge\nPut back in Nineteen eighty eight the international Olympic Committee they came out the officially confirmed that I'm quoting here Korea Team can be used by athletes\nTo enhance their performance and now that it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly

that naturally occurring in red meat problem is in order to get the amounts that are going to benefit you you'd have to eat large amounts of red meat and like four\nPounds of red meat a day most people are going to do that right and what about vegetarian they can be creating deficient\nExactly when I have a vegetarian that comes in here and their energy efficient and I put 'em on every strong you noticed the benefits almost right away because they've been so low on a younger person out there that staying away from red meat if you're staying away from me in general this is for you you

Seventeen to have you know we can do that is not when people are known for getting stronger right right so this was just a one week study people need to understand that that's how effective and rapidly this stuff works get this guy's on Korea Team\nThey put on four pounds of lean mass that's muscle tissue for those that don't know that it shows they built the muscles and they are treated the muscles nicely they increase the strength of their chest pressed by seven percent\nThey increased the strength of the leg exercises they were doing by Fifteen Percent pat\nThey could get in and out of a cheer more times faster without using their arms on top of that it could generate more power on a stationary bike\nPack this happened in one week when I think that it's really quite incredible\nAll right but what about the women out there did they get those kinds of benefits to as well will it actually help women in their fifties sixties and seventies gets stronger to\nSo Lou ... let's go
