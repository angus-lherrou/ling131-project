that's kind of thing\nPerfect timing Tucker Carlson explains the left changing attitudes toward illegal immigration in the newest video from ... you see the ... dot com where we teach what is a coffee mug devoted to show our youngest Gregory fraudulent\nThey deal report supposed ... some of the systems are actually some of the opposite here\nBecause the next time there really is an increase in anti Semitism if there is people will believe them they're crying wolf with the the only thing that they're interested to do ... ...\nIt's an amazing thing isn't it but again it's the reason it's so important is number one so you know the laws we are drenched in by the media New York times Washington Post that actually cite this fraudulent report\nAbout this doubling or whatever it is of anti Semitism since Donald Trump was elected so all the fraud\nAnd I read to you from professor David Bernstein law professor at George Mason university got kids than Trump\nSays it's he's the one who says this is a fraud so it's not even coming from a pro Trump man it's coming from a pro troops but she pro truth be on the left you could be a tight Trump which can be a leftist moments you're pro truth you leap left\nIf the Democrats are supposed to be the party of the downtrodden the party of people who need help the party of the little guy why is it that the one area where they are counting on actually winning control of the house of representatives\nHas to do with the wealthiest suburbs in every state why is there suddenly a Republican problem\nWith the will to do suburbs in this country one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six New York times asked that question in the business section today they take a look at some of those areas where\nRepublicans are not running well where the Democrats hope to sweep to power in the house of representatives\nAnd they happened to be parts of the country that have done supremely well under the leadership of President Trump\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number there's also a new Republican at addressing that and also there is another big issue that we are prepared to take on which is the issue of Halloween\nIs the focus and the expenditure in the concentration on Halloween as a great national celebration\nIs that a good thing that ought to be encouraging applauded or not such a great aspect of American Life be great Halloween debate which we run through every year to this year with a very different perspective by the way\nBetween myself and the most formidable person that I ever get to debate on which is my wife Dr Diane ... that's coming up also and this edition of the Michael ... that show but first off\nI uh I think it's appropriate to uh to offer a golden turkey award for a truly remarkable performance in a faithful candidates debate this is one of the closest Senate races in the country and by the way\nIf you look at the polling right now even according to the polling there are almost a dozen Senate races where\nThe Republicans had\nA real chance of a of making big inroads against various tablets Democrats now one of the Democrats or Republicans are very much hoping to knock off his Joe Donnelly of Indiana\nWho by the way is an idiot I mean this is not a bright capable member of the U.S Senate this is a guy who got elected because he was running against a very weak Republican candidate he's running behind all ready but then there was the debate\nLast night and a Joe Donnelly both in what he said and the way she later explained that stepped right into a well he's stepped into unpleasant and that's\n[noise]\n\nBigger Academy Award first and foremost I'd like to thank God\nFor years and the Grammy I Would like to thank my wonderful aging more powerful the people's choice\nI Would like to share this with every single senator\nNow it's time for another golden turkey award nomination [noise]\nAnd on the Michael ... show or the gold and turkey award going to Joe Donnelly he is running slightly behind the Republican candidate Mike Braun there's also an independent candidate\nWho may be taking votes away from the Republican those are terribly wasted votes in in a faithful election like this anybody's thinking about voting independent in Indiana think again\nThink again this is a very clear choice you can choose a clear conservative Republican an outsider who is a running for more Washington reform\nOr you can choose senator Donnelly who's a unparalleled eloquence led to this in the midst of a televised debate\nOr state director is Indian American\nBut he does an amazing job\nOr director of all constituent services she's African American\nBut she doesn't even more incredible job than you could ever imagine\nWhy could you not imagine that an African American as credible job he's Indian American but he does an amazing job but he does an amazing job\nOkay this is an amazing job uh this is a job that is going to cost him a Senate seat I certainly hope and listen to this because he just a couple of hours ago issued a a quote an apology explanation\nI meant to say and instead but that would have communicated what I've tried to do my entire life that I make a habit to seek out and promote people of color for both my campaign an official staff\nNow isn't that problematic\nTo seek out and promote people of color\nFor both my campaign officials that\nDon't you want to say\nSenator Donnelly I mean isn't the right thing to say I seek out the best people regardless of their color or their background but he does an amazing job okay this is a an amazingly poor job or an amazingly poor job\nIs also um reflected on the part of Nancy Pelosi\nShe was on the ah friendly confines of speaking of the friendly confines I Know I Know that's Wrigley Field the cubs weren't in the playoffs this year\nBut um [noise] you know I've congratulations to the Boston Red Sox and what an amazing year in London amazing season and they're being talked about for a hundred and Nineteen wins but that of course includes the playoff wins in the world series wins\nUm mariners still two thousand one hundred and sixteen wins okay\nMeanwhile in the friendly confines of the Steven cold beer show Nancy Pelosi was on last night [laughter] and and again a ... please before you vote\nThink whether you really really want to install this lady as speaker of the house of representatives just a heartbeat away from the presidency here's Nancy Pelosi\nUp until today I Would have said if the election were held today we would win\nWhat happened today to change that [noise] but now in saying is we've away [laughter]\nWant to say that on on Hillary's fireworks ...\nWhen\nWe on the ground for not using one grain of sad how long are the curtains\nQuick yes walking precincts and if everyone votes will have even if they are ... ... Democrats will carry the house we had the ... the Senate governorship it's gonna be a great night for America [noise]\nSacrifice a gold or something\nOkay um I don't I don't think you have to sacrifice would go no no goats sacrificed in the making of the sad or she came back and suggested does this solution which actually echoes Hillary Clinton hauntingly\nFor the question instability in polarization and the society listen\nIf you weren't let your sons and purple side is that an inclusive message that you're sending out there that it's life America's neither ... nor but I\nCouldn't pay it said that unifying our country I think it's time to heal there's been a lot lately about\nHum of\nLowering the temperature of political discourse have you have you seen evidence of that\nWell I think when we when you will see evidence of that\nAh when when we when we're going to tone down the political discourse\nBecause a calling for investigation of a sitting justice of the U.S Supreme Court that would be Brett Kavanaugh calling for his investigation and potential impeachment calling for impeachment of the president but that's a that's a great way to tone down the rhetoric right\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and then there's this um\n...

was the last time that a third party candidate\nReceived enough votes to actually get electoral college votes\nOkay uh-huh uh do you know the answer to that uh yeah it was George Wallace in Nineteen sixty eight\nThat's right a which is what I showed them we pulled up and electoral map or on line and I showed them and the point that I pass along to the kids after that question you know which wasn't leading this direction was\nThat was a time when America was so racially divided you know it was it was a a Nineteen sixty eight was\nI was only ten but I remember just being such a hostile terrible year or in American history and and society that of a a segregation and lift candidate could actually\nYou're right and part of the reason that George Wallace one is a black people were not

one thirty eastern time so you can follow me on Twitter at ... show on Twitter so ten thirty Pacific time one thirty eastern time this Friday I joined us again for another asked that question and answer\nI'm not sure that's a good sign [noise]\nMy wife has a more benign view of that she will be joining me later in this program for the great Halloween debate [noise]\nA regular feature yearly feature of this radio show but uh this year\nIt's kind of different because of all of the political correctness\nAspects to debates over Halloween costumes and what's appropriate and what's inappropriate what's cultural appropriation we will be getting to that with a great Halloween debate\nBut meanwhile we're coming up to a great big election and combined with the election and Halloween today um we have a um new album released today\nOf music by one of America's most respected and admired musicians\nAnd movie stars and all around um public celebrities that is the subject of this myth that music view [noise]\nTime as when I was just [noise]\n...\nEach time building Michael mid music [noise]\nAnd uh this is a review\nOf the lead song\nOn a new album by Barbra Streisand who was making\nHer own contribution to toning down some of the heated national dialogue\nAnd bringing us altogether because she has a her new song I Believe it or not it is it's a kind of a love song\nAnd it's directed\nSpecifically and personally at her fellow New Yorker Donald J Trump\nNo it it really is of the song is called don't lie to me\n[laughter] and uh\n... it's look\nI Will share some of the lyrics and then you can hear\nHow well what it sounds like though actually seeing the music video which I'm\nThe music video features footage of Iraq Obama crying\nI Believe he was crying at the Newtown massacre and she makes it look as if he's crying at just the Trump presidency in general by the way the Newtown massacre did not occur under President Trump\nIt occurred under President Obama but I'm here the lyrics of don't lie to me and ah this is a definitely an album with a message if a if you're one of those people who thinks you were going to be influenced in this upcoming election by Barbra Streisand\nAnd her opposition to President Trump you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six here the lyrics\nWhy can't you just tell me the truth\nHard to believe the things you say\nWhy can't you feel the cheers I cried today\nRight today how do you win\nIf we all live\nYou change the facts to justify your lips move\nBut your words get in the way in the way in the way\n... how do you sleep when the world keeps turning\nGoals that we built this come on done how do you sleep when the world is burning\nEveryone answers to someone\nDon't lie to me don't lie to me you lie to me don't lie to me don't lie to me you lie to me\nYou can build towers a bronze and gold you can build castles in the sky you can you smoke and mirrors all cliches not today not today can't you see a crying can't you see we're crying where's the New Horizons where's the new horizon how do you sleep how to use leap pad you sleep\nActually President Trump doesn't sleep much I mean he's tweeting at two in the morning and he's tweeting again it five the next morning\nOr all that we build has come undone\nHow do you sleep how do you sleep enough is enough how do you sleep when the world is burning how to use the patio sleep every one of the answers to someone and then can't you see I'm Crying can't you see we're buying can you see we're all crying everyone answers to somewhat of the song sounds\nLike this Barbra Streisand's newly released song\n[noise] [noise]\nLet\nWhere I can do the\nYour lives\nOkay um it it goes on like that here here's a question\nAnd I know that the music business is changing and people are listening to music on Spotify and did download something and you can listen to it once and then throw it away but the core of the music business for a very very long time and I say a long time\nOr oh going on two hundred years I mean really for a very long time okay a hundred and fifty years\nThe um\nThe music business has been about\nGetting music that you want to keep\nAnd enjoy and um I Know this again last night um I came home I went to see a new film which we're going to review on friday with my wife and\nWe came home from the film and then we were doing some work and I know we're ready to go to bed and I just had a again a to hear this particular very obscure piece of music\nAnd I I collect CDs I have a lot of a compact discs and I'm\n... and so I was able to find this eight Russian folk songs by ... totally Lee out off [laughter] it's a very obscure ... music and I want to share with Diane because she didn't know it and so I put it on even though I haven't listened to the CD for a long time I was glad to have it because it's beautiful music can anyone imagine\nAs have two years from now\nI say ten years from now where President Trump is no longer president he's term limited don't worry liberal he's term limited\nWhat someone want to put on\nThis song don't lie to me\nAbout President Trump to hear more of this can you imagine sitting down in your living room in the middle of the night and saying yeah let's let's share the the musical experience of\nI I think that they the Democrats should employee this song in campaign events [noise]\nUh no I meant that Democrats should because that would absolutely ensure that people are in the right mood of despair and\nI see I don't get this\nI don't get it and look I I knew Barbara Streisand years ago I actually\nWorked with her at one point and and by the way she's a very nice person she is not\nA mean evil nasty person at all or she is time she's considerate and I think most people who have had any experience dealing with her on a personal basis I Will tell you that\nAnd it's sad for me to see this\nAnd I'll tell you why I I I Know that Barbara has serious aspirations as an artist but somebody ought to tell her somebody ought to tell everybody on the left there's no lasting art there is no art of lasting value that is created for the politics of the moment\nDo you how do you okay honestly because it has a\nVery short shelf life\nOn the campaign songs that various people writer not songs that people turned two years later\nFrankly you can think of things uh like blowing in the wind is blowing in the wind had a general political meaning but it wasn't specific like this aimed at one candidate or another\nAnd if you want to create music that really can do what music can do at best wishes to nourish the soul and maybe uplifted country wouldn't it be useful if the left would get\nOff this this is incredibly hard isn't one sided perspective she's asked an important question by the New York times since question was\nWhat do you say to those people who maybe your fans who may love you're singing may love your work\nBut also love Donald Trump for answers kind of astonishing and very sad we will get to that with your calls coming up\nThen later she she says in the interview she blames Donald Trump for making her fat\nI'm not joking\nThe or the interview concludes with ... asking Barbara\nHow are you feeling these days and she says I Want to sleep nights if we take the house I'll be able to sleep a little bit better\nAnd then my ... and if they don't don't know I've been thinking about do I want to move to Canada\nI think she'd promise to move to Canada before Trump won\nThe election I mean the presidential election and that she says I don't know if I Move to Canada I'm just so saddened by this thing happening in my country it's making me fat\nI hear what he said now and I have to go eat pancakes now and pancakes are very fattening\nWe make them with healthy flower though ... flower\nCoconut flower okay good for her ... does anyone think it's fair to blame Donald Trump for making you\nThat's what she said\nAh

things about McCain when he was running against\nA bronco bomber but seat honestly the face to face with\nPeople and I've never met Trump but I have heard from people who know him that he is actually a very\nKinder person in person than you would think\nAnd uh\nThere there's no reason to allow this this kind of insanity to continue it in her new album\nThe album is called walls and I'm ... writes Barbara Streisand has a new album one that has the musical and bought him into her singular disliked of President Trump boy I Want to buy that loves to get an album the student body mental singular dislike\nAnd the rare instance of her political views entering her music and not so rare\nOne track already released don't lie to me as a direct address to her fellow native New Yorker who\nAre citizens of the United states and other state where they reside\nAnd he shares a ... basically what people say on the other side they say well but it says subject to the jurisdiction there of the reason they included that is they want it to exclude the children of ambassadors people who had a clear affiliation with a another country\nAnd all by by that context I think that they could say that someone who is growing up as a citizen of another country or somebody who is left the United states and live the rest of his life in\nSomewhere else okay you exclude that person but to try to go after now people whose parents\nWere not us citizens of the United states are not here legally the undocumented is clearly a loser and there's a great great editorial today in the wall Street Journal making that point\nThe real point about this is that there is neither political will no judicial will to do this or to have a constitutional amendment to change birthright citizenship\nPresident Trump is on very strong ground when it comes to resisting the caravan very strong ground\nAnd virtually all Republicans and nearly all Americans agree with that nobody wants to throw the doors open to everybody nobody wants to remove borders I shouldn't say nobody but very very few and just a fringe of the Democratic party\nAnd to stand on that principle the idea that we have to have an immigration system that works that's the kind of thing you can win\nThe or by the way they they did some fake news today on CNN or they said that well in in order to change the constitution the president would have to get two thirds of both houses of Congress and two thirds of the states that's not true\nHe would need to get two thirds of the house two thirds of the Senate and three quarters of the states it is not possible\nBirthright citizenship is not going to\nIf Mr Trump wants to end the practices of Wall Street journal and again nothing new York Times of Wall Street journal which has been very supportive of President Trump's generally\nBecause Mr Trump wants to end the practice sometimes called birth tourism he can always draft in campaign for a constitutional amendment but Congress is unlikely to agree and pass a law much less an amendment to the constitution to is making this futile gesture of an executive order a week before election day\nMr Trump made a political mistake this year by not trading legal status to adult immigrants brought here illegally as children for more border security\nThen Republicans could have run on an immigration accomplishment and steady one of the political issue and will ... will soon see how well that worked but here's my basic point about this politically\nI don't think there's anyone who was excited by President Trump saying he's going to address birth tourism who wasn't already supporting President Trump\nWho wasn't already supporting a Republican\nGetting people excited over this by the way I Do think it would be possible to curb birth tourism\nBy enacting some legislation around it saying that in special circumstances where people are traveling to the United states not for the purpose of long term residency but simply to give birth to a child here in the United states\nThen you can question whether that child really is in the jurisdiction of the United states and that's okay\nBut generally to challenge the idea that a child born to someone who has lived here for\nAnd where the child grows up entirely in the United states you want to try to challenge the citizenship status of that individual why not make more citizens\nWho are actually committed to this country\nAnd so make sure that there is some kind of commitment or naturalization\nBut uh if there's any doubt for the parents but creating a process where people can go through American is Asian\nIt seems to me is much better than obliterate in the idea of citizenship\nAs some Democrats seem to want to do\nOr the idea of changing the constitution to change the status of people who were born here whose parents may not have had the right to come here and the first place we'll be right back on the ... that show I go to some of your calls coming up the great hall of

citizenship and why it would be a big mistake for Republicans to try to make this a big issue in the waning days of the campaign\nIt's first of all one of those things that is going to be very tough in a judicial sense and here is the core problem\nIs the holiday inn which Americans invest the most money\nSet a good thing or a bad thing uh we are spending they say seven billion dollars that comes about eighty bucks\nFor a Halloween decorations and candy and costumes or we have a tradition on this show and every year it seems to take a different turn the tradition is a um a sort of a core disagreement that my wife and I have a learn to live with\nUh my wife Dr Diane Medvedev is the author of seven books most recently her very important books don't divorce\nWhich I it is not required when we talk about Halloween but um as is still good reading for Americans across the country or die thank you for joining us I don't know what is it is a twentieth a Halloween debate\nYes at least I'm sure we've had that many\nOf you but there's a difference to it this year because there's so many universities Princeton University just issued a statement for students who was jail a couple of years ago about the Halloween costumes that were acceptable or unacceptable\nOr do you think that um this concern with a cultural appropriation\nAnd political correctness regarding Halloween costumes reflects some of the essential joy of the holiday\nFlex some of the central jai ho cultural appropriation fad is just a reflection of our over sensitivities in many areas that she can go out of our way and I felt so why shouldn't\nDress up in a way that it's going to inflame hatred or or do anything negative in the culture but on the other hand I I don't think that there needs to be declarations on restrictions issue ... to ... about what students can do when they are celebrating on their own time\nOkay let let me ask you there was a story about a guy who came to a costume contested of Mississippi bar and clarion Mississippi and he chose to do as a wearing traditional Ku Klux Klan garb and he was asked to leave and he was like permanently banned\nOr from that bar or because of who Klux Klan of course was involved in mass murder and uh and the tax and repression and racism\nAppropriate that he should be banned from the bar\nWell I think that every business owner has a right to decide what kind of activities go on\nIn his Capitol shrimp and you know that owner without an absolute which should and I think that it was very poor taste for somebody to dress up as a cook Lex cleaner than it is offensive to many many people I mean I don't have a problem with a an an individual owners are saying this is not covered here\nYeah I think it's by the way who Klux Klan cost and would be offensive not very many be offensive to everybody\nEverybody here I felt like we don't like that yeah I can see that\nAnd what about the um there was a a gentleman and he he posted it a very prominently on Facebook and in fact his wife's Facebook profile a profile has her husband dress up in his Halloween costume which is a very realistic cost him was an SS officer or an officer\nOf ah of ah the ah the\nBasically the shock troops the storm troopers for adults Hitler and then they had their five year old dressed up as adults Hitler or they um actually have no tried to apologize uh yeah they didn't\nHire if that was in Kentucky [laughter] yeah I I Know and I think that is inappropriate especially get\nSent a guy I mean if I Know you don't do that right\nThere was a rabbi in nearby Evansville, Indiana who said the rule of thumb is don't dress up for Halloween um in in a way that in in any way of votes the memory of people who actually murdered millions of people um okay so\nThat is that what Halloween is for most everybody I mean come on you're calling out the exception the ones who are the bad boys at the holiday but for millions of people who enjoy it and he'll have a great time and quick tooth benign costumes\nAnd I have time to meet their neighbors and get together and and share ... fighter and candy corn so it's not not the way you're portraying it\nOkay I Know that people who sometimes in and let me make clear here that traditionally I'm I'm not a big fan of Halloween I Would if a left my own devices pretty much ignore the holiday [noise] my wife for whatever reason likes it\nAnd I know you like it because like you're going to go out trick or treating later with our granddaughter and I will admit that sounds perfectly nice and benign\nBut what if she sees costumes that scare her what is it I don't know what she's dressing as well\nYou're wearing shoes dressing up as a lady that call that one of ... aren't going to be where is that the yeah the species appropriation\n[laughter] what she does ... ... fine so maybe she is trying to copy become a a lady bugs but uh I don't think that one is offensive okay and I\nI can understand that for a two year old is it'd be pretty interesting seeing people wearing all these different costumes but what about the emphasis of\nUh on blood Gore um the the dark side of the supernatural or do you think that's a a wholesome\nIngredient to inject into our cultural bloodstream every year with this for taking\nThe lead a what look I'm not in favor personally I Do see a lot of our neighbors making mock graveyard on their front lawns and hanging out skeletons and data and having goes can do on their head jury\nUm I you know I think that they're not doing that just scare anyone I think they're doing because so very clear that these are not real\nIt very clear this is their decorations for a holiday that lets you know that there's death\nAdmits that there is\nA sort of a scary side to the the season changing into a dark and cold time of year and I don't think that that's negative credit people doing it they're doing it because I consider her and and I don't think it it's hurtful to kids to see that\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number if you are a great fan of the Halloween holiday\nFor a non fan of the Halloween holiday or you can join us in this exchange a one eight hundred nine five five Seventy seven digits or you can send us a tweet at a ... at mid that show on Twitter\nUm it it it does this Halloween coming right after the arrest of this bombing suspect and right after the the truly truly horrible events in Pittsburgh and it was just four days ago\nOr does it feel a little bit different\nI mean again with all the emphasis on graves and and funerals and skeletons I I I when I Walk in our neighbor and I know exactly where you're talking about a sweetie I mean there's a skeleton hanging from the tree\nI'm I don't see anything positive in that what's what's why is that a a a sort of a benign or worthwhile influence\nI wouldn't say that it was worthwhile influence I think it's an expression of a holiday but it's universally understood to be secular to be fun to be different from the rest of the holidays which are more upbeat\nAnd I don't think that it's meant to give the neighbors a negative message at all and and I don't think it's injecting it into the culture I think the culture is embraced Halloween and sales for the holiday have increased every year because of the fact that it's an escape\nIt keeps it takes us out of the horrors that grace the newspaper front page that let that go into the world a fantasy that left as\nI Do things that are fun like bobbing for apples I mean there are things that happened on Halloween that or see how they remind us in the harvest remind us it's time of year and that's a positive that's a holiday\nOkay what's the last time you have seen a what people would call inappropriate movie Halloween a scary movie\nYou're asking me I don't go to scaring\nThe I don't want to mess and digging them do when you the last thirty five years she\nLike scary movies that are about other topics too you know that's just spent and slaps that attract considered pretty scary and violence in nearly every movie the only one that I go to a rom coms\nI I understand but since you were so particular about movies I mean it's kind of\nHow it is not a celebration of scary stuff how Halloween the celebration where kids go out in the neighborhood and they see each other all dressed up and they but face paint on and they can put out a bag and say trick\nOr treat aids paying homeowners willing willingly open to turn on their way way way pain had them plenty\nFace paint you're you're not making a case for black face costumes are you\n[laughter] know and making Kelly wouldn't either I don't think at this point\nYeah maybe maybe someone can go as Megan Kelly this year with um\nI was thinking about the first time that I I trick or treat it in our new neighborhood well most of the northwest I dressed up as a clown and I met our neighbors and fall a multi colored hair and clown makeup\nAnd well
