terrorists Sebastian Gorka under\nRonald Reagan presidential library talking about his new bestseller why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apology\nThe five days at American policies are

the Reagan Library funding for twenty nine now for tickets before they shut the shop in ... by drapery works of orange\nCounty and epoch times news\nMichael meant that is coming up a new\nAM eight seven\n\nTend to think okay\nEverybody can sense stuff going on here and let's go to David in Minneapolis Dennis Prager Hi David butter the with you thank you\nI agree so a lot but it's more interesting one I differ with you and I differ with you on a fire metal ... the I think and I suspect that what three minutes talking about when he uses the word science\nCorrect or not entirely actually about\nWell and so I feel like three words and it is sort of a phrase well one of them I happen to agree with him on which is I think my Republican side often in the science denying category when it comes to global warming [noise] right\nWe have a lot of videos on this given by scientists\nThe oh I Know that no matter what but it's important that you know that I mean Richard ... was the dean of climatologists at MIT in the country\nAnd he takes issue with the proposition that the the there are three propositions to the global warming thing they collapse it into one of the world is getting warmer it is getting so much warmer it will lead to worldwide catastrophe if not extinction\nAnd they apparently are bombs they're rudimentary they're not highly sophisticated but they apparently are operational\nAnd good for the NYPD and the FBI and the New York bombs was basically an all the people who are trying to deal with this and do it also for some of the reactions not all of them some of the reactions have been a polling\nAnd hypocritical and wrong or but not Steve Scully serve the various reactions that I've seen I think the one from the whip for the Republican Party in the house of representatives\nOf the honorable Steve Sebelius congressman from Louisiana who's been a friend of this show or Steve writes these attempted attacks that have been made or beyond criminal their acts of pure terror\nViolence and terror have no place in our politics or anywhere else in our society I've experienced firsthand the effects of political violence and I'm committed to using my voice to speak out against it where ever I can\nThose responsible for these evil acts of terror and yes even if no one is killed God willing known will be killed\nThese are evil acts he rides those responsible for these evil acts of terror must be hunted down and brought to justice and I have great confidence that our law enforcement officers will succeed in that mission\nAs a nation we must agree that this is a dangerous path and it cannot become\nThe new normal excellent that is fine and by the way what the president said he spoke after Milan yen millennia was promoting some of her causes any complimented his wife speaking as she introduced him he got a standing ovation\nAnd uh then the uh the president said this about the bombing attempts\nTo suspicious packages and devices mail to current and former high ranking government officials [noise] the safety of the American people is my highest absolute priority\nI've just concluded a briefing with the FBI department of Justice Department of homeland security and the U.S Secret Service\nAs we speak the packages are being inspected by top explosive experts at a major federal investigation is now underway to full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible\nFor these despicable acts to justice we will spare no resources are expensive this effort [noise]\nAnd I just wanted to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\n[noise] what the\nPresident said is fine and it's appropriate and he offered a little bit more to be more specific here's President Trump\n[noise]\nLet's say very bipartisan state but I can tell you from both sides we both agree on that [noise] disagree just conduct is abhorrent to everything we hold dear and sacred has Americans my administration will provide additional updates as they become available\nAnd I just want to thank everybody for their understanding [noise]\nWere extremely angry upset\nAbout what we what this this morning and we will get to the bottom of it [noise]\n[noise] okay given the fact that two of the most prominent targets of these bombs\nWere Hillary Rodham Clinton who President Trump defeated and the election\nAnd the Democratic president that he replaced Brock Obama I think it would be helpful for the president or for Sarah Sanders frankly to reveal I mean enough to reveal dishonest me but I think it would be a good thing for President Trump to call President Obama and for President Trump to coal Secretary Clinton\nAnd to express his concern and his gratitude that they and their families are okay\nBecause uh and just saying that doing it would detoxify this entire matter and one of the things that I resent is mainstream media right now and a lot of democratic leaders\nAre injecting toxin into this situation\nThey're basically trying to blame Trump for this now I get it I understand most of the people who have been targeted are very clearly identified with the left their opponents of Trump\nThey include Eric Holder and Maxine Waters and Morocco bomb and yes all three of them are African American I understand that it also includes Hillary Rodham Clinton Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nAnd I'm I'm oh and George Soros she was the first one to receive a a package and apparently they are now saying\nThat the package was actually delivered in person by somewhat it was not mailed to George Soros but the package with this rudimentary bomb and it was delivered to Soros his home outside of New York city and um\n[noise] look at the idea that Trump is to blame for this of course that is irresistible to the left\nAnd it seems to me it is entirely wrong I sent out a tweet about this immediately when that tendency started\nAnd I understand that there are people in the media who are trying to link together for phenomena what are the four phenomena these bombs the bomb scare number two the ... murder number three the fact that Trump ... says that it's fake news as the enemy of the people\nAnd um and and a number for the\nUh the idea that Trump praised at a rally in Montana the body slamming a reporter by congressman Greg Gianforte by the way to apologize lavishly who paid the guide damages who apologized again and actually was pleaded guilty in court for assault and battery\nSo ah here's here's the point these four separate things Greg John forte the Trump assaults on news media as fake news an enemy of the people the murder of the show gave and these bomb scares which are attempted murder\nWhat's the connection between all for nothing there is no connection the first two are evil threatening\nTo murder people sending out bombs to people's homes that is evil murdering Jamal because she'll be which no American had any role in at all was evil and it's been denounced that way by the president the United states the other two things Trump's praise of Congressman John forte for the most embarrassing moment of his life\nAnd Trump's general ... on the news media is enemy that people it's stupid and it's embarrassing it's not evil and it's not a crime and basically trying to associate these things is wrong it is irresponsible I Know it's irresistible\nFor people on the left especially Thirteen Days before an election but it's deeply irresponsible you want to hear about irresponsible Jack Reed the senator from Rhode Island was on uh CNN and of course CNN let him directly to saying what CNN wanted to hear listen\nI think is quite obvious us some of this is a reflection of the the base toner debate and the president of the United states\nBecause at a rally and smiles as people chant lock her up or make their own direct attacks on the news media that doesn't raise the level of debate that lowers it and it creates this environment where these acts\nCould take place and not only being an attack I think the other thing has going to have this is the fact that the found out is someone is fending has exploded a device anonymously to people who could be hurt\nAnd and this is something that is just just just to wrap it\nIt's not just disreputable is not just ... cowardice is evil but the point is we don't know anything about the perpetrator yet I Hope we will soon\nAt one of these guys are wrong let me give you an example of something else it was just a couple of days ago that in Washington DC in northwest Washington Fox five Fox News in other words was attacked\nBy a guy who have now identified his name was George ... came and he broke two big pains of the last and it came in and the security guard thank God shot him didn't kill him he's alive\nNow if all of a sudden you're attacking Fox News of course some idiot could jump to conclusions oh this is because of all the hospitals things that Democrats have said about Fox News nobody said that because we didn't know anything about this guy\nNow we do what do we know about him was he indeed a left wing activist actually know uh what was he we will get to that in just a moment we'll also get to some of the outrageous stuff that was set on\nNBC and something outrageous stuff that a leading Democrat said about the shooting of Congressman Steve sleep so no you can't blame the left for that even though the guy who shot Steve's Phillies ended up dying was a Bernie Sanders volunteer we'll be right back on the med betcha\nPresident Trump condemned the newsroom shooting and offered his condolences but he has often portrayed the news media is the enemy that people\nAfter the shooting the publisher of the New York times AJ shoals burgers at in a statement that he told the president in private meetings that quote his language was not just divisive but increasingly dangerous in other words what did they have to do with the newsroom shooting in Annapolis\nOr the attack on Fox News which is where this appeared in the paper\nOr this we don't know yet\nIt'll be interesting to find out we do know be on any shadow of a down\nThat wins Steve school lease was severely wounded and there was an attempt in and so we're Washington officers severely wounded assigned to protect the congressman and other attempts to kill other Republican congressman\nThat was politically motivated the guy was clear about it but\nListen to what Nancy Pelosi said at the time when a and this is more than a year ago this is June of two thousand Seventeen right after ... was shot she asked about uh some Republicans would condemn some of the hospital democratic rhetoric and here's what she said\nThey have or comments from Republicans\nIncluding Congress about face reality rhetoric from the last thing in some ways\nBut I think that your question is an excellent one and I think that the comments made by Margaret ... colleagues are outrageous beneath the dignity of the job that they hold any the dignity and respect that we would like Congress to command\nHad their they say such a thing how dare they show this sick individual that's something that the ball\nAnd it was horrible what he did hateful that for them to all of a sudden they sanctimonious and see if they don't never seen such a thing before and I don't want to go into president of the United states but in terms of some of the language that he has you know again I I have to go there and the other day that tend to ask\nHow could they possibly say such as\nThe way they can have such a thing the way they could say such a thing as big cause that shooter\nHad told other people that he had a grudge against Republicans he had been just active and the Bernie Sanders' campaign for president he was deeply politically active and apparently mumbled to his wife all the time when he saw stuff on TV we know the guy was politically motivated\nSo the only kind of political motivations that can be condemned is if it is from the right well there are other people who say no this couldn't have been from the right this is probably a leftist set up can I say we don't know\nWhen will we find out we'll get to that with your calls coming up with that at the Michael ...\n[noise] I just am a Seventy the answer\n[noise] slow\nGoing right now on the four or five heading north bound your

up\nWho would be better at all and all of a scam like this frame job like this without getting caught\nOkay well here's a problem or do you think the intelligence community wants to protect Trump or do you think they want to damage from\nI think they want to damage\nOut okay so how so you think that they damage Trump\nBy sending a these a legend I'm bombs too and making sure that of course they don't explode I I think that's a better or gas or or theory frankly I think there's\nAn endless drawings out there on the way they see a big shock to the media I mean Trump and the ... they they think

won't be removed from office impeachment probably would strengthen President Trump it really would and I don't want it to happen it would be incredibly bad for the country but look what happened with Bill Clinton\nHe rose his popularity of the highest he ever achieved at precisely the time that the Republican House had voted impeachment and then they didn't even get a majority of Senate voters not even a majority to vote to actually remove the president from office\nAppreciate your call 'em and I think part of what you're saying\nIs at least it makes a little bit more sense than the idea that

this um\nDeliberate effort to try to well what exactly because ... ... what what would have been the impact if God Forbid some of the people to whom bombs were sent had those bombs actually explode\nI think one of the problems that we have as a country as we assume that if somebody is capable of following something you found on the Internet and making a crude pipe bomb then that means he some kind of terrorist mastermind\nOf what's fascinating here is a lesson in how media work because it was yesterday it was last night\nThey found a bomb that had been delivered hand delivered\nTo the rather remote isolated outside New York city home of George Soros the billionaire Democrat egg donor and\nPhilanthropist all over the world I mean I guess philanthropist would be a generous term but he's somebody who is funded a lot of left wing causes and by the way\nOne thing about George Soros ... ... ... ... to view him as a fountain of diluted evil\nHe does deserves some credit from Thirty years ago\nFor helping to win the Cold War no really he helped to fund a pro democracy efforts in some of the Eastern European countries and then even having having noted all of that George Soros gets these bombs and it's a kind of OK story\nBut all of a sudden you played a bomb at CNN headquarters in the middle of New York city in the middle of Manhattan and divert traffic on the street and it's treated like an emergency and boom\nNow all of a sudden it is a wall to wall they're treating this like some kind of devastating terror attack is the only thing that has been covered in the news and outrageously this morning\nPeople were demanding where's the president what does the president have to say why doesn't the president say anything well he had a public event planned for later that day he had a statement prepared for the public event in a statement was fine there's no way that anyone can look at that statement and find anything wrong with it in fact\nLet's listen to the first part of what President Trump had to say about this attempted bombing and wounding and maiming and killing\nInvolving his defeated opponent Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and Michelle Obama in their home and the former attorney general Eric Holder\nA of a the Obama administration along with representative Maxine Waters apparently and we had a caller who referred to the bomb that had been apparently

acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\nPeople are applauding and then I Know I Know I Know the monitor on the left if there was somebody a sitting here who is a congressional candidate and there isn't\nA from the Democratic party what there's ... no he condemns political violence but a at his rallies he ah encourage people to beat up some of the protesters\nI think someone with President Trump said at his rallies during the campaign was stupid\nAnd it was responsible and he shouldn't have said those things but is it necessary for him now to go back there and say gee I'm Sorry I said these comments\nMore than two years ago in the middle of a campaign it's not necessary for him to do that what has happened\nIs he has stopped encouraging violence and then somebody's going to say well the other night he was speaking in Montana\nAnd he congratulated a congressman Greg John forte for having body slammed a reporter or who um got on his nerves it wasn't even a reporter would have been particularly hospitals a Congressman John forte\nLook I think it was a mistake I don't think he should have done that and handed the other side that kind of support but the idea that that is somehow associated\nWith somebody trying to kill people and whether or not these bombs were very well made up it was an attempt to kill people or at least make people think that they were being threatened with death\nAnd it was outrageous\nAnd look there should be no problem at all\nWith people like knowledge ing President Trump said something very good there\nHe said we should condemn political violence of every time we should condemn scuffles we shouldn't condemn people and by the way it is part of what he very I'm perfectly and very poorly try to do in some of his garbled and messed up response to Charlottesville\nOr when he said there are bad people on both sides what he said it was terrible as he said they're good people on both sides they weren't\nBut there were bad people on both sides and that was accurate\nAnd if he can go ahead and consistently now condemn people from groups from the Proud Boys to end chief uh from the neo Nazis to us some of the other people on the extreme left\nWho won't allow speech to proceed you know something that was just I just found out about ... and it's it's appalling to me because\nLook I I have\nA certain affection for the physical a Yale University campus I spent close to seven years of my life there and\nRight now the camp has been totally defaced by graffiti and all the graffiti is excerpts from the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford right\nOkay what is the point of that for goodness sake I guess the point is because Brett Kavanaugh went to college and the Yale Law school he was also there for seven years so now they have graffiti to remind people I mean really that's pathetic\nAnd yes political violence and intolerance is pathetic whichever direction that comes from\nAnd here you have two members of Congress actually former members of Congress are Dave jolly of Florida who by the way is very anti Trump and Steve Israel of Florida who well surprise is very anti Trump here's how they sounded on MSNBC\nDuring an era now where violence seems to have licensed by the president of the United states\nAnd it's not just going to Montana and endorsing body slamming and it's not just saying that neo Nazis you know are good people or they were good people on both sides of a march including neo Nazis\nRemember that the president is facing the campaign offered to pay the legal bills of his supporters are if they attacked his opponents I'll just say one other thing on this\nIt's not even just the president we have a bomb squad and CNN or the CNN building in New York City today yesterday I was walking in New York City I passed the building where Fox News's headquartered and the ticker the digital ticker that displays news and the building\nWas reporting on the George Soros a bomb threat and it began with these words for the man who has everything that's not funny it is dangerous and so it's not just a president who gives a license to violence\nBut those who are enabled by that violence they have a responsibility to make sure that we are a embracing values of a piece of safety and not pouring gas on the planes were happening too often\nI mean I'm Sorry how does how does I I don't know what the Fox ticker actually said but if it said for the man who has everything as he sure that that was in the context of George Soros I I don't know but it seems to me that if you are in the midst of a heated political campaign\nIt is very easy to say this rhetoric goes over the top or this is wrong or the president said you should beat up protesters who disrupt his rallies\nThat's different from murder\nIt is and it's different from condoning murder and the problem the refusal to make a distinction\nBetween things that some people in the right may say that are sometimes embarrassing and irresponsible and just plain dumb [noise] that's very different from an action of attempted\nMass murder which is what we're dealing with here

want to show me that ... I'd love to hear from a prince Mohammed bin ... oh yeah President Trump told me it was okay I heard them attacking the lying stinking disgusting fake news media and I thought okay I'll do something and no of course he didn't think he doesn't didn't\nAt first of all we don't even know Solomon a mom and then sell them on was actually directly responsible he probably was but the idea that he was somehow encouraged by Trump's ongoing fused with MSNBC and CNN\nIs ridiculous I Do hope\nThat when only emerged on the other end of election day whatever happens and I hope urgently ... earnestly that the Republicans prevail\nBut that we can move on from this this stupid back and forth on both sides it doesn't do the country any good to have voices in the media just perpetually blaming the president for everything and attacking him for everything\nWith a visceral hatred that I Do believe is unique it goes beyond anything that they applied to George W.

from the two leaders of the Democratic party in Congress both of them want to be majority leaders\nI in Thirteen Days from now uh when they we have a great big election uh also thirty six governors' on the ballot in that election is so important to be sure you vote\nHere is what's on Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer had to say we listen with great interest of the president's remarks this afternoon we'll take an oath to support and defend the constitution and protect the American people and that is our first responsibility\nHowever they say President Trump's words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence\nTime and again the president is known physical violence and divided Americans with his words in his actions expressing support for the congressman who body slammed a reporter neo Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville he never expressed support for killing a young woman in Charlottesville it's outrageous and it's wrong\nLook he was as that's outrageous charge and they have it right in their\nExpressed his support for the neo Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville he never did that expressing his supporters are his sport is at rallies who get violent with protesters dictators around the world who murder their own citizens and referring to the free press as the enemy that people\nLook at the the instincts here to play politics with a direct in serious threat\nWhat would they still be doing that if if one of these bombs going off and people were killed it would be it would be even more outrageous and it is\nA now we we had a caller\nWho um who called in and Palin she wanted to say should Trump tone down his rhetoric he should certainly avoid anything that can be construed as an endorsement of violence of any kind at the very least between now with the election and probably forever\nIn other words it's least President Trump has a virtue of cat clarity here he does not want some kind of mass entry into the United states and by the way we can all I think relax a little bit there's an interesting piece in the Los Angeles times\nAbout the asylum process and about the level of illegal immigration and it uh it it mentions that illegal immigration right now is at a forty year low the only years where illegal immigration has been even lower than it is right now\nWe're the last three years including last year as the Obama administration has been brought way way down and brought down by three quarters way greatly reduced part of it a bad economy part of it much better border security which began by the way under President Bush\nIn any event here's the interesting thing\nWhen uh people come here\nIn terms of are applying for asylum\nBetween the years two thousand twelve and two thousand Seventeen in other words including the Trump Administration\nImmigration judges turned back Seventy five percent of the people who came here from Guatemala seeking asylum\nSo she may say it's America's strength to be tolerant and accepting but right now including under President Obama and yes under President Trump most people are coming looking for asylum are turned back\nAnd that it seems to me is reasonable and says the Trump Administration has made the process even more difficult by ordering immigration judges to stop granting asylum to virtually all those claiming to be victims of domestic violence\nA move that could block tens of thousands of people from gaining permanent entry into the U.S and in other words if you're running away from an abusive husband\nYou probably don't have to run away two thousand miles to get to the United states\nAnd that seems to me is reasonable enough\nUh let us go to your calls to John in Columbus ohio John you're on the Michael ...\nI'm like um yeah I I just find that you know disheartening as an unbelievable ... out the eighth or the left side media line they don't give you that the whole story they cut things out anything they can do\nThat it's really perpetrating the fraud was on concern that I'm\n... and the the that the political people on the left side\nThere that are lower the bottom feeder tactic of marrying President Trump has made a lot of accounting he's pretty much kept this war he stayed on target these trying but like you said nobody is perfect guy created nobody's perfect\nRight but the point is it don't you I I don't you think would be helpful if folks on our side didn't for instance chant lock her up lock her up um I mean and again it's I I think the American people are kind of tired of that and that's OK maybe in the height of a campaign\nBut I don't think it helps our side and it's not a question that there's some kind of great huge moral outrage or this crosses some line that's inscribed in the heavens\nIt's dumb politics because actually particularly the key deciding voters in a in this coming election are going to be white suburban women\nAnd I'm not sure the chance of a lock her up for anybody are

look at some of the ads that the Democrats are running I mean some of them I've seen it down in Oregon where you have a good chance of electing a Republican governor and um and and here in in my state\nThe ads are so hateful the most important thing is not to reward hateful illness\nDon't rewarded for you'll get more of it and when people say well you have to vote democratic to put some kind of check on President Trump selection isn't about President Trump it's about Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer Trump status\nIs not going to change is going to continue as president the question is do

R. E. N. A. N. or just one and not to\nAnd but they addressed it to them care of CNN he also does by the way commentary on MSNBC he um he he actually plays both sides of the pile on that one both so balanced CNN and MSNBC\nIn other words that but MSNBC did not get a John Brennan package CNN did\nBut all of these packages seemed to be very directly and personally addressed two prominent figures on the American left\nBronco bomb Hillary Clinton\nFormer attorney general Eric Holder congresswoman Maxine Waters and yes I'm also Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz now\nYou may have heard on this show and it's I Know it can be a little bit confusing that the return address on these packages on all of them apparently was Debbie Wasserman Schultz no one believes that she's the one who sent [laughter]\nUsually if you send a bomb you don't put your real address on it I mean and I know that we watch them and she'll ... she is but uh no she didn't do this I don't I don't think anyone is suspecting that congresswoman Wasserman Schultz did it\nWhat obviously was going on here is that this was the warped sense of humor or the evil and warped individual whoever it is who did this who figured oh great if they don't deliver this package and they return it then I'll get bent Debbie Wasserman Schultz and in trouble if even if I don't blow her up with a bomb that I sent her way\nA look all of this this is serious enough and I'm OK Debbie Wasserman Schultz today condemned the packages sent this week with her return and trashed\nChef saying she is deeply disturbed that her name was attached to I I can imagine that I can sympathize with that packages apparently\nCan turning can painting explosives were sent on Wednesday the high level democratic leaders including former President Obama former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton with Wasserman Schultz is office name as the return address\nOne of those packages addressed former attorney general Eric Holder was returned to Wasserman Schultz his office because it was sent to the wrong address two of her Florida officers were evacuated and response\nShe confirmed in a statement the one time Democratic National committee chair she's been replaced by the indescribable fulltime Paris or she says in her statement we will not be intimidated by this attempted act of violence\nThe appalling attack on our democracy\nMust be vigorously prosecuted and I am deeply disturbed by the way my name was used okay I think it it makes it fairly clear that um there are a lot of suspects on this and I hope that by the time we're on the air tomorrow\nThey will have identified a suspect they certainly should they should move as quickly and decisively as I possibly can\nBut to me and while there's all sorts of craziness Stacey Abrams is running for governor of Georgia\nAnd there are a series of issues that have arrested one of them not that serious one of them it seems to me very serious and one of them as it seems to me is very very serious the one that wasn't that serious\nIs that on the former flag of the state of Georgia she engage while she was in college in a protest or in which the state flag knock the American flag the states\nFlag was burned because it had the old Confederate battle flag in the flag they changed the state flag she has never been involved with burning of their flag since then okay let that want to go for a moment much more serious\nShe has called for doing a Taliban on Stone Mountain which is a huge and and beautiful mountain than city park where it would cost\nLiterally hundreds of millions of dollars and it would be unsightly and destructive to erase the work of art that was put up there in Nineteen thirty one is when they finished that they started putting it up and Nineteen fourteen and say three acres three acres of carved stone\nAnd she wants to blow it up I think it's perfectly appropriate if they put signage they're all around that saying that this image of Jefferson Davis and Robert de Leon Stonewall Jackson commemorates the cause that we do not on our support\nAnd I think it's been very clear that the government of Georgia and the government of the whole United States\nHas rejected the whole idea of the confederacy and the white supremacy that the confederacy was based upon very proudly very directly that's fine but this idea I dare dare even black leaders who have spoken out against Stacey Abrams\nRadical position about basically blowing up and dynamite in Stone Mountain the Taliban position and it\nStinks and even worse was what she said last night now look I understand\nThe Democrats are trying to capitalize on this health care issue but you think the way to capitalize on the health care issue is to trash the entire free market system here is what Stacey Abrams the Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia had to say last\nNight [laughter] higher here you are free market [noise] [laughter] [noise]\nFree market [laughter] remark in your heart [laughter]\nI mean [noise] the free market [noise]\nOkay the whole idea there is no profit and doing the right thing is entirely wrong because the very essence of the free market system the very essence of\nCapitalism is that you give people what they want and how do you know what they want is what they pay for and the notion that no one can make a profit doing the right thing that is only government that can provide for people\nIs utterly ludicrous and what she is saying here\nI Hope loses her the election I really really do because what she is a ... is that the free market system that we have to the extent that we even have a free market system any more than we do to a large extent you still have a lot of choice in your medical care\nAnd the idea that that is inappropriate when she says I've never seen the free market um write a prescription and rural Georgia I'll bet there are people in rural Georgia who were ... listening to us right now who have gone in and gotten prescriptions through the free market either because you have\nHealth insurance that covers it or because you pay for the prescription yourself and because it's made available at a local pharmacy now does that local pharmacy make profit by selling your prescription of course they do but you see that's the whole idea of a free market you pay them rather than in slave in them\nAnd government forces a matter of slaves ... this is a point that Iran makes brilliantly is that basically to get people what you want to do you can either use money\nAnd pay them to do what you want them to do or you can use force\nThat that's basically it I Know of course you can persuade people to do what you want them to do and then you do something for them in return but that's a free market transaction as well\nGovernment transactions are always by their very nature about force and the idea that someone is the Democratic party nominee in the state of Georgia\nWho believes that uh the free market has to be rejected because you can't make a profit doing the right thing for goodness sake\nLook at the hospitals that we have right now most of which do a fantastic job the development of drugs that we have there's actually something about the development of the drugs that we have through the free market\nThat is worth considering it involves a a a brand new movie as well we will get to that and your calls one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nIt and you knew the amount of time you you also think that that two thousand and one was there was not committed by foreign terrorists\nUm oh yeah a a definitely think it was ...\nOkay good so so what is our government has to do with that in other words of my problem with us with with what you're saying Li is I think\nIt's bigger than what everybody's looking at it as much burgers and and the chocolate drew a pop bombs is much bigger and more confined the there's more people involved and and what you think\nWell I again if that's the case then I think they definitely are we'll figure it out I uh I I appreciate your call but I I Hope that people will not begin seeing\nYour neighbors and your associates who may be completely wrong politically and disagree with you as definition only bad people because they disagree with you\nOn this I think\nPresident remember President Trump gotten all kinds of trouble for saying there would be good people on both sides in Charlottesville will they weren't the people on the Nazi side who's wrong about that but on the side between Democrats and Republicans yes there are good people on both sides\nCan we knowledge that\nLet's go to Greg in Seattle Greg you're on the Michael met that show\nHow's it going to go out and talk about that ... ...\n... talking about all the free market healthcare right and\nShe said that's a typical regrets on their side I mean really you know when you talk about the freeway traveling around really what it is it that it's the lack of free market will pay for the pricing you can't just go like something out one town or another for a better price that\nI Know and ... because their first of all there's so many losses and there's so many regulations in so much government interference and more than half of every dollar that we spend on health care right now passes through the government\nAnd the government takes it from people and then the government spends it so you're right we are very far from a free market system in any pure sense in a health care I'll let you go go to Heather in lieu of all Heather you're on the Michael Mann
