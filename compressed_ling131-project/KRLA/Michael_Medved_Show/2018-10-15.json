here she is the less the left is out of control I'm a public figure a new Republican I'm going to take my energy where it counts the polls you should to whether your share my views are not\nFor Trump I'll tell you why not because of anything he did in particular\nBut because he has been blessed with such wonderful opponents really I mean nobody could ask for better opponents than President Trump has received\nElizabeth Warren\nReally uh we are going to now have the great one drop of Native American blood debate\nAs this entire thing is incredible and Elizabeth Warren is trying to collect at least some of the people operating her name want her to collect the million dollars President Trump has promised if she can prove she's an Indian\nAnd how does she proves she's Indian\nOr we will get to that it's deeply embarrassing and it really does show that there are some not many but some points of commonality between contemporary liberals and Nazis\nReally yes really will get to that on the Michael ... show will also get to the great debate about the civil war and and again\nA President Trump ... ... did not show him self when he was talking about general grant and generally to be a particularly sophisticated historian he wasn't hired for that but\nHe absolutely did not inappropriately praise a Confederate general and they shouldn't be condemned for it and the press has helped him they've shown and in fact they were forced to retreat\nExactly why it is so many Americans and it's left right and center this trust mainstream media\nAnd rightly distrust mainstream media and most of all President Trump has been blessed this week at the beginning of the week\nWith the other early inexplicable desire of Hillary Clinton to inject herself into this democratic campaign\nWhy does this is a mystery is she some kind of secret agent for the Republican Party is that possible\nI mean she blew the campaign kind of everybody knows that she blew the campaign against Donald Trump President Trump acknowledges it and and now she is doing her very level best to uh to to basically\nUm help President Trump and help Republicans in the forthcoming campaign this November OK Hillary Clinton was on CBS on Sunday Morning\nAnd it it's one of those things will posted up at our website at Michael ... dot com you really have to see it to get a a full force of how uncomfortable she looks\nWhy submit yourself to this I I don't understand I don't understand what is possibly to be gained here except to strengthen Republicans\nAnd why is that she's not a political newcomer she's been around the block a thousand times she was a problem for the first campaign that Bill Clinton lost and and people forget this this is part of ancient history but Hillary and bill got married bill got elected\nTo be the governor of Arkansas very young man\nAnd then when he ran for reelection the first time he lost any last because Hillary was the issue because she hadn't changed her name yet she was still Hillary Rodham she's still have those coke bottled glasses that I remember her wearing from law school\nAnd uh she she was a much more of an quote outspoken feminist will eventually change\nAnd she campaigned alongside bill but given the fact that she has this long long experience in the political world\nHow could you be so utterly unprepared for questions that are very obvious and this this comes especially after we spoke to Ken Starr\nWho's now sending American and has just written a terrific book and again I recommend the book hardly to everybody\nThe um the book by Ken Starr which is posted up at our website at Michael ... dot com tells the story of the impeachment of Bill Clinton and it tells much more tells the whole story of Ken stars life\nBut it does not portray Hillary in a very positive way and when you read that book you can understand why she would be so utterly unprepared for questions like those she received on CBS listen\nWhat role if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill sexual misconduct\nNone no no no well I take responsibility for my life and my actions\nShe also stood by his side as he was impeached after lying about his affair with a White House intern from today had said you should have stepped down\nIn retrospect do you think [noise]\nFeel should have resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal ... not it wasn't an abuse of power now\nNow there are people who look at the incidents of the nineties and they say a president of United States cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern the power imbalance as to what an adult\nBut let me ask you this where the investigation of the current incumbent against to numerous allegations have been made and which he\nDismisses denies and ridiculed so there was an investigation and\nAs I Believe came out in the right place [noise]\n[noise] okay uh it came out in the right place for Monica did it or it came out in the right place for those people by the way including very much Lindsey Graham\nWho was one of the leading Republicans in the house of representatives at that time working on impeachment\nThis is so astonishing this is eight eight utterly shameful display of what about is um let let me play it for you again because he'll notice immediately\nThat rather than talking about what was obviously an abuse of power involving a president of the United states and an intern an intern in his office\nIs she a doesn't confirm that and she says oh well but what about Trump but you know what here is the key point and and listen to how how ... Hillary Clinton just he lied said she just moved away from it and doesn't even touch it\nPresident Clinton was accused\nOf miss behavior the kind of behavior that would have gotten any CEO fired and so quickly so quickly you can't work for any corporation I mean anywhere today you can't even work in Hollywood and be involved and doing stuff like this and and come out the other side\nThe accusations about Trump has to do\nA with a period in his life long before he was directly involved in politics and certainly before he was in the White House by the way or just listen one more time and I want to come back to this 'cause it's very very important\nAnd it's it's so crucial to make distinctions okay here's Hillary Clinton again being questioned about her record defending bill\nWhat role if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill a sexual misconduct\nNone no no not ... I take responsibility right where my rights and my actions\nShe also stood by his side as he was impeached after lying about his affair with a White House intern from today had said he should have stepped down\nIn retrospect do you think [noise]\nBill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky is absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now\nNow there are people who look at the incidence of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an internal power imbalance as to why an adult\nBut let me ask you that she wasn't aware that organization at the current incumbent against to numerous allegations have been made of stumped shops up\nRight there ... I think anyone including the most devoted supporters of President Trump\nOr would acknowledge that if it came out that he was having an affair with the White House intern if he were doing the things that Bill Clinton we now know did\nThat yes President Trump should step down at but there's no evidence of that and I am virtually certain especially given the amount of media scrutiny of President Trump\nAnd Secret Service scrutiny and and FBI school and everything else there's nothing irregular about his sexual behavior since he has been president\nAnd see the point over here is the failure to make distinctions in other words Hillary Clinton and liberals want us to believe that what Brett Kavanaugh did as a Seventeen year old allegedly at a party\nA is a is incredibly serious in ruins in forever and what Bill did as president of the United states and when you talk about abuse of power there's also such a thing about abuse of power involving\nThe Congress and the government and federal investigators or we will get to that and much more coming up on the ... Bob\nMichel message across America it's well I mean it\nA fanatic believes that it is significant if you're able\nTo find and if people who've taken these DNA test it always turns out oh you know two percent African American and I'm One percent\nAre from from uh Australia aboriginal I I don't think that turns up very often\nBut the the entire thing is not the only Democrats do this it's completely ridiculous why are we so obsessed with DNA this is the question here would be was was there any sense\nIn which you grew up with a meaningful identity\nAs an Indian and she didn't\nShe was a fraud about it's your to apologize and just move on I I Do find it embarrassing when the president using the term Pocahontas 'cause Pocahontas by the way was somebody of real Native American heritage who became a Christian she changed her name to Rebecca and she converted Christianity\nUm look a President Trump was asked about these latest revelations about a\nSenator Elizabeth Warren who is getting ready to run for president that's why she released this video the timing is horrible for her because it will only heard Democrats and the forthcoming elections here's what President Trump had to say\n\n\n\nRead it again\nI also do not\nI also do\nIt is going to be a long process for the Democrats um but there are people who are saying uh well President Trump said he would pay a million dollars\nIf a she could prove that she was an Indian now as there are people saying well you have to pay or a million dollars now 'cause she proved a that she may have had and\nWon the Indian ancestor six to ten generations ago sorry here's exactly what President Trump said he said at a rally\nIf I'm debating Warren I'd make or take a DNA test in pay or a million dollars if she can prove she's an Indian\nNo she can't prove that but I'll tell you one thing you can prove as Elizabeth Warren is one of those Democrats who is threatening to bankrupt and destroy our Medicare system how we'll get to

earlier today that things seem to be going very much in the right direction for the Republicans who are\nFighting to maintain control of the house of representatives the Senate should be fine that that also could be close but it should be fine and things from the house side are turning around\nAnd one of the reasons is stupid mistakes by people like Senator Elizabeth Warren and a former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and then mainstream media in general\nBut one of the other reasons has to do with the fact that uh lives with Lauren is one of those people who's out there beating the drums for Medicare for all\nSo for those of us who actually support Medicare and I do I I Know how important it is too many many many Americans are who happened to be over the age of sixty five\nAh why isn't it that the Democrats are always claimed credit for Medicare or now posing such a grave threat to it and nobody better to talk to about that than a Daniel see Weber\nThe founder of

and your show where one point four billion active members right now\nIsn't that terrific I I I Love that so talk about why it is that this very appealing slogan a Medicare for all really means Medicare for nobody\nFelt the exactly and really is expanding a from Medicare which is the kind of an insurance plan they're going to converted to a socialism planned and here's what I'm Talking about is twenty two million Americans have Medicare Advantage plans\nThose plants this year actually decrease in premium because they're operated through independent insurance companies having a decrease in premiums\nHowever the Bernie Sanders Medicare for all lemonade Medicare Advantage plans and replace it with a socialism plan is similar to what happened in Canada\nAnd the problem with that is they have rationing for example it takes twenty two week schedule a surgery and I don't think most Americans like to have that kind of medical treatment\nThrough hard work and faith and determination over came out of challenges but eight years after the common fire chief in St or\nI was blessed become the fire chief in Atlanta on the thin layer Shirley Franklin and um ten or twenty months after serving her I was appointed to the United states are stretching\nOnto the administration of president Barack Obama and I was there for just under a year when I was recruited back to the city of Atlanta about the honorable America say Murray and two thousand and ten and I served him faithfully for five years until I was terminated in January of two thousand and fifty\nOkay this whole story your whole story is a great American story and it's a great story of public service and success\nHow how is it you ended up whether you are say or terminate you were fired was it wasn't because of something that happened in the line of duty what was it that led to your firing\n[noise] well a a year prior to my termination I had published a book that I had written on my own time and self publish for Christian men the book is called who told you that you were neck and if the question that got ask Adam\nIn the garden to eat and ... and I say that because a lot of people don't connect that question with Janet this check the birth eleven so\nAh so the book is titled who tells you that your neck it over calming the stronghold of condemnation\nAnd uh so that happened a year before I was suspended ah but the reason why I was terminated there was a cause I spent a few paragraphs explaining God's purposes for sex and marriage and that God created\nA sex for procreation and and and for the pleasure between a husband and I told him ... and that and insects outside of that\nA is a thin and ultimately that's what cost me my childhood dream come true fairy tale career\nOkay now let let's get this straight\nYou have these opinions what's your opinion is that literally hundreds of millions of Americans share and you weren't trying to impose these opinions on some of your men and the fire department where you\nKnow are not at all\nSo in ... it was it the fact is you self published the book he hadn't use public funds\nWhat business is it of the city of Atlanta\nFor the mayor of the city council or anybody or what the fire chief does on his personal time as long as it's not disgraceful what was the argument for using a passage in your book to ruin your career\nFor their position was that those positions those views conflict it with the city views\nAre and that I can have those you as much as I Want but when I was an employee of the city or I had an obligation to check those beliefs that the door is what one council members fit and the mayor clearly supported that fish\nOkay at this point or this I think most people are listening to us or slapping therefore hands I think this is just clearly unjust and when people suffering injustice or discrimination\nFor a really an assault against their religious liberties or freedom of conscience who you're going to call not ghost

the chief\n[noise] so the the city argued they were trying to be inclusive believe it or not by firing the chief because they didn't agree with that too so I didn't I didn't quite understand that but we filed a lawsuit on behalf of the chief the good news is a is that we argue that the policies they actually required prior permission so they told the cheap\nAfterward that oh no you can't write a book on your own time for a Bible study unless you get prior permission from the ... and the city allows you to do so we challenge that as being unconstitutional is only five permission needed is the first amendment and the judge ruled with us [noise]\nThey say that uh the American people now trust politicians they'll listen seriously [noise]\nMore than they have it any time in the last ten years\nThis is extraordinarily good news for politicians in general but for Republican politicians because this comes at a time\nWhen there is an all out fight\nFor Republicans to keep control of the house of representatives of the Senate or the United states we should be able to do that\nAnd uh\nOf the White House in the hands of conservative leadership one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six what's amazing about this\nIs ask people to uh to determine\nDo you have a great deal of trust in politicians trust and confidence politicians do you have a fair amount of trust and confidence in men and women in political lights life\nOr or do you have a low amount of trust in politicians trust has been soaring here's the amazing part\nThe increase it's not only a ten year high it's seven points from a year ago and Thirteen points from the record low of forty two percent in September two thousand sixteenth okay now what happened right after September two thousand sixteen\nThe election of Donald Trump is president the United states is it appropriate to feel more trust in politicians right now actually I think it is I Do with all of the problems that we have in American politics and all the conflicts we have\nIf you're one of those people who trust politicians not at all or less than ever or you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six uh\nMeanwhile I Want to get back to that question but there was a fairly remarkable interview with President Trump on sixty minutes\nAnd no it's not Fox News is on Fox and friends it's not the friendly confines a president from those at when he was going to be interviewed by Lesley Stahl who interviewed him before and then when he was going on sixty minutes he's won CBS network is not going to get easy questions fast\nBalls or pardon me slow hanging curve balls right over the plate\nHe's going to get some fairly tough questioning and he did so how did the president do are you cannot\nHelp judge for yourself up for those who did not see the sixty minutes interview which was big news last night here was a when I think it was a fairly interesting inappropriate question from Leslie stall with the president's answer right at the beginning\nYou are the first president to the United states who never had a political post before\nWe're never served in the military you come up here and have been here for almost two years now what's the biggest surprise and what have you learned since you've been press okay\nSo I always used to say the toughest people in Manhattan real estate guys and blah blah [noise] now I say their babies [laughter] get out his political people this is the most deceptive vicious world\nIt is a vicious cycle lies deceit and deception you make a deal with somebody on the site making a deal with that table give me an example I don't want to give you an example I'm looking at in the meantime nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do\nRemember that when you look at taxes you look at regulations you look at making deals with other countries [noise] nobody's been able to do anything like this actually\nMost people don't even try because they knew they didn't have the ability to do it but it's a very deceptive well okay I\nA very deceptive world um how does that correlate with the idea that trust in politicians is it a ten year high I I think it has to do with the fact that most people regardless of which side you are on\nCan feel that it at least some of your\nConcerns are being addressed because there's so many voices in this political debate ... dramatic\nAnd even though we don't officially have divided government ... the Democrats haven't been shy in letting their points of view be known and by the way the poll from Gallup that show the\nTrust in politicians hit a ten year high that was taken before the accusations by Christine Blasey Ford and before the second round of the Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd there's no question that those accusations took a toll particularly on confidence people hadn't in Brett Kavanaugh though I still believe that uh that entire confrontation is going to work very strongly Republican\nAs does this general sense that believe it or not with all of the deal making and the viciousness that President Trump is\nTalking about there's a sense that the political system is working\nA President Trump was a then asked about uh the aspect of the political world that he is most routinely condemned and that of course would be as good friends in mainstream media\nAnd the other thing I really learned his I never knew how dishonest the media was I I I really made it I'm not saying that as a sound by\nBy now I have you have to try to get to know what even the way you ask me a question like about separation\nWhen I say Obama did it you don't want to talk to them out I don't know I had it looks like an answer but you did it for time I'm just telling you that you feed into me much differently on the subject I think that I don't want to have that type with you hey All right now the fight with a good time I'm president and you're not\n[noise] uh okay uh and and then they change continues to or a question that I think a lot of people asked\nAbout an editor mocking was used regularly the president mocked Christine Blasey Ford well Lesley Stahl picked up on that and just took it a little bit to the side\nProfessor of philosophy forging mimicked her had I not made that speech we would not have one I was just saying she didn't seem to know anything you know and you try to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary why did you have to make fun of her\nI didn't really make fun of the nation is the person that we're talking about you know the air the time the place\nProfessor they forgot before the Senate and and was asked what the worst moment and she said when the two boys who laughed at me at my house and then I watched him and my car and thousands of people were laughing at her\nThey can do what they I I Will tell you that\nWay now justice Kevin always treated it has become a big factor\nIn the midterms have you seen what's going on with the polls [laughter] did you have to call I think she was treated with greater respect I Know they say what do you think you shouldn't have been thinking a tree that West Point that's a show you how dare you seem to be saying that she\nLied about a ... you know what I'm not going to get into it because we won it doesn't matter well we won\nOkay a look at the one thing that I think he was on the right track with he did not make her mimic during her as if you try to imitate her accent or tone of voice\nShe didn't do that and it is that would've been horrible what he did was he talked about he ... he didn't changes tone of voice he said\nHe said uh when did it happen I don't remember where did you go I don't remember if we can have that played that soundbite for you but this entire media narrative which I don't think is working in the left if you disagree with me and give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nThat President Trump was mocking Christine Blasey Ford that he was mimicking her mimicking is even worse because\nPeople do mimic people I mean I I have been known to mimic people\nOh Im perfectly sometimes but I Do a better alone it but this was not that\nAnd then uh\nThen he was asked a question that has a profound concern to Democrats here's Lesley Stahl\nBut why not they shouldn't do it this is a terrible thing to have held belief that the Russians interfered in the two thousand sixteen campaign election they metal but I think China metal too and I\n... metal because I think China metal also and I think frankly\nAre problems that hurting the whole Russian ally Russia but I'm also saying that\nOK\nHere's all has many times what is undoubtedly the case which is Russia interfered in the election and I think what President Trump is saying is a there is no evidence that Russia swayed\nThe election and by the way I think that's true\nIf you disagree you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six

after our own interests uh we we oppose\nRussia's meddling in our election not because it is profoundly wrong in some kind of cosmic sense but because it hurts the United states it's a hostile act and we want to stop it [noise] so what's what's wrong with that\nI don't think there's I don't think there's anything really entirely wrong with us trying to question our own morality in uh in our current role in the world today but just to just to think that there are not the elements that are trying to influence our our because we are one of the most powerful countries\nAnd then of course there are governments that are trying to do it but uh and we are we are right to call them out on it and to try to oppose it and then again I think people are right when when a country acts abroad as apparently Saudi Arabia dead\nWhich is why do think that what people are talking about about this being some got a rogue operation that went wrong that they were actually they're not to kill his show gay and

challenge it\nCan somebody tell me what but it did for the country with Anita Hill on Clarence Thomas even though I don't believe she was telling the truth I don't\nAt least you could say she raised

you one of the descriptions\nI'm In\nPortland which is long seeing clashes between the far left in the far right\nFor two weeks they've been consumed with Brett black lives matter protests over a fatal police shooting in September those protests in turn provoked right wing groups when video emerged last weekend of demonstrators blocking traffic and beating on a passing drivers car and those videos were horrible\nAnd it it's completely what was so amazing as a police didn't break it up these people were attacking motorists and ... and by the way\nMost of the more we're white most of the demonstrators are white and they were as a tank and motorists were being white people\nHate crime okay ah\nPortland police apparently had been expecting trouble and managed to prevent it for half an hour or so by lining up and tactical gear along the street I'm sure they love this but after sundown things kicked off the anti fascist may provoke violence\nAccording to a freelance reporter who documented the ensuing Malay on Twitter one of them burned an American flag as a Proud Boys and company we're leaving causing the Proud Boys to return another quote anti fascist in Dallas the entire

is there somebody out\nThere who sees the Proud Boys broiling with the ... people you think wow those on the five people are really braver good let's hear it for the Proud Boys they've done such a

because\nI Know as the timing the timing why why do you think given the fact\nGiven the fact that this happened thirty six years ago and that brightly animal has been a very public person for at least Twenty years why now\nAnd that's it and that is exactly what I was going to when I was going to say because\nI don't want this man on the Supreme Court deciding things that have to do with rape cases per se and analyze that that will that will very possibly look at ... ... you know all the way that that in a lot is that is a I I Know what\nIt was all over the off it's you know I don't hold on I don't hold on just helped me logically what does something\nThat he allegedly did when he was Seventeen but he denies and nobody else says he did it it's just her what does her charge against him when he was Seventeen have to do with real v Wade\nNo it doesn't have anything to do with all the way what I'm saying that he he's going to be on the Supreme Court which could decide lies like we're all

words do you think that the fact that if it was somebody else's name wasn't Kavanaugh\nSomebody else who was accused of misbehavior when he's Seventeen years old that should disqualify him from ever

years after it was it's it's still Thirty years after it happened and Kavanaugh was already famous seven years ago and talking about a year therapy Sessions is very different from writing letters to a
