program\nWe'll also talk about another source of political unity for the United states which is a a complete contempt I mean total contempt\nThen is shared by Americans are black and white and Latino and Asian and rich and poor and living in the interior live on the coasts everybody shares contempt for political correctness\nThis is something that is stunning and there is a new study that a ... over at Harvard has written about yes Harvard we'll we'll get to that in just a moment\nAnd uh there's something else that uh I I think should unite Americans but maybe doesn't yet which is a fear\nOf another impeachment crisis I mean Democrats are being more and more serious and more and more credible saying if we win the house of representatives let alone the Senate\nWe're going forward with impeaching Brett Kavanaugh we're going forward with impeaching President Trump is that a good idea will talk to one of the people who was central to the last\nImpeachment crisis we had his name as a judge Ken Starr he was in charge of the investigation that led to the impeachment\nOf Bill Clinton\nWhat are the lessons for today's political world and what lessons for Robert Mueller who's playing the same kind of job that uh that that Ken Starr functioned in back in the Nineteen nineties one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nOn this issue of political correctness first there's this amazing piece in uh the Atlantic of all places in the Atlantic is not a conservative journal headline Americans strongly disliked dislike PC culture\nAnd this is stunning in the way that it shows that hatred for contempt for resistance to political correctness brings together everybody\n[noise] he um [noise]\n... what what they write about is this is if you look at what Americans have to say on issues such as immigration the extent of white privilege\nAnd the prevalence of sexual harassment there distinct clusters than emerge progressive activists traditional liberals passive liberal politically disengaged moderates et cetera et cetera okay one of the things is fascinating here is people who are traditional conservatives\nFar outnumber those who say they're progressive activists by twenty five percent or conservative eight percent or progressive activists\nBy contrast the two thirds of Americans who don't belong to either extreme constitute and exhausted majority\nTheir members share a sense of the tea with our polarized national conversation a willingness to be flexible and their political viewpoints L A lack of voice in the national conversation\nI think that's exactly right and you can count me ah yeah I I mean I I Would probably be grouped together with a twenty five percent who are devoted conservatives they say traditional conservatives but they're certainly elements sometimes you feel like part of an exhausted majority\nAnd then they go on to write they say most members of this exhausted majority remember that's eighty percent of the public\nAnd then some dislike political correctness among the general population full eighty percent believe that political correctness is a problem in our country\nEven young people are uncomfortable with it\nIncluding Seventy four percent between the ages of twenty four and twenty nine\nAnd of those under twenty four Seventy nine percent and that means the people who most resent political correctness we think it's a problem in our country or the people are having a shoved down their throats it's not working\nAnd why is this why is this resentments so common and by the way who what racial group represents political correctness most remembers eighty percent of everybody you think why people you're on\nThe uh racial group that most resents political correctness is American Indians\nAre second or Hispanics Hispanics hate political correctness and agents\nMay harried I'm political correctness or even more than white people do\nBlack people Seventy five percent resent political correctness think it's a problem the country and this piece in the Atlantic quotes a forty year old American indian and Oklahoma who participate in a focus group is part of this project and it's interesting project\nBut uh this American indian again forty years old said it seems like every day you wake up something has changed do say Jew or Jewish\nIs it a black guy or African American you have to be on your toes because you never know what to say so political correctness in that sense it's scary\nThree quarters of African Americans opposed political correctness this means that they're only four percentage points less likely than whites and only five percentage points less likely than the average to believe that political correctness is a problem okay uniting blacks and whites and young and old\nCan we say no to political correctness\nAnd that goes for political correctness even in San Francisco oh\nThis is an amazing story about someone named Steve on don't taste even his name is Steve on S. T. V. O. and he is the new president\nOf the San Francisco Unified School district and they've had a long standing tradition for the San Francisco Unified School district a tradition of I'm beginning each public meeting by saying the pledge of allegiance\nWell no more\nInstead the first meeting that Steve on cook presided over as president San Francisco in high school district sounded like this\nMake you tonight we start this me to get out of the claim American writer and activist Maya Angelou who wants to [noise] when you learn teach when you get you [noise]\nSection ... is accessibility information for public section B. opening items approval of four minutes for September twenty fifth ... motion the second please Selma certain ...\nOkay and then they go forward into the meeting a no pledge of allegiance and instead a a phony quote why do I say it's a funny quote the Washington Post ... actually looked at this\nUh this quote that allegedly from Maya Angelou the only source for believing that she ever said it\nWas that Oprah Winfrey\nA set at that Maya Angelou said it but there's no record that you have a road that are set it or anything like that and by the way what does it mean when you learn teach when you get give\n'em a I'm\nI'm not sure what that means okay here's the story of Steve on cook he's a young man he grew up in public housing he did very well in school he went to Williams College very exclusive high ranking liberal arts college in Massachusetts\nAnd um then he came back to San Francisco he's involved in a number of social initiatives and gum south elect to the school board is now the school\nBoard president but he said the um\nThe move dropping the pledge of allegiance and instead of calling Maya Angelou was not a demonstration in the vein of Colin Kaepernick another San Francisco bureau in close or he says I was looking for creative ways to express admiration for the people that make the country what it is\nHe told the San Francisco ... chronicles of the current current political crime it was disappointing end of the Trump Administration has quote been attacking our liberties\nOkay or you\nCan even say all kinds of things about the Trump Administration where it's been the Trump Administration been attacking liberties\nI hadn't heard that before what what liberties exactly is the Trump Administration attacked one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and then he said I don't spend much time thinking about President Trump yeah I think that's probably true\nHe says although there is a requirement that schools conduct a pledge or similar activity there is no such requirement for school boards that was a statement from the district spokeswoman whose name is Lauren that neck a no one in the audience appeared to mind\nCooks new introduction of course not at San Francisco and now they are planning on having other quotes from other worthy\nTo begin in a place of the pledge of allegiance those will include Harvey Milk James Baldwin\nToni Morrison the Wright brothers Abraham Lincoln and more [noise]\nUh well he actually dissented from the majority opinion said nearly a century ago Marilyn citizens out of deep respect and gratitude took on the daunting task erecting a monument to mirror the measure of individual devotion and sacrifice these heroes had so noble e achieved\nThe panel majority says their effort violates the constitution the soldiers fought to defend I respectfully think otherwise\nIt is outrageous and one of the points that has raised an important column by a Jeremy ... is one of the lawyers involved in this case is not too far away from this monument and Maryland is Arlington National cemetery\nAnd if this decision stands up that long it's going to go to the U.S Supreme Court and there will be probably a seven to two decision against the stupidity the story here as private citizens decided to honor people from that community who died in World War one\nBy creating a monument in their honor\nAnd putting it up with public subscriptions it was not using taxpayer money it was all paid for by donations and they put up this monument to honor the war dead\nAnd now if this court decision stands the monument would have\nTo be removed destroyed or defaced to a race to cross\nThis is outrageous and it's\nWhy the judicial issues are so important let's go to Rick in Los Angeles Rick you're on the Michael ...\nThanks so much like we're taking my call I have a couple of points on this issue that you brought up first of all the gentleman in San Francisco who thinks that their freedoms are being attacked\nI I Love this about ... you know all you have to do now is this a worry\nWith those views that they hold and all of a sudden it's become an attack right that's how they would know this is ... ...\nAnd the other examples you're bringing I mean you know thank our wonderful a higher education system the all we have this no hate America embarrassed for America anything old and traditional like the constitution\nForget it this is outdated now we have to form a New America which do you know the almighty left the phony moral list and I'm sure that they think they are they're going to shape a new American\nWhat your bed you're exactly right but this gives us an opportunity and the opportunity is based upon this other study that I threw into the mix which is a\nVery profound study will get some more of that it doesn't matter whether you're white or black or older young for rich or poor or liberal or conservative Americans have had it up to here with political

raises the malware someone tweak something that a little bit inappropriate they say everything's right\nNo no I think I think you're making a very good point it's one of the reasons the Jewish people are very sensitive when people describe everything else as a Holocaust\nOr would you do by saying that by saying I remember ... did in a big argument for not eating chicken and uh they said don't eat chicken at the Holocaust on your plate\nYou remember this we had we had in her new Kirk on from pizza it's absurd okay you may be opposed to slaughtering chickens I don't eat chicken personally\nBut I

I Believe more than any senatorial campaign now in history it's each raise more money\nAnd it's a campaign that's going to lose I Am very confident going to lose deserves to lose as a campaign for ... or ... in Texas and the un congressman who's running against Ted Cruz it it just took a look at the polls\nThey all show Ted Cruz up up substantially up six points nine point seven points it's in that range\nBut debate O'Rourke just announced that he had raised thirty eight million dollars\nFor what I bet there's some people are listening to move contributed a debate or works campaign\nIf you've sent money to this guy called me and tell me why one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six Syria is in a tape that he prepared Beto O'Rourke thanking his poor diluted followers\nAre just heartbreaking and say thank you [laughter] with your health we raise more than three million dollars over these last\nThree months that came from eight hundred two thousand eight hundred and thirty six unique contributions is going to give us the resources we need to lose this campaign as strong as we possibly can and it's more than three times the amount\nThe crews were is not just in his campaign to all the affiliated political action committees that are contributing thing\nWe're doing something absolutely historic not just insurance we have the resources to run and to win but to make sure that our democracy once again is power by people and the only people people over special interests people over ... people over super ... people over corporation\nIn thirty dollars in cuts\nAnd that is because there is certainly not going anywhere but it's going to be yet another example for people who believe so fervently that critical nightmare Gehring great money always when it's going to be one more time\nFavorite Greg knocked off Eric Cantor being outspent cook like twenty to one from ... gotta remember Joe Crowley by ... and she obviously one\nUm so once again we're going to see

your money because it's absolutely harmless there Ted Cruz is going to win that race\nAnd it's much better to send money to pay into than to send it to some some of those swing state Democrats were it actually might make a difference\nA and then I appreciate your\nCall and and by the way the best example of money not determining the election is uh in in the campaign Hillary Clinton outspend Donald Trump more than two to one and this is if you take\nAll of the sources and all of the money and all of a special funding a Trump ... was not by any means the leading spend during the primaries he

but we'll see\nWe'll see but anyhow um I think uh myself I kind of what you said I think they do is really running for president and this was just practice he'll he'll have all that big bank roll\nA leftover when he was dying no way to spend thirty eight million dollars now and November\nHe could be built in daycare centers\nThat he can build part of the law\nOr there you go [laughter] that'd be popular that his base would love that we're going to say they'll go Sam money I'll build the wall go ahead [laughter]\nWhy are those are just my thoughts I think you can just practicing for president somebody in the very the California and money has got him thinking that he's got to a chat sometime in the future and you've got to get his campaign chops and ah\nBut you know here's here's here's the thing what they're trying to do is they're trying to compare him to Lincoln and I'll tell you why Lincoln was a congressman just for one single term\nAnd then he ran for Senate and he lost they lost an Eighteen fifty eight but he did such a good job running for Senate and then he became the Republican nominee next year now the Democrats are saying hey ... or ... he's a congressman and now he's running for Senate and yeah he's going to lose but just like Abraham Lincoln there's one\nDifference Abraham Lincoln was money mentally brilliant and uh somebody of of deep deep integrity or ... or Rourke come on appreciate your call Mike in Cleveland you're on the ... that show\nLike simple I mean they don't get much more tractor I mean you know\nMore attractive than Ted Cruz are you crazy\nCruise comes off like it'd be ... and I get tired of all that stuff I think they are kind of a better chance than you think a lot of people lie to\nOkay I I Can't imagine why people would would lie in\nTexas to I Am in any event to say that that they're not going to be voting for better or when they are secretly look the point about this is a ... I I Know Ted Cruz takes a lot of gas because of his appearance but he's somebody who's worked extraordinarily hard for his state\nAnd after losing the presidential contest with President Trump\nHe um he has come back and he has been a constructive player in the Senate and you can talk to even people use to make fun of Ted Cruz is the most hated man in the Senate he's actually somebody who's won all kinds of respect from all of his fellow Republicans and many of his Senate Democratic colleagues\nAnd a ... honestly it will be very good\nTo celebrate a victory with Ted Cruz funnel election night he deserves that we'll be right back on the ...
