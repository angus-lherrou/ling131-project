presence on the court doesn't entirely please everyone in the country it pleases me a great deal I Will\nThere are a number of people who are ingesting this is the end of the republic as we know it is the beginning of a new civil war\nOr there have already been announced intentions by a whole host of organizations and some leaders in Congress on the Democratic side\nThat as soon as they take control of the house of representatives so says representative Jerrold Nadler who is a very very very liberal Democrat from Manhattan\nA representative Mettler says he's going to be the new chair of the Judiciary Committee of the Democrats take over and one of his first orders of business in fact his first order of business will be a full investigation and impeachment\nOf justice Brett Kavanaugh good idea you look forward to that of course they also want to investigate President Trump or on the grounds impeachments has been going on for a while look if you vote democratic and these upcoming elections\nYou're voting for this insanity to continue\nWines are good for the country what do you hope to accomplish when I'm Brett Kavanaugh on\nSaturday was officially confirmed by a vote and the

they aiming to achieve what's fascinating to me about this\nIs remembered that dramatic Thursday it seems like another era where you had testimony from a doctor Christine Blasey Ford\nAnd then you hadn't testimony from Brett Kavanaugh very very high profile I was watching on TV a lot of interruptions from demonstrators\nNo I don't think there were any there weren't whether Germany nobody nobody no ... and now some now they were able for that to control these idiots and I'm Sorry I think people who are screaming about murder and things like that are are idiots indeed\nHonestly if they can control it in a high profile situation as you can troll it every day\nThis is like a banana republic it is not appropriate for the world's greatest constitutional republic that people should be able to come on and into the galleries and screaming shout and by the way one of the things that has to happen is really prosecuting these people\nAnd I'm making them feel the disrupting Congress when doing its job and by the way\nI Would include all of the conservative demonstrators who do that kind of thing as well what do I say that because there are no I'm just not something conservatives do what can you think of the last time\nThat some right winger interrupted a the proceedings of a Senate committee or the Senate in session making an important decision like confirming a springboard

way let's linked to some of that that footage just really wonderful to watch it I I Need to describe it to\nA group of demonstrators came up to the doors of the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court building in the United states in Washington DC is a wonderful building and that Greek temples style all based upon the parts on an Athens and classics because\nAgain the founders of our country identified with the creators of Greek and Roman law they did I Know ... more white males though again there are people and African studies departments who claim the ancient Greeks were really not white but leave that aside um\nMeanwhile these folks came up to the doors of the spring court building and the doors are those heavy metal doors that with carvings on them and big handles\nAnd so a group of demonstrators came up the doors Supreme Court building banging on them literally budding their heads against them screaming shouting and sounding like this\n[noise]\nWhat is the the clear message here that we're supposed to be getting I Will tell you I think there's a clear message is overwhelmingly where\nIf you think this stuff is good for our country and then of course you want to vote democratic coming up a month from now you you do\nBecause the Democrats will guarantee much much much much more of this with impeachment investigations and lots of investigations and lots of hysteria and the end of the republic as we know it uh and basically some of the Democrats on the Senate floor wait to hear Cory Booker Spartacus\nOr who really has jumped the shark I mean it's it's just if this is your hysteria\nAbout Brett Kavanaugh\nYou think he's talking about ... you think he's talking about a a heaving analogize is the ah the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama\nWith people getting their heads bashed in we're has there been some cruelty or some salt on the individuals who are expressing their opposition to Brett Kavanaugh\nI I mean what are we talking about here\nWhy is this\nAppropriate they they of course had a song or what would be a liberal occasion I'll let you actually go to the one of the protest from Saturday immediately after the vote it sounded like this [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThat's right [noise] so do not take this today as they lost [noise]\n\nWhich is\nAbout\n... already done so\nThis may I think it's a sad day for our

wasn't accused of anything\nHe wasn't called the radical he wasn't he wasn't cold heartless Merrick Garland a basically they\nPostponed I'm\nConsidering his appointment because of when it was announced and but there was no attempt to smear him in any way and nor do I know of any basis to smear him but go ahead\nMe nothing about the fact of the matter is actually the woman who actually accused sexual uh uh uh\nNo no there were not it was only I'm Sorry and this is very important that um\nThere was nothing injustice Kavanaugh's record nothing involving sexual harassment sexual assault sexual charges misbehavior there were no X Y Z there wasn't enough thing\nA clean record until literally after his hearing had concluded and then they threw a Hail Mary pass and thought that make some hay with this one which is totally uncorroborated\nExcuse me you are not there so you can I\nSay it is totally on robbery to do right I wasn't there but what what is it that you think should this be the new standard now I'm going to\nTell you exactly what we should have done okay we should have done it so investigation fairly if not read them for a run rushing a lifetime appointment with all due respect we should've just white and do an investigation investigation and then determine if it actually done this or not\nOkay again again ... ... if there was any available evidence\nTo confirm any aspect of Christine Blasey Ford story even the existence of this party the witnesses that she named said they have no recollection of such a party they don't remember it she didn't tell anybody until Thirty years later\nThe the entire thing the whole idea that that well there were charges by women those charges clearly were manufactured and by the way\nThere was an important piece

part of the Soros family of organizations is what George Soros calls the open society project now this is not a conspiracy theory 'cause it's open it you can trace where this money comes from\nAnd the the idea\nIs that we should take it seriously or that it's a reflection somehow of of grassroots sentiment that people are banging on the door the spring court and saying shut it down do you think would help but in the United states if we simply shut down the Supreme Court\nSo that there would be no final arbiter and disagreements between say of various appellate courts that might reach different conclusions that was the case by the way on the question of the Muslim ban remember that swing court is necessary it's a crucial American institution\nAnd the Supreme Court has had his great

Sotomayor or who was confirmed with Republican votes and Justice Kagan do you remember any attacks on them from Republicans and on their personal and I remember\nLike what I saw them and that's fine but at the right wing under Donald Trump has gotten over ... over the ... this is why the Republican Party was a decade ago it's a different political party are cheap and it's become vicious\nOkay what what what do you see what do you see as vicious like Donald Trump is\nOkay I Level of ... western let's leave aside the pardon me Jerry let's leave aside the president's personality okay what is it about the Republican Party right now that you see as vicious\nWas I'd see that that's I mean we didn't even really consider 'em up for it they didn't vote for the Ford investigation of Republicans can\nCertainly did Donald Trump do or do you don't think you'd be she got enough or do you notice that they\nDid not trying to ... to her and in any way and yes that happened with Anita Hill but that was a different situation in different time with Dr Ford what comment was made by any Republican senator\nDuring the time that she was before the committee that then insulted her or questioned her or

government literally into oblivion and it's come on the dishes craziness right now\nAnd this talk about a civil war there were issues and that civil what is the issue here\nWhat is it that that Charles Blow thinks is the key issue in his column that he writes liberals vicious war and by the way the next day or actually it was the prior day the liberals vicious war that this morning\nOn Saturday the time that a big article ... courts legitimacy crisis is by Michael ...\nAnd he makes an interesting point which is that for justice Gorsuch injustice Kavanaugh they're the only two justices in the entire history of the Supreme Court\nWho have been nominated by a president who didn't win the popular vote ... firmed by a majority of center senators\nWho when you take all the votes of the people who voted for Gorsuch and all the votes of the people who voted for\nJustice Kavanaugh and you put them against all of the voters gathered by the people who voted against them well there were more votes for the people who voted against\nCheap but this is craziness because that's not how the way we choose US Senators it's true\nThat Wyoming gets two U.S senators there too fine conservative Republicans so to California\nAnd Wyoming has a population of about six hundred thousand in California has a population of thirty eight million they have the same representation in the U.S Senate that's how you find them more votes on the other side but did this deliberately is the way they set up the constitution to protect smaller states\nSo that you don't have a situation where everything in the whole country is irrelevant except for California and Texas and Florida and New York\nEverything else doesn't count I I mean this is very obvious and yes people\nWho vote in California you get to be counted in the popular vote and they certainly have a big say in the electoral votes because you've got fifty five electoral votes in\nBut here's here's the basic point his complaint is not against the legitimacy of the court his complaint is against the constitutional system that does work pretty well\nFor two hundred and forty years\nReally what's wrong with these people you're\nGoing to challenge the legitimacy of the court not based upon the qualifications of justice Gorsuch or justice Kavanaugh\nBut based on the fact that the senators who voted for the most of whom are Republicans represented states with smaller population than the people who voted against them one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six ... really it's foolishness\nA deep

why was Cory Booker and I always an Iowa because that's where the Democratic nomination process begins\nAnd his plan to win the presidency is he is going to be the most hysterical\nOr the most over

CEO and co transmissions\nMore am a Seventy sixer\nMichael meant that show are talking about the ongoing fallout about one of the a truly great confirmation battles and\nAll of the history of the U.S Senate and in fact I Can't think of anything that has produced a this this level of of negativity and craziness and hatred the board battle was close the Clarence Thomas battle was close\nBut what's interesting about that is there were a bunch of Democrats who voted to confirm Clarence Thomas\nThey weren't\nThere were unfortunately a bunch of Republicans who turned against\nJudge Bork\nAnd here it was such a strict party line thing but Susan Collins I think spoke so well for people who may be in there are a bunch of Americans who are genuinely undecided anybody who still undecided and you don't know well how do they handle it and why what is really count on that she lives in a Susan's calling speech\nShe made this clear\nI'm OK we will get to that in a moment and she made clear that uh she believes that Christine Blasey Ford was assaulted\n\nBut she believes not by a red Canada and this is what\nMazie Hirono the gentle lady of Hawaii I actually the most pathetic of of all of the Democrats and the Judiciary Committee this is what senator Hirono had to say about Susan Collins\nCollins is insulting to perhaps are far to say that the things that Dr Ford think that to the south or what is that\nWe'll see we'll focus on the health advisor hotel any survivor from her photo now for all of us are both very sorry have an account from survivor of going back many many years where they kept all these phone calls allowed it costs to themselves\nAnd says what happened with with a fella from survivors that they did not come forward I hung out that in your interview that he kept saying that there without cooperation cooperate than object Talon are from a bald assertion that who didn't do it\nThat's it they have a different direction\nHuman Services [laughter] right\nUm so what what is the point how did they just how much money for sex ed for the prostitutes\nProbably a pilot study 'cause it was only one point four million dollar only now overall every year ha Jeff doled out about four hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of grants to put that in perspective\nThe U.S military every year at the department of defense their total budget is six hundred billion dollars\nWow wow a at said it in terms of what you were talking about with open the books dot com you have a a basic approach\nWhich is the transparency is the only way to solve this is letting people know what's going on and President Trump doesn't have to get this through Congress he could do it on his own right\n[noise] well and that's that's the plan of the strategy that we outline first that the wall Street Journal then at USA Today and it's a three pronged attack and as the commander in chief at this moment that our nation's history when we feel that spending is a crisis\nThe president can take the three pronged approach and he should lead by example issued post all White House expenditures and then step to\nCut the federal agency waste and step three and this is my favorite part Michel he should report to the American people\nShow us how he's defending the American taxpayer by cutting waste fraud and taxpayer abuse and we believe that he should do Twitter to do the reporting\nBut I think it's a great idea and by the way you also suggest here that there should be an across the board cut in every federal department\nBeginning with the White House and this is something I wrote a book about the White House staff years ago\nAnd man is there a lot of waste and ridiculous nests in terms of the Fifteen hundred people who work in the White House staff a President Roosevelt one world war two\nWith a hundred and six White House aides total and what is it that we need Fifteen times that number for today I don't I don't get that at all what what about\nCan you give us some background on the um the two hundred thousand six hundred one dollars that our government spends on a new condom design with a additional lubrication why why does the federal government spend on that\nYou know the condom industry it's a very competitive industry\nBut I'm a two hundred thousand dollars flowed into a Boston, Massachusetts is a private company for a new condom design this is just one of the graph now they're obviously a small company we did identify Michael\nThat the fortune one hundred these are our most successful companies in the entire world certainly in this country that over a three year period they received three point three billion dollars worth of our money American taxpayer subsidies and they cannot argue that they need our money\nUh there's another one here which is a cigar taste test in Virginia for a hundred and fourteen thousand three hundred and Seventy five dollars how could they hold the spending to just a hundred and fourteen thousand dollars for the cigar taste test\n[laughter] and there's a lot of studies like that one point one million dollars of our taxpayer money went to prepare America's religions for the discovery of extraterrestrial life one million dollars went for a study on where it hurts the most to be stunned by me\nOkay well I guess is the theory is that if the government doesn't prepare you for the arrival of Esther extraterrestrials who will then we also spend money looking for extraterrestrial ... government might\nWell I think that was an inside deal that was twenty million dollars that the one that went to one of Harry Reid's friends and they went out looking for extraterrestrial life\nOkay people should should get involved with this and what I Love is the three pronged approach which is number one President Trump begin by showing how every penny and spent in the White House and a number two he cuts the White House staff\nBy ten percent and then orders every other federal departments cut by five percent and then number three he starts giving us updates every month on this war on waste because this is a war we can actually win\nIf you want to find out more about this uh go to our website to
