now they are declaring even over at NBC they have up there no more undecided vote on Kavanaugh everyone has announced\nAll the Republicans plus Joe mansion with the exception of Lisa Murkowski voting yes that means fifty one vote yes on confirming Kavanaugh\nAll the Democrats with the exception of Joe mansion voting no and uh the Democrats are joined by the one Republican dissenter Lisa Murkowski so pretty much a straight party line vote with one switch on each side\nUh fifty one forty nine vote it's one of the reasons that it's so important to get a better majority in the Senate\nOr today Brett Kavanaugh wrote\nSupreme Court must never be viewed as a partisan institution the justices do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle they do not caucus in separate rooms\nAs I've said repeatedly if confirmed the court I Would be part of a team of nine committed to deciding cases according to the constitution and the laws of the United states I Would always try to be a team player\nDuring the confirmation process I met with sixty five senators\nThe only reason he didn't meet with all one hundred is most of the Democrats would meet with him they refuse\nAnd I explained my approach to belong\nHe writes I participated in more than thirty hours of hearings before the Senate Judiciary committee at I submitted written answers to nearly one thousand three hundred additional questions\nI was grateful for the opportunity after all those meetings and after my initial hearing concluded I was subjected to wrongful and sometimes vicious allegations\nMy time in high school and college more than Thirty years ago has been ridiculously distorted my wife and daughters have faced violent and violent threats\nHe writes I was very emotional last Thursday more so than I have ever been I might have been to emotion a lot of times I Know that might tell them was sharp and I said a few things I should not have said\nI Hope everyone can understand that I was there is a son has been in debt I testified with five people for most of my mind my mom my dad my wife and most of all my daughter's\nGoing forward you can count on me to be the same kind of judge in person I've been for my entire twenty eight year legal career hardworking even killed open minded independent and dedicated the constitution and the public good\nHe will have that chance on the springboard to the United states Don

that both of these people have been through hell and like he slapped but my own and that kind of a body [noise]\nHow I feel like why does why do they have to do this in a public setting\nI understand you're an ... Lee right and and the senator Sasse is right and I share your feelings completely a look you know what the most damning thing wasn't senator Collins brought\nThis out in her speech is that Dr Ford said that she didn't know that chairman Grassley had offered her to testify in private and\nThis goes to I think what Bill O'Reilly was saying the lawyers a Deborah cats and ... I think the other one was named brown which\nHer two layers of big activists and they wanted the public testimony to basically tried to smear and defeat Kavanaugh's private testimony would have been so much better and chairman Grassley offered they even offered to come out to California and testify her there if she was afraid to fly\nTo patently she isn't really a face for you to fly [noise] look this was not malfeasance by Dr forward it was malfeasance by her lawyers who abused her as a pawn we'll be right back on a Methodist Church [noise]\n[noise] right here on AM eight Seventy there [noise]\nCBS Sunday after sixty minutes one ... got a friend request from God\nHe's world upside down I don't know who's behind the turned out to the guy that makes an amazing story\nSo new drawn God Forbid me\n... all news wise\nMadam Secretary season premiere he's breaking the rules\nAre unprepared he'll pressure Madam Secretary for the new drama God Forbid me and I knew in the I guess LA devious and [noise]\nThe way you get your medicine prescriptions is now changing across America go go ... dot com can deliver your medicine right to your door past your doctor to send your prescription drug\n... dot com once you Bill in your information is in the system and your prescription it's delivered it's just that easy to go to ... dot com and use the ...
