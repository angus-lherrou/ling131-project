product when we're already over eating protein so\nThat doesn't make any sense as an answer\nWhat we really need is something that gives them missing ingredient and the missing ingredient is a soluble as form of carrot and then we derived that from shapes will it's got some really great studies showing that\nIt's an important structural protein and that it really delivers the goods it effectively supports skin moisture\nElasticity in compact ... as well as overall hair and nail health and spring wow and you know most products as I said earlier or from chicken college and well\nLittle if any help because we're already getting so much protein as a nation typically most people need to\nCut down because they're not doing enough physical activity to derive to um deserve or for the body to use that much protein\nIn you know as we age the skin sins or the hair and nails have increasing difficulty in getting this carrot and the need and that's because it's got to go through the liver\nThan you guys are eating too much of those refined oils and that's the thing we want to really get a lid on that supposedly heart healthy olive oil coconut oil ... and of course ... oil and the\nAnd the other oils anytime they press on oil you got a problem so\nIs to cut those down at the same time you support the skin and ... and\nJust won five hundred milligrams capsule per day is going to be all you need if you're under a hundred two hundred pounds and if you're over two hundred pounds you got to use it leads to capsules and if you're in a hurry to a good idea to use to capsules for\nMaybe a

body well with\nHeavy metals there's three steps to dealing with heavy metals\nThe first step is to stop being exposed the best you can and one of my favorite things to do that\nIs they calcium aluminum silly Kate clay unlike the clays that are out there typically they're mostly sodium this guy can trap up to Ninety eight percent of all the weird\nThings that can be in food from insecticides pesticides all manner of junk\nAnd so we called this I'm dragging clans LAX\nAnd you would take to cap shows an empty it into a cup with about six eight ounces of water and you want to drink that while you eat your main meal and what this does is it transits the intestinal track\nAnd it traps all of these guys that normally would attach to calcium bonding sites\nAll the toxins it never leaves the intestine\nIt's just the ideal first step when you're detox seeing the body okay the next step is to do mild things don't remember I said zero\nYou gotta stop exposure so for you Delia that could mean that you um have silver filling in your mouth you have children feelings\nFor that and then you had them removed okay so now you have white stuff okay well the white stuff sadly excrete aluminum\nSo you still have a problem so the clay is going to be very helpful there and also will want to do something to minimize your exposure there what I Would recommend is\nThat you leave those feelings in place\nAnd you have them carries died stained every six months when you have your teeth cleaned and the ones that fail you want to replace them with low fusing ceramic so you'll need to look around in your area to find someone who can do this work\nYou can always call a cure a practitioner usually they work with a dentist and they'll be able to tell you you can also look in the

seven All right let's go right back to the phones let's go to\nRobert in Brentwood, Tennessee and he's wondering how magnesium might relate to bowel regularity and his trouble sleeping\nOkay or are you there Robert and how old a man are you know how much do you weigh\nSixty six one eighty seven\nOkay and when you when you have difficulty going off to sleep or staying asleep or what what's the trouble was sleeping\nI'm\nA lot of weight loss very rapidly and that's what I see and then lost white cells that certain amount of calories and tall I Try to eat meat so folks but I have the vegetables because most\nAbsolutely need the boat I Can't eat\nVegetables\nI Can't I Can't eat that much okay so you're not sleeping at night and so\nWhat was what let's get back to sleep and do you have difficulty going off the sleepers dance like\nOK offhand stay okay good I got it\nAll right well see the off to sleep is usually linked to the gall bladder\nSo we'd want to support gall bladder had your body size maybe three teaspoons of gall bladder PG usually the first night you observe you can go off to sleep easier okay and this you would use for months\nAnd uh after you have used it three weeks you would begin to coffee and them as per week nothing will give you more beautiful here and skin\nThat will just do wonders for you and that lasts for Thirteen weeks that's going to take care of going off to sleep now staying asleep is typically if you're waking up like for no reason you know we are you waking up to urinate or you're waking up for no reason\nLast year and I\n... well then we should support that so let's go with the polling the floor\nAnd see if we can't get you and your body size about oh\nThree per meal and I do that for three weeks and at the end of the time he probably find you're not getting up at all\nOld scarred traumas that may be slowly unrelenting lead choking the life out of a key or going to land\nAnd keep in mind if you've got two of anything eyes ears kidneys and the only ones in trouble it's unlikely that its nutrition so it's more likely you've got an interference field and it's just going to keep on getting worse\nBecause even if you provide a wheelbarrow full of nutrition aid can't get in but once you mud back that guy and the energy of really close to it\nNow and then both full of nutrition can outperform a wheelbarrow full before she'll give a ... get the number of someone who knows cue or a in your area quantum reflex analysis eight hundred three Seventy thirty four\nForty seven that's eight hundred three Seventy\nThirty four forty seven All right let's go right to the phones let's go to Robert in California and he's had poor circulation his hands and feet since childhood are you there Robert\nHow old man are you and how much do you weigh I'm forty three years old I Want to check\nFor ... well\nLots of times they hands and feet are cold because of the adrenal glands\nYou're not producing a an ideal amount of adrenalin that's one thing it's possible that you've had a circulation issue that is possible but it's unlikely so first thing we would look at would be what do we need to do\nTo promote the best adrenal function\nAnd so there you know there's a laundry list of things the adrenal is need\nBut in particular the number one they want a about half your weight you know says of water so if you're a hundred and fifty eight let's call it a hundred and sixty you'd need about eighty ounces of water per day how you doing on getting that Robert\nExcellent\nGood okay then the next issue is a little bit of salt\nAnd here we would like air dried sea salt or even better yet or pink salt which is\nI think so for the last two years okay that\nWouldn't be my favorite song I Would ever do you go to an air dried sea salt and what you want to do is break a sweat from time to time so you can taste the frustration at the upper outer part of your arm it should tastes slightly salty if so salt is perfect\nOkay next issue is that and of course since childhood I don't think there's any problem with iron because you are normally this problem develops over the years as a result of eating white flour in white sugar\nAnd so if you've had this from since you were a little kid then I'm not thinking that we've got to worry about iron so let's move on and then we go to be vitamins now\nYou could be in trouble here if you were a bit of the sugar hall lake as a child did you eat a lot of sweets as a kid\nThat's not okay do you know a few of breast fed to term or watch a show at least twelve months cancer\nSo good okay so you should be able to make me the item and it's All right that's good show a then the next guy is five hours is straight sleep\n... how do you do with that you're sleeping good\nChopsticks Marshall okay good well then it you know all these things sound really good to me when you wake up in the morning in bed or the feet enhanced still cold\nThey are okay All right then let's go to circulation show\nCirculation the number one thing you would try at first just to see if it's an issue as you can go on to something called Cirque du gold this promotes micro circulation throughout the body\nAnd it's your body weight I Would just go to for for a meal and just see if in two or three days you have a difference for your hands and feet if you do then I'm going to recommend that you go on the battlefield diet\nAnd you strictly follow it so there's no oil nothing that says occasional rarely you don't eat any of those things for at least thirty days\nAnd see if it now promotes a better circulation to their hands and feet if it does then it's the food that's doing this to you and it sounds like that's the case 'cause it sounds like you've got all the\nAll the things the adrenal is need you could try max stress vi and see if it does any good for you maybe one or two teaspoons per day and just see\nIf that benefits you at all\nAnd when you wake up from sleep you feel rested\n\nOkay well if that's true in all the adrenal things except maybe the B vitamins\nShould be good in it that would rule out the ... in my mind so [noise] um get a copy of the battlefield diet what I Would do is just be very strict for thirty days and see if it changes the game if it does\nThen wild since childhood then I Would agree that the something or some issue with circulation and I'd get to work on it as quickly as you can okay\nYou're welcome bye now All right this is Dr Bob Marshall PHD this is help line live and don't miss that is really great specials it's

welcome to the main event\nStarted with that clip\nFrom a from a the commander\nAnother example of a [noise]\nWhat I think this is what is what we're seeing I'm looking for the words\nAre another example of what we're seeing in in politics today it's so divided is so divided that nobody nobody can can or make a decision based on the person that's always the party there's no there's there's no common sense nobody can think\nFor themselves and I had a a I had a conversation with a family member and ah this past week\nAbout politics\nAnd you know I I'll tell you this is the reason I use that that a song after the movie clip I saw the light from Todd run run and because I saw the light I saw a little bit you know I I intended to have a conversation with this person to enlightened this person about\nHow they should see things and this person showed me how she saw things and I saw the light of how people see how how people see the world how they see what's\nGoing on and uh you know and you know I always used to do some interesting you say you know what you're teaching people to do what you do and in the in the process who learns more of the student with the teacher and most of the time is a teacher because in teaching the students something you learn something about yourself you learn something about\nAbout how people out people see things so I Know I'm getting I'm getting confused but I Will tell you in what happened in the last two months with Kavanaugh there's most people in this country\nDon't pay attention they don't pay attention they're ... they're more concerned with the Dodgers in ... in the world series or then the stuff that really made their stuff that really matters to their lives and they don't really recognize\nHow these little things affect their lives but you know I I saw I I heard a comment from this person said well it all depends on who you believe\nAnd she went on to to quote some of the things that she hears on the Internet on Facebook on uh stuff that came from CNN where they're they're taking things out of context and giving a a you know not giving a full picture of some of the things that Trump said or that were said during the cabin on and\nYou know what a\nIt made me realize that made me realize how people how people see things and it's not fair to make judgments based based on the way\nWe see them with a little clips and little you know I'm I play a clip here but I Try to give it everything to you and contacts and you don't know if I'm doing that and just like you don't know if you know what I left out or how I clipped it or how I'm putting a spin on it\nBut you don't know how CNN is doing that you don't know how people on the Internet are doing it on Facebook and all this stuff and it's not really fair for anybody to make a judgment if you're not paying attention\nAnd ah well you know what I just know they they everyone looks that looks at how we treated a Christine Blasey Ford\nUm you know hey we're is not a question of of saying she's a\nLiar or or this or discounting any of the things she said happened to her\nIt just none of it none of it can be corroborated then you've got to look at both sides and here you've got a a Brett Kavanaugh who is being accused of something he said absolutely never happened\nAnd hey we gave we gave a his accuser her her full day in front of in front of the cameras in front of the Senate everybody just talked about how credible she was\nExcept for all the people she said would corroborate her her evidence and there's just no there's just nothing that can say there is any truth to this and you know what a as Scott\nAnd I went on on the air last week I'm Susan Collins was speaking and we talked about how we SARS she saying why she's voted yes but then we came into the studio we didn't have a chance to to watch it because she came on right as we're starting to record\nAnd I had a a a listener oh send me an email about hey you know you you didn't even give her any any given her do well we didn't give her view 'cause they're her do because I didn't watch it before that we just saw the first couple of minutes of it\nAnd came into the studio um and I think Susan Collins in her in her a in her speech\nKind of kept\nSocialized what ah what\nI what I'm trying to say is you know that hey you got to look at both sides and we see it like this and we see it like this\nBut let's not just make a judgment based on you know hey does she had all these witnesses in none of them remember the night\nNone of them you know hey she left so abruptly and there's not one person that called to say hey you know what are you okay but it's not one person that called and said hey I drove you home that night argument there's not one person the people she said absolutely would remember it\nDon't even know Brett Kavanaugh don't remember that night\nSo I you know we're going to talk about that we're gonna talk about that in a little bit more detail but I'll tell you that\nI still have an open mind okay I'm a pretty opinionated\nPerson in ... in case that's news to you I'm very opinionated I Know I Know what I Know what I've accomplished in my life and I know what kind of a advantages I started out with an F. none and and I know to me America's land of opportunity\nBecause somebody with me that came from a family with no money and from a dad who gave me an example of what I didn't want to be in my life and and just did it all myself\nI'm\nIf I can do it anybody can do it and it's just a matter of hard work and dedication and determination and tenacity and you can be anything you want to be and I just don't want to hear anybody's lame excuses so but with that um\nI still have an open mind and I could still see the light when somebody or when somebody will give me their view and and I think about it\nI watch CNN sometimes and I watch MSNBC sometimes just to see the other side and I listen to I watch all that stuff on Facebook\nAnd I consider it and then I research it and uh and and we all talked about it before we put our shows together and and I try to be as as clear and honest and in context as I can\nSo but before I go on before I go on and go into detail let me quickly introduced myself for those of you that are listening for the first time my name's ed ... president wholesale capital corporation your local direct

not playing because they don't\nBut um anyway so let's talk about so as I said Susan Collins voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court um they voted she was the deciding vote while she's deciding vote but her her and Lisa Murkowski and uh and Joe Manchin who's a Democrat or the swing votes because they\nCause Lisa Murkowski of Alaska Susan Collins of Maine\nAnd ah and then they often vote with the Democrat and Joe Manchin of West Virginia often ... who's a Democrat often votes with Republicans\nI'm so uh Lisa Murkowski tried to play on both sides by on the fence that same Kevin as a good man but not the right man for the Supreme Court\n... well number one you're not going to make that decision because the president makes the decision if you're the right man you're supposed to do you're just supposed to uh decide if you're a good man so if she said he's a good man that means she\nMust have not believed the accusations from a doctor afford a maid so where did she she's trying to say he's a good man\nTo appease the Republicans but he's not the right man for the Supreme Court I think Lisa Murkowski needs to get voted out\nAnd I hear rumors that maybe we're going to see a challenge from a to her in twenty twenty two by Sarah Palin which would be awesome\nYou know what\nThis isn't right this isn't right you know people people are just so so angry and just so uncivilized and it's a and and I hate the pointed out and be be biased but the Republicans aren't doing this\nRepublican ... you know sometimes a Don and I we talked about it she goes how can the Republicans are doing anything because we're trying to be civilized or trying to be civilized and do it the right way and not not lash out and the people that and those of us are thinking that we hear Trump say the stuff that he says and he's only saying saying what we think already\nA little bit more civilized than what we're saying it but a lot more brash than what we're used to presidents and so that's why people\nGive the wrong way groups dressed in red robes and white bonnet sew costumes shown to uh uh that that to make to make it look like the the show The Handmaid's tale to Netflix show that basically um\nPushes pushes the the roles of men and women back to the a caveman days apparently had been demonstrated outside of the centers home in Bangor Maine liberal advocacy ... advocacy

other than Obama national security director Susan blame it on blaming God you're on the video rice\nCNN Dana Bash asked callers to comment and it sounds like she's ready for the fight\nHer family has a home and made that they don't share the length and let's say to me as I Know that but the irony is back in ... when she was nominated temple and bats are the un\nShe came to me even though I did not know her back then added Paul and pleaded ... introduce her fourth kinetic which I was happy to do because her family had links to the state of play\nSounds like the beginning of the campaign speech but I won't feel\nWell it sounds like a you know hey I think about this I Democrat Susan Rice wants to be the introduced by by sued by Susan Collins and she's got some connection to Maine through her family and she goes hey will you introduce me and she goes\nAnd you know what if a if a Republican or Democrat that the Democrats have now I don't think so I don't want to be and Susan and Susan Collins said okay I'll I'll I'll be I'll do that I'll do that for you I'm you know it's called civility\nAnd after after we come back from the break we're going to talk about how the civility works um and so thanks thanks to Susan Collins and ... and the other swing voter I didn't I didn't mention Jeff Flake who Jeff Flake is centered from Arizona who's basically quitting\nBecause he doesn't like President Trump and so he basically quit or being center so he's not running for reelection and he even voted off for Kavanaugh did the did the fair thing and so they aren't they earned a fifty votes will actually earned was fifty to forty eight [noise]\nUm was fifty to forty eight or all the all the Republicans except for Murkowski voted yes in all the Democrats said no except for\nA Joe mansion and then Murkowski canceled her vote because there was a there was a Republican in Montana who couldn't be there to cast his vote so she cancelled the answer to offset the heavyweight don't go away we

but if you hear someone that thinks like you and you need some financing if you want to buy a house if you want to reverse mortgage if you want to refinance Comey toll free they five five six\nFour zero twenty twenty that's eight five five six four zero twenty twenty and one last time a five five six words there are twenty twenty but you know right on that subject or if you guys are wondering why the rates have have taken such a significant\nJump as of the beginning of this month is or the or the Federal Reserve stopped buying mortgage backed securities which they've been doing for the last\nSeveral years in order to keep the ah the market more stable so when things got bad they got didn't get as bad when things got good they didn't they didn't go out of that you know it's still help them fill help them apple pie that a little bit so it was a man made the bond market a little better so this is more like how the market is supposed to be\nAnd rates aren't supposed to be zero and they're not supposed to be one they're not supposed to be too but as the economy gets better rates get better because not only are you are we\nPaying higher rates on loans but we're getting higher rates on our savings accounts I don't have that much in the bank 'cause mine's in other places but uh so I haven't really I don't really pay attention to a a savings and CD CD you're a rate so I better should should check so I can give you a report on that as the rates go up\nBut uh but yeah so it's a good thing and it's a bad thing um but life is still good anyway if ... if the world gives you lemons make lemonade\nSo uh anyway uh we've been talking about in the first half the Susan Collins speech about the Brett Kavanaugh um confirmation and um so he was sworn in Saturday morning and I think President Trump signed them in Bonn\nAir force one uh on his way to wherever he was gone I don't remember but President Trump held a ceremonial swearing in at the White House each stream on Monday Night all the sitting judge the judges weren't attendance plus many Republican figures from the White House and Senate\nWhen justice Kevin I made his remarks he spoke like a public servant is supposed to maybe the Democrats could learn something from it\nSenate confirmation process was contentious an emotional [noise]\nThat processes over [noise]\nMy focus now is to be the best justice I can be [noise] I take this office with gratitude and no bitterness\nOn the Supreme Court I Will seek to be a force for stability in unity [noise] my goal is to be a great justice for all Americans [noise] for all of America\nJust about as inspirational as you would expect the Supreme Court justice to be a but you know what are his words his words even though they didn't sound that exciting and dynamic they're fair and that's what the Supreme Court justice is supposed to be my wife made comments about hey you know look at his family's standing there his wife\nTo win back the house and ordered [laughter] that's when civility can start again [noise]\nBut until then the only thing that the Republican theme to\nRecognize and respect strength\nUnbelievable\nWhen the when the Democrats get back in power that's when civility can start again wait\nI don't understand that I don't understand that um the the ... the Republicans want to destroy things that we all stand for well what do we all stand for America was was was\nFounded on hard work people want people want people want to work hard to get\nTheir own rewards people want to be able to worship how they worship people want to be able to say what they think people you know they we separated from England because people didn't want to be controlled by government\nThat's what\nWe stand for and the government mandating who gets is and who gets sat in who hey we're going to take all your money from you because it's not fair to this person doesn't work as hard as you know you don't realize hey hey they're making sure everybody's taking care of no they're making sure you're all\nControlled the more you depend on the government the less control you have your own life\nKeep that keep that in mind keeping in mind don't listen to Hillary Clinton's BS because well you know that's not the Republican Party that's not the administration that's in in power\nNow they don't they think they can just said they ignore everything we stand for no you guys are trying to trying to use those words to take control of the of America and all the people\nBut\nHillary Clinton isn't content to only show up on TV she and bill want you to see them in person and they want you to pay big money to do it so the Clintons the Clintons are about to embark on a Thirteen city speaking to her that kicks off November Eighteen\nOr those of you that attend will not be seeing neither\nTitled an evening with President Bill Clinton and former secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton the talks will focus on stories of inspiring into that shape their historic careers in public service well also discussing issues the day and looking toward the future\nOf course I didn't see anywhere where it's going to include a question answer\nBecause I Love to see that because maybe some Republicans would show up so they could call them on the carpet for the inspirational public service stuff that they do like helped collect money for Haiti and the money never got there and went to the Clinton Foundation and then it disappeared eighty ... billion dollars so\nThe tours organized by lived nation that same promoter behind Michelle Obama's current speaking to her [noise] uh I didn't realize Obama the Michele Bachmann had a speaking tours or anybody want to go listen to her but apparently she's got a new book out and uh\nBut ticket prices for the Clintons will range from Seventy two dollars to seven hundred and fifty dollars that's not step a price that's purchase price if\nYou want to go listen to the Clintons blow smoke up your butt\nSo ah you know and tell you to tell you about how great they are and how wonderful they are and what all they've done for you [noise] uh but\nMostly all they've done is enrich themselves can somebody please explain how Brett Kavanaugh's life was almost destroyed over allegations of women who couldn't produce any witnesses or even say were they were where they were attacked\nBut a predator like Bill Clinton is still able to go on speaking to her and make money in two thousand Eighteen you know let's let's remind everybody people didn't weren't alleging Bill Clinton had sexual improprieties there was DNA evidence on Monica Lewinsky is dress\nScientific evidence beyond the shadow of a doubt but beyond any argument this guy was having a sex in the oval office while he was president\nAnd some of you guys are going to go out there and spend hundreds of dollars to listen to him speak\nBut ... Brett Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh was alleged that he that he did something no one could corroborate in high school thirty six years ago and they tried to fillet him in the in the court of public opinion [noise] understand how that works\nUm one final comment for Hillary Clinton this week it's not and it's not a surprise when she still wants America to abolish the electoral college I Wonder why maybe because it didn't work for him here she is on with Anderson Cooper\n... using the other so called Sunni balls that in two thousand [noise]\nAfter what happened to all the two thousand election with Al Gore in ... that was designed for another time not no longer works as we move towards one person one vote I think it needs to be an alumnae that I'd like to see us move beyond that yes\nThis was designed for another time and it no longer works well no longer works for her but ... let's\nLet's talk about why the electoral college was designed it was designed because uh they wanted they didn't want the people on the coast California and New York to control the country for the entire country the so hey we're going to give you more more power because California has much more people so we have more electoral votes than Kansas does\nBut we're not going to say just because the people in California are packed in like sardines that that there's so many people here that we're going to overwhelm everywhere else in the country or New York\nAnd that's where all the Democrats are is California New York there's a few other places as well but but think about that if you eliminate you know they're talking about how Trump won the electoral college but Hillary won the popular vote well if you eliminate California\n'cause she won by about two million votes but if you eliminate California and just don't take any of the Trump votes or ... or any of the Hillary votes if you take that out of the country\nThen Trump won by about four or five million votes that's how many more people are in California\nAnd how many more dummies that they're still get the vote how many more illegal aliens and how many Democrats just don't pay attention and how many even maybe Republicans that don't pay any attention that were that were built into well you know you're a you're if you're a woman you better vote for Hillary because you're you're I'm trying to think that there's a I think Marilyn Albright\nSaid so there's a special place in hell for a woman that doesn't support women\nMeaning if you were a woman and you didn't vote for Hillary there was a special place in hell for you Madeleine Albright was a Bill Clinton's or attorney general I Believe\nUm so I don't know a\nCould that have swayed any women I think it probably did I think it probably did so now let's let's talk about some of the other stuff that that popped up Kanye West went to the went to the White House had lunch and gay Kanye West and made it we played is a little clip that they cut out a Saturday Night live last last a week\nAnd a and believe me I Am not a Kanye West fan I Am not a supporter of calling us I don't like rap\nAnd I don't think he's the most intelligent guy out there he's done some stuff I thought was was juvenile and I just I'm just not pro con us but you know here's a guy who's thinking for himself he goes to the White House and he actually said something that I think\nWas kind of inspirational and he's talking about that have some people look at the make America great hats and they say make America great again there is referring back to let's make it a great again like when there was a slave so the black people get get offended by that when in actuality he's talking about let's make America\nGreat again like before Obama when we when we uh uh left the borders open and we let the we stopped enforcing the laws and we we got we got our economy we got we got our military he's\nNot talking about back in the slavery days but knowing that he can't a tiny West is talking about he's going to come out would have to say make America great leave the again part I listen to this company made\nLove to see the super bowl [noise] Shirley making America great\nHarlem where America great and show them that we can\nSolve we can learn how to use them or certainly all I Love the show we almost all we all we all want to you know we are one we're on the one\nThat was a inspirational uniting ... comment that he make made and go back and listen to it again if you didn't hear it I'm going to run out of time so I'm not going to play it again but listen to how the media talked about this\n... oh okay I'm doing this for everybody who's watching us or turn the volume down\nTo put back up again but that\nWould have to think of all I have a song called play by play and political announcer here not her fault on our White House is that combination that famous consciousness I felt like I was sitting in a psychiatric says that bad\nA commercial for Donald Trump\nWhat I saw was a minstrel show today him in front of all of these white people mostly white people embarrassing himself an embarrassing\nAmericans but mostly African American\nWow wow this is a minstrel show him in front of all these white people\nWho are the racist here is it Trump visit the Republicans or is it these Democrats on the on CNN the communist news network or pee MSNBC these people these these liberal people that are trying to make this into a racing\nHey here's a black guy says hey these ideas help everybody\nMake America great unless bring Colin Kaepernick Uzi or\nWho's the poster child for a for a for bichon about anything that Trump does and take and being disrespectful to the country in the in the uh in the name of the black people that are being\nA being so miss mistreated by America and the cops and the government and let's say let's make America great again\nWe just we're bombarded by customers who said you got to do something to help us out with our cholesterol\nSo instead of selling them to different products we kind of did the simple thing and said you know what let's take these plants sterile that have been developed recently a new brand of plants they're all that we get from Europe with great clinical data to lower cholesterol\nBy up to Fifteen Percent of the little was four weeks we took that ingredient and we combined it with
