never do the show without a Sean McConnell or you can imagine when he does is the producer in the creative director major he does everything and William for screening the calls a terrific job as always my two guests Sean steel national commitment from California how many are there are you guys\nAre there's a hundred and sixty eight the run of half a billion dollar corporation wow that's that yes it's a national Republican party it's serious business we elect Republicans\nAnd Arnie how long it take you to write whiplash from JFK to Donald Trump a political I wasn't the tenuous they'll probably a couple of years to these things and every\nI I get a book reviewer Nelly book review and that's a really a great story what's happening in our lives and the last forty years you need to read whiplash because I have to stay on the doors but I have a lot of nice doors queen from Dennis breaker that's terrific and uh I think our callers have been uplifted by you guys what are your final thoughts because\nThere is hope you ... you know in terms of what's going to have Kevin I was going to probably get confirmation said Ninety five percent sure\nUh people are really upset but they've got to go out and vote for Dana Rohrabacher is going to get reelected because the cabinet and I think that oddly enough a lot of folks in that community a really upset and that's that should translate throughout the country yeah and in fact I haven't the Democrats picked up a few California seats that figuring that'll get them into the house still absolutely\nAnd again I think everybody listening should understand that a few seats literally could make the difference it's possible that one party could end up controlling the house like two or three seats ... unbelievable anyway as possible any final thoughts [noise]\nIn Dallas Fort Worth proud Michael ... affiliate here in North Texas and wherever you may be following me on Twitter at Mark Davis there's another whole show that takes place over there and I've already done another in dire show\nI hear on my own radio station and DFW and you can say we talked some cabin op so let me share with you some of the discussions I've already had with people than my goal is to have further\nDiscussions with you one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six you know whatever one eight hundred nine five five one seven seven six go ahead and get in line now you might as well I have a feeling it's going to be a a a an active three hours\nBecause and ever since a sort of the middle of the talk show day friday\nOr all kinds of things have busted out and we need to talk about all of them so why don't we take them in sort of chronological order and uh and I have questions for you and uh just let's just share thoughts and see where we all are because\nThis this is not just a confirmation hearing any more [laughter] this is not just a\nBattle like the ones we've had in the past contentious things like that though the slander of Robert Bork by Ted Kennedy in Nineteen eighty seven day yet the battle for Clarence Thomas or just a short period of time there after that was of course successful\nUh but when the Supreme Court is a very very big deal in the battles over it or a big deal\nAnd the moment Brett Kavanaugh was named as President Trump's election I knew I was in ... in support of his nomination because I Want constitutional is on the high court of I was thrilled to have Gorsuch that was a replacement\nFor the late Antonin Scalia or the Anthony Kennedy vacancy ... was a kind of a fifty fifty Justice Kennedy a lot of rulings are came down on what side of the bed he woke up on and and he's been replaced by a solid\nConstitutional list which is a a a wonderful thing and and now we have a situation in which ah with with with Kavanaugh here comes another\nConstitution list and there is no way in the world there there is no way that the today's left is going to allow a another\nConstitutional list I'm On the court flood of people said they didn't get this bad for Gorsuch Gorsuch somehow made it in what seems like a walk on the beach now compared to today's standards and and\nBecause they'll give you one you know there is that old precepts at when you win that election you've you've heard this a million times elections have consequences right and they do X Y Morocco board knows Morocco Obama's election and consequences and one of those consequences or Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan\nOn on the Supreme Court two constitutions shaping judicial tyrants because that's what you're going to get when Democrats main people at the Supreme Court but but it was Lindsey Graham said in that magnificent Thursday or\nA moment of his aides said as as as he said as the Democrats at us as he said to uh to judge Kavanaugh when you get on the court when you see something you sort of minor in ... and you tell them Lindsay said hello\nBecause I voted for them and I would never do that and what these people are trying to do for you I still wonder William ... four days later after that Lindsey Graham moment\nI I've I rarely them as a I\nMean I've I've I may have leapt to my feet sharing I'm Glad I wasn't driving 'cause I it was it was so magnificent it brought such moral clarity and moral clarity is what we need moving forward in this crazy week this crazy week\nA week made necessary by Jeff Flake and we're going to talk about him in a minute in fact we're going to hear from him in a minute because he is at some\nEvent in Boston some radio station is doing something and he was just a it in one and they have an interviewer was asking him a bunch of things and since you know Jeff Flake runs the world now I guess we'd better probably\nYou know figure out what to what the oracle says in believe these days but the moral necessity of this is something that I Am addressing in a town hall dot com column that ah that will run tomorrow\nAnd that is that this is not just a a Supreme Court battle anymore this this is not just a victory that we should seek\nA because we wanted constitutional is on the Supreme Court [noise] this is\nA moral assassinate because it's not just about him reaching the court anymore these kind of tactics these kinds of things that you've seen these these ... speckled bottom feeding tactics by today's left\nFrom actual senators to cartoonists to column writers to two pundits to people ... to all walks of left his life\nAnd they can't they simply cannot win they simply can not when they have dashed against the rocks the basic precepts of jurisprudence\nAnd not even jurisprudence thinking about a couple of concepts innocent until proven guilty that's not just a subtle law school precepts that's not something just just a courtroom ideal innocent until proven guilty\nHe's a basic human decency it's what you afford anybody who's accused of anything that same thing with requiring evidence\nAn allegation is made well what's the evidence that's the first question you don't accept an allegation on face value this believe women saying it is a scam\nIt it it is political bullying Jeff Flake was bullied him at elevator and and and folded like a skinny seventh grader on the playground\nAnd and we are now in this needless weaker FBI\nProbe what's the latest hang on the White House has authorized the FBI to expand its investigation interviewing anybody it seems to edit it deems necessary as long as the reviewers\nFinish by the end of the way oh did you hear any bugs today that the FBI I don't know what kind of we can just go to America imagined that an FBI leak but there was buzz earlier today that the FBI it might be ready to wrap this up like tomorrow\n[noise] okay whenever you got till friday you got till friday that is what ... told us a last friday is you know how old are you can have my vote you'll have it in committee but you can only have it in the full Senate ah\nAfter a week of a further probes\nAnd and look the best case scenario the best case scenario is that this week\nGives a frozen Boehner to the Democrats who had demanded it\nCreates a comfort zone to ideologically Vega people like Jeff Flake\nProvides a very I Would say cover ... provide comfort of for the Republican votes of Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski\nAnd maybe here's where cover comes in and maybe provide cover for some Democrats who I think we want to vote for Kavanaugh I think they want to not because they like him anymore than Cory Booker does but because they really need to wind up\nAs you know there are dead you know Democrats famously running\nIn states that Trump won and won big Joe mansion in West Virginia Joe Donnelly in Indiana Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and these are people they don't just want to vote for judge get they probably don't want to vote for judge Kavanaugh but they need to vote for judge Kavanaugh because I'll say right now\nIf Joe Manchin votes for judge Kavanaugh he takes a big bite out of Patrick Morsi's attack on him Patrick Morsi is the west Virginia attorney general he's a magnificent man\nI think he's gonna win and that and that that would be fantastic that would just be a wonderful thing to Patrick Morrisey be the senator from West Virginia instead of Joe Manchin and I like Joe ... Joe mansions one of those Democrats who does not make your teeth sketch\nHe's a left of center you know big labor but just socially conservative sort of kind of sometimes West Virginia guy and I know that territory very well as the first place I ever worked in radio back forty seven years ago and then we loved it then love it now\nI'm a love it so much that I Want them to have a conservative center [laughter] so let's so let's go Patrick Morrisey and Patrick ... right now\nI like ... him to vote for a for cabinet which Manchin\nMay do and this week of FBI foolishness may may give them cover and so if we get to the end of this week in the deck is cleared and the non sentences is as old as all played out and we have a successful full\nSenate vote on Kavanaugh is confirmed it will have all been worth it right it will have all\nBeen worth it but first we've got to get their first all that but I just said has to actually happened and it may not\nIt really may not have you met today's left have you seen these people have you seen what they do have you heard what they do\nThey will move heaven and earth to prevent this not not just this nomination their goal is to stretch this election win back the house so they can impeach Trump and when the Senate so that even if he they they don't impeach him which they won't\nAh you'll never get another nominee on the court\nBecause when you boil it all down is all about making sure that they're sacrament of abortion\nIs untouched that's what this whole thing has always been about you know that right if not I'll help you out with that so um [noise]\nOne of these young ladies have you with your vote you're about to put somebody who was sexually assaulted a woman you're about to put that personal spring port here's here's what Jeff Flake needed to do pardon me for channeling Jeff Flake for just a minute because God Knows somebody has to do in order to achieve some type of clarity\nIs Jeff ... job and I and and by the way I'm not trying to turn them into Ted Cruz her turn him and to me this is what a responsible\nJeff Flake ought to have done at that occasion ma'am I\nI Am so sorry for anything that happened to you and I honor your experience and I'm open to your experience and you have every prayer and every good wish for stealing and ... that's all I have to say about your experience your victimization I of exactly to the proper deference that anybody should have for that\nHowever you identify judge Kavanaugh as someone who sexually assaulted someone that is simply not been born out in the fact it may in some investigation may play out in the next week but it hasn't been yet my decision my vote needs to be based on what the evidence shows\nAnd what testimony reveals and not based on anything anybody tells me no matter how passionate they may be about something that might have happened unrelated in their lives\nNow please get out of the elevator I gotta go that's how it should go on but it didn't turn now we have this week of hell but wait a minute on that wait a minute on that\nWhat is this week going to do when we're together today and tomorrow I'm enormously grateful to once again it's all Joe God's you're smiling a Michael's back Wednesday Thursday Friday of course and then moving on from there\nBy the time we get to Wednesday Thursday Friday friday being just posed a deadline for this entire FBI dog and pony show\nI I think there's a possibility here because as bleak as it may look and as a twisted off as I Am about a very doing during this week you realize we are talking about today's left right we are talking about today's Democratic Party right\nI I think the air hangs thick with possibilities that they may overplay their hand so profoundly\nThat they may reveal such a deep bug guide hatred and the things they say and I do and I'm not I'm Talking about cartoonist columnist in the United states senators and everybody in between\nThat the pendulum of empathy may swing toward judge Kavanaugh as millions of Americans just a good grief enough\nEnough this man has suffered enough then there is still no evidence of the type of wrongdoing that originally created this problem for him I think by friday that may be the landscape I pray that it is\nOkay for me yeah marine what's a let's have you on TALK back to their one eight hundred\nNine five five Seventeen Seventy six Mark Davis in from I come at that totally on Twitter at Mark Davis M.

take a look at your thoughts as we had to Los Angeles Robert Mark Davis in Michael how are you sir\nYourself Hi great\nYou stay room just loved that that that just covered in Iraq and in in that area kept fading about what sport witnesses said it didn't happen that what they said they said they're going to remember\nA decay Dr forge allegations quote from judge Kavanaugh are not merely uncorroborated their refuted by the very people she says we're there you and I guess what someone else is that there are no I understand I I and I understand completely\nAnd judge Kavanaugh pointed out the various people who have no memory of having been there\nAnd he suggests that the reputation aims\nThat's not what he said he said all the witnesses stated it they will have to go back and look at it that\nSays that that I'm actually I'm looking at the quote right now and to quote from Dr from judge Kevin a doctor forwards allegations are not merely uncorroborated each refuted by the very people she says we're there and we can have a semantics game all day and semantics is important it's the meaning of words these are people\nI saw the entire area I hear I\nTied into ... so I tell you what to do let let's go beyond the refutation or the no memory et cetera is this a true statement not one person backs her story not one person agrees with her story OK\nCorrect is that the Greek Greek\nIs not not one person did not one person who supports their story not one person agrees with her story or corroborate her story is that correct\nWhy wouldn't I wouldn't I don't know I'm Sorry who did I must have been studying food who did corroborate her story I'm Sorry I missed that one\nNo one confirmed what effect but if I Want I don't I'm not like real because I don't remember\n[noise]

questions about how long the FBI probes going to take her\nThere was a bus I mentioned earlier they can wrap this thing up tomorrow that seems quite a bit to develop and from the White House today was they've essentially said look\nWe're not limiting the scope of this in any way examine what ever it is you want to examine just so long as you're done by\nFriday and so there is a global jar reliably from the Democrats' side saying wait a minute why does this artificial uh a limitation on the scope and timing of the investigation ... woman it's your buddy Jeff Flake who who established is no longer than a week\nAnd and no further than the scope of what we've been testifying about so far but in a in an environment where the goalposts are always moving and the terms are always changing let us heading into the United States Senate the state of Louisiana has been very very well represented of late a junior Senator John Kennedy is on the Judiciary Committee\nYou've seen a lot of senior senator is Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana he joined us right now what a pleasure to welcome\nTo the Michael Mann that show that mark thank you for having me\nEnormous pleasure thanks for being here let me ask you the thirty thousand foot question first and then we'll we'll start to dig deep uh how how does how do you spend the weekend how did last week strike you and where do you see this drama right now Monday October first\nI was so angry last week the way the Senate Democrats sacrifice Dr Ford confidentiality the way they abuse the approval process where instead of allowing a confidential vetting they deliberately put out this letter afterwards\nI was furious so I went home and enjoy my anniversary and didn't think about it at all\nIf you are a smart man you're a good senator and a very smart man and it was probably a very mentally healthy thing to do good for your health and good for the marriage so now we're all a oh how many years may I ask\nTwenty nine well congratulations\nTo both of you happy wife happy ... good for user so now we're back at it and I've been listening to from Chuck Schumer to Mitch McConnell to John Cornyn whoever comes after him and it seems like we're all just sort of biding time waiting to see what the FBI find what do you think they're going to find\nI think they're going to find exactly what has already been found that Dr Ford made obviously ... Dr Ford has some terrible experience and she has made allegations but all four people whom she says should know about it do not know about it she has a backup statement well they weren't really involved so maybe they didn't know about it\nBut at some point in our system of life not just government not the law but life\nIs for people say something didn't happen to one person says it did you go with the four\nParticularly want a man toll reputation as on line or a woman's reputation or anybody's reputation it's not about male female it's about fairness and for people said it didn't happen when she said should know that it did you just got to go with the four and so I think that yeah\nHe was there and and I think there'll be a vote for Kavanaugh and I think it will be approved\nCentered Bill Cassidy what is truly great state of Louisiana is there any inside buzz in the hallways about what the heck happened in that tight space with that with Jeff Flake and Chris Coons as they walked out of the hearing room the other day\nNo I don't know that um I in fact I Know they're on sixty minutes last night but I just saw them and I didn't look at it um you know I saw on the screen it was muted and I did not muted\nOr because the reality is is that for people said it didn't happen and there was a four people alleged to be witnesses and by the way by the way it's like it's like Kavanaugh lived his life and such a sterling character I'm a bad that it doesn't fit a pattern either\nAnd and the Denver trying to come up with things that would suggest there is an average of wrongdoing but frankly not when Michael ... is your is your spokes person you know you got you you know you got and grew to go after somebody\nYou have the code of the day it was muted and I didn't earn muted ... once you get another lesson in life from Senator Bill Cassidy so you have a Breitbart piece is pretty interesting and and it seems to be that if if we got FBI probes on our mind and things we want the FBI look at it everybody wants to investigate everything\nYou have an idea or two about something that might be investigated and that might be collusion that actually exists among Democrats to smear judge Kevin I'm\nTotally so Democrats are trying to make out like this is some sort of organic uprising of people coming out the say the judge Kavanaugh was not\nNot not credible even though the for people that they said were there set it didn't happen but this clearly is a tactic a strategy with tactics or would you smear him you create doubt you create doubt and therefore you know way they want to take back the Senate they being a Democrat\nAt which point they would block a future Trump appointee by the way there's already a website for the woman Coney Barrett that was nominated it's stop\nI'm I'm\nA considered I'm Sorry I considered it stop Kony ... dot com and it says what if I coming soon so if Trump\nComes up with another appointee in capping off whatever we can get appointed\nThey already are preparing now this is ... this is a strategy and its pulling them and if they're trying to fool the American people that just have the FBI going after people wait a second ... this part of a strategy did you seek out from one to ... to testify against\nJudge having all that you deliberately not release a letter until after you knew you sacrifice doctor for its confidentiality that you do it as part of a tactic is part of a strategy to smear\nJudge Kavanaugh in public as opposed to having dealt with ... let's find out mark you know what I mean here of the American people or they're trying to see the American people that should be turned up that should be you know if you will like cast appointed\nIndie by all means if if we got questions everybody wants to be asking all these questions we got a couple of questions we liked to have asked ourselves hey I've got a couple of remaining couple of minutes let me get greedy when he was unreal Cassidy is also on the Finance Committee big day of the White House I don't know about you as a conservative DNA and me means that terrorists are not usually my favorite thing\nBut do got advantages and this may be on the list of stuff that Trump's made me a believer I mean here's candidate here's Mexico saying okay we're ready to play nice now how did they strike you\nKnow I think the president said he ran said he wanted to redo nap can be read it NAFTA just want more promises he made that he has stopped going to be kept I think that has worked well for American workers in my state we have a positive balance of trade with Mexico and with Canada\nUm ah you told me from taxes you go on the border with Mexico there's so much prosperity where they want was not\nIt's created a lot of jobs for a lot of folks in my state and across the country but it did need to be done and the president has already done it and he's going to take care of the American worker\nAs well as have a trade with Mexico and Canada I think it's a good thing\nHow's your what your I'm crystal ball in the midterms\n[noise] you know if the if the people are focusing upon the economy and a part of the fact that President the president made promises kept promises that I think Republicans will do okay\nWe're focused on things that are peripheral a which of course Democrats are trying to keep a focus on things that are not in a pocket book not in the kitchen table then they were advertising time\nShow I'm hoping the American people are focusing oh my gosh my life a lot better now than it was three years ago when I go with the team that brought me the the better life\nAnd finally back into the halls of the U.S Senate I don't know if you have a chance to run into a Joe Manchin Joe Donnelly Heidi Heitkamp believe strike you as the kinds of people they voted for Gorsuch all three of them who might ultimately they're looking for a reason to get some cover to vote for Kavanaugh so that they don't get killed in their own home states\nI think you just I think if you're just being fair if you're just being fair you're going to say everybody Dr Ford says should be a witness that either don't remember or that it didn't happen\nI think the FBI will find the same thing so I'm hoping Donnelly hike camp others will say they're going to vote on the behalf of fairness shouldn't be about electoral politics it should be about what is fair to a fellow American\nAnd this will be fair to a fellow American um after both Ford and Kevin ... so unfairly by Senate Democrats so I'm hoping they vote for fairness\nSenator and Dr Bill Cassidy of Louisiana thank you sir appreciate you being on the program out much appreciate your time I have a wonderful day\nMark you met\nSenator do dastardly a robot senior a senator from a kind of funny in Louisiana some real turn over the last few years 'cause he's been around since I think the twenty fourteen elections and John Kennedy was on the Judiciary Committee just been around since the last election speaking of Senate news due to the polling news polling news\nIf we were talking about these these states Trump won big and and where you might have some folks you might really want to go ahead and vote for cabinet and we mentioned mentioned in West Virginia and I live in North Dakota\nDoubling Indiana going through the head of Claire McCaskill right now in Missouri is in a

Michael's stick around much more to go\nOkay what do you hear a president that they're wrong God Forbid that said that\nYou gave them maybe it's a bad cell or something but not not at all I've I've I I support President Trump's nominees because I Want justices that will interpret the constitution as written I have a feeling that if you oppose President Trump's nominees that's what's behind this whole thing you just don't want him on the\nRoad and it's not what he did or that I'm Sorry\nNot ... I wouldn't mind you know they're not according to the condition and I am now I don't\nKnow K wait ... wherever you want while so he was\nOkay so so the ... so the the couple of moments where he got a little too snarky look those outweigh\nProper indignation that he should 'cause I think a couple of moments ago you said you understood how somebody might react pretty emotionally if they're being falsely accused on me you seem to have some empathy for that's\nThere's no evidence to support Dr Ford story none so what I'm getting from you as you don't want to get the judge have it on the court because of like thirty seconds of of conversation with two senators is out there\nNot I don't really know if you've got a three alone is you carry it is\nWell known by by figures were I think his record is fantastic on racial issues in women's issues because people of every race in both sexes deserve a constitution that's respected and ultimately I think we really just kind of disagree politically on the court I think that's what's driving everything but I notice now me you're awesome I'm Glad you're on the show God Bless you and I'm Glad you're here today\nOn the Michael ...
