[noise] I Know somebody is is it okay if I say who it is Greg did you uh\nWho has suggested a that any any time the police spot a van or a car or any kind of ethical with more than six bumper stickers they ought to investigate it immediately\nIn any event this uh this is a sort of a tip off it's where he was coming from but this is the way Jeff Sessions sounded this morning and and by the way I

I've referred a couple of times on this show to um [noise] things that President Trump has tweeted that I think are not constructive uh this is a tweet from a couple of days ago before they saw this a crime\nThe series of crimes actually President Trump tweeted a very big part of the anger anger capitalized we see today in our society is caused by the purposely falls and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news\nIt has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description um then he says mainstream media must clean up its act fast and fashionable capitalized with an exclamation point\n[noise] um [noise]\nWhat's my big problem there just one word which is purposeful purposely false\nAnd an accurate reporting in other words this is not to say that there isn't an accurate reporting there is not say there is a biased reporting there is but the idea that it's purposely\nFalls that as part of a conspiracy that\nI honestly journalists don't go into the

or the proof is accumulating\nAnd the prospect as he will be going away for some forty eight years but meanwhile the president of the United states charged\nUs earlier today and I think in an

and hostility and viciousness and meanness and craziness that has afflicted American politics\nIs to affirm freedom of speech and freedom of conscience freedom of faith and that's exactly what the alliance defending freedom as about we agree with that proposition ...\nThe the historical American position has been I may disagree with everything you say but on the right to say it\nAnd we're losing left in particular [noise] although there are some in the right [laughter] but at the left delivers\nOur like in the jak Philips case where they tried to shut down it crushes Baker who didn't

... message [noise] people aren't willing to let people have their own opinions and say them freely\nAt you know can we go to the California case for a moment cause I follow that very closely and it was extraordinary an extraordinary victory seems to me for the alliance defending freedom\nI thought this was I I've spoken several times for fundraising banquets for um for crisis pregnancy centers and what crisis pregnancy centers try to do is to give people an alternative in a crisis pregnancy is where a very often people are unmarried and they have no funds\nThat rather than terminate the pregnancy getting an abortion or that the centers will help you ... the bear the child raising the child and and deal with all the challenges involved\nAnd they were being forced by legislation in California to put up signs that said if you want abortion services [laughter] go go to this address go here go there um and that's about right isn't it\n[laughter] yes I'm I argued the case and the Supreme Court myself and you got it exactly right California's real they either papers passing a law that this is a part of their progressive vision to ensure that the correct pro abortion message was given everywhere I'm\nIncluding these charitable private crisis pregnancy centers that were set up by donations from people who are pro life\nYeah exactly and so the they were not willing to let people have a different opinion on\nAbortion if if if you are on our side of the issue of the other side of course I wasn't required the Planned Parenthood is not affected by this law it was only they claim that they only wanted\nAll women to have all the news well that didn't work that way\nRight now and then comes just to get this so people see it so clearly in other words you would have been fine with is is that a Planned Parenthood day and said well if you want an alternative to abortion and then go to a crisis pregnancy center\nIn equal actually I Would have ... I Would take the position that Planned Parenthood shouldn't be forced to give our message and we shouldn't be forced to give the pro abortion message but the lack of a quality shows what the real problem here is is that people want to silence\nViewpoint that they don't agree with and I think that that's that's where the lack of civility is really coming in and it's we're saying that the other people don't even have a valid point of view I mean we can there's a difference between saying\nI'm you know you're you're entitled to express your view\nAnd saying I agree with your view and you know it's it's okay to disagree in this country but to some people are not allowed to disagree anymore and they will silence you if you disagree with the progressive viewpoint\nWhat uh what is the story going on right now with Blaine Adams and who is a proven does promotional T shirts a case\nCases pending in Kentucky Supreme Court [noise] um the local officials there went after him because he wouldn't T shirts with gay pride team to them\nAnd he will print teachers for any person but he will deliver messages there's other messages these turned down over the years\nHe found them another T shirt shop to deliver the exact same shirt and the exact same price but that wasn't good enough it wasn't that these people want it to be entitled to have their shirts which they clearly God\nThey wanted to have a pound of flesh to go with it and so they're trying to punish planets and hopefully we won that case in the Kentucky court of appeals\nUm hopefully that'll be affirmed in the Kentucky Supreme Court if if not we'll be taking that case the Supreme Court yeah\nI I just saw an unbelievable number um how how many uh different attorneys do you put out in the field to defend these cases with with the ATF the alliance defending freedom\nWhat we have a sixty attorneys on staff and three thousand allied attorneys that um the volunteer their time sometimes at reduced rate sometimes absolutely free but we have a big team that are willing to come in and help Christians and other people all over the country\nWho have real religious freedom and freedom of speech problems\nWell that's a that's a very a very significant um army if you have three thousand volunteer attorneys\nAnd by the way where we're talking to you because right now today it's friday we are going into the

and he's the president of a pro life group on campus that she sought I'm pro life speaker of the student body has a rule process where they found all\nOrganizations all all groups supposedly on equal basis but as it turns out normally equals not equal the pro life group was denied any funding for speaker but the gay lesbian groups who received over ... about a quarter of a million dollars in round numbers\nWay about quarter of a million dollars for eight years and\nAll the other groups combined received around thirty thousand dollars and so the groups that are pushing the progressive message to really two groups who received\nThe lion's share of the night and this is my ticket from every student in student fees is like a tax on public school ... college campuses\nSo so what what are you suing for what's the relief you're seeking for Nathan up a duck\nOr seeking equality really thorough clinical and these kinds of cases is to end the practice of collective student fees for for these kind of purposes that they just need to stop that they're being administered such uneven fashion\nThat they become nothing more than a propaganda tool for the last ... students of all stripes that are

they're all kinds of private charities that could take it among themselves to greed these people on the Mexican side of the border before they get into the United states and say hey\nWe're going to
