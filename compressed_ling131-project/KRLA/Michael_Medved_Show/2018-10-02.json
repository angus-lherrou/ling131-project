nationwide something that is striking my Texas audience because I don't know if it's geographic out of its ideological I don't know if it's objective I don't know if it's wishful thinking [noise]\nUm because it is also fresh so new and so ever changing hour by hour usually I've got a pretty good um you know radar on on what is inside my bottle\nAnd and looking outside my bubble to make sure that my wishful thinking or my politics don't in views of things that I Would say that that I consider to be objectively true so here's what I'm Talking about\nThis attack vis smear campaign against Kavanaugh\nIs back firing big time uh around the country fair minded people not all of them conservatives some of them don't you want cabin on the court but they have the basic human decency to realize a a a disgusting eggs are crumble smear when they see one\nI absolutely believe that feel free to corroborate it or deny adds a one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six you know the numbers or follow me on Twitter at Mark Davis M. A. R. K. Davis always go to the Michael ... joined Twitter at ... show and Michael ... dot com even when the filling guys are here\nSo I I I've just I've talked to so many people and I've read so many things that I've talked to other people who do this for a living and they're telling me the same thing that that people are sick of this that it it has become\n... and ... it has become ludicrous we've gone from a a an\nAllegation of sexual assault that was worthy enough to bring a woman in an effort to sit down and share her testimony which she did a that story is falling apart there is no corroboration of it and the subsequent stories and New Yorker and among the arm of ah of\nAttorney Michael ... those those ... those are less credible than Dr Ford and that's saying something\nAnd and now we're getting into ice wars and uh and and then it ... sweating and who doesn't remember whether that was Brett or not at or near a punch bowl but he had some red solo cups and I wasn't going to take a red solo cup from Brett Kavanaugh\nIt it's it it it's theater of the absurd it has gone from political theater to the editor of the absurd I wrote a town hall dot com column this morning posted it\nDon my time so it's been up there for a few hours out to share a couple of thoughts from it and um and then get some thoughts from you we got some audio Richard Blumenthal [laughter] which is always enjoyable there's just something\nDelicious Lee twisted about Richard Blumenthal democratic Connecticut lecturing anyone about truth telling Mr stolen valor they had these folks they they are that bad no shame they just have no shame will also try again to diagram sentences for Mazie Hirono is just just always an adventure\nUh and and one mobile attract the moving the goalposts\nAnd just sort of see where it's all going so my question for you I vote overall broad question for you\nA ... and that is is is what's happening before our eyes\nWhat is happening before our eyes I strongly feel\nThat the nation is on to this campaign I don't I mean you that I'm actually there are plenty of liberals plenty of Democrats and many of you listening and I'd love to hear from you as well 'cause we take all comers on that Michael Medvedev show as you know Michael does that when he's here and I do it every show I'm hosting Meyer somebody else's I absolutely welcome opposing views\nBut I Will tell you something and and we had a little bit of experimentation with this yesterday\nHere's my belief show me a twenty people\nWho want to obsess about Brett Kavanaugh's calendar\nAnd who are just so convinced that his testimony just doesn't jibe with what the realities of early eighties party life we're\nFinding a mate among those twenty people are some folks who are really concerned about judge Kavanaugh's temperament I I mean oh my gosh she she really blue is cool and in some questioning what they call the charge Sheldon Whitehouse and I don't know if we can have temperament like that\nOn the court and blah blah blah blah blah it's find me twenty people who are all twisted off about the side shows ... irrelevance sees the ridiculous mess\nAnd the you know what's driving every single one of them\nThey don't want him on the court because he's a constitutional list [noise] they don't they don't\nCare about how he might have treated women when they were Seventeen years old because the people who are telling you that thing about probably had no problem with Bill Clinton probably have no problem with that candidate\nBill Clinton signed oh problems that get any five no problem but Brett Kavanaugh ooh those jury can't go there that that's when you know that something else is driving the train and what's driving the train here in in this really is so simple\nAnd once you understand it becomes easier to grass and you know what's going on here\nThis entire episode has nothing to do with women are concerned about who did or did not treat our midst treat women properly and the eighties or any other time every single bit of this\nIs smoke is smoke and what's behind the smoke\nIs the true motivation\nAnd that is that the campaign against Brett Kavanaugh\nIs being launched by and embraced by people who do not want a constitutional list on the Supreme Court\nThat's because constitutional lists do make stuff up in their rulings said don't makeup rights that don't exist like no right to terminate a pregnancy\nWhich was absolutely fabricated from whole cloth and roe v Wade in Nineteen Seventy three and this is extremely important\nI don't want roe versus Wade overturned because I'm pro life\nBrett Kavanaugh will not vote to overturn roe v Wade because he is a conservative or a pro lifer and by the way I've no idea what he'll do but if he's a genuine constitutional as the will absolutely vote to overturn it not to forward his political views or his political agenda\nBecause judges should keep justices especially should keep all those things out of there ... all that matters is is there a right to abortion and the constitution of course there's not\nLet's talk about the over ... versus a Hodges the twenty Fifteen gay marriage ruling thanks Anthony Kennedy for that\nThat this was a completely unconstitutional ruling that said the state not only the state could offer gay marriage equality because of course they can states can do whatever they want in terms of the definition of marriage but over the over ... Hodges said they had to\nThey had to\nDo you've got to to make sure that women can abort their babies I Know you've got to make sure that states a rule that a a marriage of two guys is the same as my marriage to my wife\nNo they don't if a state wants to end by the way that that conversely applies to abortion is what little constitutions one on one if you need at the moment roe v Wade is overturned in that they cannot come fast enough\nThe moment roe v Wade is overturn what happens what happens\nFirst answer as close to nothing immediately the answer is nothing but the landscape that that left is every state can have whatever abortion laws they wish for over ... versus Hodges overturned every state can recognize the marriages that they wish\nIf state number one wants to have full marriage equality to do two ladies ... whatever you want to do it's all marriage to us that's great but it's a state next door says not so much one man one woman that that they get to do that\nIf state hey wants to have a ghoulish ally permissive abortion laws I Will lamented if I Lived in that state I'd fight doggedly against it but they can do\nAnd it's a state next door says new we're going to be very restrictive we're going to absolutely protect the unborn in many many ways that we haven't even been able to do before\nThat state gets to do that all of that that I'm just described hoping to make your wrecked a car or anything that's Cohn respecting the Constitution's this is the kind of America that Brett Kavanaugh will help bring about\nIn other words if you ... the left\nAnd removing their ability to legislate through court rulings to get from the judiciary that which they cannot get from legislatures this has been an ongoing game of the left for decades and it is over when constitutional is reached the high court\nBrett Kavanaugh is just such a person God Bless him [noise]\nAnd um that's that's what it's all about because that that is the garlic too of empire that that is is kryptonite\nTo the left\nSo that's what it's all about and get another new they're concerned about Dr Ford listen we're all concerned about that for some mapping are one that Brett Kavanaugh's hands that I Wish her well I have no ill will toward her whatsoever or go lead a good happy and prosperous life oh I bet it'll be prosperous her calendar will soon fill\nWith a with a book deals and I'm\nSpeaking engagements plenty I'm sure that I Wish you well I don't begrudge or any of that [noise] so let's get Kevin on the court are we going to do that is that going to happen to you feel like we're closer today than we were yesterday or could it all just go sideways answer is yes it could and I'll tell you why next Mark Davis in for Michael methods stick around\nSaid very scary time for young men in America when you can be a healthy of something that you may not be guilty or you could be somebody that was perfect your ...\nSomebody said here's you up stuff that doesn't necessarily have to pay a woman as everybody say what somebody could accuse us up thank God you're\nAutomatically guilty of this brown you are generally guilty until proven innocent that one of the very very bad things that that gave rise right\nThat's the president and and it is just so how 'bout concern for everybody that women stepping forward to the accusations of should be evaluated fairly it openly\nAnd and guys being falsely are baseless Lee accused of it can we harbor some some empathy for them as well\nWe're in Tacoma, Washington let's get some phone action Elaine hey Mark Davis in from Michael how are you\nThinking ahead question in my mind I had started shovels she [laughter] she couldn't hold a car with that kind of voice and then she\nHad many many instructors which\nI then

did did she have anything on the way to the house I mean she had one beer there you have anything on the way to the house because my wife\nAnd I doubt chicken I Know it I don't\nKnow and this is what was great about Rachel ... report is that she very skillfully in professionally poked a lot of holes in Dr Ford's believability on exactly the kind of things you're talking about no memory of how she got there no memory the address no memory of getting on buddy crystal clear one thousand percent certainty that it was Brett Kavanaugh it just doesn't wash\nHow are you going to approve it was when she you know I'm like\nOh well that was how you view was\nThat they can prove a negative they can't possible situation and then she ... him [noise]\nI guess that would be the alibi a bit but that's

entire\nYou know crazy mess with a a judge Kavanaugh's because the left fears of ... with a with every fiber of it's being a constitution list on the Supreme Court and so what was that look like what kind of ruins would you have\nIn many many things like roe v Wade which established they phony abortion rights a overkill versus Hodges would just average they phony obligation for all states to have a gay marriage equality\nThat would be a state by state patchwork vats what honoring the constitution looks like a with a question that we had Judy out of the city or in San Antonio Ron Hi Mark Davis in from Michael how are you\nOh great great I I guess I Need a little better for the patient on the state's good starting my state by state basis\nHow does that work because I started back in or when you had an arranged marriages were to be illegal in Texas but illegal in Oklahoma or legal or in Arkansas but all illegal in Alabama or on the same here I\nWrite here's here's here's here's here's exactly here's exactly how it would work\nMarriage one oh one if two people get married if there are three levels of of of marriage marriages religious which means something as up above promised they make before God but the couple does before God second it is social\nUh meaning does your ear people around you your family your friends consider you to be married to him in there so that certainly has the vibe of being married and the third is government recognition of yet that's the only one that's everybody's business the other to the social the religious or none of anybody's business a gay couple can get married today\nAnywhere they wish anytime the only question is will the state recognized\nThat marriage there's no such thing as a marriage ban nobody will ever bang on the church you all can you do you guys getting married in America they they absolutely can get married the only question is will the state recognize\nAn institution in our Web ads are almost out almost out almost on almost done when the constitution is offered some states will recognize those gay marriages and some will not\nGo ahead okay uh so I went in traveling across the country and they're in a state that ... an hour and then they got ... and I I don't know what kind of regular even that you're going to Washington from state to state or no\nNo no well what well back out and I came back up to marriage back back up to marriage but let's say a couple is married in\nConnecticut or to do to marry in Connecticut and their marriages recognized\nBy just talking about there vacationing there driving across country or they suddenly not married as they pass through Kansas no of course they are but the state of Kansas doesn't recognize it but it doesn't matter because they don't live there are the only thing that marriage the government recognition of marriage only extend that\nTax benefits in certain laws in certain ... certain mad\n... they're still married in the most important ways religiously and socially snuff they move to Kansas well that's another kettle of fish 'cause they're still married absolutely but it's not a marriage that the state recognizes\nWith certain perks that come with marriage recognition so it's not really that big a deal about what was ... you want to go ahead\nOr let's say a young lady than a state where ... is legal and she gets her you know right either done legally another young lady that they were illegal but she get that done illegally chicken be tried for murder for the maximum I did in another state\nThat it happened to be legal Iran yeah green Iraq I I I liked states right now to be more\nThan ... that that's what it looks like\nThat that's exactly what it looks like if if a state has has ghoulish permissive abortion laws well there you are if another state protect unborn and the young lady violates that violates that law and the doctor violates that laws in whatever is on the books for violating that law would happen\nThat that's this is what the founding fathers thoroughly intended is and that's why we're not a\nOf a homogenous just America where the United states of America we're living in Florida supposed to be different than living in\nIn Oregon living in Texas supposed to be different than living in Wisconsin with some unless it's something we share completely constitutional basic rights various properly written federal laws but a whole lot of other things that I have to do with the various angles and ins and outs of life\nAre left to the states to govern according to what the wishes are the people who live in those

bladder and about on my own time here in the morning show that I Do\nAnd if it occurs to you have a has this guy written a book holy cow yes I have\nA couple of them in fact there was another technique me about it now [noise] ah there was one in twenty fourteen the good people that read ignoring a which we now own which is funny I I I wrote a book for regular human Salem Media group ... so that's a good book be able to have\nA little single Lone Star America how Texas can save our country the idea we're all in the uh the purgatory it'd be Obama years\nAnd the ... and my thought was hey if if the entire country was run more like Texas we'd be a lot better off and you know what lately looks like we're kind of doing that so that proved no one said prophetic could as hopefully with sensible that's Lone Star America from twenty fourteenth then in twenty sixteen and the election year\nIt occurred to me to do about a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty some talk show topics of of subjects that the left has been getting away with like guns are bad\nHuman productivity is definitely warming the planet the constitution as a shape bubble malleable living room and arguments and other nonsense and and just a way chapter by chapter to gently McCain maybe not so gently but at least civil Lee and constructively push back against that\nAnd I put it together in a little thing called upside down and how the left turn right into wrong truth and allies in good into bad\nThat's a lot of subtitle justice Mark Davis upside down on Google or Amazon or Barnes and noble or whatever and there's the book and the hope you enjoy it\nAll right so the last gentleman\nWho took a little while to get there was talking about how about about Supreme Court justices and boy you could say we've been talking about Supreme Court justice is a lot lately [noise]\nUm ... and how it's so important and powerful because it's a lifetime appointment and the gentleman said it's not a lifetime appointment as a yes\nIt is but I I kinda got his point article ... section one judicial branch beautiful pop judicial hours it's easy for you to say\nI'm the judges of the Supreme and inferior records show hold their offices during good behavior\n[noise] so I don't really know what he was getting at is if it seems like there were things that there were offenses that a lot like maybe it'd be deciding wrongly in roe v Wade should have gotten a few justice is just tossed out onto the curb\nSome gay um it's a lifetime appointment a ... barring impeachment and and that gets ... eat so uh but ... what led to do here is ... there there are two things that people have talked about term limits and age limits [noise]\nSo I get\nThe more unfair age when it's seen as I'm sixty ... like to think I'll be around for a couple of do three more decades and uh and I I Know a ton of people who are sharpest attack\nSmart as a whip strong as it lacks they're eighty five pounds so some people who are forty ... total idiots so um [noise] it just seems wildly arbitrary no term limits\nTerm limits boil down to one thing turn over for the sake of turnover [noise] I think the founding fathers envisioned a I'm a citizen legislature\nBut you know uh they didn't put term limits in there I guess they left that up to us well we finally did it uh for the presidency after FDR was president for thirty seven years or [laughter] I Do I Do uh\nIn in vitro for Thirteen but we didn't we did that and I guess\nI did that [laughter] but I think we're probably all on board for presidential term limits turned over for the sake of turnover especially these days seems like a good idea\nI everybody talks about term limits in Congress oh we we well I can fill up the lines right now everybody just banging on the table for term limits here's the dirty little secret you're already\nNot enough people want him oh you do I do\nFriends do the people you hang out with do I can fill you know forty seven hours of talk shows that people who do\nYou know what if everybody was so deep data about term limits we'd had him a long time ago so here ultimately has the bottom line of the the dirty little secret we like the I\nYeah of term limits it sounds great\nBut then when you realize that that means you got to get rid of your congressman just to be under twelve years and it's usually the deal is six terms in the house two terms in the Senate both equally twelve years but that means you you know what that means I mean I got to get rid of Ted Cruz after one more term I Want to get rid of China grows ever more and more term\nOh I Want to I Want I Want to prove to be a Senator George Ninety three\nSo that's why I term limits never goes anywhere is a big ... and it shows in the bowling\nApproval ratings of Congress are terrible for approval ratings of people talking about their congressman tend to be pretty good\nSo everybody else should have to get rid of their congressman you don't want to get rid of your bears so there's the whole cut on room of term limits so at at the judiciary level I mean what are we going to I'm a ... Thirty years Twenty years I don't know\nI don't know um [noise] I guess I really thought about it that much turnover for the sake of ... I tell you what that would sure make 'em as if this is even possible that would make elections more interesting wouldn't it can you measure the election coming up on a lecture in a given year [noise]\nAnd they're like three justices about to get term limited out for the very next president oh my heavens\nThat is that his gut wrenching tension\nThat maybe we've got the best uh maybe you have the best system right now\nAs horribly flawed as it is okay speaking of horribly Florida here some Hillary audio um oh bless her heart she's uh I'm In the process of forgetting Hillary was ever born she's never going to be president I'm just over its you know they did ... lock her up prosecuting your grade if somebody wants to do that\nLord knows it seems appropriate and view them to be obvious which in handling of\nNational security materials but even even as I put those sentences together my brain starts to leak outta my ears and I think about both Clintons about the same way\nJust go away just be a private life kind of like the Obamas are just just do be in private life and be happy and prosperous I don't care you can't screw up life anymore and I'm I'm moving on from you [laughter]\nBut here [laughter] I'll never get that out of my head I scrub my brain of that\nBut ah but here's here's a little more Hillary audio because they asked her oh and here's the real suspenseful question hey what did you think of that Dr Ford testimony in her reply was\nThis you feel a hundred percent certain that the events that she described um\nAre true and are therefore disqualify [noise] but\nI I watch as much of our tax money as I could I found her very credible\nYou have to ask yourself why would anybody put themselves through this if they did not believe that they had important information ought to convey to the Senate\nShe basically said that she thought it was her civic duty ah so I found I found her presentation I found her a\nWillingness to say I don't remember that but I remember this\nOught to be a very convincing and\nI I I felt a great well um [noise]\nYou know pride that she would be willing to put herself out their\nPride let's spend a moment on pride and the the\nOnly reason to be proud of Dr Ford is too because you one thousand percent believe her by the way I'm not suggesting anybody should be ragged on Dr forward but it when people talked about her courage her bravery and I I mean I think most fair minded a coherent human beings\nSink something happened to her but they just don't think it was right candidate on the debt and and so\nDo you lose courage points if you screwed up the identity of the suspect I don't know I Wish her well I Wish Dr Ford well I've got nothing\nNothing nothing against her [noise] um but boy just there's a weird question in there from Hillary why would anybody do this if they didn't believe in it or not like there's nobody you know held on personal destruction anymore but ultimately I I Do think the doctor for believed this half\nOf I think she's I think she sincerely she sincerely believed that Brett Kavanaugh was her attacker\nCan I Believe she is sincerely [noise]\nMistake [noise] Bernie I'm never mistaken about this the phone numbers one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six wanting to have written on five five Seventeen Seventy six followed me on Twitter at\nMark Davis barricade Amos in for Michael they'd been great to be here on a Tuesday more of your calls more audio more exciting stuff that are remaining forty four minutes or so of the ...
