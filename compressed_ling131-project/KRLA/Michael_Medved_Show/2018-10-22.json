answer now you can get a maid Seventy just about anywhere and interact with us today a look at the start on your mobile devices oh I Am a Seventy dive into\nThat am seventies that impacts info\nOn a um eight Seventy the answer [noise]\n\nMrs AM eight seven the answer\nAnd they keep\nSaying\nMy friend's them as Prager here back to David in Mesa, Arizona you feel that the Saudi Arabia's much worse than he ran so\nIn a nutshell 'cause we don't have a lot of time please react to my theory or my belief that Iran is much worse than Saudi Arabia because he ran is a far greater danger to the west\nAnd to Israel and Saudi Arabia is which is a danger more to itself although I fully acknowledged the Saudi contribution to a fundamentalist awful madrassas around the world so on what grounds do you think otherwise\nThe group that nine eleven was from Saudi Arabia the um [noise] the money you know [noise] they want to I Want her to come from Saudi Arabia to\nYeah okay I don't know I don't know what rumors of that would have been Saudi Arabia was not prices\nAre now there were not charges but they weren't going against Iran Syria Syria\nIt turns out that right before this particular election of President Trump's approval rating according to a new Wall Street journal NBC News poll\nAs being heavily covered on CNN and\nEverywhere in mainstream media President Trump's approval rating\nIs the highest it's ever been\nOkay don't get too excited if forty seven percent\nBut forty seven percent to forty nine percent disapproval it means that President Trump has actually closed the gap between disapproval and approval is now basically tied the Americans or even evenly split\nAnd one of the things that I found stunning I Am by the way in the midst of a battleground talkers tour I'm tonight in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [noise]\nUh and uh then on Thursday I'll be home God willing in between and on Thursday I'm going to be in Minneapolis where there are also some very hot congressional races and the governor's race and Senate races\nAnd more [noise] but right now it's all so tight your vote really really matters [noise] one\nOf the things that I've found stunning is that um I was watching CNN in the airport when I had to change planes about six this morning in Washington DC I flew from Seattle, Washington DC and from there to Pittsburgh and I'm\nIn the airport that Tom Perez on who is the Democratic national chair and uh they showed in the new numbers about Trump soaring approval rating\nAnd I asked him why\nHe had no idea he couldn't answer it\nAnd the answer is very obvious is that Americans have gotten used to Trump\nAs a um ten most Americans like the economic situation we're in President Trump gets very very good marks on the economy and for most people are the economy is the most important part of the job\nA meanwhile with an election this close vote fraud is a huge problem we will be talking about that later in the show there's a new book that suggests that it is far more common than people on the left ever wants to lead on and far more threatening and uh [noise]\nThere is also a um an issue lurking in the deep background which is the issue of marijuana we did um [noise] a segment on the show\nA couple of weeks ago about a a a guy who said look I'm just a normal [noise] I'm middle aged a stay at home dad\nGrew almost ruined his life through marijuana addiction\nAnd this individual by the way is for legalize marijuana is going to be joining us on the show to tell his story and to answer your questions at a take your comments that all coming up on the Michael ... a one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nIf you can answer the question that a Tom Perez could not answer why President Trump's approval rating would be going up so dramatically the last couple of weeks [noise]\nHonestly part of it as the Kavanaugh situation part of it is the caravan situation anybody here who thinks that we should simply open the gate\nAnd and lead in all the people from the caravan\n... even those of us who support him immigrants and immigration reform and I support immigrants and I support immigration reform\nThe idea of simply saying that uh you get seven thousand people together and they are marching to the United states and they're all waving Honduran flags will of course you let them in because they're having a tough time in Honduras there are a lot of suffering people right\nBut the notion that that uh that that somehow one of the Democrats said about this what is the right thing to do\nI think the right thing to do is to make it clear that before they walk the other two thousand miles they have left to walk before they get to the United states border they get a very very clear idea that President Trump and most other Americans who actually can think about this with anything like an open mind\nAre going to say no this is not a good idea\nYou don't simply a let people into the United states without authorization without security clearances or then have them flood the system for processing asylum applications one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nMeanwhile somebody who seems to have a position on everything\nBut I don't really think he has a position on the caravan because how could he be is a battle or work\nAnd one of the questions I Would ask here\nIs what is so great about Beto he has he has now inspired people\nThis the Democratic nominee for US Senate against Ted Cruz President Trump is going down to campaign for the guy who once called lie in bed and people say oh to Trump such a hypocrite this happens in politics all the time\nPeople who are opponents who run against each other then come together and work together it happens all the time of Ronald Reagan and George to ... uh age W. Bush George W. Bush running in the primary against Ronald Reagan in Nineteen eighty\nAttacked him pretty partially he said the Reagan was practicing voodoo economics\nAnd then later he embraced Abu to economics a Reagan chosen to be as vice president\nAnd uh they honored and came to like each other or this is\nAll remarkable what is going on that the election is so close but that hasn't stopped people from breaking into song\nOver the great Robert O'Rourke that's his real name known as bait so the Democratic wonder boy of this election cycle who was inspired melodies like this\nUp passing them God\nGuy is totally [noise]\n\nMuslim men\nI may do burn by turning ...\n\nYou know even now and then\n[noise] ...\nMen oh you bet he'll still that little little bit [noise]\nOkay the last time I think that anyone sort of inspired this many songs a in a campaign was President Trump\nYou remember we spent several days playing the various Trump songs I like the one get on the Trump train 'em in any event the ... hour work\nAnd the the ... to see about that token someone explained to me\nWhat it is exactly that is so inspiring to people about Beto O'Rourke\n... what it is that the ... the soul and and makes people so excited that even though he is almost certainly going to lose his challenge to Ted Cruz who's been a decent hardworking senator and\nThere's a conscientious and substantive conservative\nAnd by the weight knows so much more about the issues than ... ... what is it the better our work is going to do for the country that inspires reactions like this and and basically with ABC News telling him he's not just the candidate\nHe's a rock star listen I'm\nObvious strategies that are more than a in a modern can vary show off everywhere overtime for every one you can be without interruption in front of battled back much I Love your thinking well you know [noise]\n[noise] okay um [noise] or they're going to be a lot of disappointed folks in Texas are coming up on election day Fifteen days from now one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number of President Trump\nHas his own response see as a new video out about uh the Democrats offering mom's not jobs or we will get to that and uh we will get to\nWhat the election comes down to there is also a a ... a very alarming piece of the New York times with at least it's meant to be alarming I didn't think it sounded so bad\nIt's by David Leonhardt and is what if the Republicans when everything\nThe New York times even thinking about that\nThat shows you which side has momentum at the moment we will be right back on the Michael ... show with your calls [noise]\nMichael you\nMichael but [noise]\nBut I think it could be very charismatic and it could extend that magic to the country in the early primaries\nOkay there are two reasons I think you might be wrong I I watched a bay toe performing and that is a performance is sort of a performance art as they say when he was doing a town hall in or near El Paso which is where he's from\nAnd give very friendly crowd and very friendly moderator Dana Bash from CNN [noise]\nAnd uh she she fast and very directly about running for president and he said no if he gets elected senator he'll serve all six years of senator now of course he can throw that away but he said it's so definitively\nThat it leads me to believe that\nYou know he he didn't rule out running ever but he I think he rules out\nPretty well running in two thousand and twenty said that if he loses the race he's going to want to spend some more time with his family of course they all say that [noise] um [noise] and some of it might even be true okay the the other reason that I think he wouldn't be so solid for the race was he was pushed and pushed\nPaul and the fact that he has said before the race even began that as a member of the house of representatives he thought there was enough evidence of obstruction of justice inclusion that he could vote to impeach Trump now and he was asked about that as a U.S senator and he didn't back away from it\nHe is for impeachment he he believes even before the mall or investigation is wrapped up even before it's reported anything\nAnd yes they've indicted some people and they've uncovered some stuff and I I I think the Mueller investigation needs to finish and maybe it'll take some time to fish but needs to finish but better or doesn't think so he agrees with a lot of people on the far right the debt for just forget about the investigation let's impeach him anyway\nAnd I don't think that's a popular position and I don't think it sets them up well for a future presidential run or anything of the kinds hey I appreciate your call\nUm I I'm a I Will get back\nTo this and to David Leonhardt piece what if the Republicans when everything will we now know President Trump has made a couple of statements and I think one of them at least to sort of ... some of his age uh there's talk about another tax cut\nThat may be announced before November first that soon and very soon a and he says it's people are going to let us going to be a big middle tax a\nFlat tax cuts middle class tax cuts and a and then there's this whole matter of a transgendered support by government and [noise] is this a political ploy wars in substantive we'll get to that and more with your calls coming up on

but it really ... the beauty of it do\nThat give it to a local or what about the uh the journalist where we are there's more to that and we really it's a it's about our country not our battle anywhere I called to talk about the uh the planned invasion\n\nYou are you calling the caravan of planned invasion\nWorked eight Ito given the fact that we've had so far this year\nI think we've had about twenty times the number of illegal entries into the country this year legal illegal entries are way up because the economy is very hot right now people are getting across\nAnd ah this I'd only constitutes an invasion I think it is a challenge to our whole immigration system is basically an attempt to raise the border and say that um we have to let anyone who wants to come in and most Americans don't believe that\nLaw doesn't say that so [noise] but when you say and and a planned invasion what do you have in mind um\nI think it's just a part of the war the battle between conservatives and left or center trying to take down America and this is the latest strategy\nExcept if you look at those people and I've seen ... and of course they play a lot of very close compassionate a video showing some of these poor people\nWho I think are hungry\nOr scared I'm hopeful ah they\nThey do not appear to be actors\nOr manipulated their just desperate people from\nPlaces in the world that are deeply deeply dysfunctional look I I think that President Trump is doing the right thing to basically make a stand and just say no we simply cannot just open the doors to anyone in this country that is not going to be our immigration policy\nBut I think he makes a very big mistake when he threatened to cut off foreign aid and I'll tell you why the best way to prevent other incidents like this and so this doesn't happen every week or every month\nIs not to cut off foreign aid to Honduras hits to coordinate more foreign aid to Honduras to take these people at least seven thousand people I think that's how many they think there are right now [noise]\nAnd to bring them back home where you can work with them to try to make Honduras a more livable place because that's really going to be the only kind of answer that has a long term impact on let's go to Marco in Los Angeles Marco you're on the ... that show\nI might go a great job either way hey three things I was calling regarding that that the um the reporter that got killed I feel that that really not our crime\nIt lots of guys get killed all over the place we're not we're not up in arms about it for sure it's a bad situation that happened but why are we getting involved country installed\nOn because we are and we are involved with the country I mean the the argument as we uh we have a lot of financial dealings with Saudi Arabia\nNow of Saudi Arabia is not a country we give foreign aid to their one of the richest countries in the world but it's a country that we sell a lot of arms to him as President Trump says we have a pending one hundred ten billion dollar arms deal\nAnd if it doesn't go through with us if we cancel it for some reason they'll turn around and by the arms from\nA China or Russia and like\nWhy does that have to do what does that to do with this guy can kill\nWell ... what's left is trying to do and I think it's despicable frankly is to suggest that somehow uh Mohammed bin Solomon the prince crown prince and Saudi Arabia got the idea that it was okay to kill reporters because President Trump is always so critical of the press\nAnd I think he obviously President Trump is never called on anyone to kill reporters [noise]\nFive and ... do I think it's unfortunate that President Trump made some reference and it was a joking reference to Greg Gianforte and one of the worst moments of his life losing his temper and slam slamming doing and body slam on a reporter\nYeah he shouldn't be making jokes\nAbout that [noise] uh let's uh go to Matt in Seattle

this mass caravan up north was um he called it an invasion I don't think it's an invasion but when you said they look scared\nHungry and cold I was like well I've seen some videos and maybe I'm maybe I'm seeing videos but these people seem coordinated they seem 'em purposeful and they seem they seem somewhat happy and I'm not getting that and\nThe whole theme of his piece was he's a middle aged stay at home dad he's also\nThe greatest living American writer how do I know that because it says a ride on his website and uh he certainly did do a great job writing that particular column a Neal Pollack it's great to meet you over the phone hey Michael how are you\nHey I'm doing well I um [noise] I I I just wanted to ask you a day at the outset eat your piece was actually scary and sad and very honest and how how many years did you feel that you had a problem with marijuana\nMe it's hard to gauge how many years I actually had a problem I I smoked pretty regularly for more than two decades and that was they at least the last Fifteen Years or so I I overdid\nIt so a long time how do you know you over did it for\nWell now that I'm Silber I can look back on some of the money have years when I was high and realize that a\n... ... was causing a lot of my problems you know I was having a public melt down even ... than a getting into fights or I was doing crazy stuff in public that I probably wouldn't have done it\nIt's been sober you know and I also love the sleeping normally I I was I was at ... and in addition to that I spent a lot of my time thinking about marijuana about how to get it about how to consume mad about the consumers with\nAbout trips I could take that would revolve around marijuana and you know it just kind of became the center of my life for very long time\nAnd this was during a period of time when you were making a pretty good career for yourself as a writer you you've been married for a while Ryan\nHad been married for Eighteen years and I have a son and the whole time I was telling you know I was a you know basically like a professional hipster right I've got published a capital of ten bucks I had a couple of a script deals in Hollywood I you know I've written for\nPretty much every English language publication it except for the New Yorker you know it's it's not like I I was I I'm an ambitious donor or a failure but I I sometimes wonder\nHow much more successful I Would have been if I hadn't been soaked in marijuana the whole time and I certainly would have a you know live my life more integrity and and carried out by a my business ferrets were made it more efficiently and I also just would have been able to devote more time to my family [noise]\nHow long how long have you been sober for\nMy one year anniversary is November of level so I'm going to make it I'm pretty sure that uh relapses incoming before then so I'll just say a year\nOkay well good for you congratulations on that\nAnd what advantages do you see now that you're not smoking pot on a regular basis\nYou know it kind of or go to ... because in some ways marijuana was a creative force in my life I Would you know I I wrote almost all my book I all the time and like I Can't although in retrospect there there's a law that there are a lot of scenes in the novels that are about getting hot\nAnd I I think if you were those but you know I it it it helped me come up with certain flights fancy indeed some jokes\nUm and they were the creative stimulant in some ways but uh so I've actually been I Would say like in some ways less creative since I stopped smoking pot but everything else in my life is so much better I mean I'm just I'm more present\nFor my family and my friends um I'm Better organized um I I I Can't I'm making more money but I feel like my life is in order professionally in a way that it wasn't there's not as much chaos and I'm and most importantly I'm not having the emotional highs and lows\nThat it's happening when I was using marijuana you know I'm not I'm not super up all the time and and then when I when I bought 'em out I don't bottom out there's there's no there's no high or low it was like I said so I'm not having the melt down that would characterize sort of my my addiction cycle for\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number ... speaking with\nNeal Pollack who wrote about how marijuana almost\nRuined his life yeah one thing you mentioned you've been married for Eighteen years does your wife ever share a urine says he has them for a lead\nNo and in fact you know she was the opposite does she she has no interest in it at all\nUm and she many many times tried to tell me that I had a problem I Would just you know I Would just shovel or off I you know 'cause the the myth is that marijuana is an addictive in some ways\nIt's considered a health food um and so I just you know even though I had a history of alcoholism and my family\nUm and obviously have the addiction gene I just did it it it didn't register with me um maybe it should have you know they've always ducking behind the dumpster on the weight walking to the gym it's like you know take a hit so it'd be high wall of working out there that's not the sons of someone who is\nNecessarily healthy but uh you know I just\nI ah I didn't see it she did and she she was so grateful when I finally made the decision to quit\nYou know I ... you use the figures in your in your piece in I I I think they're generally accepted figure there from the journal of the American Medical Association and based on studies done in a number of countries they suggest that uh some nine percent of people\nWho ever use marijuana\nEnd up getting addicted\nAnd Seventeen percent of people use marijuana is teenagers did you first use the weight as a teenager\nI smoked once at a party when I was in high school but you know when I was when I was a teenager and this was you know the Nineteen eighties I was I was sort of a a\nGo getter do good or student council type sort of a modeling myself maybe not politically but like at least in terms of my lifestyle on you know Michael J. Fox is character from family ties and that was my model like I Would go right ahead I Would be successful I was going to be a\nGreat American citizens and um and so part didn't really play into it\nUm you know college I kind of um\nI I went a little uh I I I I'm a member of generation X and so I you know I I I became kind of a a grouchy pop culture sitting there but I still wasn't doing a lot of drugs or it wasn't until I was in my twenties that I\nSaid I really started a consuming it\nSo it was an adult onset of addiction\nRight right and I have you ever tried to calculate how much money you invested in and buying we'd over the years about\nOh I mean it was probably a few thousand dollars you know that the thing is and then you know and and this is is it a brag it's the fact you know I there was a time there where I was a ... you know well known writer and people would just give me drugs\nOr ... or smoked me up and I I'm I'm I'm kind of some\nInherently cheap so I Would look for situations where I ... I knew I'd be around people who would at it so I wouldn't have to buy but of course still with them you know I have lived in LA at a medical marijuana card I Would go up to Colorado are weak and it's been a hundred two hundred bucks so it didn't bankrupt me in that sense but\nIt you know still it was still even on the month where it was really good at ... we're still caught me at least fifty dollars not a hundred bucks for that\nNow you you you've written a since you've written a space sentence obviously causing a great stir\nHave you gotten some negative reaction from some of your old friends\nOh no people have been very supportive I got a few people in wonderful yeah\nYeah yeah I mean generally when someone announces that they're an addict the reaction is that like your faking it or [laughter] you know you're ... it's not you know or or you're not an addict I mean if you if you go through what if you go through that twelve step program guided there's no way you can now

I Can't believe that Obama President Obama is saying uh this is the most important election of my lifetime\nAnd again everyone says that about every election and it's almost never true [laughter] really and this is a midterm election and it it will not be a landslide one way or the other\nAnd yes I think it's important and yes I think everybody should definitely vote because this will help to determine the direction for the country for the next two years but then we have another presidential election and I think one of the things that happens is we're all so desperate to get people to turn out\nAnd then went on election happens and there isn't some kind of profound change how people get disillusioned how often can you cry wolf about that stuff\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number a President Obama's successor was also speaking today and he had a a different tone he was speaking outside the White House and here's a President Trump said\n\nWe're putting in a resolution [noise]\nSometime next week a week and a half\nGiving me\nDoing it now for the middle of the fact that we've already [noise]\nOh no no you know what I thought it was a vote after the election\nOkay uh\nI'm not sure this is going to work and what he's talking about is\nI'm trying to do a ten percent middle class income tax cut sounds pretty good\nBut honestly I don't think he will get the support he needs unless a and first of all he's right to say we're we're going to try to do the vote after the election what he's talking about now is a proposal to try to excite the Republican base and of course people should be excited about it you know how much money you spend in taxes\nAnd getting ten percent of that back that's pretty cool that's a nice thing however\nHe can't do it honestly unless he finds some kind of compensating a place for money to come in\nBecause it it simply does not work it does not work that when you cut the tax rate\nThat automatically the revenues go up I mean it's true that the revenues didn't go down from the last tax hike but because we're spending so much more than ... continue to grow up we're already looking at a trillion dollar a year deficit\nAnd I think the president should a work as hard as he can maybe after the election with a Republican House and a Republican Senate to try to yes continue to cut taxes\nBut to do so by cutting spending one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six or in Nevada President Trump spoke on Saturday and he was talking and somewhat similar terms listen\nLook it up again\nHer middle income people [noise]\nAnd we do that over the summer time prior I Would ever had are setting where he really right now around the block a made for middle income people not at all your pay grade he's working on it [noise]\nAll right we're we're all working\nWill say that a major for\nSome time around for maybe a little bit farther\nOkay one of the things that we need to keep in mind is they're already was a tax cuts for middle income people you may not be aware of it but you will when you fill out your tax forms and everything because basically the exemption was doubled\nIn other words part of what we have now is that the standard deduction the standard deduction that people receive\nWas double which means that there's an extra twelve thousand dollars that people who are middle class taxpayers are not paying taxes on\nThat's a good thing and that should save a lot of money all ready for middle income people\nAnd uh I ... I think the timing of this I may be could be a little bit better\nAnd also President Trump did something that provoked a huge Lee negative response on CNN [noise] what's striking about this is not the light it sheds because she has no light at all on President Trump's proposed actions concerning the federal government\nAnd trans gender is um\nWhat's shocking about it is supposed to be in journalism and honestly these reporters on air are sounding completely I I don't ... plea partisan I'm Talking about John Berman\nAnd um [noise] and I'll Alison ... and John Avalon on uh CNN listen to how\nThey react remember it was just over three years ago that same sex marriage became legal in this country\nSo now the wedge issue has moved to France rock concerts I'd love to mock issue about that or a gender identity civilized by Facebook's dozens of gender options\nI'm also liberal abrasive myriad of gender pronouns for many conservatives in some moderate it's a potent example the PC culture the Trump constantly attacks to great effect\nRepublicans water benefit from this backlash and it's an easy talk just look at the numbers transgender folks make up an estimated zero point four percent of American adults or ... million people\nThat do a lot of our fellow citizens but it's many fewer than the millions of gay and lesbian Americans but most people now know was friends family your co workers\nAnd it's just simply picking on minority rights to try to win the popular vote last time I checked self determination was a pretty basic American values\nRooted in freedom and equality what President Trump has also been playing up the care about of asylum seekers from Central America\nPushing it as a threat at rallies in tweets and with plenty of amplification from conservative media this is just more play the bass panic rooted in fear and anger rather than any reality that these asylum seekers are going to rush the board\nOkay let's say they don't rush to the border\nWhat are they coming here to do they're they're coming here in Moscow to get into the United states and what they will do is flood our resources or submit applications for asylum\nAnd basically challenged this notion that the United states as a as a bad basically the core of our sovereignty\nGets to decide who comes into the country and who doesn't\nWe don't get to decide because we're not East Germany who leaves the country and people are free to leave\nBut this is this is bizarre this is um and we have that can we go to this last\nA ... [noise] uh we don't have time okay ah I ah\nI Know we will be speaking about this later frankly what President Trump is doing is not taking away anyone's rights what he's doing is taking away a federal government position I actually believe that the federal government's position on transgender ism\nShould be neutral and in other words don't persecuted people who are transgendered but don't\nFall of a sudden presumptive leave claim that someone is a woman just because he says so or someone is a man just because she says so [noise]\nThat's ridiculous [noise] I'll tell you what's ridiculous the idea of stolen election we will get to that the real threat of voter fraud coming up on the ...

Clinton Cash it's really\nAbove that to change the world and at least change the direction that campaign uh Eric ... before the break we were talking about some of the numbers in your book twenty four million just wrong registrations among people around the country he's\nIncredibly easy to uh to commit voter fraud if people are motivated to do it so what do we do to make our elections more secure\nA great question and it's one that states around the country have grappled with\nAt times so um we saw how close the election with a joystick in Ohio and you mentioned that at the outset that was important to note that Ohio is done I think basically followed a template\nThat other states would be wise to do it they are taking steps to start removing would be illegal voters from their voter rolls and uh they've acquired an ID I also think by the way instructive in this is part of why the subtitle is how the left to steal the next election\nBecause they talk about how George Soros and Tom threads is head of the Democratic party\nEssentially fund efforts to both keep that voter rolls inaccurate and therefore elections insecure and then funnel an infant groups like acorn of the ... and exploit those vulnerability\nBut uh the state of Ohio had to fight source but it effort to do both those things right with the Supreme Court decision was five to four but allow them to continue to make sure that the people on the voter rolls were legal voters and then to be able to implement ID so those are those are two comments and\nThings I think states can do West Virginia's doing that\nAnd Georgia has done that as well so I think that's one thing um and then I think at the other day there needs to be some verification that people that are registering to vote or actually citizens because this is a very big problem and it's a problem by the way I don't think\nNecessarily that comes from a non citizens who just have this overwhelming desire to elect Democrats right not like illegal immigrants that around and they all of a sudden they get tax or they get the bats they go from George Soros and here we go we're going to go elected Democrat they actually become the unwitting
