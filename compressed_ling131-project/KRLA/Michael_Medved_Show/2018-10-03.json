All right what's on your mind go ahead\n[noise] okay well\nWhen I went to school I developed I got pretty well lumps in Nebraska or that then the area\nWill get that resolution God willing before we go into the weekend and there's one thing that\nI Do want to put out there for everybody\nFor everybody if we're going to be talking a little bit about\nThis a new attack on President Trump\nWill get a response on that the new attack which is really an old attack about\nPresident Trump dodging taxes and he isn't really a self made billionaire and there is it feels like about a two thousand page report seems to be very well research in the New York times so what is the relevance of this right now\nIt's obviously an attempt to tilt the election in the direction of Democrats will be speaking with Stephen Moore a advisor to President Trump and the Trump campaign about that and about the progress on trade\nWhere there's been great progress in the markets love it we've had this week the markets have just been on fire sky rocketing\nUm why is that happening we'll talk with us even more about that will also be speaking with Juan Williams on Fox News\nHis new book about President Trump and the black community it's not a positive book toward President Trump\nBut the question for Juan Williams will be what about the evidence and there's lots of it that there is at least in increasing open mindedness to the Republican message from African Americans we will get to that as well on the bed show but first\nI just wanted to give you a little bit of perspective is is people probably recognize I was off for the first two days of this week because the conclusion of our Jewish holiday season and actually\nI Want to thank Mark Davis for again doing such an outstanding job and are helping to carry the ball on this show while we were completing what is a a basically it's almost a month long a one holiday after another and they're all important holidays and they're all meaningful\nThis one was particularly meaningful to me not just because our daughter was here from New York um and and not just because there was a great time to get together with family and and big extended family began in ... but also because on this whole Kavanaugh matter\nI I was able to see a little bit of perspective let me just tell you something that happened which I don't think I Will ever forget I mean normally I go to services I go to synagogue\nAnd a a an normally I've talked to my friends I I was approached by a little kid and when I say a little kid and ten eleven years old\nAnd um [noise] it ... ... he asked that I'm not even sure we watch it you know as with the car is a hundred people there and anyway so the kid comes up to me\nAnd he says I I heard somebody say here that that Brett Kavanaugh through ice and somebody a Thirty Years' ago\nWhite minds that a big deal and I had not\nYet seen the story about the alleged a bar fight at one thirty in the morning when Brett Kavanaugh was a sophomore I Believe at Yale and then I later in the horrors of ice throwing\nAnd somehow it this is now reaching ... kids in America I mean under age kids this is where our politics is\nA is that just think about think about it think about it I mean not that it's okay to throw wise or not\nThat it's okay to be under age in a bar find them cetera et cetera no one was damaged or charged or arrested in this a bar or they were arrested they weren't charge\n'em okay\nThis whole idea where our politics is right now I really do believe those political consultants and ... and campaign people who are saying that right now the Kavanaugh thing as powerfully helping Republicans\nAnd I believe for one very simple reason if you like everything we've gone through with Kevin on four\nIn the back in the forest and the punching and the pushing the nastiness\nAnd then you're going to vote for Democrats because I'm a Kavanaugh was not arrested okay let let me make that clear there was a police report about breaking up a bar fight and there was an allegation that he threw whites\nAnd a ... again I think it's more relevant to the Democrats want to throw ice out they want to throw out ice they want to get rid of the immigration and Customs Enforcement I mean it was anything is more relevant\nThan the idea that Brett Kavanaugh when he was at Yale I'm I\nWas a member of a hard drinking fraternity ... the whole idea that this is significant and that is worthy of our attention this is where our politics is right now if you want more of the politics of personal destruction if you want more\nOf let's go over every single detail of people's pass to try to smear them and destroy them if you want more of this feeling of constant combat then sure you want the Democrats to take over the house because that's what you'll get you'll get impeachment you'll get in fact a Gerald nab blur\nThe radical from Manhattan and he is he's one of the most left wing members of Congress\nWould become the new chairman of the house Judiciary Committee and he's already talked about impeaching justice Kavanaugh after he is confirmed\nIf you think that's where politics should go then first of all tell me why secondly if you are a little sure to vote Democrat anyway if you do want to change your view on politics\nThat is a little bit more civil a little bit more respectful a little bit more about results rather than just\nDestroying the enemy and results for the American people more days where the stock market is there's a more days where people are working where people get raises\nI mean across the board it's happening now and ah and meanwhile\nWhat what's the focus the focus is on on President Trump not mocking\nBut daring to question up Christine Blasey Ford\nAnd he did it at a rally last night and President Trump is on button and rallies and know this wasn't a speech but first of all people say well he ... he didn't imitate her he referred accurately to some of her testimony here was the president of the United states and what he had to say\nI Want to write I Wonder\nDo you think it was always wonder how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many I don't want I don't know\n[noise] what\nWas it and I don't know\nWhere was I don't know what I Want [noise]\n\nAnd I'm at a map flies is shattered\n[noise] okay um [noise] look at ... is it somehow out of bounds probably it would be better if the president do it didn't do it but is it appropriate to question her testimony or you can only question judge Kavanaugh one eight hundred\nNine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number the um share Sanders was asked about that today by John Roberts on Fox this is the White House press briefing about President Trump's comments about Christine Blasey Ford and here is the presidential press secretary Sarah Sanders why did the\nPresident said what do we does he says the\nPresident was stating the facts I frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was stating facts that were given during Dr forts testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold a position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been\nPicked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits an outrageous this entire process has been a disgrace and the only reason that it's been that way is because Senate Democrats\nDidn't do this the way that it should have been done and they circumvented the entire system and frankly they undermine in our entire judicial branch by the way that they've acted in inappropriate which they've conducted themselves was\nOkay I I Believe it is with that in mind that\nThere's certainly the Republican base people who voted and put President Trump in the White House [noise]\nNet basis getting engaged and that's a good thing there's other reasons for having to do with the economy will speak with us Stephen Moore a coming up about the future of the economy and its political impact\n'cause usually aren't times that's the our team thousand words I mean it's a lot of war is basically the theme is President Trump didn't make the money on his own he got all the money from daddy and secondly I'm both Trump's both father and son cheated on their taxes why first of all why do you think they decided to spring this right now\nI don't know why they did it right now I was on CNN last night commenting on the show I I didn't I didn't make it through the ... ... how many more was Thirteen thousand yeah it was it ... I read a lot of it I didn't make it through the whole thing\nI had a couple impressions that made this point on CNN last night and I'm ... and by the way they really beat me up on it the first point I made was wait a minute this was like you know turning on the TV and saying you know with a hundred times you know friends episode reroute and you know that you've already seen twenty times\nHow many times or the New York times won the story I I ... I worked on the campaign they must won three or four stories about Trump cheating on his taxes\nAnd you know then they win one last year and now the running this one and there's not much different in this story than the one that won multiple times so it's just like you know just by an old copy the newspaper because at the end of this movie before the second point I made us look they're alleging tax fraud tax there is a difference a\nMichael between tax avoidance which which any good businessman them any good you know head of household will do you want to minimize the taxes you pay right I mean I don't know about you Michael I tried to pay the least amount of actually after you got the most I'm Out there was a shocking tax\nAvoidance and tax evasion and they are they are accusing Trump of tax fraud went a lot of these like I'm not an expert on tax policy but it looks like a lot of these things were just legal ways of of minimizing your tax burden and is there any American in the last fifty years has been ... by the Iraq War than Donald Trump\nOkay but here's the question why won't he release his tax information he he's been very resistant to them I guess about this article is it's an attempt to try to force him\nTo make some disclosures about or his taxes and if if he doesn't that'll be a reason they're campaigning for Democrats the Democrats will force out the tax returns what do you think\nYou know once again you're all one hundred percent correct that's exactly what this is about and that's what you know the CNN uh Chris Cuomo asked me about last night as well why won't Trump\nReleases tax reforms I advised Trump among many other people during the campaign do not do not really sure ... because if you think this report which was Thirteen they they did Thirteen thousand words they don't even have\nYou know a lot of the tax documents this man who has you know warehouses full of ... tax document through all the businesses\nShe's running through the ... and all this I mean I I I just think it would be a Pandora's box\nOkay uh and and don't file your taxes in a Pandora's box that Stephen Moore\nWho is a distinguished visiting fellow in the project for economic growth at the Heritage Foundation [noise] so what does this mean politically with the campaign coming off an intense fine we'll get to that and more on them eventually [noise]\nAm eight Seventy the answer\n\nAnd it looks like things are busy and counting valley where clashes happiness is on the phone by hitting like down the ... you'll see a load up from ...\nTo make ends meet us I'm having a long journey cleared that up differently now but then swimming I mean some really can't spend that as an incumbent on seven Kennedy ... my lane second because I actually have to abide by Jim ...

pass it's a dividing line according to race\nBetween black and white or or you could save between black people\nOf at a unique experience in the United states coming here originally as enslaved individuals and uh everybody else and there is a new book on this subject by someone who was in the past\nIs very very critical of black leadership his name is Juan Williams you see 'em on the five very regularly on Fox News he's a regular contributor to Fox News his new book is called what the hell do you have to lose\nWhich of course there's a line from President Trump and the subtitle is Trump's more on civil rights a won congratulations on the book\n... wonderful and I appreciate you having me on because micro versus you know I think our ... topic it's a rich topic but especially for conservative audience is sometimes a very difficult you know kind of ... issue uh but I think it's so important for pre shoot the opportunity\nWell one of the things that I liked about your book is you give proper credit or to the Republican Party in particular to Senate minority leader at the time Everett Dirksen for the landmark civil rights bill well let's let's start there because one of the things you remind people of is how profoundly\nThat civil rights bill that was passed a with very strong Republican support in Nineteen sixty four changed America and changed life or your family how\nWell first of all the book is structured in terms of the civil rights act or fix before so that you know we go through everything housing education voting rights are and you come to the idea that this would not have passed unless you had ever it\nFor I think it's quite similar in terms of you know somebody leveling that charge against the nominee and the comments case it was a meter heroin and\nYou know it was very slow to come out but then there are many of the Senate Judiciary committee looked at it privately they dismissed that she wasn't put her name to it and then it got leak and then it came out so it's very similar because if you look at for after four she sent a letter to a congressman ash too many makes its way through guy and Feinstein\nI and then her name is ... or she does the interview with the Washington Post ... ... what other things similar to me is a level that charge I don't think that anybody that\nYou know Clarence Thomas ... on a better\nYeah but it might one there's a difference of tests on the other direction the charges against Clarence Thomas had to do and he was head of the equal Employment Opportunity commission was a government official and he was already yellow graduate the charges the core charges against Brett Kavanaugh\nHas to do with when he was Seventeen years old\nYou are but I think that the larger issue here is ... her character for someone who's going to be on the highest court in the land\nAnd that's where I think he's open themselves to his critics and I wish you hadn't done it because they you know the whole presentation of himself as a virgin choir boy he's got a book is the was and then all of his friends like this guy was a big ... and he loved the party of going out\nOkay wait a minute if you were a U.S senator and who knows you maybe someday I'm not really\nFor real touchy Kelly of Washington D. C. becomes a fifty first date which probably won't happen but in any event\nBut one um would you vote for ... confirmation no not at this point\nAnd the main reason would be because the way he presented himself as the hearing\nHere I think especially last week when he went off you\nMaking all sorts of suggestions or got Clinton conspiracy theory again and the Democrats are I'm thinking wait a minute here's if you're trying to be a judge on the Supreme Court you're displaying a tremendous lack what I Am permanent\nOr don't you think given given the amount of money that was spent by George Soros and other than it is well known as it's now come out that the those two women who cornered Jeff Flake in the elevator for actually operatives of this open society project which is a Soros project has sometimes\nThey can can you well I unfortunately I think we are out of time of the book doesn't have anything to do with Brett Kavanaugh but of course\nAt the moment that is it an issue that seems to touch almost everything the book is called what the hell do you have to lose his claws subtitle is Trump's more on civil rights Juan Williams of Fox News always appreciate talking to you and come back again soon we will be right back with your calls and comments coming to [noise]\n\nGet breaking news on AM eight Seventy the answer dot Tom\nTraffic\nDumped in LA the one on one ... found is jammed from Vermont Alvarado and then it slows down even more crawling from there to Alameda Street where it appears Elaine May be blocked and no word yet what's causing meanwhile in Anaheim to fifty seven ... found has stopped traffic from before the Ninety One of the Lincoln\nLanes block thereby police activity same with the north bound side\nSauce on the seven ten cell phone traffic is really bad from the one oh five to Alondra rivaling blocked by a crash the car in a big rig guns to burger AM eight Seventy answer\n[noise] the FBI reportedly can interview Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh orange Caesar Christine Blasey Ford says agents and not been authorized\nBy the White House to do some Bloomberg says the White House has been for the FBI to last week's testimony by Kevin ... and forward in a lengthy Senate hearing\nMe out White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending President Trump's criticism of Ford who is accused Kevin ... of sexual assault he was stating facts that were given during Dr Ford testimony Trump challenged forwards claims and mocked the California professor during a rally in Mississippi this week\nA fourth man has died of injuries suffered during a series of attacks on mostly homeless people in LA in Santa Monica police say they'll ask for an additional murder charge to be filed against ... of the assaults\nThe man who's been hospitalized since being attacked in September twenty fourth last sleeping your seventh and Broadway in Santa Monica died Sunday forty seven year old Ramon Escobar was arrested in connection with the attacks and he's being held without bail\nAnd woman and her boyfriend pleaded not guilty today to torturing and murdering her ten year old son of Lancaster and the case in which the tooth and now face the death penalty the boy's mother twenty nine year old Heather Baron and her boyfriend to relieve that are charged with killing Anthony ... and torturing him in the days leading up to his June twenty first death\nShowers slight chance out tender storms this afternoon hides in the upper sixties mid seventies right now in Pasadena it's Seventy degrees in Costa Mesa it's Seventy three I think he talks my commitment continues to\n... again it's yet another attempt to add more government bureaucracy and healthcare and all this time it's proposition eight and who's behind each one labor union trying to impose new government bureaucracy on every\nMedical dialysis clinic in California it's a complete ... system and even worse and put bureaucracy between patients and their doctors and popping up for\nSale is clinics to cut back services or shut down sending thousands of sick patients into already crowded rooms experts more than ... will cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars ... groups representing doctors nurses taxpayer\nAdvocates involving no stop this costly dialysis proposition from\nBuying one proposition dangerous analysis proposition ... by the California emails is counsel mini major funding from things for medical care in North America\nOh\nTennis player here if you have a business or real estate dispute I strongly recommend that you call ...

opinion of Sarah Sanders the White House press secretary in any event he was taking on Sarah Sanders about the fact that President Trump last night a pointed out in a rally\nOr the and pointed out fairly accurately saw the inconsistencies in Christine Blasey Ford's memory the fact that she remembered exactly the jihad one beer\nThat night but she couldn't remember which house it was or what year it was as she couldn't remember how she got home after the so legit incident happened which is a big thing that Rachel Mitchell emphasizes and her ... she was the prosecutor who asked questions of her and actually set them up pretty effectively when you read this memo\nIn any of that here was Sarah Sanders endemic pasta or about that to President Trump's comments\nTo there's something wrong with the president United States mocking somebody that shows you\nSeem to me that he was stating facts that Dr Ford herself a laid out in her testimony once again I every single word that judge Kavanaugh said has been looked at ... and picked apart by most of you in this room but not no one is looking at\nAh whether or not the accusations made her corroborated whether or not there's evidence to support them\nShows the victim and all the\nI think both Dr Ford in judge Kavanaugh\nAh or victims at the hands of the Democrats I think it is absolutely disgraceful\nWhat they've done and exploited this process they exploited Dr Ford there exploiting all of the women that have come out to make any type of accusations this isn't the process that should've been done which is certainly everybody deserves to be hurt but that includes judge Kavanaugh and that should be part of this process and the facts\nHave to be looked at and I think you have to look at the prosecutors memo\nThose are where you see all those facts laid out and I think she makes a very good\n... his love of any wrong to have any problems stayed in fact I Know John there and just leave probably do\n[noise] okay um [laughter]\nAh actually this this could be the basis I imagine for a sitcom is a a female White House press secretary and a I'm really really annoying White House reporter\nWho secretly have

to admit that he just said your daughter was having no\nI did not I did not I'm just suggesting that I'm sure some Hollywood writer could be working on that plot right now a meanwhile ... Alyssa mulatto speaking of TV sitcoms um said she couldn't sleep\nAnd uh and then she was on Sarah Sanders and Jim Acosta and reaction this was on MSNBC\nI Am filled with a lot of range today I have to tell you now and it started last night and I couldn't sleep at all last night\nAnd I can't believe that this is where we are that we are making the choice about who we want to be in the country\nWe are making those choices and the people that we're putting in positions of power whether it be Trump or Kavanaugh or our institutions I sexual abuse had been institutionalized in this country\nAnd it ends heartbreaking for me and I just don't think we can allow another generation of women and children to feel as though their government is not listening\nThat doesn't care that they are invisible\nTo arrange for for ... and just go on and say you know he was just stating that facts law I mean this guy in the blue I can state that fact but if I Do it totally a little off like\nA sky blue mocking someone that may have sent that so so how old is everything right now and we're making a choice and the Republican Party\nMaking a choice to head back this man and this administration and its time right now right here and history will reflect upon a time being devastating I Will tell you this [noise]\nThirty four days to the mid term elections I really do believe there were eight hundred thousand new registering voters and voter registration day I think women I think survivor is I think men are are not going to allow this to continue and we're going to take back the house and maybe even a Senate\nOkay uh that's Alyssa Milano she by the way they at\nThe star of who's the boss in the eighties I don't know why she was the hearing except that when she was first star that was when these events where most of taking place thirty six years ago\n[noise] um [noise] they filled with rage this time in history that there's so much new information about Christine Blasey Ford [noise] none of it [noise] supporting her allegation we'll we'll be right back with more coming up on the message\n[noise]\nLife insurance is tremendously important that's always been my conviction but it's amazing that a third of all people don't have any life insurance at all and it's because it's really hard to buy and sometimes\nYou have to work out what exactly you need then do all the research to find the best quote and hope you don't get swindled along the way well it's not a good way to shop for anything so policy genius makes the whole process a lot simpler\nPolicy genius doesn't just make life insurance easy they also compare disability insurance home insurance and auto insurance and if you care about it they can cover it for you\nShow whether you know a lot about life insurance or nothing at all start your search of policy genius on Tom and just two minutes you can compare quotes and make an informed decision for you and your loved ones\nPolicy genius the easy way to compare and by life insurance sets policy genius dot com policy genius dot com\nWhen it comes to retirement people often ask will I have enough money to retire when will retirement be a possibility\nFor me how do I maximize my money during retirement if any of these questions sound familiar or you have other questions about retirement you are with yourself to learn more don't miss the money matters retirement seminar to get your questions answered reserved seat at the next seminar by registering on line that money matters dot net are called eight hundred nine four oh three oh two\nNext seminars on Saturday October sixth of the rabbits and hotel chatsworth and Saturday a cobra thirteenth at the embassy suite spy Hilton Arcadia Pasadena area\nAre you tired of going from Dennis officer dentist office for specialized work on your teeth that never happens the magic Beijing Dr Ray ... is ... is known for ... quite dentistry\nMom magic is your one stop shop for all personal I mean why go to inexperience overwork technicians that assembly line down when I when you can see that you raised my magic you got to think about\nWhen you go to a discount cardiologist\nWhen it comes to your health we smart and called doctor a mama you\nPut off getting a T fix for any reason don't wake up call a dentist he went on and done a call to work on their mouth ... mile magic dentistry walked in with ... broken teeth or beat up all dentures walk out with Mark Twain\nFix teeth all done in one comfortable visit call now forget I went in there for ... for the first Asian zero percent financing for twelve months ... nice to nice smile needed a nine to nine\nSmile improve your home with new beautiful energy efficient milk or windows and doors from some bond windows and doors S.

uh which he showed a hopefully [noise]\nHe gets to say when the Senate votes and he said [noise]\nSense gonna vote this week [noise]\nMost people think that probably means friday it could mean sat [noise]\nUm but uh you can be sure that every single senator will show up and we'll be counted\nOne eight hundred nine five\nFive Seventeen Seventy six and remarkably enough or at the FBI seems to be close to completing its investigation a a an update over at the hill\nSays the FBI is said to be wrapping up its investigation of the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nSo what are they out well we don't exactly know nor\nAs the Republicans repeated again and again when they were resisting the idea of this extra\nFBI investigation\nWill they come up and say well we found that he's guilty as sin or we found that he is as white as the driven snow or or I shouldn't say white was innocent as the driven snow\nOr because ... it's very very tough when\nVirtually all of the principles in this debate are white uh it's it's very tough to find some means of making this a racial issue but of course Democrats have been trying and trying and trying\nIt I'm Steve Gomez the former FBI special agent he's a wasn't special agent in charge of Los Angeles which is one of the most important bureau or offices in the country\nHe said it wasn't unusual that the FBI was not going to be in viewing Ford they were not going to be interviewing Christine Blasey Ford they're not going to be interviewing a judge Kavanaugh again I mean after all each of them spent hours\nIn front of the Senate Judiciary committee plus they have both been extensively interviewed by the staff of the Judiciary Committee apparently the um and and this I think is a syndicated that judge Kavanaugh\nSpent more hours over thirty total speaking to the staff of the Judiciary Committee than any other nominee\nFor the Supreme Court or for all of the others combined and with more questions asked I think it's safe to say that he is the the first nominee where where his drinking\nIn a high school and college has become a serious issue by the way that was not the subject of the\nThe FBI background investigation apparently they are speaking to Deborah Ramirez who had made those comments about his freshman year at Yale in the basement of Lawrence hall and ensure\n[noise] let let me speak personally for just a moment because as people know listen to the show I went to yell once upon a time\nAnd uh I did my first year at the law school and so this was before a judge Kavanaugh or was anywhere close to the campus in New haven\nBut I ... at places like that are very tradition bound the culture doesn't change that dramatically\nAnd is it the idea that drinking is a very big deal for a lot of people in college I think that's true\nI mean breaking news and once they're they're old Yale songs including the within Poussaint which is very well known it became a smash hit are all about drinking and there are there there are lots of ah lots of references in this goes back to songs dating to the nineteenth century\nAnd I I Will say that does that mean that everybody gets drunk all the time no I I I was thinking about it and I [noise] I didn't drink and college sorry\nUm I Wish I could say I didn't look I turned out okay and where at least I think I did um but no I um I I did not imbibe I didn't like the taste of beer at that time and a and\nMost are people that I knew [noise] sort of and I write about this and right turns when I talk a little bit about my years ago and part of what happened is\nIn the late sixties there was a transition and people who have been very obsessed with beer became very obsessed with pot\nWhich I thought was more obnoxious I mean really more obnoxious because people made us so squeezed religious thing of it with him flashing strobe\nLight you know oh man oh wow this is so amazing\nAnd I don't really think that anybody know not Brett Kavanaugh\nAre not members of the ... not not anybody or have the idea that drinking beer was a path to light meant\nAh I Know I don't think that was the case so maybe at the University of North Carolina they've just published and this is part of the very needed role of a free press there's a website that you published some photos including photos of\nChristine Blasey Ford during her years at Chapel Hill and University of North Carolina and showing her as something of a party girl\nThere is a statement is covered now in the New York times today the New York times not just Fox News it's the New York times is covering the allegations by her former live in boyfriend\nWho says that all of this stuff about how she was traumatized and they were dating for ... years they knew each other casualty averse to they were dating for six years between Nineteen Ninety two and Nineteen Ninety eight and he says a number of unpleasant things about\nA doctor ... Ford\nNow is that off limits\nWell he's do ... questioning her credibility for instance on the stuff that she was afraid of flying and that's why she couldn't make it to the hearings to testify earlier when it was very obvious to everybody that this is nonsense date they asked her\nRitual Miller asked her about her flying and she said oh no I'm not really afraid of flying so why did you tell that to the committee and doesn't this go to the issue of credibility\nAll all of this stuff [noise] it seems to me that if you\nAre going to come forward about something that happened too long ago from what you feel you have never ever ever recovered\nWhat do you have to expect that there will be some pushback and um [noise] the the way the New York times highlights their story ah Christine Blasey Ford's credibility under new attack by Senate Republicans\nBut that includes the following the former boyfriend told the Judiciary Committee that she witnessed personally Dr Blass Z helping a friend prepare for a possible polygraph examination contradicting her testimony under oath\nDr Blass he a psychology professor from California who also goes by are married name Ford was asked during the hearing whether she'd ever given tips or advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test she answered never\nBut the former boyfriend whose name was redacted from a copy of a sworn statement provided\nTo the Judiciary Committee\nSaid that when they were together in the late Nineteen Ninety she saw Dr Blass to use her understanding of psychology\nTo assist her roommate of the time Monica el McLean before interviews for possible position positions with the FBI or the U.S attorney's office that might require her to take a lie detector test\nQuote I witnessed Dr Ford helped make lean prepare for a potential polygraph exam demands that in a statement Dr Ford explained in detail what to expect help polygraph works and help me clean become familiar and less nervous about the exam\nMeanwhile ms McLean who is a former FBI agent denied the assertion today she says I have never had Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else prepare me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam might have taken it anytime okay\nSo here's a disagreement\nDo we know who to believe you know do we know who to believe between a doctor Ford and judge Kavanaugh well we're going to find out a little bit more about the other witnesses\nAnd yes she identified it was Dr Ford who came up with the names P Jay's mice and um [noise] a Kaiser legal in Kaiser her good friend who says she's never met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd so she couldn't have been at that party Brett Kavanaugh was in fact that that party\nAnd then march judge\nAnd what is the FBI likely to say and how was the vote likely to go and who will decide this final vote will get to that with your calls coming up on the ... one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nIn my case yes ... was to have your that was not a suitable for a person who would be a judge on any court much less ... I think when a judge Kavanaugh with all partisan\nA left wing conspiracy beyond everything I think that was the disqualifying moment short and show the demeanor of a judge to hear it he was angry with ranting he was ...\nI was astonished at his of his ran I mean he's a judge who's a sitting circuit court judge is supposed to be nonpartisan\nThat part of an raised not those funds your digital thing you can do\nIt as soon as he were unfairly to still supposed to behave as a judge his edited ... should be disqualifying showed no judicial temperament\nBut we know one thing he does not have the temperament to be a job\nWhile the Supreme Court I've never argued it for the Supreme Court but I've written amicus brief and I've I've sat in the Supreme Court\nHow can he say credibly on the court and claim to be impartial with temperament like [noise]\n... and belligerent came in full of heart is in ... county is on the table I was like this is going up all night it's fate Supreme Court justice he showed a lack of judicial\nTemperament that I wouldn't want my case to be heard by them I don't think anyone in America for Republican or Democrat who'd want someone as biased and his uncontrolled\nIn his range in age than it has ranged temperament is just south ... I think he's going to be resentful I think that out of everything we can talk about the FBI investigation but even if they clear I think that the telephone cell phones off hole\nCome out of and be a responsible Jersey Supreme Court without being angry Henry okay\nBut by the way let let me mention the name here the name is Justice Clarence Thomas has just as high as Thomas was also angry when he testified before the Senate Judiciary committee back in Nineteen Ninety One remember he accused them of a high tech lynching\nAnd he was angry and he was right to be angry\nAnd I think Brett Kavanaugh's right to be angry there's what Orrin Hatch wrote today it's a terrific piece\nHe says we're starting to see arguments like the following even a judge Kavanaugh is innocent what he said of the hearing and how he said it as just follow fine this is rich says Senator Hatch\nTheory occur in the first place only because of democratic do publicity that occur only because Senate Democrats sat on ms Ford's allegations for six weeks rather than referring them to the committee investigators as they should have done immediately\nIt occurred only because ms Ford's lawyer's recommended to me as four by Senate Democrats refused to tell their own client of our invitation to testify privately in California as she said she preferred\nThe judge cap Kavanaugh had the temerity to defend himself vigorously is now being counted as a strike against him\nI think for many Americans is to his credit we will be right back\nSee but right here on AMA seven devious or the other guy\nIn the south bay
