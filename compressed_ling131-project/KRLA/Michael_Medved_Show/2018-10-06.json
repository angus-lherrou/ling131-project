training walking coon hound I Love them I work with them when I was stationed down south incredible dogs\nGreat but see what the show that she would always correct that if she was going to lie down\nHere's why because when you show dog it's called stacking\nThey would stacked the dog meaning the dark act if you ever watch the dark shadows of dogs have to stand up in a certain way to the judgment having judged if you did the judge and go through them and see that they are what their standards are compared to the to stand to the break so if your question is how to get the doctor said here's how you doing OK\nLet's okay when you want to talk to you never want to push down on the dogs by okay that's the worst thing you can do\nHere's what I like I Do is nearly alongside the dog take your arm\nAnd just put it under her tail right by her touched okay and talk just pushed aside in because that's going to force you to sit down and you're lifting up on the chest at the same time and now you're seeing sit sit sit you're giving hugs and kisses and which he says even if they're a second appraiser praised appraiser\nDo it every day for five or ten minutes at a time and then what I Want you to do\nIs make sure that every time you work with her you always end on a positive note and she'll be find the worst mistake you can make though is pushing down on the back because they were taught not to accept that\nBecause when the judge goes he runs his hand over their back and his dog sat that we kind of be disqualified so we don't want to start a biography dog being sat just tuck under the rear tuck under the rear lift up a little bit on the front use the word sit and make it fun making happy experience and you'll be fine\nGot at bank yeah yeah 'cause hazing that treat and trying to get her to go with the cheap but not like\nShe was told not to sit not to not to sit in my whole life you know and in fact they are actually some actual handlers used to put like a leash underneath and in front of the backlash to hold the dog up kind of like a Mary and that topic I used to give handling class as many years ago for the YMCA\nAnd so dogs were taught not to be shown to

in\nAn old man you or you have a lot of money matters\nAnd Malaysia by hand your host of mine and we talked about Jesus we talked\nAbout retirement planning Social Security estate planning reducing your income taxes you name it we talk about it and we try to have more fun\nThan a human being should be allowed to have one talking about all of this boring financial stuff down there is no doubt and this week is no exception because we're going to have an absolutely fantastic show\nLined up for you but before we go one step further let me introduce myself I Am Kendall rake the host of money matters with chemical ray [noise]\nBecky jak I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on the show these are the very same idea that we talked about with our ... and most valued clients\nAnd we're not work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states it is an honor it is a privilege\nAnd we are a retirement planning specialist so we work primarily with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon and so if you would like to learn more about us you can find us on the Web we are at money matters\nDot net and one final thought is not to brag at all but uh recently actually for the sixth year in a row I was named one of the top one hundred a financial independent financial advisors or by parents and\nWe love you\nWell thank you and without our clients we would be nowhere so therefore I put that one I give it to them now let me go over with you what we're going to talk about on this our weekly excursion into the land of personal finances so first of all I'm the economy is strong\nOkay by all measures we got a uh uh the employment data looked a little softer than people thought but that's okay it's still pretty strong about two hundred thousand jobs a month now which is an economy our side that's pretty darn good\nAnd so the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates and we saw that the uh the ten year went ah which is the most watched interest rate that uh traders look at has gone up and now it's looking like it's going to have around three and a quarter if it stays there that's a big thing so I Want to talk\nWith you about have you review your bond portfolio lately\nOkay because if you have and you knew or should I think so we'll talk about that also\nSince we are a retirement planning specialist we talk with our clients about planning around all of the things that we can think of that has to do with achieving their goals having them we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision okay we want you to go play and have fun and just relax and enjoy\nAnd so to do that we believe you need to have a a a plan in place that addresses all the things that could harm you and believe it or not when you are retired there are actually Eighteen risks that you face they're Eighteen of him\nAnd properly designed plan in my opinion is one that addresses all Eighteen of those so we're going to talk about risk number seven this week which is financial elder abuse okay so if you have an older family members someone in their seventies eighties\nOr or or or older I Want to talk with you about that it's a big big deal uh unfortunately and also we're gonna talk about Social Security this week so ah we're going to answer the question of when should you wait until you're Seventy just start collecting Social Security\nOkay so there are reasons why you may want to do that and so we want to help you understand that uh that strategy [noise]\nNow also from a from an investment standpoint you know we want as I said we want you to enjoy your second childhood so whatever that means to you if you if it means playing a lot of golf if it means traveling if it means spending time with your grandchildren whatever that means to you that's great we want to help you achieve that\nBut if you lose a large amount of your money in the next market downturn than I Would argue that being able to do those second childhood activities will be very difficult if you don't have the money for it\nSo therefore when we manage money for our clients we have an overarching strategy that is called by hold and sell okay meaning that we don't believe that by hold is enough you also have to have a strategy to sell\nAnd so this week I Want to talk with you about a by hold myth that is a I heard or I've called because I've heard it and that is that if you sell\nYou know and we advocate if you sell your going to cash to protect your money while you're in cash you're not going to make any money\nAnd if you don't make any money that's a bad thing\nAnd that's like the silliest thing I've ever heard but I ... well maybe not ever but I put it up there and I want to go over with you why I think that one is just really dumb okay so we'll we'll talk about that now most shows would stop right there I mean most of us would say you know if we did all that we've done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial show\nTo infinity on beyond and buses right do we stop right there on the show no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has\nGone before and therefore at about ten till we will have our state tip of the week and this week the estate tip is called a Q tip okay so this is normally we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor\nBut this week we're going to talk about how to pass it on to your uh not too you're very uh what's the opposite of greedy I'm giving [laughter]\nWashed and very deserving spouse okay and that's called a Q tip trust it says special kind of trust designed to protect your spouse so we'll talk about that at about ten to ... to dive end up before we do I just got to have a quick update you know it's interesting Jack Jack is my producer extraordinary [noise] um\nYou know I I'm a kind of talked about we have this uh now seven month old puppy and this puppy now ways fifty pounds I mean this this is when you look at her she'd like a big dog and you forget that she was just a baby um and so you know but ah her name is noodle and she's a she noodle so it's a noodle dishes noodle\n[noise] and uh so the the update because people apparently are interested in this I don't know why or is that a noodles house training has progressed okay we had a moment there where it wasn't going well so now she she doesn't ever poop in the house anymore okay so that's a big plus I Would say right\nHowever and she doesn't pay however what she does do is this submission P. thing it's awful it's like the first time she sees me she slots and ... a gallon of pee on the floor and I'm like what the heck you know\nAnd I can't stop it it's like I've tried like being outside\nAnd opening the door so she comes out to me but then she pays right on the patio and colleague I don't know how to stop this people tell me they they outgrow it eventually but\nI Hope so [laughter] anyway so let's talk about interest rates the economy or the jobs numbers that we saw this week uh looked pretty strong not as strong as some forecasts were expecting but still two hundred thousand jobs you know a month is what the economy is producing right now\nThere's some talk that the unemployment rate has rates so low that it can go lower than\nYou know the problem with that is that we always look at what we called the ... what's called the protests labor participation rate which is the number of people of working age that are actually working\nAnd that number is still very very low relative to history so therefore there are a lot of people that are now coming into the workforce that weren't in it and if you're not in the workforce you're not counted in the unemployment numbers\nSo that the unemployment rate number the headline number is actually one that we don't really look at we look at the labor participation rate and it's still low so there's a lot of room for\nPeople to come in and start working still so the economy strong and so the fed most likely is going to continue to raise interest rates and we've seen interest rates spike here in the last few days with that realization that we've been telling you that this is something you should be thinking about for several months now now the the question I Would ask\nYou is have you reviewed your bond portfolio if you have bonds and your portfolio and and we do we believe that bonds are part of a diversified portfolio\nUm you need to look at what's called the duration of your bond portfolio because longer term bonds bonds that are ten years Fifteen twenty thirty or bonds you no longer term bonds even longer than five years\nAs a Federal Reserve raises interest rates the value of those bonds historically has gone down now that doesn't mean it will in the future but the likelihood is very very great that as the fed raises interest rates those kind of bonds are going to lose value\nSo you need to look at your portfolio and ask yourself what do you think rates are going to do over the next year or two and a so we believe that we are actually in a bond bear market the difference though is that bond markets are the death of a thousand cuts you know it's not like the stock market we're falls and crashes\nIt's like this this general decline that lasts for several years and that's what we're seeing so as you know a couple of months ago we\nReduced the direction of our bond portfolio we actually uh put half of our bond portfolio into government a cash equivalence because what happens with those is that as the fed raises interest rates the interest rate that you get in those kinds of accounts goes up\nAnd ... because it's directly correlated and your principal is very very safe so we wanna we wanna make sure that we can\nMake money when you know as to the extent that we can make sure that we make money when the fed raises interest rates in our bonds and not lose money okay so one thing that you may want to do if you have not reviewed your bond portfolios talk to your advisor or better yet go on our website money matters dot net money matters dot net\nThen or if you go to our website at his money matters dot net money matters dot net\nUm you can sign up for one of our seminars we had seminars that talk about uh your four one K. and diversification are we talking about where to get income from when you are retired we talked about how to make the decision on when to take your Social Security benefits we talk about\nHow to determine how much risk is appropriate for you you know you want you want to do you want to take only as much risk as is necessary to accomplish your financial goals that's one of our our basic philosophy is we don't want to take any more risk than is necessary so you've got to figure out what that risk level is and we will help

topic that comes up I Would say just about in every conversation we have with our clients\nAnd even with people who are in our clients who are considering it and that is Social Security okay and so one of the big questions that if you haven't started collecting Social Security that you probably have is when should I start\nAnd then there's another which is how should I collected and it's very interesting but if you look at all of the different permutations of that decision whether you're widowed whether you're married difference in ages difference in income different in health all those kind of things there actually\nEight thousand combinations of that the answer to that question how how and when I take my Social Security and what's crazy is that one of those is yours [laughter]\nOkay so how do you figure that oh well I mean I'm thinking right it could be just one maybe there's more than one but it seems to me there's only one that's right for you so you got to figure that one out and it's not easy it and I mean it's complicated\nYou know our advisors in our firm we put we we have in fact the starting next week we're putting them through intensive training I mean it it's someone who spend their time learning about Social Security still has to stay up on it the laws changed I mean it's it's it's complicated\nAnd so for you and I'm Talking about you ladies and gentlemen listening to the show as a lay person that doesn't do this for a living you know I Would say that the odds are stacked against you that you're going to make the right decision so be that as it may\nI Want to help you to have some of the criteria you should be thinking about so one of the questions would be you know should I wait till I'm Seventy\nAnd start collect Social Security then now just to set the stage Social Security you can actually start when you're sixty two assuming you qualify so you can take six or start taking Social Security at age sixty two but if you wait\nFor every year that you wait the benefit that you are going to receive increases and from sixty six through Seventy eight increases by eight percent per year\nThe benefit that you received us okay so\nIt there's an incentive there to wait because the benefit is larger however you're giving up the money while you're waiting so there's a disincentive to so there's some math involved in that but let me give you generally what are we believed to be the reasons why you may want to wait to your Seventy okay one big reason is\nWhen you die your spouse has a choice of getting your Social Security or there's whichever is the higher okay so if you are in bad health or or something where you have a low life expectancy\nThan it may make sense for you to wait till you're Seventy because then the benefit that you'll receive will be the highest and then upon your death your spouse will take over that benefit and get that highest amount and so that's one big reason why you may want to another reason that you may want to hear that you know you don't need the money\nBut as I always tell clients when they say that as well if you don't need the money then started taking it a sixty six and just give it to me [laughter]\nIf you don't want it I'll take it [laughter]\nBut uh anyway yeah so if if you feel that the you know you don't need the money you may want to wait because also one of the things that can happen is that your spouse can collect half of yours and if you both weight than the benefit that you get at Seventy could be a lot higher as well\nSo there are some reasons to wait till you're Seventy generally speaking though they are few there there's very few reasons why sixty six is normally the best time to take\nBut uh there are reasons to take it at Seventy now if you are over fifty if you are retired or retiring soon if you are within five years of retirement or five years after retirement that ten year period\nThan we want to talk with you OK we want to help you to
