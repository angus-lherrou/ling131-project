myself\nAnd it's been a nothing short of miraculous on me and I just want to put it out that it doesn't work on everybody you have to choose the right patient\nIt doesn't work nerve injuries that doesn't work on many things it doesn't work in cancer pain or multiple sclerosis and things like that [noise]\nFood that does work and most people will skill it'll pay and um I'd like to go to the question was just came in and um\nI Do tell people is go to the website which is W. W. W. dot L. A. stem cells dot com LA stem cells dot com\nAnd uh every page has a spot where you can email me and this is an email that just came in and um it's an area that I like to talk about so it's titled degenerative disc because that means one of the cushions\nBetween the vertebrae um called away from the neck all the way down to the um health five is one area in the back and everything in between [noise]\nSo the question is is Hello Dr Darrow I've been diagnosed with the general to disc disease I've had cat scans andme arise and X rays I'm also prone to bulging disks in my neck area\nI received treatments in two thousand Fifteen in two thousand six team of cortisone injections to treat this [noise]\nI live with pain daily and I'm only fifty six would you consider me a candidate can you help me with this\nThe answer is most likely yes because degenerative disc disease in of itself doesn't even cause pain\nHow can that be voting desks don't generally cause pain so why do people get surgery for these things I Do not know it makes no sense to me [noise]\nUnfortunately most people with neck and back pain [noise] um doctors do not know how to treat\nThe way to treat them is to touch the area don't look at the end Mariah necessarily we need them arise to see if there's anything strange going on but if it shows something like ... syndrome or teacher this disease Dee Dee Dee\nFor bulging disc that's not usually the cause of the pain so don't get seduced into your MRI or X ray\nHave the doctor touched the area's see where the pain is find the pain generator that means the area where the pain is coming from [noise]\nUsually in about a ten second exam I can tell you whether the treatments that I Do can help you heal and in most cases if I find the area people heal up\nI've used it on myself over the years I've had many neck and back injuries from being a little color high speed athlete\nThan they are nothing more than an ankle spring\nAnd why do I call it an ankle spraying 'cause same thing as springing wrinkle do get surgery for an ankle spraying no you don't get nervous about it just hurts\nBut it's an ankle sprained in your neck and back and we can inject the area and grow back the tissue\nAnd um that's what a needle laughs about the in the south but the it's where the air it is leading attached to the bones yeah fits the emphasis so when it's painful it's in the south of the [noise]\nSo yes those are things we usually can heal up very easily lose no guarantees with the kind of medicine I Do there's no guarantees with any kind of medicine\nAnd uh I have every one sign a consent form of says no guarantees because I've had a few people come back and yell at me and so you guaranteed this I don't guarantee anything and never did how can a doctor guarantee anything everybody is different [noise]\nSo that's the story I'm Nick and back pain be careful you don't get surgery\nUm unless it's needed there are cases where it's needed if you go to a giant herniated disc sitting on a nerve and your arm or leg is dead you'd better hurry up and and get surgery to fix that but that's not typical most people that I see at least\nUm don't have that situation they have these minor minor springs and most of them end up getting surgery for a shame because it it doesn't work out it ends up being a failed back syndrome which again I mentioned before on the show\nIf the if the insurance company has a diagnosis of failed Mac syndrome\nWhat do you think that means it means that it led the surgeries fail so many times that they have to make a diagnostic code for it\nThat's preposterous\nRally so well a couple of things one is\nUm if you want to find out if you're at least your office visit the first time is taking care of\nCall my office which is an eight hundred three hundred Ninety three hundred repeated eight hundred three hundred Ninety three hundred [noise] would you take Medicare signal at no Blue Cross Blue Shield United healthcare and for people without insurance we take care credits\nAnd it's like a credit card and um the procedures that I Do usually are not covered by insurance unless possibly a car accident maybe workers' comp for most health insurance will pay for the initial visit but not for the procedures\nAnd we'd like to get some callers into the show to make it interesting so our number here\nIs eight six six eight seven zero five seven five to\nA color is always ask us to say it's slowly um repeated it's eight six six eight seven zero\nFive seven five to if you are driving we would love if you would pull over to the side of the road and be safe and take off your Bluetooth and just go direct to we can hear what you're saying\nAbsolutely that number again is one eight six six eight seven zero five Seventy five ...\nAnd check out the website at W.

I don't know anyone in the u._k. but this person mentioned that there are studies going on at the University of liver pool would I Would do is I Would look up those studies and see the author's name\nAnd go to the doctor because there are people that are in the middle of the of this and know what they're doing hopefully [noise]\nAh the good news about this is we do he'll miniscule terrorists using pure pie or stem cells depending if it's a bad tear I haven't checked in my own ... and I've had pretty good luck with that\nUm that doesn't really matter what part of the body is we're dealing with because these techniques of regenerative medicine grew back the tissue\nThat's right I Know orthopedic surgeons for the most part don't believe that because as an orthopedic surgeon we're trained to believe that there's only one way to heal illness by taking tissue out or stitching it back together\nLet's do it ... our hey mark doctors\nAre higher and higher Hi good morning how are you doing doctor\nLiving it up mark I understand that a pain in your hand\nYeah I um I was diagnosed with severe uh carpal tunnel about four months ago and I just recently had surgery on my left hand\nAnd I had to have after going through the surgery some kind of like having a second thought because of the type of work that I Do I think I'm probably going to be out of work for over a year because my left hand and taking forever to heal\nHow long has it been since you left him carpal tunnel surgery occurred\nUm it was done on August ...\nWell that's not much time you got to give it a couple of months to heal up in Seattle kind of work to do what kind of work to ... I'm a machine that's\nA ... and a lot of a hammer arena and impact tools are his polling you ... do you have a risk grace that goes all the way up to elbow\nNot up to my elbow just halfway\nOkay that may be sufficient bilko strapped so when you put it on the wrist doesn't flex or extend\nRight yeah that that I sleep with\nThat's what I was just going to say you go to sleep with that thing so the nerve doesn't get traction are stretched out now\nThere are areas are out there and yes or a\nOr is there any other thing I can go now the right the right hand like I said I was scheduled to have that done and probably another month but is there anything else it can be done beside surgery\nSure there's a lot of things that can be done um number one you make sure you wear a brace all the time November to you stop doing machine work and you're going to like capitalism I make my living so it's sort of like if you have a hammer and you're banging your toll all day long and you come to me and say how come my towards\nRight yeah so\nI don't know if there's some way you can move up the food chain and get a job as a manager or something but [noise] what am I ... I had\nThought about the injections I happy a quote that cortisone injections done ... I'll I'll walk all it helped me deal with than like two three days\nOr about one thing but I Do that's\nA little bit different than just the cortisone injections ... there was an ultrasound used to police the needle\nUm no they they marked with a with a marker they measured and I'm like look a marker\nOkay so if you do it with an ultrasound eating it you can actually see the nerve and the tendons that are crunching on\nAll you know I've had that test a very a very painful tests but remember that when they put the needle in the muscle\nOkay no that's not what I'm Talking about that's in the energy and a nerve conduction study does not us last last a procedure\nSo we use an ultrasound to look inside and you can see you can actually physically see the nerve and the tendons that surround it and then you put a needle right next to it and you do what's called hydro dissection\nAnd this is a way the tendons away from the nerves that sometimes can help [noise]\nSo that would be the next step and see if that works and then the nerve can shrink down the problem is if you're still doing your machine work I don't think you're going to heal up\nFive\nDid not want to hear that [laughter] and I didn't want to say it but I mean that's hard work you're doing with your hands\nYeah it's been for forty forty four years Neal it's about time they're complaining\nTo get what I'm

[noise]\nWell you know what are those of you are old enough to remember Matt Dillon from gun smoke there was an episode that I'll never forget and the famous line or but at least for me that he said he said man who's not afraid he's a fool [laughter]\nOkay so you don't want to be a full so we'll talk about that and I also ah as I said you know we specialize in working with people who are retired retiring soon or most of our clients are over fifty\nAnd so we talked about a risk that you face one of the things as a financial planner you know we want you to enjoy the best retirement that you can we want you to have your second childhood without parental supervision we want you to go play enjoy whatever it is that you want your retirement looked like\nAt the same time do to make that happen I Believe we have to protect you from the risks that could take it away from you okay so this week I Want to talk about what we were on a series of the Eighteen risks faced in retirement\nAnd I want to talk about number six which is called frailty risk which is essentially the risk that your cognitive skills deteriorate as you get older and how do you plan to head for that and unfortunately it is something you need to plan for not speaking of planning for stop\nOne of the most foundational basic question that you have to think about if you haven't started collecting Social Security already is when do you apply\nAnd so uh we're gonna talk about that or this week we're going to have a segment on went to apply for Social Security\nAnd uh we may not be able to get through all the questions that are lined up that I think you might be interested in so if we don't we'll continue it next week as well now one of the things I mentioned at the top of this show was that uh you know we work as I said with people who are retired retiring soon for the most part\nAnd so we believe that maintaining what you\nBet your life building your investments your your net worth\nIs job number one if we're going to be able to generate the income to give you the the lifestyle that you want okay so therefore we believe that by hold which is you buy a bunch of investments high quality stop and you create a great portfolio you re balance it and your job is done our view of that is that it's it's an incomplete strategy\nYou need to have a third part to that which is you need to have a cell strategy and that's why you know as I said we told our clients to sell the November of ... and they just say out for all of two thousand and eight and then even half of all night we didn't say to buy until June of old nine\nSo we're we're we're by holding cell [noise]\nSo this week I Want to talk given to drop that we saw last week and not dramatically it happened and how quickly I Want to address the hey you don't have to worry about it because you're a long term investor everything takes care of itself overtime time heals all wounds and all that good stuff your long term investor by whole through thick and thin [noise]\nWell I Want to talk about that one with you because I think that is one of the most dangerous things that people tell you if you are the aforementioned retired retiring so now most shows jak would stop right there most shows and say you know what if we did just that we have done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial show\nSomebody you don't you dare stopped me because on this show do we stop there no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before\nAnd therefore at about ten till we all have our state tip of the week this is a part of the show as Yemen where we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and this week we're going to talk about my favorite trust is called a dynasty trust\nAnd this is where you can protect what you leave your heirs from lawsuits divorce and the state taxes for potentially one hundred years it's a terrific thing and we'll talk about that at about ten ...\nSo we've got a ton of get to but I Want to just quickly give a shout out\nTo a ... a listener Laura if you're listening talking about you [noise] um I mentioned last week that we have a a puppy and the puppy or she has this submissive pink thing that she does you know it's like the mom and she sees me\nYou know when I first come home from work or in the morning or whatever it is first time she sees me bam a gallon of ... right there she just squats and peace and it's like oh my gosh\nAnd so Laura heard this and she sent me an email we have the best\nI Can't tell you it's it's awesome thank you Laura she's a ... a retired veterinarian so if anybody knows the ... right [noise]\nWell I don't know I have to call her she gave me a phone number as you said call me and Laura I'm going to call you okay I just haven't had time to sweet but I'll tell you this weekend if if that's okay [noise] anyway let's talk about in this house and it ate all over again okay so\nYou know I Want to go back to um you know two thousand and seven the end of two thousand seven October ish and all that\nAnd at that time\nYou know there were some clouds there were some dark clouds or the unemployment numbers were starting to get weaker a there was a inflation was picking up\nThe economy was slowing down a little bit I mean there was no signs of what was to calm but there were signs there were some dark cloud let's say that it wasn't raining but they were dark clouds\nAnd uh and there was a lot of volatility the market was dropping dramatically and then a rising dramatically than dropping dramatically and at that time people are saying this is a buying opportunity you know when the market fell and by the way that's almost exactly\nWhat happened in Y. two K. in October of two thousand August through October same thing the market was going up and down the same way before it finally a sell off a cliff so is this like that\n[noise] um no in my view okay first of all the economy right now is not showing signs of weakening in fact it's the opposite is showing signs of strength\nUnemployment is showing signs of strength inflation is is is in good shape so we got a lot of signs that no this is not two thousand and eight all over again so what is it\nWell basically it's a re calibration okay so in other words the Federal Reserve raised interest rates the market finally has come to terms with that and said oh my gosh interest rates are going up if interest rates go up people buy fewer houses pure cars\nCompanies it costs more to borrow money profits go down to re calibration is just adjusting to the new paradigm that's all so I don't think what happened last week is the beginning of a new bear market recession all that kind of stuff but you know what it does do\nIn my view it should be a wakeup call to you\nBecause did you know did you see how fast it fell\nI mean it was like what eleven hundred points and two days\nI mean that fast the market when it goes down it goes down very fast and you can lose your retirement very quickly I mean you can you if you if you're about to retire and it goes down thirty or forty percent like didn't Y. two K. or and two thousand eight and you'd write it down like that\nThe ... one thing I'd like to do is to invite you to come in to visit with one of our financial advisors I think you'll find them to be a knowledgeable friendly I'm an incompetent and they uh they want to help you with your retirement planning All right so we want to talk with you about the important decisions that you need to make\nIf you come in and visit we also want to develop for your cash flow of analysis and that I think is the most important thing that you do when it comes to retirement is is a cash flow analysis\nAnd what I

there for you we have podcasts and videos and articles all about the topics of a retirement planning\nAnd uh the website is money matters dot net okay so you can find it there so let's talk about Social Security and one of the areas are probably the most important a decision that you make when it comes to Social Security is\nWhen do you apply for benefits okay and if not sixty five anymore full retirement age for baby boomers now is sixty six sixty seven but Social Security benefits can be claimed any time between the ages of sixty two in Seventy\nSo it's crucial for you baby boomers out there to understand how claiming early benefits will reduce your benefits for life\nAnd how delaying benefits will increase it and how to coordinate spousal benefits as well and that's an area all by itself that requires a lot of studying knowledge and all that and so let me answer some questions that are that are the\nThat was looking at here so first of all why would you delay claiming your benefits and if the average person will get the same amount from Social Security regardless of when they claim\nSo the way Social Security is designed just so you know is that they're going to pay out the same dollar amount to you regardless of when you start okay so if you start at sixty two they're going to pay you a lower amount for a longer period of time\nYou start when you're sixty six they'll pay you a higher amount of money but for a shorter period of time to wait you're Seventy they'll do that even again so what happens if they actually end up paying you the same total amount\nOkay this just depending on the time zone\nSo therefore why would you want to take a ... why would you want to delay it why wouldn't you take your sixty two [noise]\nThe problem is that most people will not outlive the will not live out an average life okay so uh you have to look at your life expectancy\nSo an average life means you live to be ... eighty six currently I think is the uh is is that is the life expectancy\nSo you know I was talking to a client just the other day who whose mother is Ninety eight years old and she still drives her own car I mean she's healthy and his his brother is a eighty you know and he's healthy and fine so so in his case you know we got to look at longevity and how long it's going to be\nSo the first thing you want to look is is a is longevity\nAnd by delaying you lock up\nPermanently increased benefits for the remainder of your life and your spouse's life the second reason is if you're married as I said because then your spouse will get the higher benefits because they have the choice of whether to take their own or yours whichever is higher okay so if you delay does a higher amount that will be paid to you're surviving spouse\nSo there are reasons why you might want to delay even though the amount that you'll get in total dollars if you live to life expectancy is the same\nOkay so something for you to consider now as I mentioned do we do specialize in in in working with people who are retired are retiring soon and we look at ah we we primarily do work in the area of retirement planning so if you are over fifty
