sending eight hundred troops to the border and the president's request\nTo make sure that order is maintained and that know people are not just simply going to walk in from the caravan I that is of

to come in if they are suffering there are a lot of suffering people in the world\nHow many do folks on the left actually wants to take here and then we have disagreement day of course a but first up I Am very very pleased because\nYou know it'd be it'd be so depressing the other way up President Trump is handling this bombing situation decently\nIs he handling it brilliantly and it was unbelievable a plum and so much style and so inspiring no but it's it's it's better than adequate it's good it's fine\nI mentioned on the air yesterday it it might have been a nice thing and who knows

stood up to try to defend the mad bomber whoever this person is\nI I don't think so certainly no one on the right if anyone on the left stood up to defend him or her I think it's probably a guy a ... ISIS as ISIS defended the bomber and by the way it's not an ISIS flag it has now been carefully analyzed\nIt was the image was a parody of an ISIS flag that are invoked or Larry the cable guy\nGet her done but that was the image which was a parody from an ISIS flag showing three scantily clad women in high heels okay I mean really really [noise] [noise] okay\nIt's the president went on in opening

very prominent one on CNN or ... of people calling comparing President Trump to Hitler\nAnd know that is not appropriate and yes that is disgusting and it's inappropriate so the president is speaking well I I Know is reading from a teleprompter I Know it's prepared for it but that's what you want for goodness sake this is a time where he has to be careful of his language and he was\nBut then he added this and this was the controversial part of Israeli speech last night and I think what he said was absolutely one hundred percent correct and highly defensible listen\nMe also has a responsibility to\nA civil yeah just stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do [noise]\n[noise] okay why is it not possible\nFor people oh say on CNN or MSNBC or on CBS or any ... any of them to acknowledge that the president is right about this but instead of that we heard this from John King on CNN in response to the president's remarks\nNo one's blaming the president and the president [noise]\nAh but the president that wants to make this about him um amen to the president for what he said yesterday\nEverybody tone it down\nTo see where the fact that what the investigators do their job we can all be better\nOkay she never said it was your fault the president's words where the media all responsibility to set of civil tone and stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks\nHe didn't say it was your fault he said that if we're going to be better as a country and that is one good thing that could have come out of it it's going to have to involve all sides and everybody and uh here was I'm Caitlin Collins on CNN [noise] uh\nYeah we we will get to that at at actually arguing

that same side who doesn't really want to hurt\nThe people who are getting these devices because quite frankly none of them have detonated but that's a but they're getting their point across as look how bad this other side is so please vote for us in two weeks I Can't tell you Michael which one and that it is but I've worked cases in the past\nNot always bombs or sometimes just letters and and

some others a mess with the two thousands sixteen election or at least try to I Can't completely rule out any very simplistic and\nAlmost unsophisticated way that there is some parties such as that are involved in this whole thing just to throw a wrench in the works of our upcoming election and just confused and confound the people involved and cause a little bit of man and quite\nFrankly I'm getting it makes America look bad and they I I and that's my uh my wife is a clinical psychologist is convinced that it's the Russians who knows we'll see\nBut her her idea is that this kind of thing and not only makes Republicans look bad because everyone's assuming it's a Republican\nBut it makes our country look bad because uh if if you're having very prominent people whose safety is being threatened in this way by bombs that aren't even that well made it looks like a banana republic\nUm do you think it's likely that we will have a PRP or before the election of twelve days from

continuing to debate the outrage of President Trump calling himself a nationalist\nI mentioned do I have no problem with that none I consider myself a nationalist because what a nationalist means generally you can look at the expense of cinnamon for patriot and yes I think my country is the best in the world and I put my country above any other nation in the world I Do\nAnd you know what what's amazing here is you'll hear Caitlin Collins is twenty six years old to graduate of University of Alabama\nAnd and this may make the make you doubt the Crimson Tide hold on the national championship frankly because she's arguing with Jeffrey to bend the legal analyst for CNN and he also defends the term nationalist but it sounded like this\nI don't think he can just change the ... national I like that I just don't think that how this works and I don't think I think we're letting if I didn't do that I mean every if you think you would think you are a nationalized then that's what the definition of the word that you're using what'd you say your one\nProbably not you know I Would I mean I don't I you know I someone who believes in in the United states and the important thing I said I'm not a national now that's what the national left out please come on I mean that term has not become like Hitler I mean\nThat is why he has not use the word national at the guy a negative connotation it is not national at the Teddy Roosevelt in the Nineteen Seventy\nNine yards and then all very legitimate grounds to criticize Donald Trump for for his racism for his ignorance for his lying I just think this one is one where he has a legitimate argument\n... are at a public ... we got I got a big another\nArticle I Will say the president of cells that we're not supposed to use that word ... and so he was self is acknowledging goes all the controversies that's part of the long run that's without any word everybody's\nA beginning of the dog whistle\nWhen when did it become a negative word to call you a yourself a nationalist by the way this um brilliant a Caitlin Collins I've listen to a couple of times either said it's not the same nationalism as Teddy Roosevelt and the Nineteen forties did she say or did you say Nineteen twenties\nOr Caitlin I hate to break the news to teddy died a Theodore Roosevelt died on January six Nineteen Nineteen and uh there there's

election\nOf tell me why what is it that is exciting you and turning you on about this one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd one of the things you don't get to vote on is I'm Megan Kelly\nBecause no matter how much you want to continue watching her on NBC's Today show apparently that's not going to be possible\nAnd this particular case is one of those where I think that people who were treating this feeding her as a victim\nOr treating her some kind of horrible criminal or both wrong or what Megan Kelly displayed in her interchange on NBC about black face and Halloween blackface uh costumes\nDoes not represent racism and it doesn't represent an innocent victim mode either it just represents colossal monumental indescribable stupidity she's a lawyer she's obviously a very bright and capable TV journalist\nAnd for goodness sake given the fact that she had just a couple of years ago a huge explosion of well deserved controversy for her insistence that Santa Claus was white\nAs she should have been able to watch out on this\nBecause what all of this is based on as she was commenting in a discussion about a Halloween masquerade which looked truly awful frankly uh by Lewis Land a lesson to his one of the real housewives of New York\nAnd um [noise] she um she dressed up as Diana Ross\nAnd pose and put out pictures of it\nAnd uh and and Diana Ross and of course has very um a light skin\nAnd as soon as she was trying to approximate that wearing a big giant that for a week and it looked awful and ugly and people were offended by it of course and a Megan kill eight took it upon herself in a conversation on air\nTo defend the idea of dressing up in blackface for Halloween a very very stupid point to make but here's what it sounded like\n[laughter] it's really ... you get in trouble if you are white per say what's on or a black person if I thought why we like that\nThat was okay as long as you were dressing up as a character feels like something is offensive to them then you should say it and that's fair if they're going to be able to take\nYou've got to be able to take it okay Allen broker of course veteran a weatherman on NBC or was one of the many many many people demanding that Megan Kelly apologize and er here here's what al ... had to say\nThe fact is a while she apologized to the shields a bigger apology to folks and color around the country because\nThis is a history going back to the eating berries minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right when I'm old enough to have lived through Amos and Andy where you had white people and black and he's playing to black characters and it was to\nMagnify worse stereotypes about black and that's what the big problem is\nOkay yeah it is a big problem and by the way Megan Kelly saying when I was a kid it was okay to dress in black face she's forty seven years old\nIf she was a hundred and fifty years old maybe\nMaybe it was okay or or even if she was eight years old or Ninety but I've got to tell you I'm older than Megan Kelly I hate to admit it but I Am and uh when I was a little kid it was emphatically not okay\nIf somebody had showed up at our Halloween carnival in my elementary school in San Diego California\nUh wearing black face costume for Halloween\nI think they would have been asked to go home it it has not been okay for a long time a long time\nAnd that's something that Megan Kelly as a graduate of the University of Syracuse and Albany law school and somebody who's been a TV journalist for a long long time honestly should've known her apology on air\nWas very carefully composed and it was meant to say for career obviously and it sounded like this\nThat want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\nWe may have heard that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another\nBlack person making their faith later or a white person making errors darker to make a costume complete I defended the idea saying as long as it was a respectful and part of a Halloween costume it's old okay well I was wrong and I and [noise]\nOne of the parts of it in his chair and\nGetting them\nBy talking sometimes I listen [noise]\nAnd yesterday I learned I learned that given the history of blackface been used in our whole way\nBy waiting country\nIt is not okay for that to be part of our or otherwise\nI ... it kind of person\nThat I Do understand the value and boom has to our history chicken early on race and ethnicity past year has been so painful\nFor many people of color the country fails so divided and I have no wish to add to that pain and offense\nI Believe is is it time for more understanding war love more sensitivity and honor and I want to be part of that\nThank you for listening and for helping me listen to\n... ah well didn't work she suspended or now it looks like\nUh she uh she's not going to be on air on NBC and she's also dumped by CIA the talent agency major Hollywood talent agency the handles her so she's done by both but she may be able to collect a what's left on her sixty nine million dollar contract\nSo good luck with this I I Do feel there is something that first of all black faces disgusting and only have to do is go back and look at some even some quality old movies I I'm\nOne of the films that that comes to mind is a wonderful movie called holiday and with Bing Crosby\nAnd it it's a lovely film except it has a sequence in it with Bing Crosby in blackface singing the song Abraham about Lincoln's Birthday and pretending to be kind of an old slave and it's so cringe inducing its horribly embarrassing\n... an enormously popular a singer\nAnd just enormously popular and he of course was known for doing his shows in blackface do I believe that Bing Crosby and ... and were were horrible racist I Believe that they basically shared some of the values of their time where\nIt's almost as if there was something funny something humorous about being black because it was so different and the whole minstrel show blackface history\nIs la mental and it it is an indication of how far we've come or do I think there's any defense for Megan Kelly making ... making the case that uh uh that wearing black face on Halloween is okay no there's no real defense for it\nBut is it perhaps an overreaction to see her entire career go up in flames because of this one stupid passing comment\nWell it's happened before or with other people I again I I think it is appropriate and good that we are more respectful and more careful\nA meanwhile there is a piece over at Fox that actually is pretty amusing if you don't get routes wrong with blackface here's why it's so offensive\nAnd today Desmond Harris writes put down the black and brown face thing step away from the bronze or twelve shades darker than your skin that is if you're at all interested in not being walking symbol of racism Halloween wait what's wrong with black face\nA lot of people thankfully don't need this question to answer to many it's obvious that it's a lazy non funny costume bad idea\nWith a depressing history that is the opposite of celebratory people have even made very simple visual aids communicate this and they have one circles I should I wear black

vote\nAnd vote and the local level and the state is the best way to do that no good for you as one way or the other but\nThey're no good good for you I can I ask are you voting for a Sherrod Brown

I Believe when you say can or can't\nYou can do whatever you want it is a free country but there are consequences and right now there is a very different sense about a white person dressing up as a black person by putting black makeup on then it would be the other way around here would be one little point of advice\nI don't think anybody would mind if he just left off the skin makeup\nRight if you wanted to dress up like a Bob Marley or we had a caller\nWell apparently vessels up as Bob Marley war you wanted to dress up as a Freddy Mercury Freddy Mercury was of Persian\nAncestry and yeah it somewhat darker skin and okay so you want to mess up is from Freddie Mercury dress up as Freddie Mercury of the er of queen\nBut don't put makeup on your skin because it is that the whole process of darkening your skin usually in a comical way because if you look at some of the classic black pays performers they don't look convincingly black\nIt's not like Jimmy Kimmel Robert Downey junior in recent films and TV shows that we're\nTalking about it's like a cartoon it's a shoe polish it's it's it's black black not dark brown\nLet us go to your calls and to um Pete in shoreline Washington Pete you're on the ... that show\nWhips or Michael how are you doing there I'm doing well outstanding um I agree with you that making probably may not have been the um [noise] she was not the poster child for conservative views but um she does have the right to say what she had to say is a First Amendment right um but at\nThe ... and she has an amendment right to fire I'm ...\n[noise] yes that's right you you you you have freedom of speech but you do not have freedom of consequences and look do I think that this whole thing is a little bit of an overreaction with Megan Kelly is passing comment I Do and I feel for her with that regard but she\nShe could have been quicker on this and certainly more effective it seems to me in responding to it let's\nGo to a Brian in Schanberg Illinois Brian you're on the ... that show it's disagreement day\nAfter that happened to be a lot to you a lot and you get away with a lot of slippery language and one of the one I'm calling about today is what you your spots for a Mac he made the point that seniors are getting what they paid for which is not true they're getting a lot more than they paid for that Israel\nHas absolutely true and I don't go on average\nFor every dollar a senior put put into Medicare they're getting free dollars back\nOkay ... what I said I don't I don't believe that I had said that that seniors are just getting back what they paid for I Am saying that they are are listed in a program in part of a program to which they've contributed for many many years\nAnd they have but what you're saying oh by the way doesn't work for all seniors on every senior who gets back more than he pays for but particularly seniors who are lower income so they paid in less than the Medicare system are getting a lot more back that's true\nSo I'm not sure where our disagreement as here\nYou see no apply that you're only getting what you paid for but in reality I went to an average on average at ... right back a lot more than they paid in\nAnd on social wired and on Social Security as well which is one of the reasons and by the way do you know why they get back so much more\n[noise] because medical costs you\nKnow it's actually cause our life expectancy keeps going up ... in other words Social Security used to pay for itself because the life expectancy was sixty seven say only had to provide Social Security payments for people\nFor an average of two years and uh now our life expectancy is almost Seventy seven\nSo it's very very different and much much more difficult to make the\nUh the numbers workout but your point is fair enough uh we we all do get more back from both Social Security Medicare than we pay in but at least we pay in something and when people talk about Medicare for all they're talking about people getting payments who put in nothing\nNot anything at all let's go to a Steven born in Pennsylvania you're on them at\nThat show up or down in New Jersey Michael okay great\nUm I I'm a white male drug being average old ... Dolan czar ... am I right that [noise]\nAh the boy that's an interesting conundrum I by the way I don't think the dressing up\nIn in their clothes\nAre portraying somewhat of a different racial orientation herself orientation or anything is racist necessarily I'd be very careful of the racist word I think it's stupid and it's also probably not a good idea I don't understand why someone would want to upset anyone with a Halloween\nCostume it's my wife last Halloween [noise] but I think she would make the case is the whole point of Halloween is to bring joy not someone's fire controversy it as disagreements say on that show one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nA NBC itself but using this black race thing to get out of a contract saying like a professional

absolutely\nThere are no evidence I mean let's go back oh come on and things that go back\nTo the I mean he he's even acknowledge that he was guilty of what he was charged with and he went to prison for I think almost two years maybe more than they were\nThere were there was no evidence there but I Want to argue with you on gay but let's hear your basically your basic point is look I'm listening to hire ... people were being used\nIt is my ... my basic point by people like yourself\nHow am I using black people here out how am I I'm not responsible for fire on an alley\nOr other professional to you you do that on a daily basis\nOkay tell me how how\nYou use the energy of black people thing is not a racist issue most\nPeople agree with you and I've had that consistently but what I I you just made the accusation that I use the energy of about black people and so now misuse it what the hell are you talking about\nFor example all people in the world have black in them if you go by time study for years and years and years ago it demonstrates the origin\nSo therefore every All right I Am I I I understand in those genetic studies will show that I may well be every bit as black as a Elizabeth Warren is Cherokee but go ahead\nSo so so why couldn't somewhat express themselves in the ... you know\nPeople can do is just stupid and it's going to be counterproductive I don't think that it dressing in a Halloween costume and going in blackface means that you're a racist I Know people have done that\nAnd they're not racist but I think it's extraordinarily foolish to do it today and to try to defend it because\nThere is such a thing as history and this is a a an extremely depressing history I'm Ben Shapiro wrote a piece was was very good on this issue where he actually put up a clip from um [noise] and and old\nOn musical comedy that showed what\nThe black face really was life and looking at that reality and confronting that reality is part of our history and that seems to me
