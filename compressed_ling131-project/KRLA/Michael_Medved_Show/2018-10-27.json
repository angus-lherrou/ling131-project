I was calling was I think that that lady was asking about proposition twelve and\nThink comment you made about big organizations well actually they've got the ASPCA which is great H. S. U. S. is for it and pay to the game so I'm I'm going with what I Want to happen to the ... of animals\nYou know I I equate that with an organization says\nThey don't test on animals for ... you know how the company and they say they don't test Atlanta but they fight you know some of their in Korea\nBut let me explain let me explain something to you having trained as a police officer with the ASPCA in New York City and some of the worst areas in in in the country\nHaving done work with the humane society haven't been one of the first recipients of the genesis what I'm also I got to be honest to God yes let me let me ... I Am not a big big big big fan\nOf a lot of the things these large I Will they do a lot of great work and I would be the last one to say that they don't\nHowever however that being said\nBefore I make any decisions on anything inhumane world\nI Do not take the recommendations from the big organizations I Do the research myself because\nIf you understand that a lot of large organizations the good that they do are also involved with tremendous fundraising where that money is coming from where those funds are coming from what those fun to use for that is important to me to I don't necessarily buy if ... says do this or that humane society says do this on\nThe ASPCA says did this I've been involved in this industry way way way too long to form an opinion based on what someone else is telling me or recommending to me I've been doing my own reading on on twelve and and I\nI'm I'm understanding it a little bit more about how these laws were passed years ago and just not follow some still having some trouble I have to Tuesday to make up my mind but the bottom line is make up your own mind by doing your own research\nDon't necessarily look at what you're watching on TV or or what the humane society what the ASPCA or Peter is saying good organizations in what they do in many cases however\nMany times many times I've found that making my own decision was the right decision rather than focusing on the decision that someone may for me\nSo great but a lot of people don't even read the electric chair that they\nGet and nothing in the world's going to make them read it and you know what the only ones who suffer the animals people need to read I spent time with the news I spent hours with the nice going over the different types of things that we have to vote on Tuesday\nAnd I want to make sure I understand them before I go to the ballot box and put my information in there so it's something that people have to research and set up to more research but anyway\nThe big organization they do some great work however I have a lot of problems with some of the big organizations I have a problem with organizations that have millions and millions and millions of dollars when he was one dog a one catch them suffering I have a problem\nWith that\nWell I Do volunteer at my local animal shelter so um\nI Love\nHow they have to handle\nPeople coming in and just dumping the adults they don't want\nAny habit you know what you know what with millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars that could be a lot more education going into the schools a lot more education going to children a lot more education going all around\nAbout the proper care to be should be a lot more ... and neuter in Spanish communities um and and it should be a lot more things going on that are not being done and I want to know why they're not being done nothing against these organizations other than the fact that they could be doing more my own organization my we do nothing hugs and kisses animal fun you know how much money we have in the bank\nNone exactly right\nExactly right because as soon as a dollar comes in two dollars goes out because if I see a dog space suffering I'm not going to put it on TV and say this dog is suffering I Want to save that dog from suffering right then and there that's what it's all about and it was a great call making decisions based on your own opinion is not on someone else's what kind of pet\nDo you have a death Patricia\nI have a an eighth valley\nYou start to kind of put you on hold and I am going to send you you know what I'm going to send you a some a hugs and kisses for your cat and I appreciate the phone call\nI Know I get a little sheet or when I talk about that a lot of people are big supporters the big on his nation as I say they do incredible work they do a lot of work and had broken up some some uh fighting but I had a a big discussion with the ex\nHead of the humane society the United states over the Michael Vick\nSame many many years ago and when I asked him a question or you can answer that question and kind of laughed it off I decided well he's no longer there so many things have changed anyway the phone number here eight six six eight Seventy Carol eight eight six six eight seven zero fifty seven fifty to hey rough in Los Angeles welcome to the pet show\nAfternoon or how you doing today route or\nI'm doing great I'm I'm calling I adopted a pit bull a about a little less than two months ago and um [noise] the problem I'm having with her she's showing a correction toward other animals um what I\nMeant the uh the foster people that are have the dog they told me that she lived with the Welsh Corgi and three cats and a cheat on children got along with them\nAnd I'm I'm coming to find out now that are within two months that I have ever she she seems to have aggression toward all other dog\nLet me ask you a question that aggression taking place when you walk around however on a leash exactly\nLet me go over a couple of things that you first of all as you said she wasn't a foster home and bless foster homes they do amazing work however I listen to me carefully\nThe dog was in a force to home they love the dog they fed the dark but it wasn't necessarily that twenty four seven dogs I'm sure that we're fostering other animals\nNow this dog that probably is never known the amount of love the amount of attention the amount of stuff that she's getting from you is now becoming very protective and very possessive over you there for what she sees another animal she she perceives it more\nAs a challenge so you need to do is when you start taking them for a walk you take her outside and she sees another dog and she reacts than an assertive aggressive way don't you overreact when I Know sometimes you anticipate the fact that she's going to do this or do that\nDon't overreact to just continue walking\nAnd don't move follow through on some good basic training so when she is reacting in a bad way once you get past the situation you can use some of your basic commands in a positive way to gain good control over the dog but right now the more attention you spend in a negative way trying to correct or the more aggressive she's going to become that makes sense to you they're off\nHis um another thing a in a vehicle like if I'm taking her somewhere she will see smaller dogs or other dogs and just start going crazy in the vehicle\nDon't remember remember she's gone from place or God Knows how many home she had before you got her from a shelter to force knows so she associates the car with something negative what I Want you to do is find an item that the\nDog what's your dog's name find an\nItem that brie absolutely loves I Want you to spend every day for five minutes not going anywhere sitting in the car in the driveway I Want you to also find a close friend of yours that she gets along well what\nHappened on one side of the car have the dog walking one site out the other side let the cars started associating something positive without being taken to somewhere else little by little she will come around\nI promise okay I'll give it all\nHey listen let me tell you there I have rehabilitated more picked both in probably any other person in the country okay and I got to tell you they always come around the sweetest most lovable dogs just some sometimes they belong to jerks okay not in your case route but in some cases what am I Do I'm going to put you on hold I'm going to send you a copy of how to get your dog to do what you want\nI Want you to focus on the chapters on building the or the self confidence and also the basic training and little by little she will come around but you have to remember that people are going to react differently to her because of the reputation that is so unwarranted that pit bulls have\nHad the phone number here eight six six eight Seventy K O L A great time to give me a car eight six six eight seven zero\nFifty seven fifty some great cause the data are going to get you never want to get to use air when it gets you eight six six eight Seventy cake or LA but right

honestly between you and me this the first time hearing of it so I Need to do a little bit more research on my own to before I have to say really\nNight on day at the polls no but again I I thought that that that does\nNot let me tell you let me tell you what I Do on Facebook okay\nWould I Do is I don't use Facebook to get my knowledge I use Facebook to give some knowledge sometimes what I Will do is I have contacts I've done some work with Tufts University Cornell I Will contact the top back to the top of your I talked to university and I will find out exactly what their feelings are because very often you get one report from one ... veterinary school\nAnd another report conflicting so I don't know I don't even know how to ask you questions I don't know enough about it and let me do some research\nThat we're getting what kinda yet let me read well because people that live there but\nI had a dog a lot more like a lot of like mind golden retriever ... from the outlying part well

platelets in we inject those right then on the spot\nThere's no waiting period so basically the walk in you have a quick procedure and you walk out and go about your business so it's a lot different than surgery it's the opposite\nWhat we do instead of cutting out to issue is we re grow to issue we stimulate new to shoot to grow I Do know that most orthopedic surgeons in neurosurgeons do not

in pain and pain give us a call and you get Dr Dallas latest stuck stem cells and platelets therapy for free\nAnd remember we are here Saturday it's at ten am handout one PM\nAnd a website you can see video sent the treatments being performed by Dr Daryl and email him tied to lay off as every page is WWW dot LA stem cells dot com that's LA stands south dot com lots of research there and even in the new buck\nThought that that stuff so\nYou have a question standing by at\nAll do I have questions [laughter] um this one is about daughter's a seal ... okay so what happens\nIf you have a torn a seal will this procedure work I'm just asking because my daughter played competitive soccer and tore her ACL she had surgery to repair her ... and her a seal she has yet to return to sports\nI was against the surgery and wanted to try other alternatives but they were denied\nWhat can you tell me\nWell I'm not sure what that means they were denied a means they that this person wanted to do something else but the insurance didn't pay for it I'm not real clear um let me see I emailed this person back I haven't heard back from them yet to see what actually took place [noise]\nBut any rate [noise] most people that have an ACL rupture that means the anterior ... ligament which holds the ... or the league from slipping forward on the femur or the thigh bone\nMost people that have that problem if you want to call it a problem don't have a problem\nBecause the knees especially of athletes are very strong and have a lot of muscle around there and other ligaments that hold the need together\nSo it's sort of I'll use a pun a knee jerk reaction to get the surgery done because an MRI shows a rupture memorize can be wrong they're overly sensitive and they show things that are not real\nSometimes surgeons go into repairing ACL and they go oh my God the seal is there the more I was wrong\nSo this is another one of those the horses are out of the barn how do you close the barn door and keep the horses and it's too late she already had a surgery repairs are miniscule switch usually does not have to be repaired and a repair it or a seal which usually doesn't have to be repaired [noise]\nSo what would I have done I Would have taken a look with my ultrasound inside the knee if there was some fluid and there I Would have taken it out which helps get rid of pain immediately unleaded heal up\nSo I don't know what to tell this person at this point I Need to examine that knee and see what is going on but we do find that regenerative medicine helps most of these cases\nAnd I've used it on my daughter's knees I have twins Seventeen year olds who are soccer players with good success and um\nI've used it on some of their friends who have had quote a seal ruptures and healed them also now will be a seal actually come back together I don't know the reason I don't trust the MRI's to tell me anyway\nSo I Hope that makes sense to all you folks listening be very careful about doing the surgery you do not need to do\n[noise] excellent ... one eight six six eight seven zero five seven five too and we're going to attack to David in Los Angeles\nDavid Dr Marc Darrow I understand that you have low back pain is that true\n[noise] I got a couple of different issues yeah well I got low low back pain but hey I'm I've got basically all the wind is that's a\nCollapsed or well gene doctor put in terms of collapsing degenerative Scalia else is just a basic I don't pay for it and I do stretching stretching\nA good I was doing your version of cable but I just had a heart issue you know Don ... told me not to do it right now to the table I was curious I Try to stay with you but I went to another doctor and I had a ... cell\nI'm ... I think there were a clone a\nDamn the Arctic cells\nSome ally until\nI'm white for plus or something ah\nTurns out that set us yeah you know\nRight and I had a shot and I said the disc areas but they they shot it around that area towards the spine but I'm sizes fine okay you know ever felt they grow there is\nAll you had an dead you had dead cells put in your back okay what do you do in order to to put them into a bottle and sell them they have to be cleaned up and dried out and killed and then reconstituted with some liquid so they can be injected I don't do that\nHow you live cells we called atomic is telling us means that comes from your body there live\nThey duplicate and they're very healing cells I Can't vouch for the stuff you had done in one way or another other than to tell you these companies send it to me all the time there and try it out on my body to when I have an injury and I've never had any success with it [noise]\nSo well as just saying it's\nNot it's not the same thing\nRight right so my question is what I think there were totaled eleven struck grass\nIssue in the ... with the treatment he injected directly I came in for the treatment basically be shooting in the district and they actually won their so collapse it's some of them were\nClose to build on well not quite low number 'cause I mean what would it be able to actually\nRebuild or improve the situation\nLet me ask you a question if I can get rid of your pain than you are full function do you care what happened [noise]\nI guess as long as it doesn't no yeah\nNo I you know you don't care what happened there are studies that show injecting the ligaments can reform the disks but I don't think it's relevant\nBut I think what's relevant is defined where your pain is coming from animal and heels at area most of these things in the neck and back come from what we call an emphasis up to see the emphasis is we're ligaments her tendons or muscle attached to bone\nAnd when it rained I assume I'm by the sound of your voice you're old enough to have had a sprained ankle and your life\nAll that number yeah I'm sixty five\nYeah you've had a number of times and so have I and it hurts like heck fries that mean you need to have a surgery\nReally noticed it does it yeah\nSo we were very careful I mean I'm hoping that all you have is a sprained ankle and you're back home\nAnd that's what most people have and unfortunately too many people get surgery when they shouldn't have had to get surgery for a sprained ankle [noise]\nLose its time more money [noise] you you're more\n\nMoney than we do the same room among the\nWe are in the honey guys are funny\nIs that old man you are if you have done is wrong well hello hello Laurie lion money matters and everything and anything in the world a personal finances\nWe talk about investment\nStrategies retirement planning Social Security estate planning income taxes\nYou name it we talk about it and we try to have more fun than a human being should be allowed to have when talking about all of this boring financial stuff\nAnd this week we have a lot of boring financial stuff to talk about because man has it been eventful on the markets and we have so much to talk about with you [noise] um but before we go one step further let me introduce myself I have been a sort of I Am kinda right the host of money matters with Ken ...\n[noise] that you had\nBeen a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marble is wonderful and very exciting years [noise]\n\nI Do feel good and all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the very same ideas that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients and as a farm are for money matters we specialize in retirement planning so we work primarily with people that are over the age of fifty who are retired retiring soon\nAnd that we currently work with over for eight thousand four hundred beautiful wonderful families we are so blessed\nAnd all the ideas that we talk about this show these are the same idea that we talk about with them every day of the week when we visit\nSunny over with you uh what what we're going to talk about on this our weekly excursion into the land the personal finances so first of all\nIf you haven't noticed the stock market the Dow the S. and P. have been on a decidedly downward path shall I say I'm over the last what six weeks now\nAnd uh so many of you who have been lifted a show for many many years now may be wondering if it is time to get out of the stock market a BS in pay and other things\nAnd so I've been getting a question a lot and it reminds me right now of two thousand seven and so as you guys may remember for those of you who've listen to the show for low those many years or who have been getting my weekly a market alert email\nYou know the I in two thousand seven in November we uh we said it was time to sell it to get out of the stock market and and just stay out until June of two thousand nine when our by came\nAnd so those of you follow the advice route of the stock market during the credit crisis during the stock market crash of overweight\nAnd that there are some similarities right now to two thousand seven that I Want to share with you because it is looking like there's a there's a possibility that it may be time to sell so I Want to talk about that with you\nKnow also this week we're going to continue or in our a journey down the Eighteen important risks that you face during your retirement and we are a number eight this week and of course number eight is very timely since it's called market risk [laughter]\nI didn't plan that ahead but boy is it highly right I'm I'm kind of going in order\nAnd that number eight is market risk so what that means is\nThat when you are a retired person or you are about to retire um that is one of the biggest risks that you face in terms of your investment is that you get hit by a big downdraft in your investments and now you don't have as much as you add ones hatch so\nAre we going to talk about number eight market risk now also\nSince we are a a firm that specializes in retirement planning a one of the big topics that we talk about with clients are pretty much I Would say every time we visited seems like\nUm it's Social Security so we're going to have some ... we had to have some questions or that or I Want to share with you and of course the answers to those questions about Social Security that I think might be on your mind so we're going to have the social ... does security ... now also\nIn view of our philosophy so because we work with people who are mostly retired retiring soon our philosophy of how to manage your money is preservation of principle comes first okay we want to grow your money certainly we want to give you the income all those things are important but first and foremost we want to make sure\nThat we protect your principal because for you to be able to go out and enjoy the all the things that you want in your retirement if you get hit by a big bad bear and it takes down twenty thirty or fifty percent of your money you know that's going to change a lot for you so I'm going to ask you the question the average bear market and this is according to Ned Davis research going back\nTo the great depression the average bear market\nIs a loss of thirty seven percent okay so it's an average now two thousand and eight the S. and P. went down to fifty seven percent and Y. two K. it went down forty nine percent so those were bigger than average so but let's just go with the average thirty seven percent\nSo I'm gonna ask you a question which I'll answer later on in the show but I kind of leave it with you a and the question is if you if you had to of course you don't want to but if you had to\nWould you prefer to lose thirty seven percent of your money at age sixty\nFour at age Seventy five\nWhich one do you think would be better age sixty or Seventy five\nAnd a if you answer like most people do you got it wrong [laughter] so so we'll talk about that now you know what jak most others would actually stopped there that's a ... the show that is chock full of great in the right and that's how most shells would just stop there but on the show do we only go where people expect us to\nOf course we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before and therefore at about ten till\nWe're going to have our state tip of the week\nAnd normally that's you know that's part of the show we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but this week we're going to talk about how to educate your greedy and washed undeserving heirs and so we're going to talk about paying for college and not having to pay a gift\nTax okay because the IRS [noise]\nYeah those guys they wanted tax\nGifts and college in most cases is more is is is expensive\nAnd you don't want to have to pay a gift tax so I Want to dive into everything but I Want to have a quick thing that I Want to share with you um money matters and and my family we are a a we think the boys and Girls Club this one is a charity that ah you know really helps young people to it to become\nSolid citizens go to college all those kinds of things contribute to society and a positive way have a better life and so we are a benefactors of that and over the last\nSix years are the boys and girls clubs we've we've sponsored a program that's called a sponsor a child [laughter] and uh so we want to raise money for that and last weekend we had the gala at a ... in in Plano in North Dallas and uh\nWe raise over three hundred thousand dollars in the sponsor a child which was really phenomenal and now six years of doing that we've raised over two and a half million dollars for the boys and girls clubs\n[noise] and uh it is is\nIt is really really something it's amazing how\nYou know if you put some energy into something good things can happen well let's talk about two thousand seven um you know are we we have as I mentioned they fell strategy but we don't believe that by and hold is enough that you should also have a cell strategy and is because the people that we work with primarily are you know wanting that they work their entire life\nYou've you've saved and everything and now you're retired and you're living on that money and you can't you know you got to preserve it\nAnd so our philosophy is is mostly defensive okay we want to preserve that we have to be able to grow it in the future\nAnd so you know with our by holding cells of philosophy we have certain criteria that says it's time to get out of the stock market and as I record this we haven't reached that yet so don't don't don't panic yet uh but this is very reminiscent to me of two thousand seven\nAnd what I mean by that is that you know one of the things that that kind of happens is that uh I guess I'm I'm human and I want to be a hundred percent accurate whenever we do something\nAnd so what happens is that you know when you get close to yourself signal where you're about to pull the trigger and say okay we're going to get out of the stock market you want to be right you know you don't like being wrong obviously\nA and if you're wrong you know we're in for example in two thousand Fifteen and two thousand eleven our strategy said to sell both of those were very very near to bury markets but they actually missed it by a little bit and where and\nAnd so technically those were you know bad calls if you will but if we had to do it again we would you know the market went down Nineteen percent and do that in eleven so that's not too bad but the U.S and pay 'em\nBut be that as it may\nThose two which we call false alarms I was very convicted that that

work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states we are blessed we are honored\nAnd in two thousand Fifteen Forbes named our financial advisor refer money matters one of the top

website it as money matters dot net money matters dot net and when you're there we have a everything we can think of to put on the website to help you to plan your retirement okay so go their mind about Social Security estate planning all that kind of stuff\nWell this is the second to the show where I normally talk about Social Security so let's\nDo that so here's a question uh can you enroll in Medicare at sixty five refrain from claiming Social Security until Seventy and still\nReceive delayed credits meaning you know if you wait till you're Seventy\nWhat happens is is that the amount of your benefit goes up each year that you wait by about eight percent\nSo if you're sixty six you wait till Seventy the benefit you're going to receive from Social Security of journals for years goes up about thirty two percent which is a pretty good increase so the question is if I enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nBut I don't collect so screwed I wait till I'm Seventy well I still get those eight percent delayed credits the answer is yes okay so you can take Medicare without Social Security but not the other way around okay if you file for Social Security you must enroll in Medicare part a All right\nSo a second question\n[noise] um this one is a a a a person who has never applied for Social Security and his eighty years old\nAnd he apply for retroactive benefits okay so you never applied you waited fiction escape twenty Fifteen Years okay so if you apply now will his benefit including adjustment to make up for the last benefits\nAnd the answer is that uh the you can get six months of retroactive benefits but that's all okay so he's not going to be able to go back and get fourteen years' worth but he can get six six six months' worth\nAnd it might come to it could be ten thousand dollars or more you know if you think about six months at age eighty or with all the delay credits that went to late Seventy\nUm one more question we have time for yeah okay so can apply is kind of person born in Nineteen fifty to repay his Social Security benefits to rent a receipt to date and then re file to obtain a higher current pay out\nOkay so it's my understanding that uh I can do so but I went to the local Social Security office and they said they didn't even understand my question [laughter]\nThat's good so here's the answer if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can withdraw your application to repay your benefits and re file okay so there's no need to go down and asked the local Social Security administration worker okay you just file ss day form five Twenty one\nSo so if you're if you're if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can get you can repay what they've paid you and then re filed later All right\nSo uh that's funny I I asked them and they didn't even understand the question\nAnd whatever you have this talk with Tom I Am too [noise] so um as I mentioned uh we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning so all the things
