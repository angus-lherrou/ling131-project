and a bunch of other stories\nAbout how men are trying to obliterate women\nReally uh we will we will get to that on the Michael ... show also talked to Bobby Jindal one of my favorite commentators and one of my favorite former politicians are Bobby Jindal former governor of Louisiana former star of the Republican House of representatives\nAbout why beyond this election we desperately need a sane Democratic Party we do I even assuming Republicans managed to hold the house and hold the Senate it doesn't do any good for the country when the other side is just completely off the rails\nAnd and bizarre we will get to that with Governor Jindal and uh I also want to speak to you about the proposition of revolution and the civil war their voices on the left and on the right\nTo say we're in the midst of the civil war or a cold civil war and may not be actual bloodshed but when you have people ranging from Carl Bernstein to on the left\nAnd Thomas Friedman of New York times on the left\nTo people like Victor Davis Hanson on the right and they're all saying yeah civil war is here we're on the verge of fighting here is uh what Carl Bernstein had to say on CNN about why he believes were in the midst of a civil war listen\nBut I think one thing we need to understand is the larger context of all of this and that is\nThat we are in a cold civil war in this country\nA when these two events are both lower investigation and the Kavanaugh nomination are almost a the the Gettysburg and and teach the absolutely essential battles of this cold civil war in both the Democrats\nAnd Republicans unfortunately uh own understand that and are exploiting\nA instead of having two parties committed to finding out the truth in these two important matters we are now into serious tribalism ear\nOkay Gettysburg and anti them\nGettysburg over the three day battle there were over fifty thousand casualties I mean fifty thousand a Antietam bloodiest single day in American history there were twenty five thousand casualties in a single days battle and by the way both of those battles\nFor people who know your civil war history and I know a bunch of you to do both of those battles resulted\nIn the union successfully turning back\nAnd invasion by Robert The late\nRobert de Leon the south in the army of northern Virginia had invaded uh Maryland and we're headed toward Philadelphia and maybe Washington DC\nIn the Eighteen sixty two in September of Eighteen sixty two when anti them occurred the union stopped them ... by the way a that's part of the story in my book the American miracle and the battle of Gettysburg July of Eighteen sixty three\nAre just less than a year later another invasion of the north this time of Pennsylvania by Robert Daly in the army of northern Virginia and again the confederates were turned back okay here's my question\nIn today's civil war if you think we're in the midst of one\nWho's invading who wears the invasion occurring because see that's what you had to do it Gettysburg and emptied them you have to turn back the other side\nThey were attacking your territory where is that happening in the United states right now one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number ... nutty stuff to me\nAnd and again it it it represents both sides I'm very glad that want to pose this to our to our website over at National Review\nThere is a a very useful piece by Jake cost who explains why Alexander Hamilton could be the best source of\nWhy we are not in the midst of some kind of civil war and now look\nOne of the points with Victor Davis Hanson makes and and a V. D. H. who is a a fellow at the Hoover Institution and Stanford and who have been privileged to me and I'm very glad he's been a guest on this show he's a brilliant historian\nAnd the one pulling that he makes that I think is worth considering\nIs that the reason he believes we are headed toward real civil war in this country is because unlike previous eras in which there were very very grave divides in the United states I just saw this new movie called first man\nWhich uh with rock star break Tomlin we went out and and saw that film last night and it's a terrific film about what it will be reviewing the coming up but\nThe the the point\nAbout that era\nOf the Nineteen sixties and all of a terrible divisions that that wrapped the country and there was actual bloodshed and riots and destruction and all of that\nBut it wasn't geographical it wasn't so clearly delineated you know there was one of the things that the civil war people say is that California should secede\nUp by the way they're a ton of people who don't live in California who would say bravo go for it or send California whether it's thirty eight million people and uh let them go elsewhere by the way\nHere's an interesting thing and I would just we're just having this discussion over the weekend that at our Sabbath table which is\nThat if you look at the numbers without California not only does Trump when a genuine electoral college landslide but Trump would actually won the popular vote by over a million and a half\nHillary's three million vote margin\nWas provided entirely by California and it's just\nCalifornia's different from the rest of the country didn't used to be it is now a and and by the way it part of the idea of ... different states seceding Massachusetts in New York maybe two and the Connecticut not yet but uh okay so you have a non contiguous country if they can all be independent countries\nThere's a new revival up in Canada because of the true though administration of people calling for Quebec to be a separate country so why not\nLook I'm not serious about that and for the same reasons that Alexander Hamilton would argue in federal is number Lebanon number twelve\nHamilton says we are by nature one country because we're financially integrated with one another we're making money on one another we are not separated\nOr in a meaningful way we're we're going to make war on one another because we're all financially ... we we had a story like that yesterday\nWhere there was a bar here in Seattle ... cheese and a group of college Republicans over at the University of Washington had said they wanted to celebrate the victory for Brett Kavanaugh by staging of beers with Brett party at this uh at this particular bar\nAnd the bar responded to those plans by posting something on their website saying we try to be totally non political we don't want to be involved in politics at all are therefore are the people who want to stage eight beers with Brett or for Brett party or not really welcome okay\nThere was talk that they were going to sue the bar 'cause you can't discriminate in the city of Seattle based upon political point of view\nAnd a cooler heads prevail then instead of suing they just went in and had their celebration they weren't thrown out their money was still good or they didn't insist on everybody putting on a ... hat they didn't insist upon a heck\nDuring are bothering the other clients they had their party and maybe there are some other people who are literally crying in their beer about Kavanaugh's confirmation is fine but meanwhile the reason she'll she did not make a federal case over\nThis is because they wanted to make some money that's a very good motivation now you could ask and this is a very profound question so what happened with the civil war\nWhy was it that these cells in the north were financially integrated the answers they weren't that financially integrated the cells had a completely different economic system in the south\nNearly half the labor force was slaves\nAnd everything in the south in terms of criminal law in terms of religion in terms of politics in terms of the economy was based on defending the institution of slavery\nAnd that was the brutal reality it was profoundly different in a way that California I'm Sorry is not that different from Texas\nIf you disagree and you think we are in the midst of a civil war well I'll I'll give you some citations from people agree with you and we can talk about it they're also one of the characters who the civil war it was rather against brother pull right now there's a congressional race [noise]\nWhereas brother against brother and sister [noise] will tell you about it and more coming up on them that that show one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nFor that kind of like your show the power to make it look out for a spy our\nOkay and you'll give me can you give me one indication I understand what you're trying to say Melvin I Do but let me ask you this can you think of one\nLaw that either a justice Kavanaugh is going to shore up for a law that he's going to strike down where he's going to act to keep power concentrated for white males which which laws are you most concerned about their\nOut what I learned a lot it starts with a fair at All right\nWell that's that's the that's the fourteenth amendment to the constitution and that's where the fourteenth amendment the constitution\nGuarantees every citizen regardless of color or national origin regard them equal protection of the law right and go ahead\n... quit now we're looking at how we get it on our watch\nYeah but when you know what ... what laws do you think right now concentrate power in the hands of white males can you name one because that would be unconstitutional\nRegarding equal pay what what was right\nThat that's been in the law since Nineteen sixty three right but that's not being put me in a lot of\nCourse it is of course it as if I Know I look Melvin if I dared to uh offer a different salary for someone based on his or gender alone\nOr I Would be struck with a lawsuit so fast and they have lawsuits like this all the time but the the point is and this doesn't mean that there are cases where sometimes people are opposed to hiring men by the way\nThere are cases where people are a whole post hiring men and some weather imposed hiring women but the idea that that this gender gap in terms of pay is because of discrimination it has been answered so many times let me suggest you go to the website of Christina hot summers\nAre a woman by the way who's written about this so persuasively and and the idea that right now this is a problem for our world will get into that a little bit more close to two thirds of all graduates of four year colleges and universities in America are female and uh I suspect\nSo that by the time my granddaughter is Twenty one right which is a little while but by that time women will be earning more than men on average\nWe'll be right back on the ... civil war or not\nMichael ...\nIs it am eight Seventy the answer is stuck in traffic\nStill second plenty of time trying

spectacular divide with a political family out in Arizona\nOr we'll get to that and just a moment but um in in National Review Victor Davis Hanson a writes how when and why has the United states now arrived at the brink of a veritable civil war\nAlmost every political\nCultural and social institution universities the public schools the NFL the Oscars the Tonys the Grammys late night TV public restaurants coffee shops movies TV stand up comedy\nHas been not just politicized but also weaponized Donald Trump's election was not so much a catalyst for the divide as a manifestation an amplification of the existing schism\nWe are now nearing the point comparable Eighteen sixty and perhaps past eight Nineteen sixty eight left right factional ism is increasingly fueled by geography always histories force multiplier of civil strife\nRed and blue states ensure that low Cal magnifies differences that were mostly manageable during the administration's Ford Carter Reagan the bushes and Clinton\nA and again uh they they were going to have a ballot initiative on the ballot in California dividing that\nState into three different states which would be the\nWorst nightmare than than before even because then you have three California's not just one okay\nUm but the fact is the the initiative didn't\nQualify for the ballot was ruled off the ballot by the courts in California at seriously it is very very small numbers of people who actually in California wants to secede even with Trump is president\nEight six six nine five four three three eight eight on this issue of a civil war going on\nOne of the things that people\nSaid about the civil war and it was literally true and it was brother against brother Mary Lincoln the first lady of the land wife of Abraham Lincoln had a brother who was in the Confederate Army\nIt was a real division she was from Kentucky\nAnd ah in Kentucky particularly that that was a ... to Kentucky did not officially leaves the union\nBut there were a lot of Kentucky Confederate who personally did in any event that idea of family division has been highlighted in this crazy situation involving Congressman Paul ghosts are of Arizona\nAnd his opponent whose name as Brill\nI just took out an ad that features six ... six of congressman go SARS nine siblings he comes from a big family\nAnd the six siblings basically attack their brother and not because he's a bad guy not because he cheated them not because it was a person of low morality but because he is an outspoken conservative here's the ad\nA that was posted by congressman goes our own it\nPuzzles or the congressman isn't doing anything to help rural America paused absolutely not working for his district if they care about health care they care about their children's health care they would hold them to account if they care about jobs they hold him to account\nActually cared about people in rural Arizona\nA back seat they fighting for our security from better access to health care I better he that he would be searching what is the most and fight for water policy\nThe environment of Arizona's sustain itself\nAnd be successful thanks has not listening to you and he doesn't

are said or done but he's a good solid guy and he's a he's a strong conservative\nAnd and really a again that I think they could do it actually special reality TV show Thanksgiving after do SARS and here they are who are these six brothers and sisters who take it upon themselves and they they didn't get paid for it\nAmazing let's\nGo to Don in Columbus ohio Don you're on the Michael Mann that

I'll tell you why\nIt's two words as Clarence Thomas when what Clarence Thomas was charged with a Nineteen Ninety One was more serious frankly because he was charged not for when he was a teenager in

Schumer\nWe'll try to get to that I'm not sure it means that much the markets had been much higher we're still much higher than we were\nAll even a few months ago\nBut I'm surely surely something is going on that might be worth our attention\nBut something else that is going on\nA there's very much worth our attention is the forthcoming mid term elections where we elect all for him to thirty five members\nOf the house of representatives and I believe we're electing thirty five new U.S senators because there are a couple of special elections there in the mix and uh\nHow's it going to go well it's a toss up and it's close\nBut there is some very very sound advice it seems to me that is given to Democrats by a leading Republican and somebody who is one of his own house elections by huge margins one two terms also by huge margins as the governor of Louisiana\nHis name is Bobby Jindal and he wrote a terrific piece that appeared in the wall Street Journal under the headline Democrats try some self restraint governor Jindal thanks very much for joining us again are always great to talk to\nMichael thank you for having me back on your show it all ready to talk to you and your audience as well\nI appreciate it one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number ... you say make so much sense in other words just to give people a flavor of what you're saying\nYou were Democrats Democrats you write can support gay marriage without forcing small business owners to violate their religious beliefs and participate in the wedding ceremonies\nThey can defend abortion without opposing the sorts of restrictions common in Europe including waiting periods and bans on midterm abortions they can fight global warming without making obsolete many Americans livelihoods in lifestyle\nIf all of that as possible\nYou have been in this place for many many years\n... one of the promos that ... that comes on for a while there during your show in Houston they talk about war it's all about we're in a war and so if ... if you listen to talk radio call so we're talking about how the war we're having with the ...\nI I think as as you know I I agree with you that does happen and I think it's unfortunate and I don't think you will hear that rhetoric on this show because I think it's wrong I don't think this is a war I and I'll tell you why David and I've said this many times of the goal of a war is to destroy the enemy\nTo kill him basically and uh the the goal of politics is to persuade people\nHey Michael is your friends who it is so don't know I'm a yeah OK you typically don't say it but if you're ... ... people who you are\nOkay you know what I you probably have some friends who have some strange ideas to write\nA strange [laughter] wait a minute wait a minute what about Beto O'Rourke\nNot my friend I I'll probably vote for him but he's not a friend of mine\nOkay we'll do vote for him a because again if you do that you're encouraging this leftward drift of the Democratic party David ... I'd like to sit down I imagine that you and I would find a lot that we would agree on and by the way I Do agree with your basic point that's why I went to your call first\nIs because I think it is true that this tendency also exists on the Republican side\nBut I'll tell you what was very refreshing to me and I think it's one of the most important speeches in recent years when Susan Collins spoke on the Senate floor\nEvery word she said\nAbout a justice capital was measured it was balanced it was persuasive it was\nNone of this rhetoric is the other side is all wrong and we're All right and this is the basic point because even if you leave out the independent voters the people who vote regularly and they go back and forth between Republicans and Democrats\nThe biggest group of prospective voters in America the people who don't vote an aunt who aren't interested the people who represent this ah Daniel Tosh uh who are dumb as blank and move don't vote and don't pay attention\nTo try to get people to pay attention it it doesn't work to say that we're on the verge of Armageddon and and we're all getting ready to kill\nEach other [noise] what it actually works better it seems to me saying well we have some good ideas about how we can change things for the better and in the midst of a big down day on Wall street today in a horrible horrible hurricane about the strike the panhandle in Florida\nMaybe we can remember that we all have bigger obstacles enemies than [noise]\n\nGet breaking news on AM eight Seventy the answer to Tom\nPreference [noise]\nDon't tend to lay on the one time ... was crawling from stadium way to six street where a crash has been blocking the right hand lane and they're now may be a stone vehicle there as well in a line\nNearby on the one on one going cell phone traffic of slam from Santa Monica boulevard to about union avenue to five self is heavy from Los ... boulevard to stadium why\nAnd in the industry areas of sixty west of fair way drive looks like a crash has apparently clear but traffic is just crawling and fought saw on the sixty west bound and fifty seven south behind that I'm Still burger AM eight Seventy the answer\n[noise] they came to live with winds of one hundred fifty five miles an hour category more than one hundred fifty six gusts recorded one hundred\nSeventy five miles an hour it's the strongest earthquake or strongest a storm to hit the Florida Panhandle or the U.S coast it more than ... years have electrical a mayor Ben Johnson is concerned about residence after Michael because of Michael because the city does not have emergency shelters\nPrior to a category for people started to get serious packed with open to regularly at that rate would still probably heard about quarter but people started to ride it out but I'm concerned about those\nYeah apple logical is just about forty miles from Mexico beach where the eye of the category for storm made landfall that is the strongest storm to hit in one hundred fifty years\n[noise] California state controller Betty ... says her office is holding nearly seven hundred and Seventy million dollars in unclean cash the and Clinton Cash includes forgotten bank accounts and cast checks dock safe deposit box contents and insurance policies\nYou can search the controllers database at the Web site claiming dot C.

a ... do you think the western civilization is perfect right now\nI'd prefer west or civil\nI prefer to but do you think it's\nPerhaps not perfect you know\nI wouldn't know so we want western civilization to change and improve the question is do you want us to change or improve or a discarded altogether the number of people who want to discard western civilization altogether that number is very small it's certainly very small among people who run for office or who are in politics in other words if you were to point out on\nInsulting to questions there was another one that depicted three

con topped which is um the Russian equivalent of Facebook and\nThis is just one of those things where when people talking about American civil war the reason they are so sensitive about anything that has anti Christian stuff is because the Russian Orthodox church has become totally involved with a boot and regime and they're very intertwined unfortunately in rush which is a bad thing for the church\nAnd is just one of the other multiple\nCorruptions of or the ... regime they have been a they're currently prosecuting four hundred and eleven criminal cases against Internet users in Russia

Party or white supremacists or area nations or any of those people however\nThe same principle obtains ... completely unfair and unjustified\nFor people to regularly tried to associate Republicans with some of those creeps in Charlottesville who were marching around um it would go carrying torches and with Nazi paraphernalia Nazi symbols\nAnd uh that's not representative of the mainstream the

justice Kavanaugh Portland, Oregon they were doing that\nAnd then boom we're on election day\nAnd it is very very clear how the Democrats plan on winning everything winning the Senate winning the

Administration there will be a nightmare crack down on female rights by the way if you think this is a either a good political strategy or that there's even a little corner of this that is true\nOr you can give me a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nWhat is astonishing to me is that since President Trump was elected\nWhich is going on two years ago really going on two years ago\nAnd in those two years the hysteria about the loss of women rights of women being forced back into the kitchen and when and being forced back into chains of women no longer owning their bodies\nOf basic women's dignity and life being taken away it's all gotten so far out of control\nI mentioned before\nOn the show in fact I mentioned several times but now there's there's all kinds of new evidence that I find very very amusing [noise]\nI'd mentioned that the tendency for these nightmare visions of a sexist future a patriarchal future with all women rights raised and that's the popularity of The Handmaid's tale hamlet show was written in Nineteen eighty five\nWhere conservatives really were riding high I mean Reagan had just gotten elected\nA and reelected reelected with forty nine of fifty states so Margaret Atwood writes this idiotic book and it's just it's a little lame book it's lousy it's not even good treat as fiction but the division of the book of course as people know now because of the great success of the TV series\nIs that the Christian right has taken over a country that used to be America is now called gilly ad and basically has taken away all the rights to women women are now property they basically now are owned by men and owned by the government\nAnd okay that was bad enough in Nineteen eighty five what sense does that make\nIn two thousand and Eighteen well the point is The Handmaid's\nTale was only the beginning there's another book that I called your attention to\nA cold Vioxx which is a a book basically\nThat suggests that in the future of women are are going to be forced to be docile\nForced to be obedient and not allowed to talk\nThey're fitted by a dictatorial government with little bracelets that administer increasingly severe electric shocks\nIf those women dare to speak more than a hundred words at a time uh-huh why why are people reading this stuff [noise] okay\nWe got my attention was this morning and the New York times there's actually an excellent piece by Alexandra alter but I I don't think she wrote a tongue in cheek\nBut she could have\nShe starts out by this way by by talking about the situation in a new popular novel it's supposed to be a classic right\nOn a desert island three sisters have been raised in isolation sequestered from an outbreak that's causing women to fulfill\nTo protect themselves from toxins which men can transmit to women the sisters undergo cleansing rituals that includes simulating drowning drinking salt water\nAnd exposing themselves\nTo extreme heat and gold above all they are taught to avoid all contact with men always a good lesson to ah our wives and daughters right\nThe water cure which comes out in the United states in a couple of weeks was long lifted off course for the man Booker Prize and joins a growing wave a female centered science fiction\nFuturistic works that raise unfortunate questions uncomfortable questions about pervasive gender inequality massage any hatred of women\nAnd violence against women the erosion of reproductive rights and the extreme consequences of institutionalized sexism\nThe author of the water cure whose name is Sophie Macintosh she looks like she's about fourteen years old by the way she lives in London she says I felt like I didn't need to invent a disaster because there was already a disaster happening okay\nThat disaster happening right now when really what is it where is it where are women\nRights being denied\nMost of these new dystopian stories writes in New York Times take place in the future but channel the anger and the anxieties of the present moment when women and men are like are grappling with shifting gender roles and the messy continuing aftermath of the Aztec me too movement\nThey're lending added charged and polarizing moment when a record number of women are getting involved in politics and running for office well yeah obviously and more women are speaking out against sexual assault and harassment\nAt a time of increase the unease about parity between the sexes both knew one classic dystopian novels seemed to be resonating with readers and critics\n\nOne new novel by an author named alderman is called the power to twisted feminist revenge fantasy setting a world where women developed the ability to deliver an electric shock\nTo any manner touches them\nThat book has sold hundreds of thousands of copies and is in development as a TV series wonderful\nJust what we need\nAt the same time readers embracing classics the genre that have taken on a new significance of today's political climate Margaret Atwood's novel The Handmaid's tale\nSet in the future theocratic state where women are treated as reproductive slaves it's now sold more than three point five million copies in the United states since two thousand Seventeen\nThey say it's because of Trump's thank you President Trump\nMargaret Atwood won't say thank you chose it for a broad total sales to more than five million and this was adopted into the award winning television series and you see the people dressing and the costumes The Handmaid's tale all over as part of these protests let me tell you about another one of these books\nBecause I think it's kind of amusing\nWhat better way to force somebody into submission than to take away the one thing that makes them human language\nLike The Handmaid's tale several recent dystopian novels explore how women's fertility tend to find her worth an societies ... eyes and consider what might happen to the government mandates and enroll childbearing\n\nIn her new novel hazards of time travel coming out in November Joyce Carol Oates award winning novelist veteran novelist she's old now but just ... Joyce Carol Oates takes an almost literal approach to exploring fears that the clock could be turned back on women's rights\nThe novel opens in the future autocratic America where students are taught that men have higher IQs than when it\nAnd it centers on one young woman who is arrested for treason after she raises questions about the regime in school as punishment she gets teleport it back to Nineteen fifty nine Wisconsin to be re educated and rendered more\nDocile sounds like fun huh I'm\nThe there are so many of these there's a ... was struggling to become pregnant when she began writing her recent novel red clocks which takes place in the near future America where abortion and in vitro fertilization or legal embryos are in trying with a right to life\nThe idea came to her when she was researching fertility treatments and came across references to propose legislation that would outlaw in vitro fertilization okay there's not going to be legislation that outlaws in vitro fertilization\n... what is it just craziness coming from\nLet's uh let's go to a Linda\nIn North Hollywood, California Linda you're on the method that show\n[laughter] well I think it ever have a good strategy even now I only did it because\nI when they are not right now is she in Athens [laughter] what are you [laughter] and they're just not smart enough you know I\nI I you know what I I don't think that's true and that's that's why I'm I'm Glad that you call that I'm Glad we're talking about this\nLook the notion that women's rights are being taken away at a time when there are more women than ever in Congress and running for Congress men and women are they two thirds of the college degrees are one by women in the or a turtle battle of the sexes women are winning by the\nWay somebody disagrees with that give me a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six I also want to talk about\nBut uh the idea that every single\nAbortion is going to suddenly become outlawed that's not going to happen and there there are no politicians that I Know of who believe that that should be the case or let us go to a poll in Los Angeles Paul you're on the Michael ...\nYes I like I don't well go Kevin Kevin against abortion right the anti abortion\nRye is not that's not a position for a judge\nFor judging the conservative on at work you\nKnow conservative politicians are anti abortion without question but he is not a conservative politician he's a judge and I hate to break this to you but the constitution is silent on abortion\nOr can you mentioned to me all all the either hints or descriptions of abortion policy in the U.S constitution\nI Know I Can't go to the Republican dominated state\nOkay but that's by no fault that that's by people who are elected\nRight okay and what not by judges and what's that\nLike for the fire fortunate\nOkay well when you say side for look at as state the state of California gets to decide how to regulate medical procedures in California\nAnd if you think that the state of California is going to outlaw abortion\nThen you must be living in a fantasy state like in one of these dystopian novels I don't I don't think that's going to happen what can happen across the country\nIs waiting periods is in other words ... the idea that abortion should be permitted in some circumstances doesn't mean the government should be morally neutral on the issue of abortion\nDo you think it's a justified inappropriate Paul for the government to do whatever it can to discourage abortion\n[noise] I think that the government should get the bedroom and that way they strike or not\nOkay most most things that happened in the bedroom don't include abortions right\nAnd again I\nDo think that the government should stay out of the ah
