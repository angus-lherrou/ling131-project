whatever you deposit and you put in a hundred thousand the next day I used to give it all back to me\nThey sell it at a wholesale price you buy that retail you sell it back to that at wholesale so they give it to you at Ninety five thousand\nBecause your money goes to pay the broker in their electric bill and and then every year they charge you a feedback on that Ninety five thousand this is important because you have to earn a higher interest rate on Ninety five just to get back to a hundred\nCars it's less money\nSo with us you could earn a lower interest rate\nAnd actually have more

do a really good job so\nWhat exactly does get the kidney in trouble well first of all not drinking enough water\nHardly anyone in America gets half ounce per pound body weight\nOf water per day and that's kind of the minimum so let's say you were a hundred and fifty pounds\nYou'd need Seventy five ounces of water a day it's a little bit less than three chords\nAnd unfortunately by not getting that water it's very very hard and the kitten he the other problems for the kidneys and really it shares this with the brain is getting way too much refined oil\nWhich is almost always omega six [noise] and then there by having a inadequate amount of omega three fatty acids and in particular the end chain form of omega three that's so needed by the brain and by the um\nThe kidneys it's called the ha do cause a ...\nAnd of course that also plays a role in promoting helping lemon tour response now kidneys can also be in trouble because you've had a scar a trauma you women when you have a

I Would recommend that\nYou take perhaps fifty milligrams of straight B six and that can take as a capsule and that should help that be nice to put you on gall bladder support but I I don't like the alcohol during the pregnancy\nNow diet wise this becomes a very big deal\nI think that the research now really support shifting away from animal products shifting away from meat fish poultry eggs and dairy products and in particular shifting away from foods made with refined oils\nYou can get a free copy of the bio field that go to the last page it's got a resource list watch some of the videos with your husband and I think you'll see the motivation to to shift and shift\nYour age this is very common those little bruises or usually a marker that the kidney is a little weak\nAnd needs kidney support\nAnd muscle mass may also linked to um the kidney as well which is known in Chinese medicine to be the power of a man or woman\nSo one of the things that I Would encourage you to do is begin some moderate exercise\nOr that may mean just a twenty minute brisk walk daily with no glasses out in sunlight that would be a wonderful start and then from that begins some moderate stretching exercises\nAs far as the bruises go the first thing I Would do is get on some kid needs support\nAnd at your age should wait\nAbout three for me all the other thing I Would do is make sure you're not eating any cooked food without taking digested support like quantum digest you would need about two of those at the start of the main meal for the end of the meal about two or even three detained hydro chloride\nAnd if you're really smart one hydro clerk acid activated we called HDL activated\nAnd now you're digesting more like in your twenties\nAnd you may at this point need to get on some probiotic like heart probe addicts support and maybe to two of those and swallow to\nTo get a reset for the good bacteria for your gut and elsewhere because the killer for most people at your age is you can't adjust your food anymore\nAnd showed rotting food inundated delivered when it over loads deliver the waste products dumping the bloodstream and then of course they overload the kidney\nAnd that's almost for sure that linked to your weird bruises okay do I know yeah yeah okay take care and give a bus driver would align there'll be happy to help you find them [noise] All right we're almost\nOut of time that we're just going to take a little break actually and I'll be back in one minute so just hang in there and feel free to call in with your question [noise]\nWhy do you do when the medical community can't find out what's wrong with you\nDr might doing townhouse in lobbying got to help believes in finding ... insemination magazine rate didn't want to top twenty seven care to Pakistan to you and your title nine Ninety well\nDr Gillian practitioner by multiple credit card after hearing of life and then you get these therapies including Dr Robert national climbing mount\n... light that content ... cafe in her life\nFabricating combination treatments for his life he's been able to help me no I was like ... to dealing now seven four five six Ninety wind eighty\n...

All right this is Dr Bob Marshall pitch Davis's health plan live or answering your questions\nLet's go right back to the phones let's go to\nSusan in New York and she's got some irritation for instance if she thinks she might have some candy to are you there Susan\nHi and how old woman are you and how much the way his planning on getting Ninety\nWell the first thing that you want to know\nThat cause you're approaching the age where\nYou can't just hardly anything in the way of cooked food so obviously your first step\nTo reducing the irritation in the intestine is to make sure you can digest your food\nSo you would get on one of the ideas to maybe take a couple of those at the start of the meal\nThe end of the meal about for between ... and now you're dead just more like you did in your twenties and this shouldn't be any rotting food\nHitting the got them within the next step we have to look at is certain foods are more irritating than others corn is one of those super irritated his show you'd want to get rid of corn and you'll want to add\nVitamin D three or we call it the three gold and maybe about six drops of this\nIn about one ounce of water\nAnd you would mix in that about four drops of lime and then now that's an essential oil of orange\nAnd it will most if I the D threes so you mix it really good in the water and you see the big droplets these three become tiny tiny now you know no matter what the state of your gall bladder\nOkay and it's not able to do what it's supposed to show the first thing we can do is promote a healthy immune response comes to things that really help [noise] one is called nuclear tides\nAnd here in your body weight and your age you could take about three per meal\nAnd this is wonderful for promoting healthy immune response which you don't have right now and the other guy is ... from\nHere you can get some capsules take maybe about\nFour per meal and this is a stand in immune system so the first thing that does is it provides human activity ...\nTo handle the first line of defense on the intestine so it's bears your immune system to deal with these other issues okay so this is a great simple thing you can do and you should have these around anyway in case you need them so it's\nReally really a great thing to do\nOkay go to come down to take care Bye bye now All right\nThis is talk to Bob Marshall PHD and his his health plan live and were answering your nutrition and health related questions and don't forget if you're sick and tired of being sick and tired then it's time to visit with

or digestion or go through the whole body\nDepending on what your the tick your objectives are and they're going to be able to give you just exactly what you need so that body can perform so much better it can also find\nA pesky scarred traumas you may not even realize you have that had been interfering with the help of a key or going to Glenn\nAnd given enough time twenty thirty forty years those into appearance fields could destroy the organic land to which they reflects so\nThey can mud back that area fix the problem and a symbol full of nutrition\nCan outperform a wheelbarrow full before so give a budget for the or to lend there'll be happy to help you with the names of some practitioners in your area they would all an eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven alright ...\nAt school right back to the phones\nLet's go to Julie in Irvine, California and she has got some problems with the thumb and wrist area and really doesn't want to have cortisone shots surgery\nFor you there Julie welcome how old woman or you know how much do you weigh\nAnd very very young to have this sort of problem it was it spawned by an injury a blow a fall or what I\nKnow it actually got the information going on in China I don't want to take all the\nWell the first thing you need to know is that it's almost sure that you've got an interference field the scar trauma of blow\nMaybe you fell hard on the wrist as a small child or\nAdolescent and that's what's blocking and building this problem\nIn other words the other side is just fine but you're not using the same [noise] uh I don't believe that moving your mouse will ever do it on you know twice your age and I moved that mouse for a million times but I Will tell you\nThat I grew up in New York where are pastime was fighting and my wrists were amounts I must have done\nSo many many mud packs on both of my wrist to get them to show their pain free and that they work the way that is supposed to but you could do the same thing instead of hitting something or someone by falling down\nAnd I'd be looking hard at that and especially when it's only one hand and the other hand seems to be pretty good and I think you're right though that a surgery in cortisone shots these are going to treat your symptom you need to get to the cause show a couple of things that you can take\nThat promote healthy inflammatory response one of them is bone and joint\nAnd at your body size maybe three per meal will be plenty\nAnd then a vegetarian da da da da da du under\nAnd taking maybe ten of those at your main meal you can choose them spit out the capsule it tastes good but you would be taking it with you know food that had protein like beans and rice or whatever else you're eating okay\nAnd that or to make a big difference reducing foods that are pro inflammatory like\nEliminating eggs eliminating poultry\nAnd restricting red meat to maybe a red meat or fish to know more than once per day and also very you have to restrict dairy because all of those\nAre pro inflammatory\nAs much as\nWell and you just um it's time for you to love that body a little bit better and make some changes and I think that by making those changes the worst guy in town is gonna be the next runner up his poultry and the next runner up is dairy\nShow those guys give them a Ninety day holiday I think you may have a new lease on\nLife okay take care of by now [noise] all\nRight this is talk about Marshall PHD this has helped mine lives and we're getting near the end of the broadcast guys so if you're on the line and

some uh some Newark time\nHopefully you know cruise ships used to be a lot more relaxing before they got why fi on there and sailor signals and all that stuff so we'll see what kind of vacation it turns into hey so ah let's get started talking about what's going on [laughter]\nThe migrants ... migrant caravan from Central America brood over Seventy two hundred people this week but who's counting it uh well apparently somebody is\nYou know and you know I don't know who who's counting exact but I saw some uh I saw an interview on a on Fox this morning and some guy saying well you know I\nI left my three kids my wife and my three kids don't want to just newly born in I don't know if you let them Honduras Guatemala and I'm going to America and we rent so they're talking about who's paying off their houses by working for a couple of years in America\nAnd he goes but uh I think I'm Better off going back home and struggling with them then possibly dying on the way like one of my friends did yesterday so so one guy dropped out and\nOne guy died so apparently they're Seventy one hundred and Ninety eight people now in the Caribbean [noise]\nRight well I guess the thing has been going from four to six to ten thousand so I guess that means they're picking up people along the way and it yeah and exactly and if you\nAnd if you think about it imagine they everybody just got ... got the idea all at once and say hey let's walk two thousand miles and go to America\nAnd I even thought the same thing like let's say I decided you know and I'm going to walk to Canada or tomorrow\nAnd it'd be like OK yeah and I'm going to do it without any luggage 'cause nobody's carrying any luggage you notice that it I did notice that no luggage um you know the the logistics of walking a couple of thousand miles without any form of assistance um yeah but there's definitely some organization going on behind us so that begs the question I mean who's paying for this who's feeding\nThem where's where's the food for how long does it take to walk two thousand miles I don't know how far can you actually walk and one day I've heard people talking about thirty miles a day okay thirty miles a day that's three days for every hundred three point so that's a that's actually three that six so for every three hundred it's ten days\nSo there's a six of those so they're ten times six to sixteen so\nTwo months' worth of food and they're going to wear the same underwear for two months yeah well that's that's the thing that's kind of odd I mean they all look pretty good you know what I mean I mean they're they're dress nice it looks almost like a group of tourists more than anything else primarily young a young males by the way yeah\nAnd er and most of them don't have their families hey you know I left my wife and my three kids and Honduras or a or Guatemala but I think I'd go back\nOh wow how come all these guys have kids when they get to the border of our country because they're having an along the way is that what you're saying\nI don't know ... maybe they stealing from Mexico or maybe they deliver the kids the kids can't walk that far so we're just going to put them in in a plane flying to slam to a war as or someplace close to the border and uh and work and we'll just drop off you just pick them up to the airport after you walk walk up there for six days\nI think after six days I looked like hamburger or\nSomething yeah I Would be on my hands and knees I think are by the time I Would get to the border these guys look first there there are certainly got enough energy to hop over barricades and again there are still just accept like who's paying for all this where do they shower where they go to the bathroom I you know they were talking a massive massive coordinated effort it's like a it's like a\nBike on you know that they have little checkpoints them with with snacks or you know the pay stations yeah they have the the stations where you check in and people are the marathon they they ... they hand you a water bottle while you're walking and you're dumping on your head or drink it and now here's here's an energy bar\nYeah but that that's a marathon we're talking like a couple of thousand miles here yeah yeah well I'm just saying well I'm just thinking they just organized somebody organized this\nSaying don't don't I don't anybody out there thinking don't and I'm not saying I assume everybody listens our show things so I said and then when I say don't think\nThat this thing is just spur of the moment everybody just decided to go or things just got bad in Honduras or things just got bad in Guatemala and they just they had to get out\nIt's it's ... but I'm saying I say that too 'cause I Know you guys think just in the show but don't let your kids think or your neighbors your co workers things to say hey you know what\nWhat are you thinking everybody just got a oh let's just go I'm leaving my wife and my kids are I'm leaving all my belongings and I'm not taking if I have a car I Can't take it 'cause they can't get them across the border and uh and plus I Would rather just walk and um\n'cause it looks cool or on TV and uh what else\n[laughter] yeah I I don't know they do well and yeah that sounds stupid well the other thing that did Jimmy didn't make any sense that they're flying to Honduras flags at least I think that's the hunter and flag I don't really know exactly but it's like why are you flying the Honduran slack I mean isn't that the reason you're leaving the first place 'cause it sucks there\nYep exactly no but I you know they won't be refugees by the time to give to our place\nAnd of course ah some of them speak English but they won't be able to speak English by the time they get to replace earlier in the week President Trump took a lot of heat for this tweet that he put on Monday he said sadly it looks like Mexico's police and military unable to stop the caravan heading to the southern border the United states\nCriminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in I have alerted the border patrol and the military that this is a national emergency must change laws\nSo you know for so for those of you for those of you don't know uh you know Trump just signed into or just a negotiating off it's officially signed the the U. S. M. C. A. the United states and Mexico Canada agreement which is a a revamp of the of NAFTA north North American\nFree trade agreement and he's saying hey you guys either stop these guys in Europe or you're in your country before they get to ours or\nThat that agreement thought and and we're every every man for himself in the in the national trade and ah I guess they tried they made some kind of an effort to try but they can't they can't hold them back where reporters pressed Trump on Tuesday the president doubled down on what he said\nDon't you go in the middle of the cameras in the middle as you're going to buy you're going to buy say the least you got to find out why not allow you got\nIf you look at who they targeted so far it's almost like they're following Donald Trump's Twitter feed you we are in an era now where violence seems to have a licensed by the president can the United states\nBut the president certainly has encouraged to kind of rhetoric this is what happened when the president calls you the enemy of the people\nAnd if anybody ... dare say that it was set up by the Democrats as an October surprise uh you're automatically dismissed as a conspiracy theorist but\nWhat else would be for you know you got you got like twelve bombs that were delivered none of them went off\n... none of them went off at all\nYeah one thing we can say is the guy's a lousy bomb or whoever this was and it looks like we're always see finding the identity of this I actually made before you can go on the air or just learning who this person actually had exactly\nSo let's let's do a recap and then we're going to break for a for a ... uh for some commercials but here's the recap on Monday a pipe bomb was sent to the home of someone we talked about earlier George Soros the ... the devices discovered it source home and kept in a New York\nWednesday morning three similar devices were found address to the ...

I don't want to say October surprise but I I think I think\nThe Democrats will number one I think I think someone in the\nDemocratic world thinks that sending that care of and I was going to ah create some and just specifically targeted at our at our mid term voting day to get here um I think that\nThey thought that they were going to create some scenes that people are going to feel sorry for all these people coming up and vote against Trump and vote against the Republican Party vote Democrat\nI think it's had almost the opposite effect to look\nIf if the Democrats think that the majority of people in the United states want this massive influx of people in here from\nFrom other countries I mean look even the people that are here illegally now don't want more illegals coming in right because they all have to compete for the same jobs at the same resources are we all have to you know share the same roads and fruit did they did they really want more people pouring in I don't think so and\nI don't think so either and now and now I think they're starting to figure out that uh the early polls the the early polls empty the early that people are early voting they're starting to see that hey you know between the the the cabin out there that I'm going to say the crap they did to Brett Kavanaugh\nThis all the all the shenanigans they're pulling their is starting to backfire on I'm In and people are saying hey you know the Democrats are just out of control we're voting Republican and uh so now they want to change the narrative\nSo now it's let's set up to let's set up the uh the Republican so it looks like they're bombing the Democrats so on a on Wednesday the president delivered multiple statements on the threats this was a statement from the White House\nIn these times we have to unify we have to come together\nAnd send one very clear strong language staple message that acts for the rest of political violence of any charge him no place in the United states should learn to [noise]\n\nLearn by voters in states and I can tell you're from both sides we both agree on that\n[noise] yeah but the liberals continue to say the president encouraged to happen with his rhetoric here's a Maxine Waters and be probably five who tells a Democrat to harass Trump supporters in public\nI think the president of the United states\nThe bonds hundred and forty million dollars per year um\nWon't raise taxes it'll help people off the streets and into comprehensive mental health services an addiction treatment\nHomeless advocates social workers doctors an emergency responders agree yes onto the con is a fix up to five point six billion dollars away from so severely mentally ill to fund bonds to build them or just housing and without requiring treatment so they're going to take five point six billion dollars\nAnd I just put housing up forum doesn't do anything to treat them for their disease and a will for so many people into many more people into homelessness it's unnecessary because last year legislator authorized county use of M. S. M. H. S. A. funds for housing\nIs again the it's it's a it's a money grab for the state to come up with a solution the solution is a a revised HIPAA laws so we can actually do something for these people because most of the homeless people want to be homeless\n[noise] well I mean it's it's a goal is this is a complex problem it's a combination of drug addiction mental illness and people as you said maybe just want to be there so the answer of building you know the public subsidized housing for them as a solution to know the answer is no\nSo vote no on to cash number three authorizes bombs to fund projects for water supply and quality watershed fish wildlife water convenient it's this is going to say save some more uh save some more a selfish melt the smell K authorize eight point eight seven seven billion in state ... general\nObligation bonds for various infrastructure projects\nFiscal impact increased it costs to repay bonds averaging four hundred and thirty million per year over the next forty years you know what the state will never recovered from all this stuff\nThe the the yes on three people say secure safe reliable and clean water for California provide safe drinking water repairs unsafe dance you know what they should have done this years ago ... repaired the dams before they before they broke they should have repaired the ladies before they broke\nAnd uh they shouldn't be sending our water from northern California out into the Pacific ocean to save the delta smell\nAnd uh the fish will migrate where they need to migrate and uh but the ... the state of California and he has a farmland that needs water and uh somebody in Sacramento has no brain and somebody all over the country\nUh doesn't investigate anything when they uh when they vote 'em the cons against\nTheir will not produce one drop of new usable water interest payments on the bonds will double the amount of has to be repaid the bond holders or know the answer is no use the delta ... for fish tacos nest eggs\nHad more people eat a and people drink cars will not use a will use the water it will grow food K authorizes bonds funding construction hospitals providing children's health care\nUh the the pros California citizen California's children's hospitals provide specialized care for over two million sick children each year cancer sickle cell organ transplant no matter what families can pay eighty five percent of children with leukemia are hurt or cure proposition for increases the capacity\nThe you know what the people at Loma Linda are saying vote yes for it because they're going to get a hundred and thirty five million dollars that it is\nBut if I work construction yes towards construction on their new hospital for seismic or for that for seismic retrofit so hey they came up with new government the um regulations on how they're building a Santa costs an extra hundred and thirty five million so instead of\nInstead of a somebody coming up with a hundred and thirty five million or getting rid of the regulation uh they're uh they're just going to say hey we're going to we're going to\nA fund these children's hospitals by it and\nIt's a it's a waste there's somebody needs to have some a common sense and in managing the state of California vote no on for four or five is ah for property owners transfer ... I'm just going to the skin explain this one what this does is for people who are over fifty five\nAnd as well as a severely disabled homeowners a and people that have already contaminated or disaster destroyed properties that allow them to move\nAnd keep their tax and their tax rate\nWhat they had so you got people that bought their houses for a hundred thousand dollar an hour five hundred thousand they need to move to someplace else has the elderly but they can't because they went from the cars if they go from another one five hundred thousand dollar house they paid a hundred thousand or\nInto a new five hundred thousand dollar house that might be a lateral move their tax rate will go from that fourteen hundred dollars a month or two or six thousand or fourteen hundred dollars a year after six thousand and they can't afford that this allows people to move and take their uh their tax rate with them\nA lot of people are saying we're going to lose ... billions of dollars in ... in tax revenues by the property taxes staying low but you know you forget to where they're already paying fourteen hundred dollars a year on a five hundred thousand dollar house someone's going to buy that thing for five hundred thousand in the tax rates go up on that it's good it's good for real estate and in California\nAnything else real estate helps everybody\nSo yes on fire [noise]\nSix is the gas tax\nThey try to tell you that this is about uh about uh repairing roads and if we say and if we vote on this where are we going to have potholes we already have potholes this is a this is about repealing the gas tax that made the or the taxes go up a twelve cents a gallon for gasoline and twelve to twenty cents a gallon for diesel\nAnd uh and it set some new rules so that the the state government can't just arbitrarily raise taxes on things like a DMV registrations in gas without having the people vote for\nIt yeah the biggest biggest problem for me on this thing was that it was put on it was put out there without even a vote and if you allow these people in Sacramento just arbitrarily pass laws without people voting what are they going to stop to this that definitely we're we're looking at a a yes on prop sick\nExactly Cape ... seven or as for daylight savings time we uh we had a little bit of a debate on this because ah what is this really do so saying that hey some people think daylight savings time just confuses people because twice a year we have to move our\nClocks forward and are twice in a ... or I'm moving back uh it throws people off you know they're they're late for their meetings or they're or they're or they come early they could have slept an extra hour when they when they end up showing up early or whatever you'd throws off your\nBody clock um there's arguments for both pros and cons for daylight savings time and when we looked at it you know a yes vote on this just says hey the state can change if\nThey wanted right you're right it doesn't actually change it I Am in favor of changing having one freaking time because it does screw up everybody's clocks that does make people ate it costs millions or an untold inconveniences the whole idea is stupid or in a lot of states don't have daylight savings time neither was should we I'm saying yes on prop seven\nTimes I'll probably vote yes on it that has just hey we can change their mind later so it's a it's all just they can vote on it and change if we want um I think uh\nArizona\nArizona doesn't have daylight savings time and neither does Hawaii and though I think there's one or two other states seem to hurt them it'll it doesn't seem to hurt him\nA proposition eight regulates out patient kidney dialysis clinic um this is a no uh we don't want the government a telling people telling the the dialysis people\nUm what they can do what they can't do the more the government gets involved in in health care of the more the government gets involved in anything it costs four times as much the government skimming off this stuff because the people that are that are directing the money\nThe people that are directing the money it's not their money and so they just wasted it costs it takes twice as long four times as much cost and a and we don't want them getting in the way of people actually getting a dialysis they're going to try and try and make it\nMake it totally fair totally fair guess what just keep the government out of it and let the free market a fix things people will go where they get taken care of and uh people that have kidney problems that need dialysis need to just\nNot be screwed with or you can if you if you have to have any healthcare is using you know what they're doing to prescription drugs or if you're not if you're if you're not upset with that it's because you don't have any prescriptions\nCave proposition ten is a rent control expands local government's authority to enact rent control um there is there are laws in the state about rent control what you can do\nThis is going to take over the the ... the rental part you're going to find if or if this passes you're going to have a a ton of of uh people just get out of the rental business and you're going to you're going to get out of the rental business\nUm there's going to be no incentive to buy you're going to see a ton of properties come on the market\nAnd uh you're gonna see prices go down just gonna be the prices of houses probably gonna go down cars going be flooded kind of like when a um Reagan made made some changes on on the taxes in Nineteen eighty six I think it was\nAn a everybody's dumped all the rental properties cause he change some of the the loopholes that people were enjoying on having rental properties so\nVote no on ten [noise] eleven\n... is that requires a private sector emergency ... employees to remain on call this is the labor law thing this is some people are saying hey it's only gonna help him our companies are going to they're going to save a billion dollars a year and they're putting they put Twenty one million dollars into this campaign this is about labor laws in California\nIf you're an employer if you have someone who works more than five hours and doesn't\nGet a lunch you have to pay him for Ninety minutes or let them go home at six hours at six hours and paying for eight hours this you know if if you got an employee if I have an employer says hey we need to work through the less I'll bring unless your desk and I'll let you go home a little early you know what if we have the ability the employees like that\nHey I get free lunch and I get to work and I get to go home in our early I'm happy to do that but the labor labor law says hey I get penalize you got to pay out and that some ... billions of dollars to all employers and it hurts when it hurts the employers hurts the employees are last one so that they are so I say yes on ... comments on that last thirty no\nThousand people that call today were given a second year

dealing with the higher omega three ... we're talking about support for the HDL cholesterol\nHealthy you pull flexible arteries that's so great for the circulation heart muscle strength platelet activity red blood cells that stay nice and soft and flexible so they're going to work their way through those little capillaries but what about triglycerides that becomes so important show\nThis

Myers up that certainly would they be would touch on this study and tell us how this works\nRight those are great study in fact that's the reason I started taking crude oil about five six years ago a pilot study double blind placebo controlled exactly what you want to see out of the journal of the American College of nutrition ... participants got three hundred milligrams of crude oil or placebo
