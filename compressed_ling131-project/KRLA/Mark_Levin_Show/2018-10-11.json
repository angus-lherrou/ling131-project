S. vote against our interests\nAnd then assume that we're going to give you a millions upon millions of dollars so I could that change uh American leadership it's a total shift\nFrom the state department in from about diplomacy the U.S has has existed for decades it was we used to have the idea of kind of placate everybody with cash now it now the new strategy is we take that cash from you and you can come begging to us when you change your policy I think that's it\nExactly right number one I think that there is that relates to all of those issues\nAll right so we're taking your calls at one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one time we want to know your thoughts on what do you think the main issue that we should be focusing on if you went to the United states and I my I start with Israel but I Want to get other people's and North Korea certainly in there as well Iran another one I mean you're talking about hotspots the bachelor ship than you are un representative\nFor the ... it's a big role I mean and look through years is a long time a service in that role she's worked very very hard I we had a chance to work with her a closely last year and I'm not an either or on and off during the last a year and a half and I will not seat or you could tell she is working on it I think she did a great just to pay your job\nIt's a huge role Jay because of how many leverage point to exist inside that chamber and Jordan talked about the financial aid when I totally agree with that I also think ah in in terms of foreign policy team everything comes back to that signature move of moving the embassy but think about the other leverage points Jamie no longer has the United states deferred to other caucuses inside the un I mean ...\nOrganization for the Islamic cooperation do you think they're driving the agenda now know the United states is\nNo longer have they declined to use their leverage to things like vetoes and the Security Council which the last administration declined to do a no longer had they been afraid to withdraw from ineffective un bodies think about unrest and then again back to the financial support both dollars to the United nations in two countries who don't align with the United states to\nGet all of those levers points that essentially the last ministry Asian had lay down\nA President Trump an investor Haley pick them back up and use them over the last two years yeah I think\nThat's a no you're exactly correct and I I think very effectively as I said well taking your calls and comments eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten go ahead and take a call\nYet right to the socio Jerry in Rhode Island on line three Jerry welcome to the United states to welcome [laughter] I was reading something about getting welcome do their job\nI think I think you partially answered the question like\nI I mentioned the producer when when you put a basket or end I'm assuming that given the agenda by you're going to hurt that in ... well like I said so what part of it as a reactionary for the rest of the world so when you ask us what do we think whatever work just now with Harry\nNot broke down on that way but I think it comes from a leader\nWhat's your so here's what happened to the United nations uh sometimes is a cabinet level but not always under this administration it has been a cabinet level I think under Brock Obama's it was not\nUm so independent she was a cabinet members that meant you had to go through the confirmation ... investors do anyways but she had to go through a confirmation process but the agenda is set by the administration she works closely with the president the secretary of state where she was extremely effective is her advocacy at the United nations itself both publicly and behind the scenes\nYeah that's right I mean she again I think she showed this idea of strength\nShe changed the way the U.S foreign policy was going to move forward or from the past administration to the Trump Administration and she put it into action so she called the un out\nFor what it was called the Russians out for what they were doing the Chinese what they were doing the Iranians stood with Israel and when the administration decided to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move our embassy to uh to is to Jerusalem\nThe there were there was a vote at the un of all these countries condemning that\nAfter that even before she said you better what we're watching how you vote\nAfter that she announced the new U.S plan which is that you would no longer receive aid if you regularly voted against us interest at the United nations where you were to have you ever country they came to the un\nAnd bashed the U.S and and then voted against her interest but you received all this a humanitarian aid right over more humanitarian aid for you if you continue to vote that way and act that way what would you say than a\nFrom your experience in dealing with the state department on this issue I actually she's a very effective advocates both publicly and behind the scenes what's your sense\nI think the most effective we've seen in recent times saying look at it comes back to the ambition level of the ... the ... the and gender is not very ambitious to position is not that important but this agenda was incredibly ambitious all the way from the embassy moved to the financial aid withdrawing from bodies\nAnd back to the last caller's point I think it really answer this question did the president determines the agenda\nBut then the ambassador has to implement I'll just give you one example\nWithdrawing from the human rights council that is it a decision that has made at the presidential let a level\nBut then ambassador Haley had to actually go down to the human rights council\nAnd implemented in and I'll tell you the fallout was tremendous around the world and I would say in an extremely important in a positive way because that council has has has ceased to further a human rights agenda for a long time now but the president decides ambassador Haley has to actually go into the well into the chamber and implement that agenda\nLet me play for you what a Nikki Haley said this is a former announcement yesterday for ...\nFor the nine votes on foreign policy now and I think if\nIf we were going to have some from ... Fowler whether it was what the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was NATO country buffet ... weather changing of the nation from Haines ...\nSo I think the legacy that Nikki Haley creates is a very positive one but look it's an important role I Know there's a lot of people complain about the UN and believe me we are critical because they they their policies on Israel and others have been ridiculous and they're fake red lines and and you can go on and on the fact of the matter is do we need effective advocates there\nAnd we've had that with Nikki Haley so again we want to know kind of your view on what you think the top aspects topics you should be that we're addressing it to you and I mean what does this way it's the middle east\nAnd this isn't it any particular order I I think these are the big issue points it's the middle east so it's the it's the it's the Israel Palestinian conflict the greater Middle East that would include Iran because you have to look at the Iranian situation that's part of that then you got the whole Russia\nIssues with Ukraine then you go over to China you've got the issues with China and then particularly been into the Korean Peninsula as you look at that agenda you understand that that UN ambassador has got a broad swath of what they're dealing with yeah when you do an expert in a lot of\nRussian you deal with Iran you're also dealing with Syria and that conflict there um and then of course the broader issue which is reforming are corrupt United Nations\nSo we looked at the uh defunding of unrest and those other kind of a un programs that have been a a so so poorly run and uh again sort of out of control your weight and I think all of that is very important but I Love to hear from everybody up there one eight hundred\nSix eight four thirty one ... hundred six eight for three one two\nOne zero then you said that you thought that um the fact that that the situation in North Korea and the sanctions there Nikki Haley's aggressiveness on behalf of the president in the United states served as very well\nYeah and you mentioned it earlier in the broadcast day but I think it belongs on that list that you in Jordan just rattled through because North Korea has no doubt move in a positive direction now we're not all the way where we need to be but the reason that that dialogue is happening in the reason that progress has been made\nIs because the United states led the international community and putting sanctions in place on North Korea\nTo actually bring them back to the table investor Haley was the main spokesman in the United nations chamber of for those sanctions so I think you know going forward certainly the middle east is always the epicenter I mean the oh I see always has hostility towards Israel front and center on their agenda but I think right or in the next year is that North Korea a front\nI think that's right and so what is going to happen is the president's going to make a an announcement in the days ahead of who is nominee will be that and we'll talk about that process there'll be a confirmation process there\nThere's a lot of talk on who it might be but I think the president's narrowed down his list\nFrom eight people are asking already on Facebook once the confirmation because they're just been through the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation process what's this confirmation going to look like\nWell it obviously depend on who it is Jay but look I think you need expected to be contentious I think you're going to have to appoint somebody that is is qualified ready for the job so that they can get through look I I think this is one of the reasons jade that you're not going to see somebody who is already in a spot that require confirmation because then all of a sudden you have two people that you've got to get through the confirmation process\nI think this is probably going to be somebody that's not in a confirmed spot already and Jay I'll predict\nThat there's two qualities that Nikki Haley had it to the next candidate will have its gotta be somebody that's tough as nails because they've got to go into this\nVenue and be prepared for people to walk out when they're ... you know gender but then they're going to also have to have that diplomatic characteristic that Jordan's talking about Nikki Haley leaves it very well liked inside the United nations say and that's tough to do when you're advancing the engine as aggressive as she has she's been\nVery effective on Elena Facebook said Nikki Haley's resolving strip changed the position of viewing ambassador we need something like that to fill that role I think that I think ... is actually right here\nI think that's precisely correct so we need someone light Nikki Haley someone who is a clear coherent advocate of tough America policies someone who'd demands respect on the world stage\nAnd someone that advanced who's our interest how hard do you think the confirmation fight for this one could be depends on the person but it's very hard I could be very hard difficult in this will like this will be after ... [noise] yeah so I think so now to tournaments or as what happened another impact on the ... let me see if could could\nYou control the U.S Senate though may be a tough confirmation but not as tough Supreme\nPortland which is what we're taking your calls the one eight hundred sixty four thirty one because we are here for another thirty minutes if you're not going to pull out of the broadcast gray seal Jay down over audio and video streaming at their same on Facebook and periscope and our social media platforms\nAnother way for you to hear the broadcast we encourage you to do that\nAs well at a a seal jaded over Facebook and periscope I mean if you want to talk to us eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten back with\nStuck in traffic we secularists over the past four or five south that getting set her drive the crashes are Buena let played block stopped traffic from Bella justice above the boulevard and the secular did retro cool mugs Fifteen or a doctor but he'll boulevard of Dover pickup truck there as a write in Bay floods\nAnd this was some traffic from baseline road [noise] on the Fifteen five by itself it out of avenue for whoever the fashion been cleared for lane\nStop and go practice so from Scott rose\nMichael has moved quickly\nThe wind from hurricane Michael is causing massive damage to the Florida Panhandle and surrounding areas but officials warn a bigger concern is the storm surge generally responsible for fifty percent um storm related\nDeaths seven point three seven point seven out of the nation in around ... some of these areas indeed receiving some of the largest on the\nNational Hurricane center director Ken Graham says the system is expected to bring heavy rains and hurricane force winds as far north and central Georgia before we can into a tropical storm and quickly exiting off the mid Atlantic Coast by friday al Lewis' Miami\nAttorney psychiatric evaluation has been ordered to demand accused and setting the twenty three thousand acre holy fire in August he's already been evaluated by two psychiatrists but they disagreed or whether he's mentally fit to face arson charges he's accused and starting the fire and August sixth that destroyed the Eighteen cabins\nAnd whole or homes you know orange and riverside counties\nSouth when weather partly cloudy overnight lows in the upper forties timid fifties a positive result in the morning and then should be a a sunny a partly sunny by mid afternoon and temperatures that high is so low seventies about us Jay Sekulow continues next\n[noise] you still get the best tall I wake up with a news he wants and nice as the sunrise weekday mornings just six welcome to your morning at your news and talk you can trust [laughter] on a on a Saturday Night\nWashington D. C.\nSpent eight years I didn't have time on my level even ... hospitable for falafel now when you walk her father\nNo chief counsel for the American Center for law and justice secular\nSeverely announces that she will be resigning at the end of the year as her position as your investors she served for two years\nAnd that's a that's a significant amount of service to make sacrifices for the government officials when they go into government service like this where they actually uh it's it's you know it's an expensive undertaking as you can imagine\nBut she's been a very effective one of our most effective advocates in us history I think Nikki Haley will go down as one of those affective un ambassadors in us history I I've no hesitation and saying that\nThe I mean think about what we've done I mean the U.S has accomplished under ambassador Haley we recognize\nA Jerusalem as the capital of Israel finally and we take it to the world and say you know what are you can condemn is all you want\nA you better watch your aid money uh we've changed the u._s. foreign policy approach to diplomacy where we used to just throw money out I'm even countries that would oppose the ... the un oppose our foreign policy\nAnd throw money out to try to tease him in that has been changed a show the the tone a it's been ... I Would say it's not just the tone change from the Obama administration it is a complete\nLee new approach to diplomacy\nAt at the United nations that has been done by any previous administration in modern history what do you think Harry\nWell um I think that's absolutely correct I think it's important to recognize that during a Nikki Haley's tenure the United states has withdrawn from the Iran nuclear deal\nWe have responded with top rhetoric to North Korea and that has drawn I'm a real ... yeah ... ...\nAnd we'll continue to impose sanctions on many regimes including Russia or Iran and North Korea and I think that has drawn a real response of throughout the world out of the level of respect for the United states has risen immeasurably\nWe are getting a lot of calls are a lot of ... notes posted on Facebook at periscope than about what's going to happen let's walk people through 'em but what the process looks like the this is another one I mean we just came out of accomplishment Supreme Court justice ambassadors are also confirmed\nAnd this is the president nominates that's his authority Senate advice and consent\nWell when we already heard from the president on this day that he expects to give us a name and the next two or three weeks you said maybe sooner he said he's down to a handful of names already but once he decides uh yes it will be sent to the Senate or there will be the confirmation hearings that will go to the floor I think Jordan is correct that it's not going to follow the protracted timeline of the Supreme Court\nThe nation but J I Do expect to just to just because of the nature of the Senate right now I expected to vote margin\nOr will be slim I think that whoever is nominated will probably get all of the Republican support and probably a handful of Democrats so it probably won't be as razor close is is pretty in court\nBut look I think you saw the play ... a play book from the minority in the United States Senate right now up until the elections and maybe even following Jay they plan to oppose any one significant who's nominated regardless of who they are\nI mean during that were just taught me that I think that look we can it can be a bruising process and it's going to depend on who it is now the president is going to he he picks people that are going to carry the agenda administration poet of core you almost starting with forty eight objects as before you start yes I think the votes going to be close I think we just went through a really horrendous process for the Supreme Court and\nAnd so a comparing it to that is is it's probably not fair ... it to get it as long as the person is ... is qualified\nThey will be confirmed I'm less is less issues you know about that that again it appears that the Senate will remain in Republican hands that'll be the key 'cause that's when this will happen is after\nThe midterm elections an after those people are in place so it's because she's staying until\nThe end of the year so that that means it will be the next Congress that will be confirming a vis a vis investor to the ...\nI I think it's a look I expect one of the fight but uh if I were having this is a very very important role All right we're gonna take more calls me come back right so if you're on line hang on we're too right after the break you want to talk to us when you think about the un what the court and issues are what do you think about the gay at least under one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten\n... friends in the panhandle of Florida it's a monster storm coming on about an hour and a half again we'll take your calls at one eight hundred sixty four three one one zero Dover gets to work at the age the OJ you could do that at ACL Jay dot org but boy we are praying for you it winds of a hundred and fifty miles an hour [noise] going to the Panama City back for more than a month\n[noise] [noise]\nThat's the American Center for law and justice we focus on the critical issues that matter most to you and your family\nRacy OJ chief counsel Jay Sekulow\nWeather is presenting arguments before the U.S Supreme Court are engaging in the halls of Congress for more than a quarter century\nThe ACL Jay's been on the front lines protecting our values and constitutional freedom\nThere's no better place to get the facts\nThe most important issues of the day\nI think the OJ website\nYou can listen to our daily radio broadcast [noise]\nWatch our TV show\nGet the latest news and insight on vital issue even support the work of E.

but what they can do is they can ruin your business they can they can and\nSaid oh you're right I and I'm opposed I'm opposed to their program but you see is there a lot of programs that are bad an ill advised in stupid I'll give you an example Lyndon Johnson's great society programs was a colossal waste of money and it's created a lot of the fiscal problems we have right now in this country were created there\nBy spending it was well over\nI think they say fifty trillion total and adjusted dollars\nAre in failed anti poverty programs President Reagan but however that wasn't a revolution was this program\nBut but when you're changing the way things have always been done like\nA you know Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a life time activists lawyer for the ACLU right and she's Ninety six to three because advise and consent made meant something different background now there are kids who get to where this is a political football now\nOkay every day in order to start we're going to I I think those are I think those are on before hold on I think those are unfortunately\nChanges but when you start talking about revolution you start thinking about ... teens you start thinking about bizarre and his family killed by firing squads you start talking about blood on the streets\nAnd frankly I don't think it's helpful for winning the case in other words being opposed to revolution and

lessons should we take away from that will speak to Ken Starr tomorrow will also be reviewing a new and wildly controversial movie some people say it's too much flag waving some people say not enough flag waving what about first man the movie about Neil Armstrong\nThe man to walk on the moon first one of the dead or will review that with a Ryan Gosling and Claire foil review that film tomorrow meanwhile this came in and I this is rare but I'm going to admit that a a disagreeing tweet is right\nIs right\nMichael writes him on Twitter he says about the Trump Kanye meeting if Obama had this type of meeting you would say the meeting was embarrassing incoherent\nEmpathetic you're right\n[laughter] well I think it was kind of embarrassing and going here and pathetic but I Would certainly have made more of a deal about it was Obama because there was one thing about Barack Obama from the very first day he became president\n\nThey are going to say that you were an educated they're going to say that you clearly are not well mentally\nThe same people that say that we don't need a shame people and we don't need to bully people the same Democratic Party that says we don't need a shame people that we need to let people be open about mental illness and we need to bring it out and not make it something that people should be embarrassed about are the same exact people today\nThat are shaming African American man because\nHe didn't do what they told him to do\nI'm going to bring up an analogy here and I know people are going to get mad at me for doing it before you freak out and start tweeting at me or sending the evil messages on Facebook to listen to what I actually have their say through the end of this comment before you lose your mind and I mainly talking to a liberals that are listening because we know they're listening\nDemocrats are upset\nThat a black man by the name of Kanye West is not supporting the people that they told him\nTo support think about that\nAnd when he supported the president they first said he was an Uncle Tom\nThen they said we would we would we would shame him health shame him into saying that he's mentally on well clearly this is the person that mentally on well then they said the president's taking advantage of a mentally on well man\nThen you had people on TV\nWho are African American who went on TV and said this about Kanye West is what happens when they grow don't read\nYou've heard that right I'm going to play it again this is what African Americans who are Democrats set on national TV about Kanye West because Kanye West disagrees with them politically so now they just bully him by saying what is what happens when negroes don't read\nYou've heard that right Kanye West says what happens when negroes don't read\n\nAll because Kanye West likes Donald Trump\n\nNow here's my analogy when I Know there's going to be people on the left that are going to freak out by me saying this\nAnd before you again don't tweet at me until after I finished the statement because if you tweet at me before I finished the statement I Will not respond because clearly you're ignorant and you're not listening\nIs is not the perfect example of a modern day version of slavery\nWhat they're doing the Kanye West\n\nIs it's not a perfect example\n\nOf what slave owners did two slaves to keep them\nIn their lane of slavery\n\nKanye West is a black guy Kanye West's back in the day said George Bush hates black people\nRemember that\nMr producer can you grab that audio do you mind doing that\nKanye West was a guy that after Hurricane Katrina came out on national TV at a fundraiser and said George Bush hates black people no one said that he was not reading then\nThere wouldn't have black Democrat in America when he said that that would have said this afterwards tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read\nAbout that Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read I Would argue that as an incredibly racist statement I Would argue that's a perfect example of modern day slavery from the car is ours\nNow in ... west says this after Hurricane Katrina listen to it\nThe most tragic loss of all George Bush doesn't care about black people [noise]\nGeorge Bush doesn't care about black people did you hear the car sellers say this is what happens when negroes don't read snow you didn't hear you want to know why because that was okay to be said on the liberal plantation of owning African Americans like modern day slaves\n\nYou will get what modern day slavery is in this country what is it\nIs a party that controls the thoughts and the minds of African Americans it as a party that demands that African Americans don't succeed but fail so they're dependent\nOn their government aid and they keep them in those poverty at high poverty high crime failing schools and when you bring up that you want these kids to be out of failing schools what do they say\nThey say no\nBecause we've got employees that are black working in those schools and where unions as teachers and you can't destroy public edge for education I Would agree with that you can you've already done\nSome possible for me as a white Republican destroyed public education you guys have already taken care of that on the left I Would argue the left doesn't mind that young African American kids are in failing schools\nBecause that keeps them on their plantation that keeps them in modern day slavery and so what\nHappened was as you have a I I'm referring to the car sellers and what he said you're a negro who went from living on the plantation miss producer wants to play the audio again this is Kanye West's while living on the plantation talking about George Bush after Hurricane Katrina\nGeorge Bush doesn't care about black people\nHe said and I quote George Bush hates black people and everybody clapped\nEverybody said Kanye West is a great black man who's calling out an evil white present and it was okay to say that on that you're on that day because that was the words that were okay to say on the\nDemocratic plantation then the ... comes out in Kenya and start singing for himself and starts realizing hey this this world I live in a flavor is not very good\nI I Am saying massive crime rates in my hometown of Chicago which apparently is moving back to I'm seeing poverty I'm saying are kids that are getting a good education I'm seeing all these things and he starts questioning the plantation owners which is the Democratic party\nHe starts questioning the rich black guys\nWho are running the Democratic party who are telling them that no no no no you need to stay in poverty because won't take care of you there I don't know you don't need to think for yourself no no you can't even have an id to vote we're going to make sure you come up with that idea because we don't even expect you to have an id outrageous that mentality and then ... says you know what\nI'm going to be independent I'm going to be independent thinker I'm going to come out and say that I like black unemployment rate it all the time what I like a president that wants to talk about creating jobs African American community and set of offering up welfare checks and food stamps [noise]\nAnd then they reprimand this man who got off the Democratic plantation\nScalia was what happened when they grow don't read\nHow is that not the most racist statements is it not racist because the Democrat says it not racist 'cause the black person said is it not racist\nBecause it's supported by all Democrats\nThe same Democratic Party that says Donald Trump's tweets are are are horrible\nThe same Democrats say that Donald Trump bullies people and it's terrible that same Democrats today they're sending out tweets\nAbout this thing national coming out day for the gay and lesbian transgender bisexual community and that we should love every one if you get off their plantation they'll say this to you tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read\nThere it is\nDon't tell me\nThat the Democratic party cares about black people\n\nDon't tell me that this isn't racism don't tell me that this is not slavery modern day slavery\nYou shut up you sit down in the back of are blocked by us and our black party in our Democratic Party and you say what we tell you to say and what you're going to say is George Bush hates black people and you're brilliant but if you ever get out of that lane if you ever get off our plantation and try to make a name for yourself or have independent thoughts\nWe will go out on national TV and we will bully you and we will tell people that you're mentally unfit\nYou're mentally insane you are mentally incompetent you've been to a hospital before for mental health issues clearly the white man's taking advantage of you all and by the way you're an ignorant black person to tell you what is what happens when negroes don't read\nThere it is that is your Democratic Party\nThat's exactly what they say if you leave their democratic plantation\nNow I'll be happy to hear you tell me how I'm wrong now I Would love for you to tell me why it's appropriate because a black man disagrees with the Democratic party and walks off their democratic plantation and actually start to say things that make sense about the reality of the economy\nA things on a lot on his medicine that it's horrible it's going against the African Americans um he can't get a break uh it's just it's despicable what to do with the guy now because it's a Trump fan and it's it's horrible but these people\nThis is this is the public shaming and the assault which is exactly what he's explain what explains so well I mean you you look at the last week he read two celebrities that have gotten into politics right you had you had Taylor Swift to comes out for a Democrat and says she's terrified of congresswoman running\nIn Tennessee Marsha Blackburn and it terrifies her what would she what she would do if she got elected to the U.S Senate and Democrats came out and said this is a brave\nIndependent woman they threw down the woman card right this is what does that brave independent woman she's brave she's a role model every woman should've should've should look at her and teach your children and your little ... daughters and your and your grandkids to be like hey we're ... because this is what a strong\nBrave role model of a woman looks like\nThen Kanye West comes out for Donald Trump and now he's a token negro that doesn't read he's mentally ill he's an Uncle Tom\nTerrible and and and the things that these guys they say about it it's really really I mean it's on believable it's like they want to put in that they want to institutionalize the guy now where I\nKnow they they want to kidnap him and they want to bring it back to the to the plantation of the Democratic party and then lock him up in solitary confinement than their mental ward so they can control the black man because right now they can't control and then when they can't control a black man who's who's speaking truth to the world they'll tell you though undermine\nYou and say\nYou're

that were going on\nAnd from the you know quake nut rolls and what have you all of the sudden I seem to have like four disturbances although no one could that explain to me what it was prior to that

issues as a token a black\nMan uh and and there and he's taking advantage of using him by putting them out there today no one said any of that when Kanye West came out and said George Bush doesn't like black people\nBecause it was a narrative they wanted to be out there it was the narrative that they want it they they they were OK with that narrative then you are on the Marco venture been
