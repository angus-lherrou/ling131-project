watched Utah play\nAnd just one of the players drink quarterback got knocked down now I I Know what we'll talk about that is actually what they want to go first or whatever you want and I was going to say that a guy that just jumps out the\nAs Britain ... I just think he is such a good\nFootball players flat out and he's just explosive he returned kid he's a heck of a receiver you know that hotly likes him because he target you have a lot more than anybody else and\nNot a gigantic do I mean he's five eight a hundred and Seventy pounds or you know he's a gym rat he just loves to compete and he's a guy that'll getting in between a couple of linebacker catch a path and get crunching gets back up you know you just didn't stay down leading wide receiver a in\nNot only has twice as many catches anybody else on the team\nAnd why not go anywhere on appeal to catch the ball\nAnd you got to have a ... or go to guys that are highly has all of a sudden in the last three games really come on I mean he's completed Seventy seven percent of his passes seven touchdown and it's because he's got that wrong or going with coffee I mean that's just once you get that little bond going between quarterback wide receiver that's when the passing game takes off\nYou and I are going to say the same thing every time I watch her play quarterback and I just feel like something's off the seat and say why the don't look right his arm doesn't look right but he's found a way\nTo be playing at a very high level right now I Wish you could fix that part of him 'cause I think we're going to affect him going for further but he's running the ball with a purpose\nYou know we've talked about this is your ears have you'll ...\nHumbly would not when the beauty pageant on looks yeah he was in a way that our forces that talent portion yeah anyway I mean it's yeah it's basically just to watch it it's off the looks but how he gets it done I mean I mean the numbers speak for themselves and then\nThe other thing about him he will run the ball into a brick wall at first I mean he didn't care that they can't teach them the slide that they try they just won't do it it makes you think the end he played quarterback defensive\nTackle in high school I mean that's his mentality and he just gets out there and he can't get away has fees are great ball handler was that last I mean this is it\nIn your face running game from Hungary and also Zach moss\nAnd and you just said it and this is gonna be ... well I'm going to talk about this later to\nGreat great ruined receiver everybody David Clinton everybody maybe put\nAnyway Zach mosses built a little bit like Clinton you know he's kind of strong in stock and\nI'm like gosh this is great stuff\nBoston is a guide worried about tonight\nI I I remember he's worried about that well if we watched it last week Arizona you know that kind of smaller roles on yeah on a defense rose I get a ... yeah I get I get it but here's the deal I gotta you gotta tackle better than that\nThey've got you got to tackle Zach boss I mean you got to retool does\nAnd they have to do that if they don't do that just can't get law\nYeah I mean that must have just he's a combat you every play I'm I'm not going to really put a move on you you want to but has let's do it you know let's go targeting targeting together I mean he's not doing that in today's ready but he he's a guy that going to run\nThrough you before he runs around you\nMatt this is a run after run after contact team\nCan talk about this all day but the coach wedding\nYou know the way he wears the shirts the way he is he's ... he's just Puff Daddy walk around it comes to the stadium on a motorcycle he's just he's he doesn't everywhere jacket you know he's out there cold weather is just kind of he gets jacked up he ... he gets jacked up\nAbout these teams the way they play where they run the ball the way their quarterback place the way the receivers playing they're not afraid of contact and that leads to the guys up front\nThe orbits of large it seems like every year for Utah bring it home get after you\nThey started a gel actually at the end of November and they were very really fired up because they had to replace their entire off into law in Utah and then last year they started playing better and now this year these guys are really what's the catalyst the running game I mean they're just big due to always three Thirteen three fifty three twenty three Thirteen\nThey all look the same they're going to punch in them out they prefer to run the ball then do they do to pass by I mean they just want to run the ball right down your throat and that's really why Utah doing good a offensively and this is another stat stat is really interesting and gets us see\nThe scoring drives average eighty two yard so they're just staying on the field forever\nWell this is crazy man they're lesser games have been over forty points to I mean they're putting up putting them numbers so yeah and one of those games those at Stanford so this is a team right now that not only like you said time a possession [noise]\nUm and they're they're running the ball or quarterbacks planted a very high level and they've got to tell it on the outside I mean I I'm going to say this and this is that this is probably UCLA has played some really good teams that shit we're talking about their schedule already\nBut this team tonight is a true true true test or not just where there are bad but also for their deepest and\nWe're going before we get off the off into huddling\nTroy Taylor is a great coach and he's a great mentor I mean it was a you know politic path for how he went on to coach Jae grounding Folsom in Folsom I don't know if you've ever seen him play the thought of all almost Seventy times the gangs and when you have a quarterback coaching the quarterback relating I mean that's really important in coyote winning hand deserve a lot of credit\nBecause he only has ... Taylor but he has Gary Anderson is associate head coach\nAnd parents uh recently named the more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors now for the seven year in a row\nAnd without our clients I Would be no aware and so I put that went on them I give it to my clients well this is a part of the show where we talk about how to pass\nOnto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor now this week we're actually going to talk about paying for college\nAnd the gift tax laws so if you were not aware a gift taxes come do if you give anybody more than Fifteen thousand dollars in one year okay [noise] and ah so that's the gift tax and college in many cases more than fifty thousand dollars a year I Know I have one in college right now\nAnd so you could end up having to do a gift tax if you don't do it properly so we're going to talk about that now but first jak that you play it I Know I\n\nWould say\nMy dog and may be\n\n\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite is designed to take you from riches to rags\nAnd we do not want that to happen to use every week at this time we have our state tip of the week so this week we're going to talk about a college education paying for that okay so as I mentioned the gift tax exemption\nIs Fifteen thousand dollars this year so let me give you some history on that one okay so that when when the IRS [laughter]\nAlmost cut you off guard on that one when the IRS came up with the notion of estate taxes this is a tax upon\nYour death then it goes to whoever and they want it attacks that so they created the estate tax but the IRS has a lot of things but it's not stupid and they figured out that if you have a tax that happens upon death\nThan what people are going to do is if they know they're going to die they're going to give it all away first and then when they die there's no tax so we can't have that that would be downright on American not to have some taxes paid\nSo they came up with the gift tax which means that if you try to give it all the way we're going to tax it anyway so you can't get away with that but they also realized that if you tax every single gift you know if I take you out if I pay for dinner with with friends or something that's a gift\nAnd so do I have to file a tax return for that so\nKind of onerous and they'd probably be thrown out of office for it so they made a gift tax exemption and to give tax exemption is Fifteen thousand dollars\nPer person that you can get to and as a married couple you can get thirty thousand dollars to as many people as you said the gift tax exempt amount that fifty thousand is you can get that too many people as you wish um and and that's how that works so college is part of that\nSo one of the things that you want to do so there are additional exemptions too that gift tax\nAnd by the way if you exceed that fifty thousand a gift tax is the same as your state tax and it can get all the way up to almost fifty percent okay so you give a big gift and you may oh half of that in taxes think about that one [noise] so\nHow do you not to pay taxes on college uh on on a college education costs the answer is you don't give the money to the child or to the student\nAnd then have them pay it you pay the institution directly so if you buy all the books you pay for the tuition and all that kind of stuff if you do all of that directly\nAnd you don't have to go through the child then that is an exemption to the gift tax so therefore doesn't count so my advice to you is don't give the child the money now I'll give you that I'll give you that advice because when I was in college\nI'm In my fraternity there was this guy called Scott\nAnd his parents were giving him the money\nTo ostensibly pay for the tuition guess what Scott was doing\nHe wasn't paying the tuition [laughter] he was keeping the money and he used to come down every day and like he had this Chinese ...\nYou know what this does sat in ... and he'd come down in that and he looked like and slept all night he'd wake up in time to watch the gong show remember that bury the was that guy's name Barry something who did the gong show\nHe would wake up in time to watch the show on television and then you know he'd have lunch and he lays around all day spending his tuition money\nSo if you needed another reason not to your child the tuition money it's that [laughter] anyway\n[noise] as I mentioned we are affirming that uh we uh we special we specialize in retirement planning that's what we do so we we work primarily with people who are over fifty who are retired

I Love and\nWell what is the real answers because there's many different answers\nSo you can create a guaranteed lifetime income and still have access to your principal you don't tie up the principal so if you find that you have some emergency have do you start the income you can stop the income and you can reach in ... principal and started back up\nBut they didn't say that the second one is the thing about taking income you still have a gross but they're saying you don't or it's very minimal not true with some annuities again not all our was at work or fix the same way\nFor example you can have an annuity that say it's pay you ten thousand dollars a year and say it's tied to an index say it's died to the Dow Jones of the U.S and the five hundred or a bond index let's say that index goes up ten percent in a given year\nThen there are some particular annuities with what they would do is they would increase the income by the amount of increasing so the ten thousand would go up ten percent or become a eleven thousand misses it very clear on the ad\nAnd it's a responsible to use a generality when you're discussing are so many variations so basically folks you don't tie up your money if you get the right direction if you have someone that's knowledgeable the knows what they're talking about\nOtherwise it's true so which ones which ones false depend on the product itself is like what's the difference between a Ferrari and Volkswagen\nOh depends on what you want to both give up your own transportation they both kitchen where you want to go on a lot sexier though isn't it a lot more expensive\nBut then some people want sexy in six months of others just want practicality or affordability which annuity fits your specific need and they are all the same so don't listen to this generality get specifics [noise]\nNow come off of that one that was something I wasn't prepared to do until I got the phone call in the way here let's go into things that um\nYou need to know may be regarding the political aspects in your pocket book can get away from that [noise]\nThere's a lot of people that want to run for president I die I didn't know the job was available actually I think it's still got to kind of got got person the way there for another couple of years but then maybe the thinking that\nIt was a gentleman by the name of Cory Booker Korea's the senator that's an important position that makes a lot of influence because there's only a few of those guys and girls up [noise]\nAnd he wants to be president well one of the things he wants to get votes on cars that he's decided that if you're in a lower middle class family maybe inner city whatever you're not in the middle class or upper class or upper middle class would want to call these people [noise]\nHe wants to provide a fifty thousand dollar siphon unless steak for every child leaving school so that they have money to go to school on or just set up a business when they're Eighteen and graduate if they graduate\nUm that's very interesting and it really is a little ... isn't it the more you could dependent on the government to pay money to somebody for doing nothing except mean poor or less than middle class [noise]\nHe'll get votes for the parents don't check or maybe even from the Eighteen or Nineteen year old they get said fifty thousand dollars is only one problem Corey where do you get the money see all these goodies everybody loves children right so yeah let's all vote for that where's the money come from comes from your pocket folks\nJust like everything else it's not free [noise]\nAnother situation Maxine Waters Maxine wants all of the businesses to be run by the government\nDo you get the message there and she's going to get re elected because you people keeping the forty third district you keep putting her in office\nAnd of course you've got a big hit because you've been in there for years that is you can't get rid of her butter politics are dangerous nonsense folks who don't want the government running a capitalistic system they don't know how\nOr another center see Lisa influential pit bull named into their centers they want to be president of Elizabeth Warren [noise]\nShe wants to get forty percent of the profit\nFrom corporations back to the community so after paying the regular tax rate for the state and the regular federal right\nWhatever's left in profit she wants to other forty percent to go to the community\nI didn't know that businesses were put together to subsidize the private citizens in this country that's not quite capitalism as it's called something else for so it's progressive notes communism let's do it the right way here everybody gets the same at the expense of the people that are making it\nSee that watch out what you're voting for a while it but he's in another state yes he's in a crazy state uh this stuff gets like disease comes over here too when you have to start dealing with it [noise]\nUh another one that wants

and expert answers about retirement planning to thousands of people now here's Greg five\nLet's talk about the bond\nIssues that are going to be asking you to put your stamp of approval on\nThe number one and it says that um we're going to authorize bugs to funds specified housing assistance programs authorizes four billion dollars in general obligation bonds\nFor existing affordable housing programs for low income residents veterans farmworkers manufactured in mobile units and transit oriented housing whatever that is\nPhysical impact increases estate costs to repay the bonds averaging about a hundred and Seventy million annually over the next thirty five years so the bond for billions going to cost almost six\nWill just an extra hundred and Seventy million a year that's all uh and of course whenever you put in a poor or the veterans see they get your the tug at your heart's don't take\nThe second one authorizes bonds to fund existing housing permits for individuals with mental illness well again you know we got to help the mentally ill don't weigh a it's a amends the mental health service act\nTo fund the no no place like home program which finances how's he printed vigils with mental illness ratifies existing law established for the new place like home program physical impact allows to the state to use up to a hundred and forty million per year of\nCounty mental health funds to repay the two billion in bonds I don't know quite how that works with just move money around isn't it but\nAgain the causes the mentally handicapped we need to take care of those people do it [noise]\nUh let's see what's the next one that they want the bleeding hearts here Dmitri authorizes bonds to fund projects from water supply and quality watershed fish wildlife water conservation groundwater sustainability and storage\nThat says it authorizes eight point eight seven seven billion and state general obligation bonds for various infrastructure projects physical impacts increases a steak cost to repay bonds averaging four hundred and thirty million per year over forty years or a total cost or Seventeen billion dollars folks\nNow who would deny that we want better water we want our fish in our game and we want to be able to collect more water [noise]\nFolks this is a con job took total con job\nWhat were we collecting water where is this going to help how much water runs off the Rocky Mountains into the ocean but we got a governor that thinks a choo choo train for a hundred billion dollars that will serve is virtually no one is better and we can put this in place to\nPaul we have to build a series of dams of the central part of California and considerably less cost and we can capture the runoff\nI'm not running for anything folks but am I just alluded to take care of my too much commonsense or I just you know in fairy tale that I'm Still in Disneyland what kind of garbage is is it's BS folks\nThe fourth one is authorizes bud funding to the construction of hospitals providing children's health care\nAgain you bring kids into the picture you do all the good thing for kids and mentally ill and the people that are homeless and you throw this oh we got to reach out and help these people so we're going to put another one point five billion in bonds\nThe total cost per year for these for bond issues is over six hundred and eighty million dollars per year\nPaying billions of dollars and we already have bonds authorized that haven't been even funded and we got to cheat you train the cost several times with this stuff is worth if we're so upset about the gas registration and the gas tax et cetera what's the matter with you clowns when it comes\nTo this silliness of a train absolute stupid period end of the subject\nIt's got all this money going to nothing and you want more you want more and more and you put out this polar heartstrings for the fish and the water and the clean air and all of that folks\nAnd the interest rates are going up also or get a double whammy\nWe've got housing now slowing ... for the six months in a row ... housing starts because the costs are so prohibitive and now the costs the money is so high that the group that's the biggest home buyer potential is the thirty five and under the millenniums\nThey don't have the jobs to support the cost and the interest rate\n[noise] ah also we had different kinds of loans and those good old days didn't we see the government decided to make loans real simple\nLiars loans you go in you need a hundred thousand dollars a qualified for that house which is just love which only making Seventy five no problem right down a hundred put on a hundred and five will be a little little extra fat there and there was no tax return checks there was no income checks they didn't contact your employer they just said okay that's it let's make the loan on that basis [noise]\nAnd then they couldn't pay for it down the road and it fell apart [noise]\nWhat was countrywide was responsible for something like a trillion dollars of these Sony loans and they fell apart\nNow what have we got access to money is much tougher you have to have that twenty percent now you have to have certain ratios of like fifty five percent alone value including car payments and credit cards can qualify folks have put in a real tough market and it's going to cause the bull to run out of gas [noise]\nNow we gotta stop paid for guessing also\nOkay the first step is that you're in that red zone K investing their money it's going to be a little tougher to do isn't it is no longer just throw it up on the wall\nFull of hearing that five year before retirement or in retirement what I'd like to refer to as the red zone you need some common sense with dealing with this may be the bowl in the market [noise]\nYou've got to protect your money now I hear this protect your money all the time no I'm Talking about protect you own a home been there\nFor twenty Thirty years family grew up in it had a lot of equity right\nTo protect it or do you ensure it protection is words folks insurance is real value me protective do you guarantee your home to protect what's the chance your house is going to burn down one of the million yeah\nSomething like that so why should just go back and say the pregnant no because if it does your wiped out so you ensure it\nWhat about your health insurance I didn't carry health insurance until I was about fifty 'cause I was single I started late in life but I got married and had kids up different story I Wish I had insurance on my dogs to these things cost me my leg but why do you ensure you hell\nBecause you can't afford to be wiped out I've got a client that has cancer this by\n[noise] she goes in for treatment every two weeks\nSince there for a couple of hours plugs are in goes through whatever process chemotherapy then goes home is fine for two weeks it cost a hundred thousand dollars every two weeks how can anybody afford that if they didn't have health insurance would you go without health insurance it'd be crazy\nSo you ensure you protected don't you why aren't you rip protecting your retirement why is it ensured somebody help me with this I don't get it he'd rather give it to money man I guess there's the charging one and a half to two percent and it takes away twenty five percent of the game\nOver long term you lose money and when the market doesn't go well goes down you get loose twice\nYou know here it was a sad commentary vanguard those are index funds John Bogle ... started the kinds of years ago [noise] it's a very very low cost it's a hold in the hope approach they do not manage or move the money around or guess when the virus so if they hold and hope you diversify you let it hold [noise]\nHow'd you put your money and big guards indexed say that the total index that he has to be five hundred index ten Fifteen Years ago it would have outperformed over Ninety percent of these money managers because you didn't have to overcome these ridiculous fees and the guessing\nSo you've got a less than ... percent chance of out performing just sticking it into a low cost of a fifteenth of what your money managers charge and they can't overcome that the doctor will you lose they win and you could have just one by just being in a low cost well diversified index fund that what's the problem with it\nYou still have risked don't you\nSo you go into an index type of deal and you ensure the money\nAnd you take away no fees\nAnd you set up what's called a compound in the future again not a simple return now next week I'll give you a little promo ahead of time we're going to talk about the biggest secret about investing in the stock market [noise] see the stock market doesn't compounds your returns\nIt's a simple or what they refer to as total return [noise] there's a huge difference between total returned and compound due to return so there are vehicles that you could invest into the market tied to the market that compound your gains\nSo they outperform the total return so this is something you need to discover and it's a very intense product far as how it works so let's go take some time and I'm going to lay it out next week step by step\nIssue by issues that you fully understand how this stuff works because you're not being told the truth about how you can get involved in this stuff\nBut you don't have to worry about the market going up or down you don't have to be feeding some organization thousands of dollars to guess your market for you and they fail Ninety plus present\nThe time to keep up with the market because they can't overcome but the ... of the seat that you keep pain and this is old school I've said this before this kind of the school went away Twenty years ago but these guys can't help but during that drug gardening the drug is to take the money [noise]\nWhenever you can and make you gifts that they are really something special that they are just terrific they know more than you do about managing your money they don't know squat folks it's throw it up on the wall and guess that's what money managers do\nThey diversify put you into multiple sectors well you can do that yourself older you know when they get out do they then why are they still hustling for clients\nIf they were they knew how to get out there to show that the market a long time ago where they got you out to the end of January folks when the market was at its peak because it's not there now\nAnd if I'm right that the elements to push the bear market for the last eight or nine years or not there anymore interest rates are too high buildings going down the prices are too high a consumer can't buy this stuff\nTech stocks way overpriced that's what the six hundred point drop was on Wednesday\nTech stocks showing bad reviews bad returns returns hurt them but it's more than that the capital it's changed the availability of capital has changed the game has changed there's no more of that big government throwing a bunch of money around making things better\nWas government keep asking for more money California more bonds more ... more but because they can't live within their own budget\nAnd the answer is to stick it to you for more with some ... some strong of oatmeal it's for kids or it's for the air the water to where it's nonsense has already regulations up the was it for that\nIt's asking for bonds for stupid stuff like a train\nGet mad about the trains folks stopped issuing war bonds in an area that they can't afford to pay for them because it's you that's good to pay for the eventual isn't it can you afford to spend another ten percent of your money to pay for all those bad management of money\nI doubt it next week folks who isn't on call some friends neighbors et cetera were going to get down to the nitty gritty of how not to invest or what you should know about investing and what Wall Street doesn't want you to know the real facts of how to put money to work for you safely and efficiently\nSo look forward to it don't miss it ... and the kids the family the neighbors this is an important important story to learn so have a good weekend and I look forward to mess in your brain housing group up\nNext we have a good when\nYou've been listening to Greg ... on my investments are remember when it comes to your money

professional or other relationships for\nAnd yet the market seems to defy gravity and continue growing but if you're a client of mine I think it's important for you to understand that my primary motivation and helping you invest for income doesn't have a lot to do with the stock market\nBuff more or less has to do with the fact that it does not support our core value of protecting your principal and giving you the lifetime income you need so that you don't have to worry about running out of money\nAt the same time I do believe that the market out some problems ahead and I've been concerned about the market for very long time and I'm Still concerned\nAs a matter of fact the longer we go without a big correction more concerned I be gum and yet when you listen to the media this is not the picture they're painting right what's your hearing out there is that the economy is as good as it's ever been never been stronger that's what's being reported and it's not that this\nInformation is outright false that the media is just outright lying to you but there are certainly a lot of misinformation out there that make the economy look better than it is and let's face it\nDoesn't media want you to think that the market is going to have a major correction of course not\nDo you ever watch Fox News or CNBC we're all the advertisers there all the big wall street firms the firms that sell all the stocks or mutual funds that let me ask you does your stockbroker want you to think that stocks are going to go down no do the mutual fund companies want you to think that the market's going to have a major correction or worse of course not\nThen it goes to say that the mainstream media who are funded by these large firms also don't want you to think that the market's gonna crash they'd be shooting themselves in the foot if they're reporting was contrary to all the advertisers interest\nTherefore the information you're getting is biased and not in your favor you know a couple of years ago I was interviewed on CNBC\nAnd I flew out to their studios in New York in the day before I sent them my notes and I guess if you're going to be speaking on live TV to an audience of three hundred million plus international viewers because I don't want to have an idea is what you're going to say before you said\nAnd once I set my notes I got to tell you within thirty seconds they called me and said you can't say that\nAnd what they did not want me to say\nIs that I Believe the next time the market crashes it could be worse than two thousand eight\nSo I Know how buys the media is because I've been censored but in a way that kind of makes sense right because\nWhat happens if all the professionals get on TV and say the market's gonna crash but then it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy so what kind of makes sense that they don't want you to hear this information but that just means that what you're hearing out there from the media is biased and I think it's important to recognize that\nJust so if nothing more than being able to land appropriately\nAnd I'm not going to spend any time now talking about why I think our next crash could be worse than the crash of developed an eight I've talked about that a lot on our past shows what you can listen to by\nGoing to our website at Providence financial radio dot com or if you want to learn more about why I think the market out some problems coming up and how big those problems could be that I've got a book that I'm willing to give you written by good friend of mine Jeff small\nAnd this book is called turning financial planning writes tied up and he spends almost the entire book talking about the fundamentals of the market and why these fundamentals don't match up with\nReality or with what the media's reporting and I've got a few copies left I think that's so important that if you want one of these copies you didn't call me now and I'll make sure that we get one to you and we'll save you the twenty five dollars that it would cost you if you're going to go on Amazon it by it\nBut you can call me now eight four four seven eight eight call that number is eight four four seven eight eight call and we've got operator standing by you're not going to get a busy signal\nJust give us your information and one of my team members will get in touch with you next week and let you know what you need to do to get a copy of this book written by Jeff small turning financial planning right side up or if you'd rather text us just touch the word book\nTwo three one three one three one again that's the word book two three one three one three one won't touch base with you next week\nAnd that being said I've been expecting a major correction or even a crash for three or four years now and\nIt hasn't happened and I've had to ask myself why not what am I missing and so I Do want to spend a few minutes talking about why I think this inevitable correction it's been so elusive the answer I Believe it is because much of this recovery\nThe recovery that we've been going through since March night the two thousand nine the longest recovery and bull market history\nThis recovery I Believe this recovery has been built on an artificial foundation and furthermore I Believe the Federal Reserve is that a big hand in spring this artificial recovery by keeping rates so low now for so long\nThis artificial recovery really all stems from low interest rate so I Want to spend a few minutes talking about that in two thousand eight of the market was melting down the feds have lowered the interest rates down to zero\nBut this did not stop the crash therefore the Federal Reserve pulled out another tool out of its to box a tool they call quantitative easing and chewy it's just another word for printing money so the feds began issuing free money to the bank so that they would have a supply of money to loan out\nAnd because rates are so low consumers and corporations could borrow the money is virtually no cost free money\nIf consumers and corporations could get their hands on free money then presumably they would spend it and if they would spend it then it would increase corporate revenue and if it increased corporate revenue than corporate profits would increase of corporate profits increase than the stock price would increase in their stock price has increased across the board than the market crash would\nCome to a halt and that was the goal of quantitative easing to stop the crash\nBut the problem is printing money as artificial inserting free money into the economy it's artificial it\nMesses with the normal business cycles that economies must go through to remain healthy and this was the start of the artificial manipulation of the market back in two thousand nine and I think it's even arguable as to whether the crash was halted by this or not it might have already rented normal cycle and would have ended anyway\nSo we don't really know if ... worked\nBut what we do know is that the government went on to print money for roughly six or seven years and put this country and that that the feds went through four rounds of quantitative easing with the last one ending several years ago now and because of that or national debt is now over Twenty one trillion dollars\nMost of it because if you eat them because if you eat\nOur country has gone into more debt in the last ten years then this country has in the entire previous history of this country yeah let me say it again our country has gone into more debt in the last ten years then we had in the entire previous history of this country because of quantitative easing\nAnd yet someone's got to pay it back who do you think that's going to be it's going to be your kids and your grandkids\nBut at the beginning of this recovery began with the artificial stimulus of quantitative easing but it did not end there\nThere are really many other ways in which the government and the media distort the true reality of our economy to make it look better than it really is\nFor example let's look at the unemployment rate and inflation rate the bureau of Labor Statistics is reporting the unemployment rate to be three point eight percent and this is the number that everyone focuses on but guess what this number doesn't include certain classes of people\nMany millennials right now who are just getting out of high school and\nAll the way up to maybe mid thirties or so they would like to get a job but they can't get one but because they've never had a job they're not counted in the unemployment that so that three point eight percent doesn't include them there's another class of people do and those are the pre retirees who are fifty five or sixty years old who would like to still continue working\nBut also can't get a job so that forced into retirement early but guess what these people are not counted in the unemployment sat there not counted in the three point eight percent\nAnd get this if you lost your job\nAnd you're exhausted you unemployment benefits regardless of how old you are you're no longer counted in the unemployment that\nYou're still would have a job you're not getting a paycheck which are no longer unemployed as far as that three point eight percent as concert your not known it so when you take all this into consideration is the unemployment rate of three point eight percent is that really a true number\nOr is it fair to say that that's probably an artificial number by excluding all the people we just talked about the government is artificially manufacture the unemployment rate to be around three point eight percent but when you do in fact take all of these other\nUnemployed people into consideration and you'd throw them in\nThe true unemployment and under employment rate is likely on the double digit rate\nAgain artificial number not reality\nAnd if you want to read more about that and about some of the other things that the government is doing and reporting that has really artificial then you've got to get your hands on the book that I'm offering this show written by good friend of mine Jeff small\nA book that's called turning financial planning right set up where he talks about why the market is likely to have some problems ahead\nAnd some of the artificial information that's being reported out there like we're talking about in this show if you call me now I'll make sure that we get a copy in your possession that number's eight four four seven eight eight call or you can text the word book two three one three one three one\nAnd in some situations they're willing to do whatever it takes to increase the earnings for share even if it's not necessarily in the best interest of the company or the shareholders\nI think McDonalds is probably a good example of that\nMcDonalds executives depend on their earnings per share for eighty percent of their paying eighty percent\nSo you know they want to eat he has to be high end because of this executive incentive McDonalds bought that so many shares between two thousand sixteen and two thousand Eighteen using borrowed money\nThat it caused their credit rating to go down so they were willing to sacrifice their credit for their executives does that sound like a fundamental reason to borrow money and buy back to your own shares of course not\nBut this is what's happening out there and you need to know it\nAnd you're not going to hear from mainstream media unfortunately I'm not tied to any of that my financial practice I'm

Jerry Lewis which and we feel that a big part of people's financial anxiety is cause but all I call the fear of the unknown and I'm Talking about the financial no\nPeople desire to have a great lifestyle you desire to have a happy retirement you desire to have all your dreams your aspirations your desires come true at least in your golden age but for most of you you probably haven't spent enough time sledding one\nTo be really certain to be really sure that you have it all covered financially\nSeat you don't know what you don't know\nThat no matter what comes your way you want to be prepared both mentally and financially to deal with it so it would all be at least okay that you know that it's coming\nSo to hear on your money talks were going to cover how to avoid the four of the biggest mistakes that can cost you your retirement\nAnd if you follow these for actions steps you move from worrying about retirement towards positive action to ensure that all your retirement dreams and desires country\nStep number one and the biggest mistake people have is you need to have a comprehensive financial plan most people don't have that it needs to cover\nEverything see retirement isn't just about one thing it's about many things all working together if you don't plan for them to work together they could work in opposition and that could cause a lot of distress both emotionally and financially\nLike Social Security very simple you take it early or do you let it grow\nHow do you get a living income to replace your paycheck when you stop working do you draw from your four one K. is your for all three bees your IRAs you draw from your taxable savings and investment accounts where do you draw your income from first\nThe retirement accounts or he already taxed accounts or from Social Security see there's at least three decisions right there that most people don't have the answer to\nThe wonder there's financial anxiety even if you have a lot of money as they say more money more problems she needed to have a financial comprehensive game plan\nNow there's two kinds of people right now that are listening to this program there are those without a financial game plan and their nerves there in a panic they're wondering if they have enough then they look at the stock market and it gets even worse there wringing their hands nervously watching the market every single day\nEssentially their plan\nIs based on out and then there's others who do have a plan and their calm and killed as a cucumber\nOne only at you run through this process than she did you develop your investment plan to see a lot of people have a lot of money they don't have a plan they should have planned before you have the money but that's okay [noise] but for most you're listening right now oh bet your experience has been more of a ready shoot in any type of process\nThen you may have a lot of money and investments and only now are you starting to have that plant\nAnd are written plan is probably a good idea I remember I can help you on that welcome back to your money talks of Jerry Lewis with us thirty year financial planner and advisor today recovering how to avoid the four biggest mistakes that can cost you your entire retirement\nNo there hasn't been much I haven't seen over my vast experience which I Know is very important that we avoid these biggest mistakes\nIn the first have recovered step wanting to need to have a comprehensive written game plan and then step to you know to recognize that you can and should control the risk when it comes to your money in your investments step number three is you cannot overlook obvious and not so obvious obstacles that relates to our retirement\nI'm going to call it an obstacle longevity is one of them will that's obvious because we all desire longevity everyone wants to live a long time and you know very few people I Know say I want to die\nYou know it's obvious want longevity but inflation not so obvious comes with longevity inflation meet higher cost of living of everything really for milk food cheese gas close Burger King all of it\nHistorically inflation spin around three percent over my lifetime this years two point eight percent that's what the effects of Social Security for for next year you're getting Social Security and to give to ... percent raise next year\nSo let's put that into numbers if you need five thousand dollars per month in out of pocket that's what you got to come out of your investments because after your Social Security and I mentioned is sixty thousand dollars a year for twelve months at five thousand a month with a two point eight percent inflation which is what the department is saying that that's what it is\nTo Fifteen Years if not five thousand dollars anymore that Seventy six hundred dollars per month so instead of sixty thousand per year it actually costs you Ninety One thousand dollars in cost for a year over fifty percent higher you have a plan to pay for your higher costs down the road or is your plan the kinds of his hope and pray\nPray to help I mean but I got help those who ... themselves you need to do a cash flow analysis for today and again for your retirement date and then for ten and Twenty years down the road to understand\nWhat your future intimate expenses will look like\nAnd healthcare costs as another obstacle that's not so obvious far too many seniors failed to address one of the single most expensive items that are likely to incur in retirement and that's their health care expenses or close to three fourths of ... or older adults have expressed concern that affording health care and retirement\nFar too few are actually making plans on how they're going to cover their costs\nThose don't even understand how to make these plans or even how to estimate how much money they'll need for care\nIn fact fifty three percent of affluent older Americans responding to a recent nationwide survey said they didn't know how to estimate the future health care expenses and sixty five percent had no clue how to ask me long term care costs you can't afford to go without a plan for health care is a senior now in fact\nYou start planning as early as possible ... money aside today cover those long term care expenses healthcare costs during your golden years you don't have a savings for long term care you're making a major mistake seven out of ten people won't eat it\nAccording to a different sources of typical sixty five year old couple can expect to spend north of two hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars on health care and medical expenses that's not covered by Medicare\nThat's not covered by Medicare over a quarter million dollars one big reason why so many people make this mistake of not planning for health care costs is they take Medicare is going to cover it that Medicare is major covers limitations are more than half of that one older adults leave this Medicare part B coverage you know is free it's not free\nOlder adults underestimate light the costs of care and most or take talking with their financial advisors about planning for health care costs and more than half a survey responded with financial advisors said they haven't broach the subject of health care with their class because they consider health care to be a personal issue it's not it's my issue as a financial planner\nYou need to work with the right person\nUnforeseen not talking to your advisor learning the truth about Medicare is the lead seniors to save far too little and again these out of pocket cost for a couple could reach over four hundred thousand dollar mark\nA long term care semi private room his route eighty five thousand dollars private room around Ninety seven thousand dollars most people think long term care is covered by Medicare is not I\nDon't think you'll need long term care according to Forbes nearly Seventy percent of all people who lived at age sixty five will require some form of long term care\nBut a huge factor in most people's retirement plan is lacking as their lifestyle plan\nMust include your spouse if you have one\nIn his ... this should be obvious but I mean people every day and it's really not what are you going to do with your time that your lifestyle what are you gonna do with your time to retire because what you do with your time usually comes with the cost how much will it cost you to do you want to do with your time that's how we got to figure out your income\nMistake people they just I'll travel in my early years I'll get that out of my system by expensive to go down later because I Want to have to replace my car my clothes travel get cheaper leaving when I tell you I've been working with seniors for over Thirty years what retirees discretionary spending may go down their medical costs go up to fill that void and then some\nHe'll spend more every year the older you get\nNo matter what your lifestyle choices I assure you the final obstacles not having an income strategy to pay for all this and that might not be so obvious\nBecause we're tournaments not about one thing that's about many things all working together you get to maximize the benefit you go from Social Security for you and your spouse you have a plan to create your own income to supplement your Social Security\nRetirement isn't about the money you have only it's about the amount of lifetime income you can create from your expenses from your income from your investments to cover your expense\nFor him off and are free save for retirement income check of just listening this is for the first ten callers or textures with at least a hundred thousand dollars of investment last it's the number to call or text as one eight hundred for for nine nine five zero one the one eight hundred for for nine\nNine five zero one will first performed for free the Social Security and house which alone we normally charges a hundred and fifty dollar value\nThe Social Security now says well you decide the very best time for you to collect Social Security benefits for your family if you're married are you and your spouse might be able to maximize that benefit\nThis is usually a million dollar decision that's how much benefit you get from Social Security and then we'll look at that retirement income gap how much more monthly income when you need to create from your savings from your ... your eye or raise another investments after calculating your Social Security pension to real estate and outside business income\nWill perform that all important ... for you today for your desire retirement age and what happens you expenses after ten and Twenty years after retirement due to the negative effects of inflation\nWhich means higher costs also look at your sources of income to cover the rapidly rising costs of health care now you might be able to pay for the devastating costs of long term care which seven out of ten blisters right now we need some help on the safe retirement income checkup absolutely free and there's no obligation\nJust call or text right now one eight hundred for for nine nine five zero one that's one eight hundred\nFor for nine nine five zero one to get started leaves you named telephone number you'll be on your way to was smarter and more successful retirement no matter what your situation is today to be one of the first ten callers or you can test right now one eight hundred for for nine\nNine five zero one one eight hundred for for nine nine five zero one\nThe fourth and final mistake to avoid to not have your retirement decimated is not having a plan for a safe income\nYour lot of people have investments in the stock market they figure they'll sell that\nThis is where most people get themselves in real trouble they make knee jerk emotional financial decisions based on fear and greed and react to the markets were emotional by nature we get excited when the stock market goes up and people panic when the stock market go down to is a lot of people are wired to buy and sell low the markets are high\nYou know this is obviously a quick way to lose your entire life savings to get that wrong you want to have a plan for income\nWant to focus on income versus growth\nWould have some growth and protect against inflation which some girl I call it purpose based investing many people today are taking on far too much risk the minority and there's a couple of come see me they had over two million dollars they need it less than three percent return to meet all their need after their you're guaranteed income from Social Security and and and other sources\nYet they're Seventy two percent of their money in the stock market at risk\nWould you feel you're missing out to try to get an average temper sent returning to stop
