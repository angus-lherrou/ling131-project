{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "And it's told us a little bit earlier what is that conflict of interest\nWhile the conflict of interest is the fact that many executives are these corporations get paid based on what the earnings per share it so they want the earnings for share to be high because it makes a stock more attractive\nAnd in some situations they're willing to do whatever it takes to increase the earnings for share even if it's not necessarily in the best interest of the company or the shareholders\nI think McDonalds is probably a good example of that\nMcDonalds executives depend on their earnings per share for eighty percent of their paying eighty percent\nSo you know they want to eat he has to be high end because of this executive incentive McDonalds bought back so many shares between two thousand sixteen and two thousand Eighteen using borrowed money\nThat it caused their credit rating to go down so they were willing to sacrifice their credit for their executives does that sound like a\nAmanda McClintock is a member and Gerard ... who specializes in the areas of personal injury products liability and insurance bad faith they are champions of justice for the little guy\nEach week we hosted as informative and entertaining our bring clarity to the headline generating legal challenges of the day well we're going to look at the legal field in a different way today\nTo avoid putting their audiences to sleep motion picture makers have had to use artistic license freely to create good courtroom drama\nThe niceties a procedure ethics and due process go out the window to ensure the entertainment value is not jeopardized\nStill in spite of there's an easy marriage of law and film the court room has been a favorite haunt of screen writers and directors for more than sixty years probably due to the simple fact that\nReal human drama does get played out in the courtroom day after day and the public find these stories interesting [noise]\nWell you're gonna find today's show interesting because our guest is professor Paul Berkman\nFall Bergman is a law professor at UCLA he is the co author of real justice the courtroom goes to the movies real in this case is spelled R. E. E. L. as in a real a film\nHe teaches film and the law and he helps direct the street law clinic in which students teach legal concepts to high school students as a law student he felt that his duty to keep\nLiberty in the classroom and\nPractice he continues as a teacher earning him the gratitude of his students\nNot sure what his professors said at the time [noise]\nHe joined professor David vendor in pioneering the school of laws clinical program in early Nineteen Seventy feet primarily teachers evidence\nHe combines art with the law and as analyze and observed every movie pretty much ever created about lawyers and the law boy we got an interesting program for you today Tom\nHi everybody hey thanks for coming okay date dino\nEnough of this judge baloney enough of this lawyer baloney we got the real deal whole field going air force now I'm not kidding you on this [noise] you know the professor um is a a sucker for ... professor at UCLA\nOr his students love him enormously and he brings something in the legal profession which you don't see too much [noise]\nHe has an artistic view of things you know generally lawyers or you're right you're wrong you're guilty or innocent engineering and um they they fall in love with that\nBut here the professor has gone a different route not only does he know evidence and knows how to teach evidence and those courses but also he's looked at her lawyer should the are depicted on screen [noise] I've done this a little bit they've dino to be honest I've done a couple of 'em\nLectures on persuasion ... and how lawyers persuade\nOne of the ways you persuade is total belief in the client and wanted the movies that we'll discuss here is a film about her lawyer that totally believed in his client who says\nThe defendant is not guilty [laughter]\nYou know ... and uh some of the some of the things we've looked at her total belief in principles the cross examination of Jack Nicholson uh on the stand [noise]\nWhere he says you lie under the very freedom that I provide you and then question manner in which I provided [noise] I Wish you would simply say thank you and then the cross examination question is\nIs you order the code red here yeah right I did um so both those people believed in the principals involved enormously and those are ways of persuasion a\nSoft sell to persuade her [noise] Henry Fonda in\nThe jury he's in there with the jury and\nHe says well you know that knife really here let me show this knife\nAnd steady set up the jury they said there was a very unusual knife wouldn't it Oh yes it was nothing like it no there isn't a she cooked a mall in many slams duplicate knife on the table and [noise] so the law profession I'm\nIs in the persuasion business and how you persuade and so forth and I think that the movies teach us a lot I don't know if they're all entirely accurate or I'm going to ask professor or\nAbout his views on this but David you know it's really great to have the professor with us [noise] he's given the so much thought I'm so excited to hear what he has to say welcome professor Bergman to the show\nThank you it's a really great to be Tom thanks for inviting me how did you get this way okay [laughter] how 'bout that high\n[noise] well my uh the love of movies started pretty early I grew up in in LA or in terms of a courtroom movies\nI when I started teaching evidence I was looking for a a way to introduce students in the subject matter without just talking about principles or appellate court cases that yeah looking for a way to have a variety of materials that we could talk about in the classroom\nBecause I think whatever you do you get bored if you keep doing the same thing every day so I I started looking for\nA clip from courtroom movies uh that we can analyze a with the students just as though they were a actual lawyers doing actual things because\nYou know believe it or not Tom sometimes or judges in an actual cases don't make the correct decision sometimes lawyers asking proper questions witnesses gave improper answers so regardless of the truth of the uh\nTestimony detected in the clip or the students they'll have to think about what what would you do with that actually happened in a courtroom and your lawyer involved in that case\nI you know I'm going to tell you something I did a little research on you not only from your legal background and you're teaching background in your movie background [noise] but um I have a couple of plants over there at that school ... and I asked them what do you think of the professor [noise]\nThis one young woman sent me this is a true story is the only clash you never skip\n[laughter] about that ball or that's what I hear that I've ever asked that question isn't that a nice thing to say it is lovely to hear I you know I think that as a law\nSchool a teacher and it goes back to what you're talking about time for a courtroom lawyer\nOr maybe just about anyone if you you have to demonstrate passion and I always feel that if I don't demonstrate why I'm interested in what we're talking about in class [noise] why should the students be interested in it so I Try to teach in a way that suggests my passion and interest in the subject matter\nYou remind me a lot of demand McClintock a partner and our from\nWho's the only artistic person in the firm ... without a doubt at least the only artistic lawyer Amanda\nGive movies in ...\nOh I think they do quite a bit I think for most people\nMost of what they know about the law lawyers the legal system or comes from movies and TV shows\nUh you know not long ago it was a you've heard of the ah television judge judge Judy or the California judicial commission gets more complaints about judge Judy than any actual judge people watch that on television and\nI think that she's an actual yet and are are they object to her rulings are manner or so yes I think people today you know in a judge or a lawyer and a movie or TV show says\nThis is the rule I think uh people uh accept that as that must be the ruler they wouldn't sad\nWhen a when a TV series a legal TV series are popular and they sort of come and go or movies legal movies become popular and they come and go when they're popular isn't it true that we normally them see a boost in applications to a law schools\nYes about uh well I guess over Twenty years ago now LA law was one of the best thing that ever happened to law school or a enrollment because uh that glamorize the work of lawyers they seem to be having a a wonderful time while earning huge salaries and\nNow that motivated people go to law school a\nThousand roughly Twenty years before that when I was a applying to law school I think we had more social justice oriented films like inherit the when to kill a Mockingbird and and people saw that and saw the legal profession as a way to have a positive impact on society\nProfessor Saturday Night\nSeven o'clock I'm In the sixth grade Perry Mason baby [noise] man he laid it out it was a total gentleman his one last record was phenomenal\nAnd as a matter of fact I uh I that was the reason I Want to be a lawyer later on they had another show on that was the worst for a little bit more feisty but at least Perry was awesome\nExactly exactly I think that today but most people that you know are a look at computers like a TV look at movies most\nOf us are visual learners and the more lawyers can make a information visual are generally the more ah persuasive it is I think\nWe're going to talk about your book later manager wants to talk about that but\nYou know being a trial lawyer warned the persuasion business how do you persuade how can you best tell the truth that it makes an impression on that jury and indeed addict is just is a pretty good job yes he did okay [noise]\nYou're listening to champions of justice with tons of rowdy and demanded McClintock and our guest today is professor Paul Bergman is a professor of law at UCLA also the co author of real justice the courtroom goes to the movies will be dealing on and off with the book throughout today's program\nAnd we're dealing with as well some of the other aspects of the law and justice Tom you want to talk more about persuasion or tell me more about that from your perspective I mean\nYou represent clients that have a lot at stake so you really need to do a lot of persuasion you know you do\nBut more importantly the words that you use have to make sense to the people that are listening to them\n[noise] it doesn't do any good to be talking a\nMath to people that aren't really know anything about man you got to talk to people in terms that they truly understand that just like addict has just did a few minutes ago [noise]\nAnd the ability of a lawyer I think and how you're gauge how successful you'll be his the ability to be able to persuade with the truthfulness of the case and being able to put it out there how much\nPreparation we heard earlier about the preparations lawyer did him in the movie my cousin Vinny how much preparation do you need to do how much do you have to be up on the subject matter that you're dealing with in the courtroom\nTons of ... you know we use mock juries a professor and um we tell the story in different ways we get a reaction back\nAnd it's all the same story but it's tools is a different emphasis and so forth and it's very interesting that um this type of ... this works on this type of the jurors this works\nBecause this client has everything invested in you and we're going to start the case against the Dodgers in a couple of weeks and that client has everything invested in a ... and if we don't do the best possible job is going to be terrible and\nSome days especially when things work out will in a courtroom as you're driving back to the office you say holy Toledo you know can you imagine getting paid to do this this is so much but [noise] other days Paul you know it's not quite as good\nRight you're listening to champions of justice with ... and amend McClintock our guest today is professor Paul Berkman he is a professor of law at UCLA also the co author of real justice the courtroom goes to the movies Amanda\nWhat do you think of your favorite ... evidence for the new movie [noise]\nWell you there's so many I I Would uh I\nI Would give an example from a film that are probably not too many people have ever seen I'll go back to the mid forties for a\nA movie that I write about in real justice a called a criminal court and ah in this movie a defense lawyer is\nRepresenting the clients charged with murder as they usually are in films at a time I know you do great work and civil cases but I'll be by a large audience that seem to like to see a movies in which somebody is charged with murder or so anyway and this is a\nA film the or a defense lawyers or cross examining a witness who claims to have been standing on a street corner\nOr when the defendant ran up pulled out a gun and shot the person standing next to Emily so he's your classic eye witness who points to the a defendant there in court is the person who ran up and pulled out the gun\nA ad in cross examination they\nA defense lawyer becomes increasingly are angry accuses him of lying the a prosecutor objects the judge says what's wrong with you or you know you can't behave yourself I'm going to have to kick you out of the courtroom or in a defense lawyer gets angrier and angrier and angrier and says it's obvious there's no\nChance for justice in this courtroom I'm going to have to take justice into my own hands\nAnd with that he pulls out a\nA a gun from his pocket guy waves that around the courtroom uh and the witness who says he still calmly by watching this had to find it on a street corner pull out the gun a dive for cover behind a uh the witness chair\nOr the jurors die for cover the prosecutor dies to cover the or a spectators rush out of the uh a courtroom\nEr and at that point the or the defense lawyer goes and asked the jurors to get up and I look at a a witness who says he said calmly by [laughter] or watching a will for murder take place as he cowardice behind a witness chair [noise]\nAh so I Love that that demonstration I Love that use of the testimony to demonstrate that ah it's implausible and what's really interesting about that is that basically took place in an actual case that was tried in Los Angeles\nOr in the early Nineteen hundreds the lawyer was role Rogers are probably somebody I heard of\nThat I have indeed matter of fact I [noise]\nYou know they they know if you take from one person is called stealing if you take from everybody it's research I've read Earl Roger stuff and I've read a bunch of a whole other lawyers great stuff and have stolen from a mall [noise]\nSo on the way over though we're talking about this American McClintock day dino no kidding is truly one of the finest lawyers in California acknowledge by by everybody\nAnd it's we're coming over to do the show Amanda says you know Tom women do or not treated very well in the movies go ahead Amanda\nIn reading your book cover to cover and of course it's really really a great read fake ... ... very few ... female lawyer\n... positive light can you think of any\nWell probably the [noise] it's amazing we probably have to go back\nSixty years of my math isn't too good\nTo Adam's Rib and uh I I think the portrayal of the lawyer there are portrayed by Katherine Hepburn or who really uh uh takes on a a a client who's accused of\nTrying to kill her husband because he's a carrying on an affair [noise] uh and she said this is really an early feminist movie where\nAre you know she asked the or as she talks about how the unwritten law would protect the man in a situation that it doesn't protect women\nAre that are all she's asking more as the justice that a man would get in this situation to be made it out for a woman and she's probably the strongest image of a female lawyer and the most positive image\nOr that we have are still even though that movie was made a around Nineteen fifty and and here we are about a of more than sixty years later still waiting for another positive atmosphere and a lot\nOf the current films that have the featured a female lawyers a few good men was one of them are Demi Moore her character was not portrayed very nicely\nNot at all she supposedly in the film the lawyer that has all the experience\nUh yet uh I Believe his name is lieutenant Kathy played by Tom Cruise\nOr although he's never tried a case in his life uh spends most of his time playing a softball or all of a sudden he takes over and tells her how we're going to do things and and she just kind of fades away into the woodwork that is really an embarrassing for child\nThere's an interesting uh sort of a hybrid between these two and that is from the movie legally blond oh yeah you get one of their goal scene you know the ugly blond yeah take a listen to this and it kind of touches on okay here's how you cross examine but also here's how you do your research here's how you know what you're talking about\nI went down [noise] what have you done earlier that day [noise]\nI got I got a lot say once again that a parent and came home [noise]\nSo you got and sour [noise]\nI Believe the witness has made it clear that she was in the shower [laughter]\nCan I think [noise]\nThat many ways [noise] to a year since I was a trial in that [noise]\nYou know around ... thirty for my phone cut that out at the park\nTo the market stretch selling that same day and they didn't have a white T shirt contact with completely head down had cats\nAnd he goes in and turned he goes well fight for you and they ... the second half of the economy into a hospital and they sat there and they pray nonstop and then the rest of the doubt that they thought they did\nThe triple the size of his army or the nuns kept praying and they only had Thirteen or dead or about Seventy wounded where the British lost ... lost a thousands and we'll blow it out and forty five minutes and among the people thought this was divine intervention was Andrew Jackson himself\nYeah and he uh according to many reports he came back\nAnd thanked the nuns afterward and thanked them for that or you know\nThe other twenty five year anniversary did not go to the battlefield he went to visit the common to thank them and they all noted it and they celebrate January age every year to this day at one point it was the second biggest holiday in the country and then I guess after the civil war things restructured\nYeah I mean look at it [laughter] everything restructured after the civil war I've I've President Trump has as you note in the afterwards to your book the book is Andrew Jackson the miracle of New Orleans it's posted on our website ... Michael midday dot com\nAnd I should also noticed Brian did that or the battle of New Orleans and the miraculous details concerning that battle also feature in my book the American miracle\nYeah the ah\nPresident Trump is restored Andrew Jackson's portraits of the White House and he clearly admires president Jackson thought could President Trump for this moment in his presidency with all of its challenges to he learn something from Jackson's example\nI think so because Jackson was like LBJ LBJ was Jackson more where he said okay what do you need to get it done because you had to\nI Want done a lot of deals in the Senate leverage to leverage his power a got a lot of people's face but in the end he got things done\nAnd he ... he turned the economy over to Martin Van Buren actually with a surplus and he was the last president to do that not have a deficit so I think that he had to make them deals for that to happen at the same time ah you know both to programs that will allow their country could grow\nAnd he understood the working class more than ... percent more than that it was more than ... more than watch it um you know more than John Quincy Adams says he was born ... often and he understood he really thought a Midwest and then the south or the southwest was totally ignored\nSo I think because Donald Trump constituencies that same one in proportion\nYou can go in cuts of deals in order to average greater objective for sale and then see what happens after two years if he loses the house you don't see what happens after six years we get the second time so I think back to what they need to learn but relentless the fighting spirit he's pretty much got that down\n[laughter] yeah he does um but Jackson a ...\nIn terms of his fighting spirit also have this great ability of making up with people that he was fighting against a one point he he had actually for a dual with uh\nI've been involved in a very bloody brawl with Thomas heart Benton the senator from Missouri who became one of his closest allies and help get his program through\nThat may be comparable to the Ted Cruz Donald Trump relationship\nAnd Marco Rubio and Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham Andy Nikki Haley\nA he has a lot of people that were critical care and working with it why were they were were were willing to put it aside and support him and for the most part\nEverybody has I think this evolution of his other team as is much more supportive who Donald Trump is Larry Kudlow the Gary Cohn\nSo Larry Kudlow said this Donald Trump got to get over this free trade agreement is reached trade free trade is good and Donald Trump is is almost one Larry older but he didn't uh he did not want to come in because\nHe said you know the I Can't really go along with Boston up all these deals but then after a few months after talking to him he's now in in the beginning chocolate or you\nKnow I think that I think the idea for Larry is that as he's believing President Trump that the whole goal of a tougher negotiating posture is lower tariffs\nAll around for us and for them we will be right back uh with just a few minutes more with Brian killing made the is the author of Andrew Jackson and the miracle of New Orleans the battle that shaped America is destiny\nAbout his vision of what happens in this faithful election just eight days from today we'll talk about it with Brian kill me

election and it seems to change and go up go down I ... in terms of what is happening right now one thing that is amazed me most not talk to my listeners about it\nHas been all the indications and all the academics and all the pollsters saying this is going to be a record turnout that people are streaming to the polls more than ever before sending in their early ballots why do you think that is\nEven more than the politicians the groups I think the progressive agenda\nAbsolutely out of control absolutely disgusting like after the shooting in Parkland\nThis slaughter the synagogue they just push their agenda\nWithin hours within hours the media are politicizing this mass murder\nOf American Jews by the subhuman\nCockroach in Pittsburgh shame on that shame on them just when you think the media reached a low point they go lower\nWe're brave men and blue police officers that certainly got four of them were shot\nIt wasn't that long ago when the media and the left and the prior administration were trashed and law enforcement left and right\nAnd they barely even praise them now\nBut they'll be back to their own routine in a few weeks trashing law enforcement because that's what they do\nDevelop banging their heads for the cops for Seventy two hours maybe Ninety six hours but there'll be back\nDo return\nTheir hawking this letter that was sent the New York times magazine ... hawking at others hawking it by a group called bend the art\nJewish leaders sorry Jewish leaders\nThese are progressive these are activists\nSome left wing political action group\nAs our buddy been Shapiro points that you know who runs than they are Alexander Soros George ... son why don't they look you know there's the media because they don't care\nMeanwhile the rabbi\nAt the synagogue in Pittsburgh he's walking and the president despite the fact that if CNN host as you'll hear later we're trying to draw the rabbi into a debate indoor controversy because that is all the media cares about\nNow\nWe're like prior administration\nThat effectively went to war with the Jewish state of Israel\nObama secretary of State Clinton secretary of State Kerry\n\nKerry and his last big speech openly trashed the Jewish state\nObama treated the prime minister of Israel\nAbsolute disrespecting contempt they've been reached into the Israeli elections to trying to feed them\nAnd they refused do no way out the door with just a few weeks left of their administration they refused to defend Israel in the un against her enemies\nThey voted present and yet another hate filled resolution at the United nations\nThe American media in this country I said back in may had blood on its hands went on moss backed by the Muslim Brotherhood backed by Iran backed by Hezbollah was riding on the Gaza Strip shooting missiles into Israel Israel defending itself they\nImmediately attacked Israel they immediately attacked the Jewish state\n\nVirtually all of them I spoke about that\nOne Brock Obama pushed through the Saran deal violated our constitution Bush really around deal gave them a hug and gave them one point five billion dollars in ransom followed by facilitating another hundred and fifty billion dollars\nTo that regime which is a terrorist regime\nWhich has its own people and its own journalist by the way media\nWhich is set it intends to destroy all the Jews in Israel and by the way intends to destroy the United states Obama was set up right\nHe was celebrated\nObama literally armed with billions and billions of dollars\nA grave enemy of ours that the Jewish people\nAnd then when ... when the president Donald Trump withdrew from the deal\nHe was attacked by Democrats some Republicans like Bob Corker it was attacked by the media\nYou ask any Jew and Israel\nThe president may have a fifty percent favorability rating in the United states is a Ninety percent favorability rating in Israel Ninety percent\nNinety percent\nThis president is the best friend the Jewish people in Israel have ever had\nBar no other president which is one of the reasons this\nMass piece of crap went into that Senate got one of the reasons he denounced Trump too many Jews around him he said\nYou know like a son in law like his daughter like it's three grandchildren I don't know that we've ever had a president it's certainly not modern history that Jewish children and grandchildren\nAnd despite every presidential election\nAbout recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel pandering about moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem this president your opposed to the un opposed him even some Jews in our own country opposed to like J Street\nHe's appointed\nA great patriots and the most pro Israel American as a passenger to Israel from the United
