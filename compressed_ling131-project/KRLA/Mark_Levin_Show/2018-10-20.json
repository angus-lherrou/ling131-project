[noise]\nIt is and listen as it's not a conquest because they're not you know overthrowing our government or but but it is an invasion\nNonetheless they're they're not looking to to well I'm In the probably by the power of their vote they're looking to overturn\nA our way of life or through the ballot box but their first intention is to just invade and to uh take from our country whatever they want including the federal benefits and state benefits at a list and beat I'm with you\nThat there is no ... you described it perfectly when you've got thousands and thousands of people demanding entry into your country and they're waving the flag of their nation\nThat you're being invaded and then the thank God the president is it doesn't care what CNN has to say about him he is going to defend that border\nUh Pete thank you thank you for the call the problem here is the president doesn't have the support he needs\nThe the the there's there are some things the president can do here but uh you know listen if if if Republicans do lose\nThis election coming up at the midterms in many ways they're going to have themselves to blame him that the one most powerful motivating issue that President Trump or rode into office on\nIf you could name one thing the Trump stood for it was enforcing our borders and building a wall to protect our southern border there's no two ways about\nThis is I Know that there was a lot else going on in this election or the the uh antipathy for Hillary Clinton [noise] uh the the you know decades of of her be invading our living rooms in a very shrill and unlike away\nOr the idea of Trump being the person to name Supreme Court justices versus Hillary Clinton [noise] uh the promise tax cut the rejection of identity politics and there was a lot baked into the cake in the twenty sixteen election\nThe economy trade all those things but the Senate all aside from it if you ask the men on the street named me one issue Trump ran on the vast majority would be\nBuilding that wall and protecting our border and Republicans I understand why it in some cases but Republicans did not follow through for him they just didn't\nAnd they'll tell you is because the Democrats do it in the way because of the filibuster and they'll tell you that it was because of a threat of government shutdown they'll tell you lots of reasons it doesn't matter [noise] they've had the majority\nAnd if they wanted to\nIf they really really wanted to\nThey could have pushed for that wall they could have pushed\nFor jumping on board the president's agenda with regard to immigration the fact is too many of them don't want to either because they're getting their beds feathered by the U.S chamber of commerce and other deep pocketed interest groups who do not want our immigration laws enforced as they're written [noise]\nWar is because they're terrified that they're going to lose reelection\nBut here's the thing\nThey didn't get elected so that they could get reelected I don't know anybody who votes thinking\nYeah I'm going to put this person in the house of representatives so the two years from now they can win reelection\nI I'm going to vote for the senator so six years from now I can vote for them to get their job is not to keep their job their job is to do with the voters expect them to do\nAnd they didn't they dropped the ball\nOn and forcing our immigration laws and protecting our border\nAnd and if if they lose\nIn many respects it's going to be because of that\nOr let's go to Daryl in Portland, Oregon your next step I learned O'Connor infer mark live in Gerald\nLarry how you doing guys\nDo I've watched I've watched the border over the years her up in a Chandler, Arizona\nAnd you know they actually had a here they had a fear of consequences that if they snuck across the border for a job and they you know you know food or whatever they did\nThat if they ever got caught they were going to get you know tossed out of the country they got to basically everything that they're welcome more than the citizens and that and your people standing in line trying to do the right way there's no incentive to do it and if you think whoa don't work for the Israelis\nYou exactly you don't get real it's so funny when you say you know I remember when I was younger people didn't cross the border because you remember\nA that movie from Cheech Marin from Cheech and Chong was born in east LA\nYou remember that and it was a parody song and they did a parody of born in the usa called born in east LA and it was in the entire movie was about him being well actually the irony is his character was not actually illegal but it was but it was about him on the run\nFrom border patrol and from immigration officials who were trying to deport\nHim right hey if oh if only that really were the case if ... what what has changed for God's sake that wasn't a movie in the eighties\nYou know ... in the beginning it was a ... I Can't think of who who was in Arizona at the time I mean McCain has been there forever I mean obviously it's not no longer with us but uh\nIt just it slowly came and more and more and more and then they became later and later on the consequences you know when you get here and then now they're actually given them benefits like hey we'll take care of you know you want to have you know four or five ... go ahead\nOh we're not doing enough for him Darryl Darryl thank you for the call and we're not doing enough for these people who are in this country illegally it's it's funny I I I always hear from people but you know for those who have been here for many years and they become part of our society the ones who are law abiding tax paying\nA uh people in this country or that even though they're illegal we should have a path to citizenship for them and it sounds great doesn't it they've been here they've been law abiding they've been paying their taxes they shouldn't be deported we should give them a path to citizenship\nWhenever anyone says that you could you just follow up for a minute and say I could get a hold on I'm sure there's a lot\nThere here in the country illegally they've been here for years they're law abiding and they pay their taxes\nAnd they've got jobs\nCan you explain how that's possible because if they're in this country illegally for years and years and years and they've got a job\nAnd they're paying taxes on the money they make from that job then by definition they are not law abiding number one they've broken our law by staying in this country or entering this country illegally but number\nTwo if they've got a job that means they have either lied\nAbout their documentation for their reusing fraudulent documentation quite possibly they're guilty as an accessory to identity theft\nSays so your argument\nIs complete and total nonsense [noise] if someone has been in this country illegally for years and they have a job and they're paying taxes\nThere are people from another country who are crossing our border illegally and demanding to stay here it has nothing to do with path to citizenship for people who are already here it has nothing to do with visas it has nothing to do with comprehensive anything\nAnd if you and if your solution for these people who are crossing our country illegally and want to stay here in demand to be in our country\nIf your solution is tied to all these other things that you want voted on an approved then it means your part of the problem you're using this to get other things that you want\nI Am so against the idea of comprehensive anything reform in Congress I think every individual items should be voted on standalone\nDo you want a wall or not well okay well go ahead and fun to the wall but only if you give amnesty for people in the country already what's one got to do with the author\nTell you what let's have a vote on the wall and then we can have your vote on amnesty step up this is not about compromise and this is not about trading horses this is not about making a deal\nEither you're for protecting our border or you're not you're either for granting amnesty to people who continuously break our laws or you're not stop with the bowl\nLet's go to Curtis Ocala, Florida Curtis your next up on the market and show\nHow ya doin' good what are you say\nWell go do it but uh I got a chair or do they shut down the water ...

C. W. M. A. L. is uh in the nation's capital it's the talk radio station of record in your capital and uh I Do the uh the show right before mark\nRipe for three hours after new drive a Larry OConnor I sit in for him then goes Marco event so on my way home I listen to mark the here's the thing I Can't listen to anyone else\nI Am too afraid that I that they might plans an idea that I Will inadvertently take or or you know purposely take a bath and and also it's funny when you get into the business it's harder to listen to talk radio\nBecause he you know you sort of know what goes on it's like a filmmaker's look at movies they don't look at movies the same way you when I look at movies because they're looking at how it's been put together some of that way for me with talk radio now\nBut see with mark first of all he's incredible I Love the show it's very different than my usual show actually um and and and frankly\nBecause he's on immediately after my show\nI you know I'm going to buy these days\n... news cycle the stories what's important what's happening now it changes five times before I'm On the air again Twenty one hours later so I can listen to mark and I love listening to mark a ... and\nAnd I have no fear of you know that they're taking any of his his ideas are his lines or his takes because by the time I'm On the air it's all new it's all different\nAs I Love this opportunity to be able to sit in for him and I'm so honored to be able to do it and that's a huge thank you as always to mark a answer Richard and rich and uh and Stephen and everybody a Becker at the mothership who's who's helping out here [noise]\nAnd those if you listen to show I Hope you tune in every week at this time because we talk about stuff\nThat if you're over fifty retired or retiring soon is important and so we we talked about a state planning which we're going to do here in just a moment\nBut we also talked about investments we talk about Social Security we talk about income taxes\nAre diversification four one K. we talk about the whole ... a whole gamut of ... and I hope you benefit from it\n[noise] now this is a part of the show we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and normally we do that but this week we're going to talk about a very deserving and very washed and clean air of yours and that would be your spouse [laughter]\nThere you go and so this week I Want to talk with you about a special kind of trust it's called a Q tip trust like the thing sticking your ear\nAnd a Q tip Stanford qualified terminal interest property but that we call it a Q tip for short and it's basically a trust that is designed to benefit your spouse so if you're married you have a spouse or we'll have a spouse soon then you want to listen up okay but before we do that ... can you play it on your\nService\nWould always say you you\nMay be\n\n\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and we use that because the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite design to take it from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to you so every week at this time we have our state tip of the week\nNow this week we're going to talk about trust for your spouse now the theme of our show this week\nUm has been our vision one hundred as a firm for money matters\nAnd as I mentioned a little bit ago ... we ... we're not work with a thousand families and the responsibility that comes with that is one that we did not take lightly it's not just taking care of them that is important in guiding them and helping them to have financial security but it's also their families\nAnd one of the things that you know I've often said as you don't want your financial adviser for him to die before you do so we created in our from what we called vision one hundred vision one hundred means that a hundred years from now we want money matters to be as strong or stronger than it is today\nNot only fascinating Mr Spock but also very logical and so that's kind of a ties in with this segment of the show which is an estate planning in passing\nOn to the next generations and we have a a ...\nValue that we live by which is a core value number eight which is that everyone deserves love\nAnd what I mean by that is that no matter who you come into contact with including that person to cut you off on the freeway and then flipped you off as they were going by they deserved love you give love always okay\n... if not you don't get love because you think you're going to get it back you give love because it's the right thing to do you give love unconditionally with no expectations coming back at you if you do that I think you live a very happy life\nBecause then your happiness is not dependent on other people coming back to you and saying I Love you back or doing stuff for you or whatever it doesn't matter you don't need that if you're if you're the giver of love then\nSomehow and you know in in different religions are different names for it but it comes back to you the more love you put out into the universe the more love will come back to you\nAnd you don't have to force it you don't have to expect that it will come to you saw a core value number eight is everyone deserves love everyone that comes into contact with us as a burn as a person in our family everywhere we want to make sure that we give them all the love that we have to get and if we do that they'll be better for it and in in in some magical way so we'll wait\nAnd so a state planning which is the topic of this segment is that so let's talk about someone that I Hope you love a lot which is your spouse okay so the Q tip trust that is a kind of trust that upon your death\nYou lead the money for your spouse in a trust\nNow people tend to freak out about the word ... they don't like that word but you know what trust are are are not black boxes that you put money in and cannot come out no in fact just the opposite a Q tip trust is there for your spouse to be able to have\nAccess to the ... for whatever they need it for pretty much I mean there are some limitations but not many and but what it does do is it protected them\nFrom if they get divorced they remarried and get divorced which maybe you don't care much about at this point but could happen or if they get into a lawsuit or if they have a a you know if they if they go bankrupt than all the money that's in the Q tip and the trust for them is is protected from all of that\nAnd then you may have a spouse that isn't so good with managing money and you want to have a trustee that helps them with that so that again is the value of the cutest trust okay so\nThink about your spouse protecting the money that you want to have them have for the rest of their lives in the event that you died first and if you want to put it in trust a Q tip will do that for you get something for you to think about so this shall we talk a lot about all of our core values I Hope that that you got some ah some of it if you didn't hear the entire show\nOur website is money matters dot net money matters dot net and you can podcast didn't listen to the whole thing and uh you know I I feel sort of like maybe I surmise today somewhat but uh I Believe in these things and I think if you live your life that

garbage you could ever possibly here\nAnd it must work 'cause we're buying a spot to bind the TV Time and somebody actually responds and buys this stuff and I've said over and over and over again gold is not a good investment has it been for years and it doesn't respect inflation or debt it doesn't care and the facts don't backup that inflation or debt will cause it to go up because it doesn't\nBut that was my first authorized this week of my own little research subsidy or watching TV and went to some guy actually stay put gold go into ten thousand dollars\nNow also I had a caller that actually reach me on the phone and said you know I've seen this commercial recently [noise]\nAnd so like this one minute commercial and it's called the annuity trap they says I like you to kind of comment on it and their next show and I said sure no problem I'll look for it and sure enough the same day I'm driving home and I hear the same commercial it's a woman a commercials says the new trap\nAnd it's really official so you've got two guys they're one of them is the alleged question guy right there's nothing that's all of course off the top of their head right and the other guy as the I guess self appointed expert that's telling you about the ... trap\nAnd the first thing he says the good thing is it a new disease or long term guarantees and they create income and in many cases you can't outlive it and that's probably the only investment that you can put your money in on planet earth\nThat an annuity can provide you with a absolute certainty of income for the rest of your life guaranteed no matter how much money is left in the pot then the second thing you mentioned that is good is it no insurance company has ever ever defaulted on payments\nThat is also true now that doesn't mean that some insurance companies haven't gone broke it means that because of the guaranteed funded some place\nAnd the guaranteed reserves in surplus somebody will come along and pick up the liability and continue to honor the payment and the track record is impeccable to second best investment you can get into it on the planet earth what's first government treasuries the can't default haven't wasted two hundred and forty one years\nSo that's the second good thing but then he says\nIf you need cash for emergency let's say you start the income and your funds are tied up now and uh if you get a better breaker needy or something you need some extra cash you can't get the money out and then the second thing is that it's no good as it once you start the income\nThan the growth on your money or your payments doesn't do very well or does nothing [noise]\nNow this is I guess the self appointed expert that pays for those commercial those two statements are absolutely dead wrong to that's the problem you don't know if they are and you're listening to the propaganda [noise]\nThere are annuities out there that actually increase any year that the marketing increases that they may be tied to index to [noise] and there are many many programs that when you start the guaranteed income that you can't outlive you can stop the income if you need to pull more cash out than what the income is Seventy two\nAnd then started up again now if you knew it ties an annuity you of just messed up big time and you've got an amateur an idiot and uninformed agent that doesn't know what he's doing\nBecause he selling your product that no longer exist as far as having to do that [noise] this all stopped what twelve years ago you no longer have to a new it ties in annuity to create the income you can take an income option which is the same thing if income for life\nBut you can stop it in the middle of the process five six seven years later and take out some withdrawals in and started up again and or just the income from the reduction [noise]\nThis is not correct information this commercial is incorrect\nHe's either uninformed or what else I Would say maybe a little dumb because he doesn't know the market and that's the problem with all of us information you're getting some of it isn't quite correct so the self approved expert isn't an expert because he doesn't know exactly what he's talking about\nNow there were some comments that were sent over ...\nPeople say listen I got these quotes and I want you to [noise]\nYou know it kind of go over to talk about um [noise] so I have a cold here it says indexed annuities contracts have really\nHigh hidden fees\nAnd I'm quoting us that's why they're terrible ideas for older people even though they're pedal to them\nAnd it says can Smothers s M E T T E R S a former U.S Treasury Department economic policy official and a professor of insurance at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of business\nNow Wharton is one of the that's where the rich kids go vote 'cause it's expensive [noise]\nAnd they pay a lot of money to go there and it is a very prestigious business school how in the world has this idiots I city to tell you that they have all\nKinds of hidden fees first of all there can't be any hidden fees they've been legislated out of being the state of California Department insurance does not allow hidden fees that specifically outline on the ensuring page very clear big letters\nAnd the hidden part or hidden fees period [noise] there's a majority of annuities indexes especially the don't charge any fees where does this idiot get his information he's a professor of insurance at\nThe Wharton business school really and he hasn't got a clue what he's talking about zero [noise] that was another comment here that they sent over to me and said can you comment on this and says\nWe don't recommend an allocation to annuities for any portion of your portfolio the that whatever your age appropriate as allocations to bonds provides similar boost to the likelihood that you will not have sufficient assets in retirement\nThat quote is forest magazine so they're telling you that bonds are better allocation than annuities\nReally I can show you twenty five year history of bonds versus annuities and you knew these are cooperating them destroy their performance is not even close\nI in fact I Would say that over Ninety percent of the mutual funds out there which was about a thousand or so and money managers\nHave underperform what some of these better annuities have done in the last ten Fifteen Twenty years so where does this idiot and of course there's NO NAME on it just says Ford's magazine they don't know if they're talking about making a statement that is simply not correct It's not verifiable it doesn't have facts to back it up\nBy the way bond funds as an allocation you folks that are in bonds this year you've lost money\nBecause the feds raise interest rates three times that means you're bond values are less than the beginning of the year so the allocation towards bonds is really not that wonderful [noise] that was another quote as individuals in over he's got all these things that he wanted me to respond to it says\nQuote the likely that we're going to find an annuity product that meet our standards\nFor your benefits is that there seem to have to ask yourself why or other guys peddling that product\nIt's because they're looking out for their own and best interest rather than yours or that quotes from a Rick Adelman now\nI don't know who ... you know talking to obviously doesn't know again what he's talking about [noise]\nWhat bonds pay what is the rate of return um ponds treasuries around three percent Newt he's out there that guarantee that as a minimum\nAnd or the market but again I'm away digressing the likelihood that they find one to meet their standards\nAnd Edelman wants you to think that to their standards will be okay to charge you two percent fee every year maybe his best interest is the cause you higher fees than average because it's been it's been in his pocket book [noise]\nNow there's an ad with berets but says Barron says just named ... as the number one financial planner and the United states [noise]\nTo go to my office folks\nYou'll find a dozen or more of these twenty five pounds I think the ... rock crystal or whatever they call it [noise] that's kind of stuff that the rich ladies go by putting a ... percent of peace in the dining room table\nAnd when Thanksgiving comes along and they use that room once they are they move it and put it someplace or the way 'cause it's in the way\nSo it's really a piece of nothing well these awards are given to the top number one guy in the entire country to country one guy I talked to from the guy I have several of those in my office now what's the criteria for the barons reward is at a rate of return is a performance\nIt's none of the above its meaningless it doesn't mean a thing except as propaganda to confuse you that maybe you're dealing with somebody's really good doesn't mean that now if you have an award for really good production\nThat you're like number one in the country several years maybe that means something or maybe that doesn't mean anything either it just means I was really good at convincing people to trust my judgment that's all it meant [noise]\nSorry that's the way it works for once told me ... on his performance that counts so when we come back and talk about some of his performance stuff and what you should be looking for people are buying these stories about words that are given away without any real requirements of performance so hang in there we'll be right back\nNow we have another one minimum wage the minimum wage somehow in the process the government decided that they have the right to tell businesses what they can pay for labor\nWhere's that in the constitution or is it well it's you know we don't want ten cents an hour slave labor cut and stuff like China or whatever that's not the point\nIf you are trained if you have talents that you can sell yourself to the to the business world you're going to be able to dictate to certain is that what you're going to get paid if you're a dumb down that goofed off in high school didn't graduate didn't go to any trade schools whatever then basically you get paid what you're worth but that's not good\nSee because that doesn't get votes Bernie Sanders thinks that we should have a living wage has other presidential candidate here's the deal you have to have a living wage and it's fifty dollars an hour\nNot a minimum wage a living wage which somehow the government is supposed to have the power to do this to tell businesses what they can pay people you can pay the kid to a handout hamburgers and McDonalds and give 'em fifty bucks an hour or you can give the janitor to school was sweeping the floors and cleaning the gym floor fifty dollars an hour and a lot of talent their folks\nBut they didn't bother to get talented well they're not capable than they are not deserving of a wage that someone that spent time learning their craft and a specialist in computers or engineer or whatever you earn what you've learned not the government dictating what you have to pay\nBut here's somebody wants to do that so what we have is the government is dictating what you pay who gets what\nThe government is in charge of wages and businesses and what happens jobs disappears businesses get rid of labor now when I come back\nWell I'll just give it all ties with Jerry Brown a native I was born in California in San Francisco area few weeks ago and I'm sitting here trying to figure out what in the world that people were thinking about\nWhat this guy as the governor of the state of California for three terms because when he leaves he's leaving with a bang he's going to really put it to you folks even more of his crazy political nonsense and this is what causes your\nShrink you're voting for this garbage and we get back to cover a few of those things that you need to be aware so hang in there is going to get used to write\n[noise]\nPresident Trump

it's time for the good bad and ugly and through your retirement goals possible break box on my investment answers\nWhen it comes to money hand your retirement it's not what you think you know what you need to know\nOver forty bucks has provided sound direction and expert answers about retirement planning to thousands of people\nNow here's Greg far right let's\nSay that I started a business a multi million dollar business in the financial business ... years ago [noise]\nAnd as I grew I was incorporated I made a business for a couple of reasons one corporations have some tax advantages also can set up a nice retirement plan for me and my employees\nTo contribute to everybody because they make you wealthy or successful because you can't do it by yourself I mean I understand that you have to have the other guys to help you that's what businesses do hire hundreds or thousands of people in particular industry to make their industry more successful in their business and their shareholders more successful [noise]\nNow government comes along and decides Jerry Brown\nThe corporations should have a balanced board now why do we have a board\nBecause if you have several hundred employees and you have billions of dollars going through your company and you have all kinds of stock holders maybe thousands\nIt's very calm person to have some kind of major financial decision to be made if you have to have to put it before the stock holders could technically they are the owners so you put together a board to kind of regulate the owner and to make major daily decisions or weekly or monthly\nBoard is more efficiency now when you have board members you don't go find some willy nilly whether they're black or white or female or male or occasion or Asian you don't care\nYou if you're smart businessman he will hire people on your board that contribute to the success of your business that's what you do\nThis lunatic brown did I say a lunatic that's being too kind\nDecides that he's going to set up a California state law that says any business that has a certain amount of production now must have their board equally balanced with male and female all that should get the women's vote because that's what it's all about isn't it\nIsn't really he really give a damn about women really I don't think so they lose anybody else except the husbands sons and the Father's Day care about women\nUh this is all for political nonsense [noise]\nI don't want business being told what their staff is going to be or my business but the staff has to be made up of a certain amount of gender whether they're qualified or not this is nuts and it's going to be law suit as this idiot is leaving the January\nNow I can tell you right now it won't last three minutes in the Supreme Court because business does not have the agenda of the government telling them who we hire who runs it and the decisions we make there's enough regulations as it is\nThis is the kind of stupidity when you vote a certain person you're getting this kind of garbage then eventually comes down to hurt you because business will figure out a way to avoid this nonsense that usually means less employees working [noise]\nNow one of my favorite subjects where your vote is going to cause your pocketbook district\nOr the Affordable CARE Act anybody remember that one it was shut down our throats wasn't and not a single Republican voted for it that doesn't make us bad or good it just a dog has been wired and what if your Democrats than either until they threw in some little juicy things have promised to do something which I didn't do\nValley forge CARE Act was to provide insurance without pre existing conditions and everybody gets covered and we are required to have at least that was the initial salvo what's the Supreme Court and they change their mind and didn't call it a fine they called it a tax\nSo the Supreme Court judge said well that was the deciding vote in tax covers contacts you\nIs this woman nuts no she's just a communist folks but we call it progress snow we call it communist you got a name is ... she's a communist she wants the government to run all businesses and run all the money\nWell sounds good to me yeah after a bomb you don't want to work for a living\nNow there's also a proposal you haven't heard this would either 'cause this is all done by the one percenters the crazy people that are in charge of a particular party folks [noise]\nThey want to take your pension money or Irish or for one case about Seventeen trillion dollars of this stuff\nAnd they want to take that money and they want to pay off most of the national debt debt somebody actually proposed this and there's some support for it\nAnd then what they'll do is they'll take that money because you're so incompetent manager drug money they'll pay you an income for the rest of your life off the money that when you die they keep the balance it sounds like Social Security than oh another social program\nYour buddy that you've worked and say that you took out of your paycheck so you could set aside money to retire with\nAnd they want a ticket and confiscated and then pay you an income from it till you die forget you kids catch grandchildren they're not included\nSay this is the kind of garbage that's being proposed by the one percenters the taking charge of some of this radical craziness that's going on\nAnd you have a choice vote for this garbage or think with your head before you vote for this kind of nonsense and find out what these people are actually sane because this kind of stuff just couldn't take money out of your pocket that's going to take money away from your children that you don't spend\nSee this is the stories of the swap this it's a smart books this is everybody wants the government to run your life [noise]\nI Know I've had many requests about going over the propositions and I'm gonna do it briefly because most of this isn't worth the time of the air when do we got better things to do with the air [noise]\nThe first proposition number one it authorizes bonds for funds specified housing assistance programs number two it authorizes bonds to fund the existing housing programs for individuals with mental illness\nNumber three authorizes bonds the fun project to water supply quality watersheds fish wildlife water conservation groundwork sits sustainability storage all that good stuff [noise]\nUh and number four more bonds to construct hospitals to provide children's health care\nFolks all you gotta do is to get you to vote for some of his include the poor children clean air and clean water and you will put your signature on that bond and you just are dumber than a brick when you don't think beyond that stupidity [noise]\nWe've got this project to build a train to nowhere and there's no debate about that as a hundred billion dollar price tag and growing\nWhy don't we take that money to build a few few jams up the middle of California and capture the run off in the spring of the Rocky Mountains for water supply\nOr how much cleaner do you want your water and your air I don't know if you're getting much cleaner folks because you can spend an awful lot of money for an extra one percent [noise]\nBut you have the money in the ...\nA hundred billion dollars will pay for all of this with plenty money leftover why aren't you ticked off about the stupidity\nBut the state of California always comes out and said we need more money and we'll put kids in there or will put poor and there are all put schools in there and you just sign up and you're just do it blindly and we end up with nothing improved\nNow prop six and I'm going to read you what it says a member of the attorney general the state of California words it this way says quote eliminates a lemonade certain road repair and transportation funding requiring certain\nFuel taxes and the occult feed to be approved by the electric not by the people who we vote in it doesn't eliminate any thing that\nIt's working in a way that's deceptive and simply ally\nAll it's doing is trying to get rid of a tax that they already have adequate money which they've diverted in the first place\nWake up people this is the kind of ... job you're getting\nThen another one is the ten expands local governments in thirty to an actor rent control or was as usual residential property do really want government\nAgain to take another step in your life to take away options for you of who you want a richer property to what you could afford the rent for because it is that isn't the market determine what the rents can be if somebody is completely outrageous on rent people are going to go someplace else go where rents more competitive [noise]\nThey don't need big government looking over your shoulder and telling you how to manage your assets your property this is stupid how stuff gets on the ballot is just where are these people thinking\nOh you I'm renting now and I so it's a control my cost and yet it will be wonderful what she'll do is the builders will stop building they don't put property in place when they can't charge certain rent market rate ten it's your house to house folks hits your job to read it with somebody that's willing to pay for it\nNot the government telling you what they should pay for it got to get big government out of your of your pocket book folks and that's what we got here in November\nHave got to wake up the government of California answer to everything is to create more\nThat actually had a state senator that said that well we need more money for schools and whatever so we'll just doubled the sales tax or maybe we'll double the property tax so you don't control your spending just been more and packs more pretty soon there's going to be left to pay the taxes\nAnd state senator has said that we need to have a windfall tax on the corporate tax because this new tax lower tax windfall tax notes attacks but it's a windfall so we should take at least a third of their half of it and give it back to the state just what we need more spending on stuff we don't need [noise]\nYou know that the government's calendar year in September thirtieth\nNow the tax bill is one point five trillion dollars over ten years that's a hundred and fifty billion a year folks what you're not told is a tax cut didn't lower the tax revenue that came in this last fiscal year in fact it's the same but the spending went up over seven hundred and Seventy billions of dollars\nSo these monsters these comics of spinning in in Washington the swamp and they don't have to keep control\nYou keep putting him in he keep voting for these clowns to tell you we need this that and the other and we don't have enough so we'll just spend more in taxes are more and it will complain about it we don't have a tax so many people that have real solutions not angry\nNot making laws that they don't have a constitutional right to do so but the judges to ... help up up up approve them\nOr we need to find somebody who can get rid of the law breakers\nFire the mayors and the government employees or continue to do this nonsense\nAnd get people that are fiscal responsibility if you can't pay the bill you don't tax us anymore you know stop the bill you cut it back that's what businesses do one of those down cycle business sense the field has to stay in business so you cut expense isn't over yet that's what you do\nAnd then we got to stop buying boats because California's real good at that the ... votes for unions for years give us more salary we'll give you money to support you for your election has nothing to do about you the individuals than improving your life\nHow do we fix this\nI don't know to give you an example of quick one fear Germany last year took it over fifty billion dollars in automobiles in our country we charge and the two and a half percent fee our machinery cars that goes to them it's a ten percent of the\nThat's not fair we continue to be stupid him playing this game that gives them the upper hand\nThat's what Trump is trying to stop and everybody on the Democratic side is fighting this why\nCome on people let's play fair play at the right it should be competition America is a place to be safe have opportunity a helping hand for your for your neighbors and your friends\nAnd protect your family it's not here to pay for everybody else's problem solving yourself exceptions but not for everybody so again thanks for listening\nA little bit of politics today but it's again your pocket book the voting for those garbage and you won't be able to live here anymore\nYou've been listening to Greg ... on my investments are remember when it comes to your money every time it's not what you think you know what you need to know\nTo ask Greg questions regarding your financial matters [noise] you can email him at my investment answers that Gmail dot com bust my investment answers and Gmail dot com or call an eight hundred three all three thirty six Ninety and Greg will return your call personal\nEight hundred three all three thirty six Ninety\nAnd joined us again next Saturday answering for more of the good bad and ugly truth\nTo help make your retirement goals possible with Greg Farr here on my investment answer\nThe information provided in this radio shows for informational purposes only nothing's during this broadcast should be considered as either legally or financial advice\nConsult with an attorney or other financial or insurance professional to determine what may be best for your individual in the\nBut there are really two phases of life you've got the growth phase and you of the income paid the growth phases where you're headed towards retirement and your goal is to grow your portfolio and the type of investments used to do this are generally stocks or mutual funds\nAnd if you have a long period of time generally Thirty years plus than investing in these investments is really a great way to go you keep contributing to them year after year\nHaving money deducted from your ... going into your retirement accounts at over a several decade period of time you'll be glad that you did that\nAnd this strategy of dollar cost averaging works really well when you're on the growth phase of life and you've got several decades to be able to invest but the growth phase and when you reach retirement why\nWhen you retire it's no longer about grows it's no longer about contributing to your portfolio and trying to save as much as you can\nIt becomes about protecting your principal and trying to get as much as you can from your portfolio to supplement your income so that you can live retirement the way you want but you have to be able to adjust for inflation\nAnd you have to prepare for a long healthy life to make sure that you don't ever run out of money and yet\nProbably the most common mistake that I see people make is that even though their life has made a paradigm shift from the growth phase to the income phase they've never made that paradigm shift with their money\nSo even though they're in retirement needing to take him come out of their portfolio they're still invest it as if they're trying to grow their portfolio and I got to tell you that is one of the most devastating cancerous things you can do to your portfolio and a great way to run out of money before you run out of life and here's why\nWhen you are invested for grow the performance of your portfolio is strictly about the share price you buy mutual funds at ten dollars a share you want them to grill you buy stocks at twenty dollars a share you want them to grow and you could make a lot of money you can lose a lot of money and there are certainly going to be a lot of volatility along\nThe way so you better have a strong stomach but when you're invested for growth it's all about the share price\nYour don't get when you were invested for grow is you don't get any income yeah maybe you get one or two present evidence but those are usually swallowed up in the fees so you don't get any net income to you\nSo when you get into retirement if you stay invested for grow that in order to get the cash you need to satisfy your required minimum distributions\nOr to supplement your other sources of income you have to sell shares\nIn every month when you sell shares of your portfolio to get the cash that you need your portfolio is declining cannibalizing your portfolio every single month that you make a withdrawal from your account and if you live long enough\nThen you're going to be in great danger of running out of money and this is the concern that I have because I find that most people under estimate how long they're going to live I talked to people virtually every day that tell me something like well I don't want to live that long I don't want to live in through my nineties or to a hundred\nSo does it really matter how long you want to live I mean just find anyone who's in their nineties and asked them if they thought they were going to live that long\nI'll tell you what the answer that most of them are going to give you is of course not\nAnd I challenge you go to the nearest nursing home and walk in and talked to some of the people in the nursing home and asked them if they ever thought that they were going to need long term care and live as old as they are and you know the answer\nNo one wants to be there that none of these people in any nursing home in any city in the country ever thought they were going to be in a nursing home so reality is you don't know and I'm going to suggest that you plan for the worst case scenario and financially the worst case scenario for you as a long healthy life\nAnd in reality it doesn't even have to be healthy I mean let's face it if you're in a nursing home it's a very unhealthy life but it's still very expensive as a matter of fact it's a lot more expensive than if you were healthy\nSo you have to plan for that or you're going to be in grave danger of running out of money and if you're sixty five or Seventy years old and you start selling shares of your portfolio and you have another Thirty years ago Thirty years of depleting your portfolio and selling shares every single month to get the income you need\nOh my gosh that's a problem\nBecause if you live long enough you could run out of money\nAnd yet there is a solution and I'm going to spend a few minutes talking about the solution when we come back from our break but if you like reading and you're interested in reading a book that talks about what the solution is for retirees to make sure that you don't run out of money before you run out of life\nThen you've got to get your hands on this book called return on principle it's written by a good friend of mine David ... and then he talks about the solutions to make sure that you don't run out of money before you run out of life\nAs a matter of fact if you want to call me I think this information is so important that I'll be more than happy to just get a copy in your hands at no cost her obligation to you\nBut you got to call me now the numbers aid for for seven eight eight call again that aid for for seven eight eight call or\nIf you prefer to text text the word book two three one three one three one and one of my staff or get back\nTo you next week and we'll let you do what you need to do to get a copy my math a nice car you're listening to the Providence financial retirement show when we come back we're going to talk about the solution to help you avoid running out of money before you run out of life said too [noise]\nThanks for listening to our show today in retirement you only get one chance to get it right and we know that proper information leads to inform decisions and that's why we hold free informational workshops in our area every month\nTopics like Social Security are empty the latest retirement tax strategies IRA estate planning and so much more\nFor dates in times of the next free workshop in your area just pick up the phone give us a call today call aid for for seven eight eight call that eight four four seven eight eight two to five five [noise]\nWhat we're talking about one of my favorite subject\nBecause that's what we help our clients do in in this day and age if you're retired or near retirement you absolutely must know the difference between investing for growth\nInvesting for income in a minute ago we just talked about why investing for growth is really so detrimental to your retirement because you cannibal lies your portfolio and if you missed the first part of the show you're going to want to go back and listen to it and you can do that\nI go into Providence financial radio dot com and all of our past shows are there and this show will be available as soon as we're off the air\nAnd I want to take a few minutes and talk about this illusion what is the solution if you're retired but you're invested for growth and you're having to sell shares in your cannibalizing your portfolio every month\nTo get your income\nAnd we're gonna talk about that before this show is over I promise\nBut before we do I want to take a few minutes and talk about one of the most important sources of income for retirees today and that is Social Security\nI think I remember seeing somewhere that forty percent of retirees would actually be in poverty level if it wasn't for Social Security and yet it amazes me\nHow little emphasis people put on taking Social Security and the decisions they make\nAnd determining when they want to start collecting it when they want to file\nAnd I would think that if this is the most important source of income for you for the rest of your life\nYou'd probably want to do some research and read and talk to the professionals and get all the information you need you can make an informed choice about the best time to take Social Security for you but that's not what most people do most people take Social Security based on\nMaybe a thought that they have maybe something they've rat oh you better take it as they do get Social Security is not going to be here right so they start taking it a sixty two or you don't want to wait till Seventy because if you wait till Seventy then you lose all those years of payments where you could have been collecting Social Security but you weren't\nAnd so they start collecting it sixty two\nAnd I find that generally speaking most people start collecting it earlier than later\nAnd yet when it comes to the complexity of Social Security\nAs much as I hate to say it it almost takes computer software to figure out the best way for you to take Social Security especially if you're married because there are some strategies that can be used if you're married that are often missed and good cause Jew thousands of dollars if you're not familiar with them\nYou know what they say right what you don't know can't hurt you\nBut is that true we all know it's not true and if you do know the strategies for taking Social Security right now you may be missing out on five hundred thousand dollars a month\nI'll give you a quick example we had a client that we met several months ago so I've done a lot of research on Social Security and that's why they came to see us because they wanted us to run our software to make sure that they didn't miss anything and it turns out that they did\nAnd their situation was somewhat tricky and I find that a lot of people situation is so I don't want to take the time to really flush out exactly what we did and help them but it had to do with the spousal benefits then they didn't even know they were entitled to them and by the time we were done that turns out that with our advice\nAnd that really is a good description of how investing for income works now imagine for a second that you owned the same rental property\nBut instead of getting a monthly check imagine that you had to sell part of the property every month to get the cash\nAnd the bottom line is when you invest your money for income all we're doing is putting it into investments that are much more conservative than the stock market really have nothing to do or certainly not a lot to do with the stock market and yet are designed to give you rent\nRent in the form of interest and dividends you can spend your portfolio is going to fluctuate just like the property\nBut who cares because you're not having to sell shares to get your income\nAnd if you want to get a copy of Dave's book\nReturn on principle you could buy it at Amazon I think it's twenty five bucks or something like that or I've got a few copies in my office that I'd be more than happy to get you and if you take the first step of calling us than will make sure we get one in your possession but you've got to call me now the number's eight four four seven eight eight call\nAgain that number's

the analysis of the financial situation or plan from attacks perspective the purpose of this tax plan is to ensure tax efficient you want to be tax efficient aid there's gonna be taxes\nYou just want to make sure your fishing and not paying extra taxes to tax planning all elements of the financial plan work together\nIn the most tax efficient manner possible [noise] it's a comprehensive review if you will of the structure in title ... of all your assets and all your investments and how they work together and then it's a future look on how they're going to look\nTo gather down the road because it's not just planning for today it's planning for your future so we've had just had the biggest most major tax changes here in American over Thirty years the Trump tax plan became effective January first twenty\nPayments you make every year do you think your car payment your mortgage payment your your payment for your tuition\nTax payments are huge every taxpayer knows the toll of paying taxes and you know what it puts on their financial linked him\nTo minimize the impact tax planning is essential and needs to be done wisely\nNow the number one way to reduce taxes to reduce shrink up\nAnd one way to reduce re comes to contribute money to retirement plan well there's a four one K. for all three P. or any kind of similar retirement plan and were your contributions reduces your wages lowers your tax bills it can reduce your adjusted gross hate them through various adjustments didn't them there's many ways to do this\nThree basic way to reduce your tax in each basic method when you have several variations you reduce your income you can increase your deductions you take advantage of tax credits\nTo get down to your you know the way it works the tax system you have your gross income which is what they make you might as your adjustments your judgments or your expense you know things like mortgage interest is ... percent right off\nAnd then you have your adjusted gross income then there's deductions which many people itemize now they raise the standard deduction 'cause they figure now sixty percent of people use to itemize the government thinks that less than ten percent of people who itemize going forward\nThat get your gross income minus your adjustments equals your adjusted gross income modest your deductions and exemptions equals your taxable income then you'd go to that\nTax cable and attacks tables have been reduced to get the total tax and then you have credits and credits or write offs like for example your child credits\nSo you want to adjust your adjusted gross income is a key element to determine your taxes a lot of things tend not just as your tax rate there is tax credits et cetera but again it's really important to start your tax planning and look at ways to adjust your income if you have especially in your investments\nTo adjust that down see you if you want to do something the other way to reduce your taxes to get money away but you want to do it tax efficiently like for example if you want to make a significant give to charity consider giving appreciated stocks or mutual fund that you vote for many years instead of cash\nThis will super charge you ... power with your generosity so the truly important in terms of\nHow and what you give us a gift when you give it was a lot of people who are terribly inclined and they have in there we'll know last will and testament earn their trust to give money away to some sort of journal there's ways to get deductions today for that\nIn your lifetime that will still help the charity equally just as much as giving away after death but can help you today\nYou don't believe people should start up a business set up a whole office there are deductions that you can get through that you want to avoid double taxation on your investment ... see a lot of people think okay let's reinvest are given us reinvest and if you reinvest these extra shares that increases your tax basis senior fund neck and reduce the tax will gain\nOr increase in tax law sings when you were deemed shares in taxable account\nFor getting to have these reinvest it did it as as part of your basis you're giving up some taxes that's a costly mistake\nMight want to consider tax free bonds there are municipal bonds state and federal tax exempt\nThose things can pay very good money and they're very very safe\nYou want to use insured investments to defer taxes there are several investments that offer higher safe because if the insurance companies that are insured they offer guarantees many times he can offer income for life and they offer tax advantage growth\nMeaning you don't pay any current income taxes are a lot of these investments there's a number of strategies out there\nBut a lot of people say they're like my passion yeah I'm passionate about helping them navigate your financial life in today's environment\nSo today we're talking about tax\nSo simple steps that if you bother to take them you can really reduce your unease about this whole situation you see eighty five percent of adults suffer from financial anxiety I can help reduce that stress by breaking down the financial side of taxes into simple steps\nThat will create more income\nWhich you know putting that into an actual number will save you money over your lifetime\nWill do simple cash flow analysis so how much

right now one eight hundred for for nine nine five zero one this is absolutely free\nAnd there's no obligation you need to provide a lifetime of income for yourself\nYour investment mix you want to

know much about it\nI'm a financial expert this will help put you on a path for success with your money in your retirement I call it a safe income tax strategy for success color test right now one eight hundred for for nine nine five zero one one eight hundred for for nine nine five zero one\nSo you know there's been changes to the itemized deductions okay um ... you know it used to be the standard deduction for a single person was sixty three hundred thousand twelve thousand if you were married couples was twelve thousand seven hundred now Mary joint is twenty four thousand\nPerson exemptions used to be four thousand fifty they took those away you don't have any personal exemptions anymore so it's important that you understand and a lot of people itemized while they gave me the twenty four thousand marital deduction or twelve thousand individuals actions you don't mind so medical\nAnd dental it used to be have to have ten percent of your income was spent on medical dental ... only seven and a half state and local taxes the change that where the property taxes and state taxes can only be ten thousand dollar deduction max that that are hurt a lot of Californians because we are very expensive house\nThe mortgage interest deduction has change if you buy a new home it's only seven hundred and fifty thousand dollar mortgage but you are grandfather approved ... million if you own your home for a long time\nCasualty of death last people you know say well I lost my wedding ring or my car got destroyed you know which does happen and uh they wouldn't be able to write that off charitable gifts the increase that right off of used to be fifty percent of the urine coming up your terribly climbing voice sixty percent of your income\nAnd again there's other miscellaneous deductions that have been taken away as well the tax bracket have changed how some people depending on your income you're going to be in a lower tax bracket but your first Nineteen thousand dollars worth of income is ten percent tax bracket\n[noise] and then through married filing jointly your adjusted gross income Seventy seven thousand four hundred I remember I said the deduction is twenty four thousand\nTwo Seventy seven plus twenty four means if you make a hundred thousand dollars in your household or less you're in a maximum twelve percent tax bracket so those things are good those things have been reduced down\nNow these tax credits have changed again family tax credits are better if you have kids that used to be a thousand dollars per child and these get phased out now is two thousand dollars per child and it's not getting phased out\nA foreign tax credits well that's you know because they want you to invest in America and again there's general business credits that helps businesses dramatically so\nThere's a lot of other changes as well\nOr that have happened that affect Roth IRAs and in effect estate taxes were now you twenty two million dollars is not taxed for a married couple\nBut the biggest change was in the corporate tax bracket went from thirty five percent or Twenty one percent that's huge it help businesses and there was a twenty percent tax breaks for small businesses that I don't think a lot of people even know about\nThis was huge and that's why the stock market has been doing so good but it's important to understand that when you invest\nYou want to invest in companies that are making money and investments that are trying to give you\nA total return which is income plus some growth yet there was a lot of people out there that are investing straight for growth because the tax laws were different were the capital gains tax were lower than the income tax this was going to level the playing field\nI think people seniors who want more income and safety they're gonna benefit from this because the capital gains tax\nBecause the total return\nIs income plus wrote an ordinary income taxes have been reduced and the capital gains taxes haven't been touched but it's really important there's a lot of moving parts the biggest question is who's going to pay for all these tax cuts\nWho's going to pay for is it going to be you\nOr is it going to be someone else back if you made any financial", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Glendale", "day": "20"}
