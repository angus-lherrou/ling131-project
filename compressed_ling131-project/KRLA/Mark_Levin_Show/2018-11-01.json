to win reelection it is very\nVery dangerous to play this game if you're a voter who's a conservative or Republican are you are right of center to be voting for these Democrats they're very dishonest\n\nWhy would Chuck Schumer be spending so much in Virginia West Virginia that is because he knows mansions going to vote for and that's why\nAnd same with these other states why do you think for the reason I said you know New Jersey you have an opportunity to you have an opportunity\nTo elect the first Republican to the United States Senate and forty years now I Know he's a rhino it doesn't matter it's meant that is it that\nTell you a little store it's very short [noise]\nBack in the Florida primary I seem to think it was in August something like that\n[noise] um my father one of the vote\nActually my wife Julie said you know the elections coming up you want to vote he said absolutely ...\n\nAnd he wanted to vote and the day before he broke his hip because the cancer had gotten into his bones so he broke his right hip and he would later break his bona up near the right shoulder\nA few weeks later he didn't get to vote\nWhat he wanted to vote anymore to vote and he always voted\n[noise] and I'm telling you this because I Want to encourage you to vote\nThis was a man who was a World War two vet this was a man who would call me almost every night after my radio show or I Would call him he was so worried about the future of the country this is a man who during the Republican primaries when I was back in Cruz said to me I like Cruz to the Y. being so tough on Trump\nAnd he was right [noise]\nThis is a man who was very very frustrating an upset with the left in this country\nBecause he understood history anywhere that we were losing our country that's why he wrote the book\nAnd that was created these books he didn't need to do this but that's why did it\nAnd\nIf the greatest generation could go to war and defend this country since the Korean War vets could have gone to war to defend this country the Vietnam War vets could go to war\nAnd defend this country and all the young men and women in between and all the young men and women now in Afghanistan and Iraq and other places Syria so forth\nWith their lives on line that's in this country what are they defending exactly the defending our liberty [noise] they're defending our constitution and the rule of law and our national sovereignty\nIs it really so hard for the rest of us\nTo make sure we vote is it\nReally so hard for the rest of us to save the country from within\n\nWe have an enemy from within its called socialism called progressive isn't together it's called tyranny when I say these things I'm attacked I'm called I hate Margaret I don't care\nFor the truth is the truth\nThere are millions of you listening to this program and all kinds of outlets in formats terrestrial radio am FM satellite radio and the market live in ... on the heart radio after\n\nHe listening to me on your pod cast here live streaming the show there are multiple ways they hear the show\nAnd on any given day\nI'm just having it in my head could be Thirteen or fourteen million of yeah\nWe've\nBeen together a long time those of you who've listen to this program a long time relatively long time right more than Fifteen Years now others have been with the longer that's OK at a at other careers\nI never even tended to get into this career\nBut we've had a very special relationship I feel\n\nI Know for many of you and part of your family in some respects piston part of your family but the same with me I Know I'm blessed with you\n\nAnd the common thread and all this is our love of country\n\nThat's where you were taught that is what you believe that's what I was taught that's what I Believe there's some people in this country who don't love it who attack it who rip it apart cues their fellow citizens of being like Hitler and Nazis and races and so forth\nThese are the forces these are the people we must defeat\nAnd we can't right now to feed them in our public schools and college campuses we can't night right now to feed them in Hollywood in Beverly Hills in the entertainment industry we can't right now to feed them in the media the ladies in general we can defeat them at the ballot box\nIt's up to you\nAnd I'm Serious when I say I think about the power we have if we make sure three four five six seven people who we know and who will vote the right way to get out and vote take what election idle really looked like\n\nIt is in my view particularly in this election you're patriotic duty to take care of business here\nI really believe that\nTeacher patriotic duty this is not just another election\nIf we lose their grave consequences\n\nAnd so rather than have anxiety and frustration put your energy to work put your interview to where you don't need people to tell you what to do you know what to do you know how to get other people\nInvolved in voting and so forth as your own precinct worker get out the vote I brought a number of candidates to you but they're still up on my Facebook and Twitter sites who need your help in close races\nA number Kennedy\nAs I told you I don't believe in giving to the party bureaucracy I Believe in giving the candidates [noise] so\nI Would encourage you to look at them and support them\nAnd hopefully most of them will win on Tuesday but some of them won't\nBut the goal is to make sure most of them don't lose but most of them do it and I can't get down into every house fight but we have like forty seats that are close you may live in one of those districts\nOne of those seven districts in California one\nOf those six or seven districts in Pennsylvania one of those three districts in New Jersey one of those four or five districts in New York\nThey're all over the country you may live in one of those districts\nVery very important\nThat you get involved even in your own life that you get involved with a handful of people and make sure they vote and imagine if you do that and then a few others do that and so forth and so it would be a big deal it really would\nConsider a silent majority and if they were about to find out are the\nPoles right are the polls wrong we're about to find out\n\nBut we should be focused like a laser forget about the static we should be focused like a laser\nYou know you love this country\nAnd you know there are candidates out there\nWho do not\nTheir candidates out there who want to fundamentally change America I don't want to fundamentally change America love America\n\nYou know Hollywood Bloomberg\nStyle hair Soros and others many others multi millionaires\nYou know that they they support a strongly centralized government because they know is multi millionaires they have enormous influence the future this society and they want more influence over the future of this aside their ego maniacal their narcissistic\nSo we have to fight this\nYou shouldn't be on the fence right now my fellow conservatives in Arizona you shouldn't be on the fence\n\nMy fellow conservatives in the ... district of Virginia where Barbara Comstock as you should be on the fence anymore\nBy fellow conservatives in the state of Nevada you shouldn't be on the fence anymore\n\nAnd we can go through all the states where the Republicans running or not necessarily that conservative but\nThey still love the country they're not trying to tear it apart and it seems and that's the kind of race we have right now folks\nI Know you detest the media and you have every reason to detest the media\n\nAnd not defending the first amendment there not defending freedom of the press we've talked about this before they're advancing a a radical ideological agenda that they're trying to disrupt this presidency they're trying to burden this presidency they're trying to undermine this presidency\nYou know they used to always say don't pick a fight\nWith a newspaper why because they buy their ... by the barrel\nTrump rejects that he is\nA um he's a contrary him\nHe's a contrarian and it's a good that's a good thing under these circumstances\nAnd the media cannot stand there used to the way George W. Bush would react to the media which is not at all\nNot at all they thought they taught Republicans a lesson when they went after Richard Nixon the way they did\nThe Trump has his own man he's writing his own history and you're living through this history it's remarkable history latest from China and they will try and write the history they will try and write the books about Trump\nHow he was like Hitler and how supportive for killer how was a low point in American history it's a high point in American history\nIt's a leading point in American history\nAnd what's going on now is that the media and want to cut short or the advances that have been made they\nThey want to create chaos they want to create hatred in jealousies and so forth but on their terms which is why they are not only
