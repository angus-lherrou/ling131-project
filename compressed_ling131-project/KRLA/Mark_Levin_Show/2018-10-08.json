are champions of justice for the little guy each week we're this informative and entertaining our bring clarity to the headline generating legal challenges of the day\nToday our topic is a very very serious one\nWe're going to be talking with two gentlemen Adam Murray who has been the executive director of the inner city Law Center of Los Angeles since two thousand seven the inner city Law Center has\nBeen serving the poorest and most vulnerable individuals in Los Angeles since Nineteen eighty [noise] it was founded on the basic principle that every human being should be treated with dignity and respected at all times\nInner city Law Center represents over two thousand homeless and working poor clients each year\nGreg Spiegel is the director of strategic initiatives at the Los Angeles inner city Law Center\nHe previously served as director of public policy and communications at icy Elsie advancing policies that improve the quality of affordable housing and prevent an end homelessness\nFrom two thousand two two thousand day he served as a housing attorney at the western center on law and poverty where he helped draft and implement state and local roots\nArms to improve code enforcement of slum housing particularly to prevent environmental health hazards like lead poisoning recently he served a stint on the staff of Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti\nWild ... it's a serious subject you've got too heavy hitters here\nFire everybody hey thanks for joining is very very nice of you to spend a little bit of time and Dave dino every once in a while it's nice to have a couple of people to give so much\nYou know we all the lawyers are out there and they're winning big cases or they're doing great mergers and acquisitions and so forth and lo and behold you have these two men who were totally dedicated to the people\nWithout them they have nothing and these are people in desperate need of\nFood desperate need of a place to sleep [noise] these are people who are in desperate need of medicine et cetera and this organization shared let's do that [noise] uh they're not in Beverly Hills [noise]\nAh they're down on Skid Row because that's where their clients are and the things they do for them\nFor the the needy that for the homeless and so forth because truly phenomenal [noise]\nAnd I wonder the opportunity to share some of the things they do if you\nCan de do more of them left the inner city for a while to be with the mayor's office to try to give the mayor's from insiders to the problem and so forth and [noise] hopefully a little bit of solution as well but it's um it's really something\nThe head head McKee luck is Adam [noise] so I'm going to talk to him first\nAdam tell me a little bit about this organization that I'm very proud of knowing you're just from the outside\nIt sounds like you for having us today and thank you for bringing attention to this very important issue that's really a scourge all in Los Angeles a forty seven thousand people\nEvery night in the county of Los Angeles experienced homelessness that's almost forty seven thousand individuals human beings who are on our streets\nOur in our parks ah every evening every night it's really heartbreaking number and inner city Law Center is a\nVery pleased to get to work on this problem with the actual were not pleased to work on we'd rather that wasn't a problem we didn't have to work on it but it's really an honor to get to do the work that we do a it's an amazing organization with very talented individuals like Greg who's here with us today and others are very talented very passionate individual to come together to work on these challenges\nAt and what we're talking about today we should make sure that people understand because we are heard all across the nation we may be talking about specific for Los Angeles but what we're talking about is mirrored unfortunately in every city in our country isn't it\nThat is correct you have an enormous number of people throughout the country who are struggling to get by struggling to pay their rent struggling to stay in housing an enormous number who are unable to do so and ending up on the streets ending up in the shelters families that are broken up because of the stresses and the tensions around that\nAs a heartbreaking situation day in and day out and you're absolutely right David plays out all across the country\nThen so the solutions that we talked about today they can be implemented across the country as well\nThat's absolutely right and there's lots of good work that's being done I think it's it's a heartbreaking situation but there's so many people are struggling with homelessness are in danger of homelessness but it's also hopeful situations but there is more attention and more emphasis being put on this challenge and more resources being dedicated to it so it's both a heartbreaking time at a fulltime me\n[noise] I I think when it that\nThey very important and critical aspects that you and go ahead and bring cases they're starting problem is a perception of change that does she felt that we all encounter daily\nWho we perceive as homeless so often it's easy for us to say\nNo they they don't take care of themselves they want to be on the street they don't want help we're not going to be able to help them and they basically turn our backs on them and turn to turn a blind eye because of the cause of their problem [noise]\nBut what I have seen inner city jail in an instrument or late treat you Adam and your leadership and wet Greg brain is the first actual change that no no no\nBy and large majority of the people who has found themselves on the streets are people just like us who very recently had a job and at home or an apartment\nAnd they were able to put food on the table and because of an economic acute economic problem\nThey had the carpet ripped out from under it and they and they land on the streets and they just need a little help to regroup\nIsn't that true that the majority of the people on the streets are of that second category\nYeah when you think about who was homeless in a place like Los Angeles or most places of the country I I make a distinction the folks who are experiencing chronic homelessness and shorter term homelessness and in LA it's around a third of the people we're almost at any given night or chronically homeless and there's a technical definition but basically it's people have been homeless for a long period of time are struggling with serious issues\nBut the other two thirds are much more who you're talking about in short term homelessness the statistic that really brings that to light to me is that between two thousand and two thousand Thirteen and the county of Los Angeles the median rents went up by twenty seven percent and the media and rent or income went down by seven percent [noise]\nDo you have an enormous number of families\nWho are really precariously perched just one thing going wrong away from homelessness one last job one domestic violence incident one ... ah illness and the family one thing going wrong and they're over that hump and they're into homelessness\nAnd it's just devastating to see the number of families and individuals who are perch just that one step away\nAnd there's a lot that we can do from a policy standpoint republic standpoint to intervene and help families who are facing those challenges and keep them from becoming homeless Adam if\nYou've done any good have you do have some people that were homeless and because of the inner cities and next thing you know they're they're back [noise]\nYou know Thomas ... which probably the most rewarding thing about being an inner city Law Center is that literally every day there are families stay in their homes who get into homes food get access to public benefits\nWho get paid money from the slum lord to have been running their buildings from a whole host of different in a whole host of different ways we literally every day see families whose lives have changed because of the work of the people in and say Law Center\nAnd it makes it incredibly rewarding to do this work in an environment that generally is pretty challenging and what we see but the fact that we're able to make such a difference in our lives lives is really what motivates us and keeps us going\nDoes anybody ever come back and say hey your inner city thank you\nAll the time we have clients come back and and thanks for the work and we have clients come back even with very meager means will come and donate to the organization volunteer with the organization I'm committed it's people who are facing really serious struggles in their lives and very often doing everything they can\nUm but they need assistance and and very often they're very appreciative\nOf what we're able to do and I should add here Tom it's not just the staff of inner city Law Center who are amazing\nBut it's also we have a whole network of of lawyer volunteers and paralegal volunteers folks from your from who have come in and help and others and it's really an important way that we leverage additional resources so will the staff of inner city Law Center is incredible and amazing we could not do what we do on the scale we do if it weren't for all the volunteers will come and help us you\nAre listening to champions of justice with ... and maybe Solomon and our guest today you've been hearing from Adam Murray the executive director of the inner city Law Center in Los Angeles we're also joined today by the director of strategic initiatives for icy else even that is Greg Spiegel maybe\nHundreds stakeholder group to kind of coming together on a plan that was a starting place and that built some momentum the last year has seen that transition and expand into city and county government which is the only places where we can really bring this to scale [noise]\nUm and so we've just been a transition over many time hundreds of people working on this innovating taking best practices from across the country and getting to this place you\nAre listening to champions of justice with Tom ... name is Solomon and our guest today you've been listening to the director of strategic initiatives for the inner city Law Center in Los Angeles Greg Spiegel also joined by the executive director of icy I'll see\nAdam Marie I'm you're\nTalking about getting people off of homelessness getting them off the street and yet somebody listening to this might be thinking okay but how do you move them from dependence upon\nVarious services to self sufficiency and Adam I kind of make this akin to when I was a child I had a very serious illness\nAnd I literally on learned walking off because of the illness so I could not walk right afterwards I have to really learn to walk many of the people who are homeless walked\nCouldn't walk\nWe have to train them to walk again we have to be able to an enabled them to walk again as an analogy how do we do that\nToday I think it's a there's a different answer that depending on who you're talking about interacting with I think one of the things that's very important in what Greg said is that there are many pathways into homelessness and there are many pathway out of homelessness\nAnd you really have to figure out where that individual is the individual person individual family than what they need to transition out of homelessness and that's a different depending on on why they're homeless they shot there and what they're struggling with now um\nBut we we see a lot of\nFamilies in particular who become homeless recently for economic reasons who are eager to get back into a working environment to get back to a job to get back to a stable living environment and they really just need a short term assistance to do so [noise]\nUm so they need they have had something that's pushed him over the edge into homeless as they lost a job that had an illness and the family and they just need like Greg was saying for that six to twelve months cushion to get back on their feet and get back where where they where they want to be and why they're easily the\nWas the other folks who need more intense of helping them need job training services or health services or something else to get there\nAnd so that's more akin to what you're talking about us I think it's important for us to just be honest about the fact that there is also a number of folks who need assistance or going to need assistance for the rest of their lives or their their we emptied our mental institutions onto the streets decades ago\nThat's really that's really an issue in other words are you from the police department standpoint so much of the crime or these people who have mental issues that should be being served in that fashion and they're just all out in the street\nThat's right and the police are called out again and again to be the front lines of interacting with ... which is not ah the healthiest way to do it the most productive way to do it but there's a subset of the folks who are chronically homeless whom need permanent supportive housing in our life any that support for the rest of their lives\nUm sets the humane thing to do I know if someone in my family was living on the streets with a serious mental health issue and needed help for the rest of their life I Would want us to provide that and everybody who's out there is somebody is on or somebody's daughter somebody's family member [laughter] so I think we just have to own that but that's not the bulk of who's on the streets on but it is important that we recognize the bulk\nTruly are people who have this problem and then they get out and get back and so\nForth and the statistics are overwhelming on that I mean okay if I wanted to know does cause that's really important here so so you're looking at about almost forty seven thousand people who are homeless every night\nAbout Thirteen thousand or thereabouts are chronically homeless and that's the subset where they're serious mental health issues and long term assistance as needed the balance of the other folks are mostly going to transition with the right support services back into jobs and apartments and lives as we think about them for\nA really show about thirty thousand plus you think are going to get back and so forth\nIt's even more than that that that's the nightly count right so that's forty seven thousand every night but over the course of the year it's probably a little bit more than three times that that are experiencing homelessness\nAnd almost all of the difference between the two hundred thousand over the course of the year and the forty seven thousand are down each night are folks who are short term homeless\nVets like putting all those people and the Dodgers stadium and you fill it up\nYet and Norman's number of people that is I think about that at every single one of them as as a human being was literally sleeping in a shelter sleeping on the streets yeah Greg\nYet and I was going to add with Adam was saying I often I hear people say well the homeless person I Know they don't they don't want a house they don't want to be off the street they want to live on the street and\nWhat we know is that I'm most homeless people don't want to be in a shelter or our traditional shelters have\nBeen something you have to line up in the afternoon to get in with all your stuff and there's a crowd and you you line up and people pushing job and then you get maybe sleep on the floor of that but it's it's not your ideal situation some people don't feel safe it's not on the shelters have limitations about who they take and who they don't take some\nIf you um have an addiction problem you're not welcome others have religious or service requirements that they don't want to do so people with mental illness as serious issues that's not an attractive situation so\nThere are many many people who don't want shelter\nBut there are very few people who will turn down housing and that's why that's the solution is permanent housing\nAlmost everyone will come off the street if you have permanent housing that fits what they need the other thing I Want to say is that\nFor those people that need that permanently need help and we need to accept that and its services it's actually cheaper to house them and serve them than it is to lead them on the street also on a street these are people who are not functioning so they are\nHad serious mental illness or perhaps drug addiction or both of 'em and they are passing out on conscious and they get picked up by an ambulance and they're taking to the emergency room and there's a police an ambulance crew involved in this tons of labor thousands of dollars the estimates for the the most acute\nTop ten percent of homeless people cost the county of Los Angeles about eight thousand dollars a month if we ... them and provide them services it's like three thousand dollars a month we actually save money by doing the right thing\n[noise] if you talk about they don't want to be homeless and I've missed\nThis picture before but it has a different perspective and when I used to ride the train into Los Angeles or along the Los Angeles river underneath the freeways you would see on occasion a little towns suddenly being built we would call them you know shanty towns [noise]\nWhat what occurred to me as this as I watch those towns develop those people were building their own homes they wanted a place to live it wasn't just attempt\nThese were scraps of would they were able to scrounge and they were building their own homes and their own community they wanted a sense of home of community of belonging to a group of people\nAnd then about every three months of you know enforcement would come in and just ... literally bulldozed the entire area and those people were gone but it occurs to me that that is a demonstration that people really do want a home\nThat is so well said Dave exactly and so they don't have the home out there that can afford or that he's addressing the needs that they have and they recreate it and the improvising and as you say it's not just one lean to on its own people start living in community they're replacing\nThat what they're missing that we have been unable to provide opiate stop providing\nAnd that goes back to your point ... these are individuals don't stray from their geographic location there jak Alistair out as they are currently living situation\nAnd ... van ... community in the same geographic location [noise]\nThe um [noise] the homeless problem is pretty bad for you were talking about a hundred million dollars more from the city Kan city pay a hundred a hundred million dollars more\nSo in the current budget that the city is I'm putting aside a hundred and thirty million dollars for the kinds of solutions we're talking about [noise]\nAbout Seventy five million or so is existing money is being moved around from what used to be other priorities and putting into homelessness and the solutions we're talking about\nIn addition they've identified eight city properties that can be sold and or are going to be used to develop supportive housing for homeless people on it so that's another forty five million and then lastly\nThe digital twenty million is a proposal for a fee on development that would\nGo to pay for so for commercial development um perhaps residential development hasn't been fined yet but that would the developer would pay a fee for the impact of the development increasing the need for affordable housing for people who work in the development for security and for the shops and and um\nAnd for maintenance that they need to have an a a an impact fee to mitigate that need for affordable housing so that twenty million dollars would go in this budget towards at one thirty eight and then going forward that fee would continue every year so that would be in\nAnd government at some level is coming down and interfering with your natural rights to live your own religious faith\nAlliance defending freedom is there goes to a

protests should we do now and I mean there are hundreds if not thousands of comments and it's you would find it fascinating because you are a study of writer\nAnd you know here here's my my partial response to that and I I think one of the reasons that for people like yourself\nWho have had severe doubts about President Trump this does bring Republicans together because the point is if they're going to go after Brett Kavanaugh\nHe is about as mainstream he's not somebody who's out there and we had um a fairly distinguished lawyer at our at our table who had been part of the Ted Cruz campaign\nAnd uh it was at our table over the Sabbath and he pointed out that if you looked at the names on that Heritage Foundation list Brett Kavanaugh was the most moderate person he could've possibly picked if you look at his judicial record he is not someone on the extreme right at all he is ...\nOnline like Samuel Alito like a Antonin Scalia he has a mainstream normal very distinguished conservative so if they are going to make him a victim of this kind of character assassination that do anybody ...\n[noise] I I feel like as a conservative and the reason I was a never Trump mainly because I wanted to conserve conservatism or the long run I was playing the longer right um\nAnd I think you were to which really attracted me to your show than I've even kind of slightly ... myself

stand\n\nTakeaway number one you must do in the lives take away number two there is no appeasing of a left number three the left blew an opportunity they will never be able to be able to cultivate cabin on out with their law school speeches and all their public accolades there's no turning them now he's in life number two\nAnd life and number two had some hard lessons life number one ended for

better damn well do the right thing you let us down before you finally stood up and look at it look at what happens when you do the right thing is that typical\nDan Horowitz as great a P some conservative view to buy about some takeaways from this look at what happens when you don't fold the conservative\nBase is bigger than you think here's your strategic miscalculation in the past for some bizarre reason whether it's living in the lead us media bubbles and hanging out in the corridors of Washington DC New York and California I'm not sure what it is I Lived in Maryland they spend a lot of time in DC I'm guessing from my\nExperience is this is what it is whether it's gun control or use air quotes there because it's really gone confiscation\nHigh taxes are bigger government you're under the assumption these are mass market appeal items because you hear it every single day in the bubble you live in and you feel like if you take a stand on these items that I was so maybe we should cut government spending we're kind of looking at going bankrupt when like pretty soon like maybe in a few years\nCheck it out available for pre order now our police by jak within don't miss out

I I'm not making that up as a joke I just go do [laughter]\nNever forget that we're\nTalking about the rules the new rules the new lessons we have\nTo take away after the cabin or hearing rule number one and it went over the last hour we must own labs everywhere\nNo appeasing the left number to the left can't cultivate cabin on now they've already cut that off they ruthlessly attack them by the way family just sat down for the swearing in ceremony to under assault flaws yeah\nThat's what it feels like the stand up in the face of a of of a determined malicious adversary and when and come out on the other side\nRule number four take away from this doing the right thing fires up the base on the basis far\nBigger than you can imagine ladies and gentlemen you have no idea\nHow many people in

looking at their kids and they were going no no no\nNot at a U.S that's for us the conservative base is bigger than you think we are on the right side of this you know I made the same argument not to get off topic here but about the damage to the NFL brand I my promise this relates to just just quickly people have said\nTo me that the NFL but their ratings are creeping back up no they'll they'll do fine they'll do fine or listen folks are not here to make this an NFL show that we've done that topic six different ways from Sunday I'm just here to tell you\nThat I personally know of probably twenty five to fifty people who have tuned out completely from the NFL had made a point to tell their kids watching people kneeling on television at times up turning the channel where we're watching the local news when I'm watching at white had why you changing the channel 'cause we don't do that ...\nYou don't do that\nWe can disagree with these folks they're free to speak out of course it's a free country where you will vocally vigorously defend their big ark God given rights to free speech but we're not going to disrespect their flight that flake stands for something bigger than that and if they can see that and I can't watch\nIt's not just the damage now it's the damage generationally to the\nNFL and moving back not a cabinet all\nThe Democrats are losing it they do I'm just I'm not giving them tactical advice folks I'm telling you what's happening on the ground so you understand that this is not all lost people get so down ... and I get it and the Republican side because it seems like we get small victories and the Democrats get large ones we get a tax cut Democrats get Obamacare\nA bigger government spending it happens over and over you know we\nWe get some kind of restriction of partial birth partial birth abortion and the Democrats get massive social victories everywhere else\nBut sometimes you have to sit back and just smile a little bit and realize that we won one this weekend and not only did we win one the generational lasting damage the Democrats have done to their party is not going to end with this\nDo you really believe to the institutional Democrats radical left this and media looney tunes out there who supported this do you really believe with a straight face when you're all alone at night here all alone\nAt night and your bathroom you'd done brushing your teeth you got your hands on the counter and you're looking in the mirror and it's a moment of honesty before you go to sleep there is no one else around when\nYou reflect to you really believe you help yourself here\nDo you really believe uncontrolled childlike pie raids in the Senate chamber screaming and yelling massive arrests screaming in people's faces ripping people signs down in some cases attacking people\nIn order to get cabinet are kept off the court do you really believe this help do you have any idea how many rational seen Americans who don't live and breathe politics every day of their life because they work and they have jobs J. O. B. S. is J. O. B. S. S. of Joe Biden misspelling it\nYou have any idea how many of them sat in front of their televisions and watch your history on ... nonsense and turn to their kids and their spouses and their mother in law's in their their grandparents and said hey\nAt a U.S I'm Sorry but that ain't us\nFolks I was never a Democrat ever but growing up you know in in in New York City in Queens\n\nYou know you have this tendency to kind of you know want to understand how liberal see the world I mean again I was never a liberal I'm I was an independent most of my life but what really opened me up to conservatism was this saying us moment\nAnd then they said also moment for me was when I was a police officer in New York City and I saw\nHow again I'm not suggesting every single time a ... you know there are a listener unfortunately are bad cop cigarettes I'm telling you the overwhelming majority overwhelming I worked with were great guys and women who really just\nGave a damn they weren't there to get rich trust me there ain't no money in policing and he and his word in that case\n\nBut when I was a cop and I was an independent you know again sometimes sometimes even kind of see it the liberal way from being surrounded all the time by Democrats\n\nI remember how some cops and use of force incidents who\nI Know did nothing wrong they acted according to how they were almost viciously it immediately attacked by the media activists out there without even giving them a fair shake I'm telling you that was my ...\nWife said something's wrong here this is this isn't right I mean if you can just attack someone a police officer without even hearing his story in an unquestionably tragic incident that will use of force incidents are no one goes out in the street with a desire to get to use of force incidents sorry do you think that's what cops do your seriously seek professional help\nBut to see the way they were treated that was my they're saying a moment\nI'm telling you Democrats I'm telling you that they're saying us moment is happening almost daily now with you guys and ladies\nScreaming and raving lunatics attacking people I have montage as I put together on my show of liberals losing their minds\nYou know who to you who exactly do you think this appeals to you are turning off generations of Americans just like you did back in the Nineteen sixty\nEight election is Dan Horowitz again puts in his wonderful piece in conservative review today\n\nI've no Nixon fan believe me Nixon was a Nixon was more of a Democrat that he was a Republican and he was an awful president I'm Sorry but the Nixon campaign team understood that late Nineteen\nSixties election that chaos doesn't sell folks chaos is not a brand chaos it's chaos\nWhy the liberals think that instilling a sense\nOf of chaos and insecurity and societal fray and tearing up the threads society why they think this is going to sell on a mass scale necessary somehow to implement their legislative big government agenda is is insane it is just ... ... what makes you\nOr let me take a call here I miss this woman I haven't spoken to her in forever\nDonna in my old stomping grounds of Frederick Marilyn can I assume you are listening on the great legendary WMA oh\nYes I Am dad and it is so great to speak with you how\nAre you I haven't spoken to you in probably two years\nI Know and I pay attention to you I I Love

I Love can I just stop you for that 'cause I Love love love the point you just made you see me on Fox or a couple of times I shouldn't I made this point on Fox repeatedly that the gift of Donald Trump
