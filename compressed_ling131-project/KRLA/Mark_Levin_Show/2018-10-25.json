{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "Well they did but some not directly after post office from my understanding but I'm Still doing more research mhm 'cause I just picked the story up because I don't have to be earning that are just rushing to the radio and different things while I Want to thank you for listening to me [noise]\nAll right my friend I appreciate your call and your service let's go to Frank Jersey City New Jersey the great W. A. B. C. do\nVery well thanks for taking my call and uh you know there's a great show on earth to people out there realize\nThat this midterm election probably the most important one retired and maybe this country's history\nUm this country that address is right now and go one way or the other band of people don't realize that and then you should actually be voting for the Republican Party because they're not socialist Democrats because hardworking people out of a law\nGreat decent conservative review by our buddy Daniel Horowitz ingest Seventeen months illegal alien family units increased by nine hundred and sixty percent\nAt the border nine hundred and sixty percent\nAre a lot more than roughly fourteen thousand people seeking to invade our border he writes\nThe American people are rightfully concerned about the brazen caravan quote unquote of invaders headed for our southern border and fully expect that it will be stopped at all costs before it reaches our border not an courtrooms however we must not lose sight of the likely eight hundred thousand strong quiet invasion\nAt a less public level that is crossing our border this year\nBrand new data from customs and border protection should mobilized Trump and Republicans cannot just focus on the caravan baton finally stopping the broader invasion in its entirety\nAccording to customs and border protection that she be P roughly four hundred thousand illegals were caught sneaking in between our point of entry and fiscal year twenty Eighteen and it's not even over\nAnother roughly one hundred and twenty five thousand presenting themselves at the port of entry into fight twenty Eighteen were deemed in admissible\nThat fact that the overall numbers increase by one hundred and six thousand her that fight twenty Seventeen is enough of a concern but several other data points or even more concerning the trajectory and the nature of the border crossings or what should really worry us\nFirst it's important to remember that border agents will tell you that the u._s. typically apprehend only about fifty percent of those who are legally cross the border that me\nInstead they were likely close to eight hundred thousand people who cross the border last year not at our points of entry\nNow as such it's not just the several hundred thousand illegals that were released into our population after being apprehended that you're concerned those who care about their communities in schools much more concerning or the ... but we never apprehend who most likely are more dangerous than the ones we did every hand\nAs Brandon Judd president of the border patrol council explain a several months ago to or watch\nThe criminal cartels are pushing them that is these family units in front\nAs the sacrificial lambs\nForcing me to use my resources to take them in the custody so that they can then crossed the dangerous criminals right behind them and we play into their hands by continuing to humanize the way things are happening on the border it's more than humanize we romanticize of ladies and gentlemen\nOr just from a drug crisis standpoint\nThe hundreds of thousands of undetected illegals coming in every year thanks to the fake sympathy over families is terrifying as the LA Times wrote in a recent report\nQuote Chinese companies since ... now and small quantities to dealers in the United states or Canada but ship the drugs in bulk to criminal cartels in Mexico\nWell then what happens the cartels they mix the synthetic into heroin and other substances are press them in the counterfeit pills the product has been smuggled across the border see the Chinese government working with Mexican cartels\n[noise] the president of the signing a series of opioid pills today all of which fell to recognize this premise as the main cause of the Seventy two thousand annual deaths\nThan the state of point\nThat's a concern us as the trajectory of the increase\nWhich is unfathomable while the overall numbers aren't higher than they were during Obama that is because the numbers dropped way once in a generation load during the first few months of Trump's presidency just based on the perception that he didn't force our sovereignty since a legal saw that nothing changed\nTheir numbers surge beyond belief and the president has been trying over and over again he's been telling us he wants to make changes but the Democrats in Congress are blocking it\nAnd so are some Republicans by the way\nA total of sixteen thousand six hundred and fifty eight family units these are ... nuclear families\nWere caught between the point of entry in September a new record and he's sharp spike from the previous months into the one hundred sixty one thousand and I love and one hundred and Thirteen family units were apprehended this year remember\nOnly one point four percent of the family units apprehended last year were deported so almost all of them remain in our communities along with the nearly half a million others who are never apprehended and this is growing every year so now we've gotten to almost seven hundred thousand\n[noise] and it goes on\nThis is an incredibly serious matter of course national sovereignty the rule of law or the nature of our immigration system it's being openly and brazen Lee violated and not just by aliens\nBy people in our own country by people in our own country now\nWe spend a lot of time\nNight it's been picked up by a lot of news outlets a conservative news outlets since today as we have in the past on this issue pointing out the hypocrisy of the Democrats Hillary Clinton Bill Clinton Brock Obama Bernie Sanders\nChuck Schumer and many others Harry Reid the positions that they took ten years ago Fifteen Years ago twenty five years ago the positions that they took on a legal immigration first of all they called them illegal immigrants\nAs recently as two thousand nine twenty ten Chuck Schumer called them illegal immigrants as a matter of fact he admonished his audience in two thousand nine he said look\nIf you don't use the word illegal then you lose essentially the moral high ground what is this undocumented stuff he said now of course he's reversed course 'cause they're all about power and politics none of our country\n[noise] so what's the point the point is the Democratic party is not even the Democrat Party of ten years ago\nIt's certainly not the Democrat Party Twenty years ago his position on immigration like its position on economics like its position in the military like its position on healthcare embraces increasingly radical\nPolicies in attitudes and it's not going to get any better it's going to get worse\nBecause the media really want to understand the division in this country they need only look at themselves and look at the course of the Democratic party has taken you've a party where John Kennedy couldn't be nominated for the presidency today you have a party where Bill Clinton couldn't be nominated for the presidency today\nYou have a party that wouldn't nominate Harry Truman for the presidency today and I could go down the list\n\nAnd so now you have individuals who won out radical each other how me who is a centrist and the Democrat leadership boy so called ... can you name one just name one\nWell I Can't name any I don't see 'em do you\nAll right by the way we have a wonderful guest at the bottom of the hour I told you each night now we'll have one or two candidates on here um there are many who are deserving of support and you know who they are but ah doesn't work that way

they don't anymore if the Democrats have completely gone so far left that they don't care about the the working class and\nIn America anymore and you know the biggest thing that bugs me I'll walk the walk but I think the biggest thing that could be done is it's both sides it's it's\nIf if you really enforced verify it\nAnd you didn't want to these people and he said okay every illegal aliens you hire or going to fire you ten thousand dollars a week and and I think Trump was behind this and if I'm not mistaken that was brought up during this whole dreamer thing\nWell give me another one why don't we enforce our visa rules forty five percent of the people here illegally comes to the front door and overstay their visas\nYeah exactly and it's just really frustrating because I'm I'm a\nBut

Texas and about twenty two hundred miles away from the border crossing at Tijuana source President Trump said there is time to work with Mexico to work together or with Mexico this I think underscores the need\nFor increased border security and the wall\nIf you have the wall or you can have these situations and certainly you don't want\nFourteen thousand people at the wall you would still have to work on these types of caravans but it would be a big deterrent\nOr because you people would do what they would be up against would they reached the U.S a southern border take your phone calls one hundred sixty four thirty one to that's one eight hundred six eight four thirty one let me ah I go to\nBat Harry ... the idea here this goes to also national security it's not just a humanitarian issue the department of homeland security\nHas said that they in a tweet or from their spokesperson they can confirm I'm putting them that they're individuals within the caravan who who are gang members or have significant criminal histories citizens of countries are since outside of Central America including the middle east\nAfrica South Asia and elsewhere are currently traveling through Mexico toward the U.S I mean that is from the department of homeland security doing their intelligence work to figure out who these people are\nAbsolutely so broadly speaking the caravan is a challenge to the integrity of the U. S. borders it's a challenge to the rule of law I'm much\nMore directly with respect to some of these individuals who are in ban it in the care of and many of those individuals are a direct\nThreat to US security\nOr some of them are smugglers some of them are drug smugglers human trafficking smugglers et cetera and some of them are perhaps harbor terrorists ambitions and so it would be difficult to look at a mass of fourteen thousand people ...\nAnd then to separate out those who are legitimate a refugee claimants from those who wish to do us harm so we should engage in a full throated a diplomatic effort\nParticularly with Mexico and Honduras to stem the flow we must intervene before the caravan reaches our border\nIt's important to note as you indicated earlier joined that many of the individuals who are in the caravan\nOr they don't seem to like the United states so why are they in the care of then why are they coming why are they ... up perhaps uh putting swastikas on American flags if they desperately our rent a one to be come refugee immigrants to the United states\nSo there are lots of questions out there\nUh yes we should enforce our law with compassion um but we should seek to intervene in stem the flow before it reaches our border\nOne eight hundred and sixty four thirty one tennis number you call if you want to talk to us on the air is John's call ready in California on line three John welcome to Jay Sekulow alive you're certainly in the state where\nA a you deal with the illegal immigration on a daily basis and the the this caravan could be heading your way they haven't made the decision yet on which way to turn towards California or Texas or else they'll get that far but John thanks for call you're on the air\nLike Paul ... was ... or so ... was also people ... culture war ...\nWell let me play for you secretary said palm pale I think in the ... in the emergency kind of situation I last year could build a wall in this time period a you know there are thousand miles away from our closest border it's it's that's not going to happen I agree Congress should have already passed that I think the president agrees\nCongress should have already passed that so the construction could begin but take a listen [noise] to secretary of state Mike Pompeo ate a clear message to all of those people in the care of and then I'll go to Andy to talk about really whose role in the U.S government this is at this point when you've got the caravan\nOf fourteen thousand people heading our way take somebody called payout\nHe I'd say it's also has a message for those who are currently part of this caravan for any caravan which follows you will not be successful at getting into the United states illegally no matter what\nI repeat the care of and will not cross our southern border illegally under any circumstances if he seeks to come here go through the normal refugee process if you apply for refugee status a permanent solution as possible and Mexico or at a third country but I can tell you with certainty\nWe're determined that illegal entry into the United states from this caravan will not be possible\nBut there again I think this and he goes to the main point which is that at this stage of the game this is the executive\nBranch role because you've got to deal with a foreign country a Congress really doesn't have time to act that can't build a wall or they could authorize it but they can't build it up so it it's now comes up to the executive to work with yet another Ford power to prevent this group of individuals for reaching one of our southern border entry points\nYes that is correct your ... it is an executive branch obligation responsibility right now Congress is out of session and they don't come back on November thirteenth after the elections\nWere were they when they shouldn't have been doing the this legislating about this they were a wall or they were not doing their job they were not doing a the the functions of a legislative to cheer so they've left it to the executive branch and and that includes the statements that may or may by the secretary of state\nWho has a responsibility but also the department of homeland security which really has to protect our borders but ultimately the buck rests with the president of the United states\nI Believe we actually did that when it was a smaller group so back in April there were walls set up a to make sure that individuals uh that was a much smaller number again that we're talking about uh about Fifteen hundred total ... ended up being about five hundred that made it to the wall but there was a wall in\nPlace I I don't know if it was a temporary structure put there by the military or certainly one that was reinforce hairy so yes you could harried certainly have the time with a thousand miles out or twenty two hundred miles after putting out which border crossing a this group decides to go to or if they split up to go to different\nA border crossings there there are certainly times to reinforce specific areas of the border\nI think you're absolutely right Jordan it's important also to note that the border between the United states and Mexico is very very long yeah and so ... the U.S military or to the extent that they are able to put up temporary structures to impede a border crossings\nAre they will perhaps have to wait about in the sense to find\nOut what direction or the caravan is going to take\nA but they're all still then be time to put up some temporary structures to impede the caravan from crossing into the United states but I also think we should focus um most of our efforts at the moment\nOn diplomatic a ... efforts with respect to Mexico um I think secretary of state pump pale according to CNN News has said that the caravan will not cross our southern border illegally under any circumstances\nYou know and so that is why I think again very important folks to ... this is a this is the executive branch issue right now\nCongress could certainly pass federal laws prevent this in the future but right now the executive has to deal with what they are dealing with we come back we'll take your phone call

just to update you briefly because I Know all the news networks recovery right now so we're not going to adored they're suspicious packages that have been intercepted or that we're going to the hopes that President Obama a former President Bill Clinton\nAnd secretary of State Hillary Clinton or George Soros I see it in water sitter and appears even potentially in Florida too would have Debbie Wasserman Schultz is that Congress will but one of her field offices in state offices in Florida it appears that there's certainly some kind of leak\nBetween the individual or individuals\nWho put together a these are devices ah thankfully no one has been injured done of these devices has exploded a but there's still an active law enforcement Vesta gay should all go away that appears to be leaked\nAll these devices do appear to be leaked we will continue to update you throughout our show today\nAs the news wards are the biggest news is probably the ... in New York called Columbus Circle is evacuated that includes a would have seeded major hubs it includes also a a major hotel the Mandarin Oriental shopping ... restaurants a a grocery store\nAnd other offices so that is significant that it is shut down such an important building an area\nIn New York City the other issue that we're focusing on the most take your calls around to analyze it is this caravan of fourteen thousand a day that's what the estimate is fourteen thousand heading towards\nA U.S border coming down through Mexico a but had it been eating out of the Honduras or add a this is much larger than the care of and that was that was back in April which edits biggest point was Fifteen hundred we do their political motivations behind this caravan from the left\nOut of Central America specifically out of how diverse\nThe conservative president of Honduras has asked people to return and offered them assisted to help\nTo get back on their feet it does so they're doing the right thing but they don't have the power to keep these people back so we've got to work with Mexico before this ends up on our border or the estimates are there about a thousand miles away from the closest border a tree in Texas\nAnd did a couple of thousand miles away from the border a tree in California we're going to take your phone calls on it now one eight hundred sixty four thirty what Ted I just called for Pennsylvania on line one I welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nYou're happy when\nThey do it like question is could be a couple of that first date with their own troops also provide some type of care for it\nAnd it would eliminate some of the responsibility is pointing going towards the U.S and this is the issue\nI think right now the U.S is doing reports that an estimating the numbers of people I don't ever fact\nPatsy on Facebook right wrote it will the U.S to try to get involved so she was thinking the same thing I\nUh I I think that what is troubling is that whether you it gets involved or they will start telling everyone who has to take who ... out the numbers and setting up refugee camps and I don't think that's the situation we want to be at right now I think this can be handled\nBy two major powers the United states and Mexico\nWho worked side by side this is not good for Mexico the U.S could provide the support to make sure the Mexican authorities have the support necessary to prevent this from causing more trouble in Mexico it ultimately trouble on our border in the United states by the way we talk about\nWhat's happening towards our border we are talking about what's happening in Mexico that they're dealing with because until you cross over your in Mexico so this is they have as a serious interest in getting the situation under control but I don't believe that we would want the un ah to be\nMore involved in this process at this point in time\nWhat do you have to four and a half hours could handle it who have the resources to handle the situation we will pay for your

child sacrifices they practiced human sacrifice they burn babies alive or so not such a level folks\nAnd by the way you want to have ancient Canaan nights welcomed with open arms into the United states are your six sorry son of a B and you need help science LA and San Francisco will thank you for helping me with this segment we talked about this earlier\nIn the show 'em look I think it is perfectly appropriate for people to have personal compassion for some of the people who are in that caravan and no I don't think they are all terrorists and I don't think they all mean or evil for the United\nStates but it is you simply cannot say that the country is going to be wide open to a every single human being in the world who is hungry\nAre starving or facing violence\nAre facing a difficult situation it's billions of people and that is not fair to the people who have lived here who themselves or their families have contributed to the United states I look what what has\nTo happen with the caravan particularly this is a test and if the Democrats really want us to say oh come on and you six thousand or seven thousand or however many they are\nThen what do you say to the next caravan was already starting in Guatemala\nThe truth of the matter is I Do believe President Trump is wrong to say well we should cancel foreign aid to El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala what we should do is a look let's work together on this and we will provide more of that foreign aid to keep the people there\nAnd for the people who are going to be sent back from the caravan you don't have to say well you're going to be sent back to a hopeless situation send them back with some private organizations or some Christian organization some do good organizations that will help them get set up so they don't have to live under such squalid conditions\nOf back in Honduras or back in Guatemala with the other caravan but the the answer and I haven't heard a single Democrats say this but that's the implication\nIf everyone who is needy\nAnd helpless and a destitute and desperate has an open door in the United states\nWhat does that mean to our population and what is\nI mean for the people who are here on ready\nAs Joanne from Los Angeles wrote in\nEr during the disagreements segment last week you mentioned how the rights is not generally harassed groups of politicians as the left is prone to do I remember the Tea Party people disrupting rallies and far right groups in Charlottesville et cetera okay the Tea Party people were not disrupting rallies\nWhat she's talking about is they came to town meetings\nA constituent meetings that were held by congressman to try to get their attention and\nThe left does this to that that it seems to me is not is not hateful when people come and you have a constituent meeting with a member of Congress would I'm Talking about ... I the effort to shut down people and not allow them to speak\nThis on college campuses is uniquely the left when it comes to interrupting congressional hearings uh when it comes to and you might say well what about these bombs we don't know about the bombs right now we don't\nBut it's it's so laments a ball and the same thing by the way it's true Charlottesville Charlottesville wasn't conservatives\nAnd these people these creeps that's one of the good things in the ... movie\nAnd yes it has some good things in it some things that are I have more problems with one of the things that I thought was very good in the movie an interview with Richard Spencer who is this leading neo Nazi was very much part of that Charlottesville scene and he's a leftist he's not on the right\nOkay and then there's a another email that came in about were left and right stand right now and where they're going saying that no Republicans haven't moved to the right up plus a a tweet that says Michael you're wrong President Trump is a hundred percent responsible\nFor where rage takes us in the United states we will get to that and more on disagreement day on the Michael that that child [noise]\nMichael ...

cities of Minneapolis in Minnesota for lots of reasons will talk about tomorrow is part of ground zero in this election struggle\nMeanwhile a couple of other disagreeing emails and a and one tweet the tweet is I'm\nA pretty direct it was a tweet so it's not that long for Robert G. and Robert ... says Trump has huge influence over how millions of people think\nWhen he says Democrats are evil or the presses the enemy he foment raged for his game and it's a hundred percent responsible for where that rage takes us\nLook I agree with you is reprehensible when he says things like that and I don't think he's said directly the Democrats are evil but when he says the presses the enemy of the people he should drop it and and again it's just not worth it\nBecause anybody who likes that or is going to vote for Trump and the Republicans anyway\nAnd uh for people who are uncomfortable with it like those people in the middle like those famous suburban moms that we need to win to win this election\nA building that houses a Washington radio station that would be our affiliate WMA around Washington DC was evacuated after report of a suspicious package authorities said\nThe offices of WMA out FM uh in the forty four hundred block of gender first street northwest were evacuated police said\n[noise] please said several nearby streets were closed as well\nWMA al as a news and talk station known for its conservative syndicated programming such as Rush Limbaugh show\n[noise] of course it has our show as well in addition to its halftime service it also break ... broadcasts on six thirty AM no further information was immediately available but the suspicious package at the station where there was connected to this week's discovery of explosives center prominent mostly political figures across the country\nSo we don't know I don't know\n\nThis is serious\n\nFrom my I'm reading this as I got it I wrote my buddy Larry O'Connor who fills in for me now and then and handles the local Sean WMA out says here\nAnd he was broadcasting at the time and they had to go to a best stuff as they evacuated the building and said we had a suspicious package delivered to us your name was on the label by the way I guess mine\nA police recall they ordered an immediate evacuation ends up a false alarm okay false alarm I don't know what all this from ... my name was on the package\nMr producer you thought my name is on the package to how did she know that you get what now\nYou get worried about the mail there [noise]\nWhat we do get our threats don't we and I I wanted to talk about that briefly about about me\nOr but kind of what takes place\nIn terms of the country and these various threats that have taken place and so forth and uh [noise] and I wanted to point this out\nWe have these packages and we'll get more into them in a moment\nWe have these packages going on now ten of them to various Democrats\nAnd law enforcement politicians to meeting the American people have every right to be concerned and outrage every right to rational right to be concerned about this is a bad thing and it is a bad thing\n\nBut I went back and looked in the recent few months\nAnd ABC News reported just a few weeks ago suspicious letters sent the Republican Senator Susan Collins is home author started contained rice and\n\nAnother one ... to ... the secretary of defense and the chief of ah of the navy they tested positive for rice and\n\nEric Trump saying the entire family has receive white powder in the mail I was in August\nWhen there's others\nMarco Rubio\nCan't remember them all\nIt's just\nHard to to to ignore the fact that all these examples I gave you before\n\nIt ... wasn't that they were downplayed was that they weren't really covered in any several why were they\n\nAll these packages going to the Trump family all these packages going to the Pentagon Madison so forth are to Rubio or other members here and there\nI'm not trying to make anything of this\nI'm just saying\nThe coverage was different the coverage of what happened is Susan Collins was different wasn't administered the dosing [noise] there was no panic mode\n\nThey didn't blame Donald Trump Fort incidentally 'cause how could they because the Trump family was receiving some of these things\nThe president who was sent to the president and he gets death threats all the time\n\nSo there's something odd about how the reporting takes place on so much of this now that said\nI told you yesterday that I could see them together we could see how the media we're moving to attacking\nTrump for what's taking place and now it's fully open\nIt's fully open\nThat Trump's words and Trump's rallies and Trump's tweets are encouraging the sort of thing\nAnd I took a stand yesterday at least for the first out of the program and I explained well actually the media say many more hatred vile disgusting things in the present\nUs than any politician does\nNational Public radio NPR contacted Westwood One and asked them if I Would submit to a twenty minute interview\nI said why would I submit to a twenty minute maybe I just spent an hour talking about it\nYou can download it she can do your little cherry picking in your set up job and I don't even know why there is a National Public radio it's necessary we have thousands of radio stations scores of radio companies why do we need a government run radio company where the hosts are overpaid and they have no ratings\nThey don't live by ratings or die by ratings like anybody else you know competition for them it's government radio whatever government radio and a free society for but anyway\n\nSo we have these rice and attacks against Republican senators Susan Collins right after she voted for cabinet other threats\nPositive for rice and sent to Madison the or the the chief of the navy center the president of the United states white powder set the members of the president's family I really do not remember CNN getting all worked up about white powder being sent to the president's family does anybody else\nNow\nWhy does all this matter it matters because the media are out there trying to determine who politically should benefit and who politically should be punished it's the damage thing it's the most grotesque thing\nAnd of course if Trump\nTrump's to blame But Trump's not to blame for any of it he didn't do anything\nNow I Want to um play a montage for you on this pathetic program on MSL as the the morning schmo and Mrs ... you're going to make it but you're also going to hear\nA never Trump or probably denies he's never Trump or John

bastards really ticked me off I think I'm going to commit a mass murder attack\nPlease don't get me wrong he says\nOf the speech we're hearing from politicians as reprehensible it's a sign of the time by the way from the media to Andy [laughter] it's a sign of the times a reflection of the course of our culture an indicator of how we've lost respect for ourselves and the civility a good manners that go with it [noise]\nThere's more over long been a category of speech usually referred to as fighting words that has given been given minimal constitutional protection because apparently insults and insights\nLet's see but I Do not mean to suggest that it is inconceivable that any but the most palpable incitement could ever be actionable politicians explicitly call for violence and violence results they should be held politically\nAccountable regardless whether the circumstances\nAllow for the prosecution my point is simply this no one goes on a bombing spree because of something hurt at

media attack\n\nWeather was march of twenty Seventeen when I put together their reports and talked about the surveillance and obviously been taking place in Trump world\nOr if you go to Wikipedia you take a look what's going on there it's a disgrace what they've written about me and how they managed that site you wouldn't even recognized\nFor when I wasn't here I was with my father sitting by side in the Washington Post Robert Koester and another reporter decided that they didn't like what I see our TV host says so they had to mark Levin she our TV\nAnd they're over at the mother Jones says clown Kevin Drum he takes it and actually puts quotes around words as if I send them I never said a word\nIn two weeks wasn't on the air never shut it worried about 'cause shrug it doesn't matter now which they're not one of them has withdrawn it not one of them as apologized\nYou know I objected and I object now on the left and the Democrats want to constantly interfere with our economy [noise] one industry after another one industry after another degree with me\n\nThat Democrats are always wanting to regulate industries they're always wanting to tell them what to do they're always wanted to set up their price structure and their employees structure and all other structures in our industry we don't support that do we\n\nI mean the way you create more products in the way you drive down costs is worth less government right less government interference\nI mean that makes sense\nTo Democrats constantly want to drive up the cost of domestic steel\n\nWhich results and you're paying more for pickup trucks and your truckers out there for your Eighteen wheelers and people who want to buy purchase a car drives up the cost of homes because believe it or not they're stealing your homes are still in a lot of stuff so it drives up costs and the Democrats are always wanting to drive up costs why is that\n\nIs a payoff to certain unions is at it\n\nAnd it makes it much more difficult to export our products because it's much more expensive to create them to to build them ... to construct them to manufacture them\nAn automobile for instance if it costs two or three thousand dollars more to build an automobile in this country because the Democrats drive up the cross the steel well then we're not going to export as many automobiles and what happens to the to the auto workers well\nThey don't fare too well do they what happens the American manufacturing a auto makers well they're going to fare less well to same with the people build motorcycles so I'm really tired of the Democrats doing that\n\nThe Democrats have been talking for decades have up basically controlling pharmaceutical companies\nControlling the cost of pharmaceuticals well how's that going to control the costs of pharmaceuticals how do they know what the cost of pharmaceuticals\n... the we talked about this the other day the billions of dollars that these companies spend to find\nTo make to figure out what works and what doesn't work and most of the time they fail that's why there is a significant cost for certain types of medicines\n\nAnd we talked about the poverty programs they have for people who can actually show that their income is at such a level that they can't afford super expensive medicines and so forth but the Democrats want to control that Bernie Sanders talks about all the time\nMore\nGovernment interference how's the government going to know what the charge for something\nI don't know [noise]\nThen you look at ... capital what started as an alternative to natural gas and oil because what OPEC was doing to us we're now the biggest producer of oil and natural gas on the face of the year we don't need ethanol and I don't want any calls about it I don't want to all the self serving calls we get 'em all I'm not interested\nWe don't need ethanol we don't need to use wheat\nAs part of an element and making gasoline for your car and for most cars it's very damaging\n\nSo basically we're ... seizing people who have\nWho produce that says we don't need it the environmental issues to push it now they backed off and they say hey you know what you can you create more pollution or using as an art creating as at all then you don't the point is we don't need it anymore so why should the federal government and pose Fifteen Percent ethanol and feel\nAnd it's been a big push by the left all these years now 'cause it was done for eight months a year to make it a twelve month issue that is the sale of eat Fifteen ethanol blend all year round not just for eight months\n\nWhile the Democrats didn't do this the Trump Administration did all three of these things\nAll three of these things\nFord Motor company which I guess we're supposed to hate now has said the U.S steel costs more than anywhere else in the world they're spending an extra one billion dollars on manufacturing automobiles and you can see right now automobile sales are flat for new automobile\nBecause the prices are going up several thousands of dollars\n\nSo millions and millions of people are affected by that and they don't even know it same with refrigerators same with washers and dryers same with dishwashers\n\nSame with anything that as steel or for that matter lumina the prices are going up and that as a pressure on what inflation and you can start seeing inflation going up and interest rates going\n\nI support the American worker I support the American consumer I support the American economy America First means capitalism first\n\n... I don't believe in free free markets pure free markets well nobody does because we don't have them and we've never had them but that doesn't mean you embrace these Bernie Sanders ... not so good drugs\n\nThe president's put out a dictate it's not even legal\n\nHe's put out a dictate through the department of ah what do they call health and Human Services\n[noise]\nThey want price transparency I don't have a problem with that\n\nWe all want price transparency but when they do the price transparency on pharmaceuticals here's what they need to do the same thing at the gas tank when you go there and they they show you are the prices in all show us the taxes show us the cost show us they are indeed that went into that particular medicine\n\nOther word you want transparency thing give it give us all the trends parents that's involved\n\nYou see the amount of money that's being spent you can read in the newspaper all the time to find various cures for cancer you see the amount of money that's being spent did find cures for dementia and Alzheimer's the amount of money that's being spent to try and find cures for diabetes and so forth money's being spent over and over again and really\nIn many ways or at least in some ways it's been quite beneficial people live longer than ever before\n\nYou know the government tried to regulate the cost of vaccines under Clinton and other administrations you know what happened we want vaccine company left and they couldn't make enough vaccines and then they at a hospital so we had to import vaccines from New York and other places\nWhen the government gets involved prices go up demand goes on quality goes down availability goes down this is a matter of fact\nIt's not a matter of conservatism liberalism socialism capitalism is a fact it is experience it's provable so now we're driving up the cost of consumer goods big consumer goods I'll give you another one\nAnd somebody you want like this either because you know you're suspending irrationality and it's just a you're waving the flag of a one party or another I don't care\nThat support this president\nDoesn't mean I agree with everything I don't agree with what he's doing in these areas are winning bring 'em up\nThe tax cuts\nNew home sales are flat and starting to decline it's starting to happen with re sales now why is that\nWhile the media will tell you mostly that it's because of increasing interest rates low interest rates are increasing but ladies and gentleman they're nowhere near high interest rates four percent four and a half percent\nMany of us have lived through eleven twelve Twenty one percent interest rates this has nothing historically it's minimal\nThat's not why\nWhy do you know why Mr producer\n\nBecause you can't that Dr all of your interest payments on mortgages and all your property taxes anymore there's at ten thousand dollar threshold and it's doing exactly what I said it would do\n\nHaving a negative effect on home sales those if you want to resell your homes whether it's in a red state blue state I don't care you're in America it's harder to reach your home now\nAnd for builders to hire what we call construction workers and electricians and plumbers and Tyler's and brick workers\nAnd on and on and on all those men all those women are affected by this\n\nI Wish it was the greatest tax cut in American history\nBut as it applies to individuals that simply was not\n\nAnd so it has a downward push\n\nThat the man who made this nationalism frame famous in the last century was Theodore Roosevelt progressive and he gave this famous speech called the new nationalism speak they talked about all the things big centralized government was going to do and that's when I said to the president at least on the air you don't want to be that do you\nWhen I turned on national is worth about American is when you say America First you're not seeing nationalism first\nWe believe in federalism\nNow I Know what the president meant you know what the president meant for the last that was just another opportunity to be fame the president and the dumb down what Hitler did it's sick but words that meaning they've consequence\n\nYou listening to me you're not nationalist nationalist you believe in big centralized government that national government at all times these would be the state governments are local governments that's not what you believe it's not nationalism versus globalism it's constitutional isn't\nVersus global isn't it capitalism that we embrace constitutional as individual is\n\nHas to put a fine point on it\nThere's no reason the government should be involved in what goes into your tank on your car your gas tank or your or your pickup truck you're Eighteen wheeler all they do a screw it up and drive up the cost [noise]\nThere's no reason to pay two or three thousand dollars more for vehicle [noise]\nIn order to different check one union and one industry [noise]\nThere's no
