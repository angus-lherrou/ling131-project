step forward it's not the most important election of your lifetime\nUh but but it's important for the next two years because of the Democrats do when the majority in the house we're looking at

[noise]\nYou're looking at impeachment you're looking at investigations [noise]\nFor as far as the eye can see your looking investigations of the Trump Administration and the Republican Party and

guy's going to be a running for president\nOr he is on the intelligence committee he's Joaquin Castro he's a congressman he's a Democrat he's on the intel committee\nWhich means the Democrats take him very seriously by this this used to be a committee that that you know transcended party it was about the most important sensitive information that this country or could ever waded into\nA ... that that it it shows no politics there's no red there is no blue there's just red white and blue on the intelligence committee [noise] uh and then the Democrats brought us Adam Schiff as the ranking

heard of politicians say about another government official and that's saying something\nSpeaking about the current situation in Saudi Arabia\nI Know poppy that there's been a lot of discussion about this W more discussion on CNN and all the other networks today [noise] let me get to the point that I think is most of the survey right now the reporting that Jared Kushner may have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit with an enemy is where\nThe crown prince the NBA or Saudi Arabia and that the print that may have acted on that one of the people that he took action again took a soldier getting kids as they're not really I have\nI just find it there for me or we do not have that report am not sure where you're getting there had\nBeen recording to that effect not according to that effect sure\nNow here's where you have to understand why this matters more than just you know some sort of gas for some sort of outrage the outrage of the day a Democrat is accusing Jerry ... hit on this guy and working in concert colluding if you will with the Saudi Arabian government and the crown prince\nA ... that's certainly all valid and true but here's the most important thing you need to understand about this he's one of their stars\nThe Democrats win the house\nTwo and a half weeks from today and he is in the leadership\nI mean he's he's he's a rising star he they're going to give him power more power than he has right now this guy who was peddling a conspiracy theory that is completely be bombed unfounded and atrocious he goes on CNN in turn national television\nAnd accuses Jared Kushner the president's son in law and a White House advisor\nOf delivering U.S intelligence to Saudi Arabia so that this is a columnist for the ... could be killed\nAnd and they're going to

getting done if you care if if you are sick and tired and fed up\nOf the ongoing drama the UC play out and cable and broadcast news on a daily basis with regard to the Democrats are acting hysterical about this president and about this administration than this is a no brainer\nThis really is a no brainer you cannot give walking Castro [noise]\nAny more power than he already has in the house of representatives frankly has too much as it is\nAs a junior congressman from Texas He shouldn't be on that committee with that kind of irresponsible behavior with that kind of irresponsible language by the way he he came out later this is this is amazing he came out later and said I didn't intend\nTo a accused Jared Kushner of any illegal behavior and I didn't intend to accuse jury cushion or could you\nMay have with the U.S intelligence delivered a hit with an enemies with to the crown prince the NBA or Saudi Arabia and the print that may have acted on that one of the people that he took action again [noise] so do\nI ... he did you hear what he just said and now he claims after the fact via Twitter is how they do it these days that I didn't I didn't intend to choose Jared Kushner\n\nOf calling a hit or doing anything on Puerto delivering this information well here's the problem with these Twitter denials these cowards who won't go on television he's fine going on international television on CNN and making this charge\nThe reporting that Jared Kushner may have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit with an enemies where\nThe crown prince the NBA or Saudi Arabia\nHe goes on international TV and delivers that and then when everyone starts screaming slamming and I'm Talking about liberals I'm Talking about the Daily Beast a website which is which is a left leaning left complete total left the site says I Can't\nBelieve that walking captured it that he doesn't then go on television and has an exchange with anyone no\nNo no no he puts out his apology non ...\nApology denial non denial walk back on Twitter\nWhere he says I did not intend to say that Jared Kushner blah blah blah blah blah and of course there's no reporter not that there would be but maybe poppy Harlow over there at CNN would actually are raised their hand and say okay\nCongressman Castro uh I understand your statements saying that you didn't intend can you tell us what you did intend to say\nBecause it seems pretty clear what\nYou said [noise]\nAnd and and here's the best\nPart of his denial that never got any follow up and never got any challenging as just except at all well he's ... he says he didn't intend to do that so let's just take him and his word they didn't do it he said all I said was there was reporting to the effect\nThat Jared Kushner may have done that and Congress needs to investigate I\nUse the [noise] and now and now that\nThat's the crux of it because you see\nEverything that happens in this town Washington DC everything that's happening down at the border right now everything that you're seeing on cable news night after night after night all of it has to do with the mid term election that Kavanaugh hearings that was all about the mid term elections\nThe the the the way the media and the Democrats and some Republicans are reacting to this story of this a columnist for the Washington Post who apparently was killed\nBy officials with the

Salvadorans Guatemalans Hondurans all waving their flags demanding to march across Mexico and enter our country and our elected officials seemed completely feckless and unable to do anything about it\nYou know if there's one thing that they're supposed to do is protect our nation protect our sovereignty protect our borders and they have no interest in doing so [noise] uh and that\nIs very much\nAbout this midterm election it should certainly be for fun in your mind or we're going to talk about that coming up in a bit but right now I Want to talk to women\nSpecifically women [noise] ah because I see when I saw the Brett Kavanaugh story turned the way that it did when I talk to women\nAnd they told me that they were so angry at what was done to now justice Kevin when they told me that when they saw justice cabin on when they bend judge Kavanaugh talking and having to defend himself they saw their husband they saw their father they saw their son who had lived the life that they would want them to live\nAchieve something at the highest level of sending the dedicated his entire professional life too and then they saw Democrats defending him they saw Democrats are skirting due process trying to destroy this man for their own selfish political purposes and then wrapping their attacks\nIn this this protective blanket\nOf of women's rights of of trying to protect the victims of sexual assault but ... weaponized\nThe me too movement you know the meat to this whole ... thing\nAnd I'm not a huge fan of the hashtags and the slogans and the movements and that stuff I don't think you are to who we like to be free thinkers we conservatives don't like to follow the herd we don't like to follow a\nA a trend we don't like to be a part of a movement and must that movement is about individual liberty and freedom which ultimately is anti movement right\nThat's the dichotomy of being a conservative and someone who wants freedom is that your your your joined a movement\nTo push for independence and the whole idea of independence is that you don't have to be part of a movement so I'm ... but that said\nI have great respect for women who do step forward and accused horrible people doing horrible things and the me too movement and be inspired by the Harvey Weinstein situation was so completely and totally different than what we saw with Kevin ... are these were women\nWho were not acting politically who were not attacking a person for his politics probably agree with him on his politics in fact his politics is what probably protected Harvey wide staying in many ways because he gave to all the right causes\nAnd and donated all all the right of feminist politicians so he could you could wear the mantle of feminists are Barbie wouldn't do that he loves women after all he donates to Planned Parenthood which is\nThe most despicable statement one could ever make if you really love and care about women the last thing you would do is give money to Planned Parenthood but that's how the left thinks that's how Hollywood sex and the me too movement as it\nIt came forward under Harvey Weinstein and some of the other allegations of Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose and they're all Democrats have you noticed there all liberals they're all they're all in the media for that matter\nBut what they had in common that we didn't see in the Kavanaugh proceedings was that there was immediately floodgates opened up other valid corroborated\nCompletely credible allegations what we saw with Kavanaugh were a couple of other allegations you know led by the likes of Michael ... there were completely and incredible\n... locked any ... any consistency\nBut\nWhat you saw with the cabin up thing was the politicization of the me too movement you saw me to use as a political weapon to destroy somebody because ultimately they didn't like their politics\nIt was just the last quiver in their ...\nWait the less arrow in their quiver\nYou know what I mean it was the last weapon at their disposal they tried everything else got no it was during those confirmation hearings and this one they secretly surreptitiously held back and then threw it out there as their final attack that's all it was\nAnd it was despicable and it was dishonorable and it went against everything that we in America stand for innocent until proven guilty due process\nAnd when I talked to women they were outraged at the Democrats about that\nAnd then something happened first of all Democrats aren't talking about it anymore which tells me you know they get it and they think that this was a loser for them if they spend too much time money focusing on it\nBut then I had a I mentioned that I'm from Michigan My brother and one of my brother still live up to my brother's still the Michigan one of them lives in the Detroit area listening on W. J. are my brother duck and I just spent a weekend with him and and he told me\nAnd I've heard this from some other people in other areas where there are close races right now\nA northern Virginia right here in the greater Washington area the temp district in Virginia My brother doc lives ah right over in Thaddeus McCotter's old district they're good Republican Thaddeus McCotter ah right there in the ... county Oakland County area these are all you know purple districts\nThese are districts that can go either way\nAnd I'm hearing that the suburban women\nThey're mad and they're not mad at the Democrats ... this me to sing is resonating with them that it's actually motivating their vote that there is a real danger for Republicans right now that they could lose the house because of this\nBut Democrats can overplay their hand so it was just sort of under the radar now the beauty of filling in for mark within here on the market within show coast to coast [noise] is that there are a whole lot of suburban women listening right now\nAnd I want to hear from you\nIf you are a suburban woman where do you stand right now on this thing and more importantly what are your friends saying because I'm thinking if you're listening to this program you might have already made up your mind and you might be voting Republican but that doesn't mean that all your friends and family\nAre Republicans you know when when you hang out with your girlfriends when you're standing on the sidelines of the soccer game and you're having conversations with the other moms\nAre you sensing right now that the Democrats really are going to ride a blue wave is it because of anger over this issue\nIs they're going to be a backlash I'd love to hear your take eight seven seven three one three eight one one and maybe I'm In a bubble maybe I'm a man and they're not allowed to share their secrets with me\nBut\nThe women the vast majority of women that I interact with her ... getting mad at the Democrats for doing what they did\nAnd and in fact that they're more energized now than ever before\nTo vote in these midterms strict party line Republicans they're not even looking at the candidates they just want to make sure that the Republicans maintain the majority\nThat's my experience but you know I'm asserting my patriarchy here and I'm saying that I only want to hear from women at age seven seven three one three eight one one I Want to know what you're hearing uh how about Nancy Fort Worth Texas Nancy you're on the market within show I'm Larry O'Connor Hi\nHow are you I'm good I'm concerned though\nAbout April than I Am concerned that this that there may be this this surge for the Democrats that I'm not sensing that I'm not seeing and that that's what's going to give the Democrats the majority\nOf that not not true and I wondered if they'd heard about the walk away from home oh sure yeah I'm proud to be there or I Am in Fort Worth about five of that they're gonna go their\nCar and I guess I felt like they are going to tell\nThe people that are walking away hysteria just crazy what's going on [noise]\nYeah and for those that don't know the walk away movement is a traditionally are people who are traditionally Democrat people who fit the traditional demographic of Democrats where they're African Americans Latino minorities women who I've I've seen through it all now and they're just it's okay to walk away from the party\nRight now that's right it's time for\nPeople that were like for our stock at that like walking away how hard it is it there we don't want to walk away from her or the they're violent or\nA whole the majority in the house and they're going to gain seats in the Senate and that would absolutely be a huge red wave because by all historic precedent\nAnd based on the media coverage right now Democrats should win the majority if they do it when the majority that has a huge story that that would be that would be a a a dog a man bites dog kind of story it's unpleasant but then I this past weekend I spend time with my brother from Michigan who lives in Michigan and he said oh there's something going on out there\nThat really is I'm worried I'm looking at some of these races in suburban Michigan something that should be Republican seats and women are angry women are really angry and at the cabinet things not playing the same I is it\nAre you hearing that lady's ...

Kato was a think tank that focuses on free market principles and ideas and a libertarian\nOr concepts and principles are and they're all brilliant throw all really smart people over Kato\nAnd ah I'm really looking forward to this a very special edition of life liberty and lived in the Sunday make sure you tune in because I miss the mark I miss my just as much as you do\nA great to be here I'm lifting my ah outrageous a gender discrimination they won't be ladies only from this point forward but I Do appreciate it I just did an event with mark living here in the greater Washington area we had a theater full of five hundred people\nA year for the station and the it was great marketed this great thing at the end of it you know we did like an hour and a half presentation on stage and before we were done he said you know I Want to say one more thing\nCan cut all the ladies stand up to the women in the room stand up and it was more than half of the room and it was so great\nThat he did that and and I loved having there's still a bunch of women on the line wanting to get in\nBecause there's this there's this fake Sony despicable\nMyth perpetuated about talk radio about what we do here when we when we discuss\nBig important ideas and conservative principles and values and we have this free\n\nSo I came back we went back and forth on this earlier today and if you want you can get the whole interview over at a my radio station to be a male dot com but I came back around and said All right let them I Know you want to throw a bunch of money at this government and you want to do all of these things on the ground to keep them from going but that's not going to stop these four thousand okay there on the way\nAnd frankly whatever money you send down there you've already sent plenty and that hasn't fix the problem I don't know how much more money you got to spend\nBut let's focus on what's happening right now 'cause you have a lot of criticism for President Trump for saying he's going to send the military down there for saying he's going to cut funding if these countries don't stop their own citizens from playing yeah you have all this criticism of him for actually trying to protect our borders so what would you do your senator for crying out loud\nWhat's the solution how do you stop these people from coming into our country when they reach our border what are we supposed to do\n[noise] but I don't know if I'll agree with you on that statement I I I've been in bed with the FBI down in Central America I Know how dangerous the numbers are\nBy the way I real fast let me just to be these ... I had just said that there's a criminal element that there are dangerous gang members who are coming along with the than we know that to be true\nHe's telling me that it's not true at a fine you you you you reach your own conclusion I before you decide do you think maybe there was a violent criminal element over the last several years the came along and cross the border\nWith these unaccompanied minors don't or they were all seven year old children really they all had tattoos but ... we quibble\nA I have interviewed a gang member who actually came to the United states to set up sister gangs including in Maryland so I understand the danger factor as it relates to these gang activities\nI think most of the families that show up at our border or people who see themselves as desperate they're trying to escape Central America in some cases the legitimate fear of their lives should be able to seek asylum\nRight okay so fine so so let's say they're coming to this country to seek asylum what do we do\nIf they have a legitimate claim for a song that claim should be heard no one should be admitted to our country without proper\nOkay but hold on I'm Sorry to stop you but wanting a better economic situation and being afraid of a criminal element in your home country are not legitimate claim\nThat are very few I don't disagree with you want\nAnd then I'm going to pause it for a minute 'cause that's terribly important because the Democrats and open border Republicans are doing this all the time\nThey say well you know these people are just seeking asylum in our country they're looking for a better life and we need to be compassionate and we need to follow international political for asylum\nSeeking a better economic life is not a legitimate claim asylum ... living in a crime infested country is not a legitimate claim for asylum otherwise my friends in Chicago will be claiming asylum in Toronto right now\nSo the ... that but that's all they'll say they'll say well you know the economic it's a horrible economic and they've got a horrible drug problem is horrible gang problem your rights but that's not a legitimate claim asylum so if that's the reason for coming they need to be turned around they can't be let in that's not a silent\nBetter economic opportunities to browse herself so what do we do with them [noise] well ... what we happen to them a prior to the Trump administration's return some oil we we we either if they're from Mexico they returned to Mexico there from Central America we fly back to Central America\nReally that's not actually what's been happening at all as you know easy because they come in here and they claim asylum even though they're not supposed to be eligible for asylum\nAnd what happens then\nAs soon as they cross the border and they're stopped by border patrol and they say oh I Want asylum you know what happens then\nWell I get into what I play a little bit more of this is important for you to hear because
