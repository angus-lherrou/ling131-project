saw this from another reporter who's worked I've always esteem very highly Julia high\nAnd they were to my fellow American Jews she said this president makes this possible here where you live I Hope the embassy more move over there where you don't live was worth it in other words the embassy mood\nIs what caused\nThe killing in Pittsburgh\n[noise] and she has a voice on MSNBC they're very proud of her\nThe calculation here I suppose is that people voted for Trump to get an embassy moving their vote proxy murdered other Jews how careful should one be should distinguish reporter be accusing others of such enormous these even indirectly and this goes to this guy Schmidt\nGood little German\nHead of people think this message will fall on the use of those who fled from Iran to be told that they are in fact guilty and the death of Pittsburgh Jews\nAre even more shameful you only years ... some at Mr ... a Holocaust survivor escaped death by four minutes before he was a little Lake Shore because he was he's also a strong supporter of Trump\nFrank\nJulia what'd you stand before this eighty year old man not in a tweeter on line peace but face to face and tell them he's responsible for

your neighbors and all the community [noise]\n\nWhat we want this country to look like [noise] the reason it's not a regular election is because the Democrats have nominated some very very radical even anti American candidates and I will say that because if you're pushing socialism\nIf you're pushing extra constitutional policies and that's right it's an American\nAnd um if you're disgusted with the media you need to turn out and vote and push them back to\n\nFree speech freedom of the press I can tell you at our founding a freedom of the press was not what it is today\n\nFreedom of the press was about promoting a revolution against the monarchy freedom of the press was about Republicanism small are Republican is freedom of the press\nWas about individual isn't\n\nFreedom of the press was about representation and limited government\n\nWho is not a rabbit progressive agenda [noise] and uh we need to keep this in mind\nBecause of the progressive or not about supporting our principles progressive as they're not about what you and I believe in this is a huge battle some big election he wanted a president who would shake things up that's exactly what he's doing he's trying to push back\nHe's trying to push back really like no president I've ever seen before\n\nAnd even today he's being compared to Hitler he's being called a racist it's grotesque what's going on in this

I'm not going to do it normally but I'm going to do it in this case 'cause it's an extraordinarily important time in our history\nAnd I'm also going to have an expert on the program to go through a number of races that are very close and I consider very important\n\nWe're truly battling a very bleak force they very dark force in this country that do not share our values and principles they lecture us while they attack us they tell us to tone it down why they call our president Hitler\n\nAnd there's many big it's among the many like Don limit of CNN the thing he said the other day is a firewall offense or Steve Schmidt on MSNBC another big it\n\nAnd the things he has said and now I've gone through and look these are firing offenses but the executives the corporate executives on the boards of directors of these companies Comcast Time Warner and the rest they obviously want this\nThey want a divided country they want the race baiting they want the anti Semitism coming out of the media\n\nThey don't want a United Nations uh United Nation they don't want people having civil substantive serious debates\nThey one centralized power\nWith these corporations and these executives believe they can uh they control outcomes in this society\n\nOr we're going to talk more about this as the program goes on but I Want to hit this issue again the birthright citizenship\n\nAre hearing people who make absolutely no sense on this issue saying that the president cannot use an executive order to address birthright citizenship again Mike ... is that I Know the courts are going to be hostile to any effort\nTo curb birthright citizenship statutory or by executive order\nBut I hear people say a statute will be stronger first of all they're not going to get a statute because it will be filibustered in the Senate so it's a non issue that Democrats aren't going to allow it they want birthright citizenship\nSome of the filibuster rule in the Senate there will be no statute the president as aware that\nThe commentators on TV even some conservatives they pretend they're not aware of it but we're all aware of it or would have been done already\nThese are the same people in Congress to refuse to build physical barriers on our southern border to protect this country and to enforce our immigration laws suddenly they're going to pass a statute\nOutlawing birthright citizenship but why passed a statute if in fact as the left says and some of these conservatives say 'cause they're no nothing's that birthright citizenship is in the fourteenth amendment which is what Paul Ryan said preposterous\n\nIf that's the case then house a statue going to fix a statue won't fix it because they're saying you have to amend the constitution ones last\nTime we actually amend the constitution the old fashioned way or want it to the old fashioned way that a long time why because the left changes the constitution all the time and now when we want to address something that they did outside the constitution now we're told we have to pass a constitutional amendment helps her\n\nAs we discuss the other day as I discuss this Daniel Horowitz from conservative do discuss with me\nBirthright citizenship was not actually implemented in this country until the sixties and seventies the Nineteen sixties and early Nineteen seventies by the bureaucracy by the bureaucracy\n\nThat wasn't in the constitution no court ordered it and those statute was passed so why do we have to amend the constitution but pastor statute while while the better chance in front of the Supreme Court if that's the case we have no chance in front of the Supreme Court\n\nAnd as much as this battle over Kavanaugh was so crucial he's not Clarence Thomas he's not Antonin Scalia and
