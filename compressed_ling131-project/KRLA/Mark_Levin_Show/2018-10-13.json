so we weren't happy squirts anyway this is a time when we talk about estate planning and so we're going to talk about this week the dynasty trust and I think the dynasty trust is one of the most powerful\nEstate planning documents there is I really do and so we can talk about that but before we do it ... can you play it\nI Know I\n\nWould say you\nKnow my ... am\n\nI ...\nAnd of course it is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite we don't want that to happen to you so therefore\nEvery week at this time we have our state tip of the week now this we were going to talk about the dynasty trust which is a kind of trust that will hold the inheritance that you lead to the aforementioned greedy and washed undeserving airs for up to a hundred years\nAnd not only that it'll protected from lawsuits divorce and estate taxes during that entire time so wow Mr Spock it is also very logical thing to do I think\nSo let me describe to you the way it works a dynasty dressed basically\nIs in its own separate entity okay so it has its own tax id you have to create it\nAnd you can create a junior lifetime while you're living or it can be tested ... which means that it is in your will soap on your debt they read the will and it says create the trust so it can be done that way as well now the dynasty trust is what you put money into okay now once it's in the trust\nNow what happens is it can stay in that trust as I said for up to a hundred years and during that time it'll be protected from lawsuits and and divorce and estate taxes why well because for example let's say that the you know your your daughter gets a divorce [noise]\nWell your ex son in law is not divorcing to trust he's divorcing your daughter\nAnd so therefore the trust the money that's in the trust inheritance that you left behind is not available to the former son in law or because\nThere's no no no liability they're also in a lawsuit if your child goes bankrupt same thing they're suing your child they're not so into trust therefore the trust his immune from that and then also you have a state taxes estate taxes in the in the dynasty trust a ... it's called the generation skipping tax trust because it skips generations\nIt comes to taxes so it's a very powerful document in that regard now while they're living they have access to the money has trustees your children or whoever you've named as the beneficiaries can receive that money from there and it and therefore they can choose the investments that they want to use and they have access to the money for what's called health\nMaintenance and support him H. E. N. S. and you know hands is basically covers I mean what what does that not cover health education maintenance was sport is pretty much everything right\nSo it is a very powerful document I think it's one that uh anyone who has let's say over a million dollars in in ... they want to leave behind\nDo they're greedy and washed undeserving air should be thinking about but even if you have less than that it might be of interest if they're real estate or something like that so talk to you or a financial people talk to your attorneys before you do any of this stuff but I think it's something for you to consider\n\nWell Dorothy I've got something else that's two wonderful to be true and that is that if anyone listening to the show right now would like to talk to one of\nOur financial advisors

and you're going to get hurt because nobody knows where this market is going and reasons for going up and down change daily the market is what it is and there's no certainty now today I Want to talk about certainty\n[noise] there's a lot of stuff going on a lot of misinformation that a lot of social information are kind of weird things that are said about things called annuities [noise] annuities [noise]\nOne is Ken Fisher can re money matters and Rick I don't want to have in common they wouldn't sell you a minute he was the last thing on the planet\nThey never never never do that never they've set it never and there was a long time I found in the financial business if you stay never really restricting yourself to ever ever doing something might be right for the client [noise]\nSee I don't know why you wouldn't have an annuity as part of the portfolio see\nIf you don't want to guarantee your friends or your growth then don't get into the new to it 'cause that's what ... do\nCan Fisher was a full page ad every once in awhile desert expensive and he sits there and tells you that they have all kinds of fees and the bad stuff and they have small print and da da da da\nDa da ... running with the so called advisors we have the split screen\nAnd the one advisors city when the client on his side and the other advisor the bad guy on the other side that sits there and tells you that you know we have no hidden fees and ah [noise] no no secrets and we're really good guys and our guys get compensated better when you do better\nFolks they get compensated the same one and a half percent fee I don't care if they do better or worse or whatever and they get paid the same\nNow you got to believe this or not right if somebody tells you they're complaining about annuities having fees and they charge fees also\nIt's a bit of hypocrisy there isn't there\nA what they don't want you to know is that they really can't guarantee anything we're annuities can\nSee a new these can guarantee your principal and when they do or and they can guarantee their earnings so when you have this market fluctuations like we had on the tenth of October [noise] you don't care just goes on and on on or you can just you know continue to let these people tell you that the duties or a bad idea [noise]\nSee ... you want to understand that people that sell stuff with fees and management that have no certainly of outcome wants you to think or they want to pretend to make you think that you're being protected while you're still in the market\nI've heard this over and over people are protected but you're in the market how are you protected how protected do you feel on the tenth when the market went down the ... the ... over eight hundred and thirty points protected you feel the next day\nI don't know doesn't do to protect the soda nudey didn't have any problem don't care they want and have dinner that night and feel better now Mr Edelman um he thinks the best thing you should take the emotion out of it\nI've never heard that one before there was you go to a seminar to find out emotions can get in your way\nBut when the market goes down eight hundred and some points one day and they're charging you two percent to guess for you you get really emotional at that point don't ship that day you get an emotion they'll question so I don't know how you control the emotions there because it's all kind of bad that sinking feeling\nNow you're told the new these tie up your money I heard a little one of many commercials that say something to kind of ... kind of taken out of ... out of the actual thing but it it's kind of the general idea is you know you buy an annuity and the guarantees in income bulky where there is guaranteed income for how long for the rest of your life\nLessons on all bad [noise] but if you end up with some kind of need some emergency so you fall down playing basketball and you'll whack out your knee and the guy go the emergency room and you need three thousand dollars to fiction aid he can't go back in and get that money out of your nudity 'cause it's quote tied up [noise]\nThat's not true folks either these people are amateurs that haven't got a clue what they're talking about or their worst they know that they want you to go a different direction the new things don't have to tie up money don't need to do that [noise]\nYou just have to know which ones not to get involved in to that's the problem\nThat what's the real truth about annuities see that's that's the important part is is it really for you or is it is anything absolutely for everybody but what do annuities do sit no other investment does see they have some special places for some of us\nNow for example some of them have multiple guarantees\nThe fixed annuities guarantee a return for clients investments for conservative minded investors right doesn't get any better than that since the principal investment in the interest rates are guaranteed so clients are secure using a new to generate income now\nOr in the future\nAdditionally clients can choose from immediate or deferred annuities depending on how quickly you seek the income\nSo you control when to take the money out\nAnd you don't have to worry about the value of vacillating just boring doesn't nice conservative boring it's better than a bond auction folks bonds have been a loser this year they've had friends of razor is three times bonds of lost money annuities haven't lost money\nHow 'bout accumulation [noise] see no matter what happens when the market goes up or down six different entities including index and they won't ... below a certain percentage point the interest they can't go below zero\nAnd if they have a fixed interest rate built into it they have to pay it they don't have a choice of not painted the market to know what it's going to do\nSo when you purchasers continues to have earned interest even in uh down near news off for a long term savings plans for future income stream that's what they're for\nNow diversification to fix deferred annuities can provide a whole bunch of different stuff and guarantees taking guaranteed income stream or they can last a lifetime or over a period of years\nBut at the same time you control when the taxes are going to be paid\nIf you don't want to be taking the income from their new to you when you're working it to the mass a hundred percent job where you're getting the full paycheck\nYou want them to supplement your income when your income is dropping [noise] when you're not working as hard anymore when you're on the Social Security only\nSo that's what gives you the path that benefit up there for all you create your own personal pension that you don't have to reporting the earnings until you start taking it and it's there to replace money ... million anymore that's the purpose was it\nAbout control [noise] see the most important part about it I knew what he is you control a predictable income in advance you know what it's going to be\nToo don't have to worry about it because it has a fixed return and then over to the gurney says deferred\nSo we don't have to report any of it 'til you take it that allows you to build more wealth doesn't it and you don't\nHave a the coming out of the thing for our management and you don't have the market taking it away either when the market goes south\nSo those features kind of interesting to write about wealth transfer\nWhat happens when you pass away [noise] see many of us are focused on what happens to our money after we pass away well most of the good Uncle Sam probate or whatever fixed annuities are a great avenue for providing security to level ones in the event of your debt out\nBecause they can help in a state avoid the probate see a new disease or not probate all they don't have a probate tax and they can be passed along over time instead of lump sum so you're avoiding the lump sum tax such as IRAs\nIRAs are all taxable you die that money's left for the kids do they go get it and when they get it insult taxable event with an annuity they stretch it out over time and avoid the taxes on it that's a better way to go\nAbout liquidity see this nonsense that your money's tight up in an annuity\nLet's say three years down the road you're in one of these annuities and you have to cash out for some emergency which is highly unlikely but you have to [noise]\nYou're gonna find that the cost to get out of the that you didn't pay say a surrender charge is less than the Cuban costs you pay to manage your money with a broker this nonsense of being tied up is just that\nThat's total nonsense that's only not true [noise] so you got to get the facts don't we and they can be flexible\nFlexible kind of knew the day when it comes to creating income for the family [noise] when we get back to I'm going to talk about the flexibility than how it can be a viable tool to add\nDon't charge me anything to manage my money don't charge me anything when I give you my money 'cause I already have that but when there's again I'll share on the profit with you\nSo the insurance company is going to share and the profit with you but charge you know fees on your money now which would you rather have\nA broker the charge at one and a half to two percent no matter where you make money or not or the deal is says we're charging nothing protect your principal and we will charge you only a participation portion so if it goes up ten percent and they participate they give you eighty five percent\nPay Kate Fifteen that's kind of the same thing as one in half isn't it\nIs that the better deal and that cost will then protect your principal and protect your previous games and you cannot even as it back I can show over time that that's going to beat the market about Ninety nine percent of the time [noise] and it doesn't have a cap\nAnd now we're also going to talk about what they do best something kind of fancy and different that they've done they have now what's called an income writer or a withdrawal writer this was invented back in two thousand and six to get rid of a new position but it works like a new a desertion\nThis writer has a life of its own it works separately within the policy so you have the regular accumulation value based on a fixed rate or some index that hopefully goes up\nAnd then you have this fixed park this writer that says we're going to guarantee the next ten years that is going to go up at the rate of seven percent compounded\nSo at the end of ten years is going to be worth about eighty seven percent or a hundred thousand dollars would be worth about a hundred and eighty some thousand dollars for we're going to do simple interest to seven percent well it only go up seven thousand a year\nNow at the end of ten years seven percent compounded a hundred grand a hundred and eighty six thousand seven hundred and then we're going to have a factor so when we come back and talk about that factor and how that works now that's\nDifferent than a new position\nBecause the beauty of this little puppy and stuff it started started\nAnd reaching takes accountable out kisses ... and the recon fear started again it gives you flexibility\nBut there are some good parts to it so bad parts so when we come back we'll explain how that little puppy works oh hanging there will be

that's why you need to have a reference to get back to\nThe let's talk about this income writer withdrawal writer and how does it differ from a new position and are there are some good bad and ugly once well let's start with the good\nYou've got to separate caught it doesn't have anything to do with the markets gainer losses it automatically just trucks along at a particular rate of interest that they declare now there are some that pay ten percent simple interest\nAnd there are some that pay six percent or seven percent compounded [noise]\nSo at the end of ten years which uses the term that they were run they'll guarantee that thing for ten years some will give you a renewal rate for another ten years so you don't know quite what it's going to be but they'll declare it and you can run it for another ten years\nThe writers ... set up growth on your principles to create an income from it in case the market doesn't do as well because it's a greater the two so what's used at seven percent compound hundred thousand dollars goes in the ... the Dow hundred Ninety six thousand seven hundred dollars okay can you walk away with that money can you just say okay so many trick nope\nIt's designed to pay you an income using some factor the factors pre set in the contract so if you're sixty five years old and so you're factor is five percent then they will guarantee you an income of five percent of that value for the rest of your life so the lifetime income would be Ninety eight hundred dollars\nNow if you wait 'til age Seventy ... factories going or if you reached eight Seventy same ten years but just started a little bit later than that the other guy you started to sixty they're getting started at fifty five which you take the income at Seventy the factors at five and a half\nSo same gross same amount of money but now you're payout factor is higher so your income now it's ten thousand eight hundred and Eighteen dollars\nOther words it's going to have a progress a lot of it's going to guarantee you a certain amount of return and there is any guessing about what your income will be you know exactly what it will be five years from now ten years from now Fifteen Years so now ... along you could wait\nThat's unique to any other investment on planet earth because you don't have any certainty of income from bearable source of absence so as part of your plan of retirement I Believe that I knew his can be part of it not all or nothing buddy part\nAnd an integral part to create a replacement of income that is a certainty not guessing not ... but maybe but for sure and depending on what the program does far as earnings or the writer which is guaranteed to grow to give you that value to create the income you've got something that's definitely retirement planning\nNow but the ... the problem with the writer is that\nIt has a ... most of them do\nMost of them in charge a fee somewhere between point nine percent to one point three percent now they don't take it off the writer value they take it off your accumulation value just put a different way you have a hundred and Ninety six thousand seven hundred in this writer value after ten years\nYou were other park which is your other pot is now we don't know what it's going to do it can't go down but it's tied door or into the recipe five hundred let's say doesn't grow as fast it's only got a hundred and sixty thousand dollars in it that sure walk away money it's also your death benefit money\nSo it's not the writer because it's not a death benefit it's an income benefit\nAs you charge defeat the fees figured off the value of the income writer plants one percent less Nineteen hundred and sixty seven dollars on a hundred and eighty six thousand it comes off\nBut what if you pass the accused of years now and you need the living in years to retirement years we've had a reduction in income\nWhat if you can take that life insurance policy of half a million dollars\nAnd it's only good for you to die let's look good for you good to the family but you don't die and you get to retire at the kids all grow up to have their own kids and come over and mess with you if we would spoil it for the grandkids and send them home to get even a debt stamina are taking care of your retirements okay\nOr maybe it's not maybe the retirement now squeezing a little bit what if you could take that life insurance policy\nThat half a million dollars and now converted\nInto new witty what\nSee life insurance has for dying annuities for living in retirement what if you can take the life insurance and converted into retiring getting example let's say we had a sixty year old gentleman and he wants to start taking money out can retire early for seven year old doesn't matter I wanted to do that for her central\nAnd we make the payments out an adjusted for inflation during the first ten years now he was killed at withdrawals are quite a bit of money\nNow he's got a death benefit of the contract that's much higher\nIt gets to the tenth ear and says you know kids are grown and gone house mortgages no longer there I'd like to be able to spend the life insurance novel idea isn't it so now the income which I'm a temp fear was almost five thousand dollars a year on the hundred thousand now goes up to eleven thousand three hundred and Ninety seven dollars\nBecause we are now going to convert the life insurance into an in come insurance\nEver heard of that life insurance for protection and that life insurance for retiring\nThat's the new kid on the block folks\nAnd the sophisticated guys out there that haven't got a clue what they're selling doesn't have a clue what they're doing some order to him because that's where the most brokers do they do know how to manage money they're order takers believe me used to be when I started out fifty years ago it didn't know what I was doing I was an order decker then you learn\nAnd then you find out you really can't guess the market because you know what it's going to do you just have to look like you know what you're going to do this kind of the old story when the market has a big dip\nI mean a progressive one over say here Simon drops of twenty thirty points like two thousand eight of you get together in the ... and you're on the west coast that's what they call it by the way when there's like twenty thirty guys in the room that's your stockbroker room and they get together with a strategy\nGame when two thousand eight hit they all got together for a strategy they were there five o'clock in the morning 'cause we're the opens up three hours the sooner done an east coast so he got to be ready for all the phone calls when aunt Mabel causes what happened in my money my okay and you know what they told him tell him don't worry\nEverybody lost somehow that makes you feel better that you just weren't taken out as an individual and beat up financially everybody got beat up so it's okay this is the kind of nonsense that goes on in the investments community folks [noise]\nThis is the game they play to keep you invested and of course the other one has it always comes back to your grandmother's calling gotta life saved in the markets she's eighty five years old don't worry grandma that thirty percent you lost it always comes back\nHow old are your grandma eighty five well you know we might have to be a hundred and ten but he'll always come back to worry about uh just the kind of garbage that's out there are folks\nThis is not the way the games should be played the game should have certain diseases have guarantees there should be that chicken the box or in that checking account or money Ken my savings account every single month there should be that check that's a certainty not well might be there well it might be a little less this month there might be a little more next well we don't know\nI don't want to deal with I don't know if folks I don't need to any more I can direct people to certain piece of outcome where we know what it's going to be an ex point that could be better but we had a guaranteed bottom we have a absolute certainty what it's going to be\nNow with the market cooperates it'll be better if the market doesn't cooperate you don't lose it back\nAnd this is a kind of stuff that's a very it's a drives me crazy I listen to the garbage day after day on the radio and turned them in just to hear what the dumb dumps or say and it is it's uninformed dumb but it's you this uninformed 'cause you don't know what to look for you don't know what to ask for\nAnd you need to know that there's other things to look at that should be looked at carefully you should get a full package laid out that says here's what you can do maybe\nAnd here's what you can do for sure which one do you want to do you want to go for the gusto and maybe lose a pot of money or do you want to go for a reasonable assumption of quality that will probably be competitive about nine out of ten times\nYeah beats the market in many cases that you don't have this ... of what the market there today you know you've got your phone with you in at two o'clock at one o'clock in the market closes on the east\nYou you'll look up to see what the Dow or that has to be did for the day you don't want to live that way\nAnd your stockbroker is not your for your friend folks he's there to keep you fully invest as long as you can cause that's how he makes his living you need somebody that's going to say hey here's what you need to know about what's out there for sure and here's the alternative so you guess both ways\nNow what is an ideal investment for the features you need to look for\nWell you need to grow to be taxed for well that's what I urge to even non Irish should be taxed for so you don't have to report the taxes 'til you actually take is you'd have some kind of minimum guarantee in the plan\nShould be there [noise] how 'bout some potential greed greed potential let's good grades good folks as long as as smart as long as you're not putting all your apples on that table and say okay just roll the dice and I hope we get the light track\nDice and blackjack doesn't work never mind that you'll really made me a black guy right\nBut it can't hit blackjack all the time folks and when you hit the crabs you lose it all or a good part of it you can't recover it you want potential minimum growth and you want your money to be really protected these things get thrown around these words all the time it's not protected\nIt's still in risk if it's insured it's insured if it's guaranteed is guaranteed to use those words when you have guarantees are actually in existence\nYou've got to be aware of what the fees are low fees better results none of these money managers can beat the duck double folks they ended up falling short because the feed the ducks ... cuts into your earnings you've got to control those are and get rid of them there are ways to do that\nNow the risk out much risk you want to take\nAs you get into this retirement years risk should be minimal\nGo into these seminars and be told they know what to do when to do how do you just got a bunch of hot air folks they don't know anything more than anybody else that your money's already in the market and you go to one of these to get the absolute certainty you're just moving from one bunch of hot air to another\nThere are things you can do to prevent the market from eating up your retirement\nYou can actually set up was called the target dated income you can actually say listen I Need this stuff in four or five years you can actually set up a program that says here's what it's going to be for sure\nAs an income now could be more but it can't be less telling me any financial seminar that's managing money and guessing for you they could sit there and tell you that three years and now here's what you're going to get period for sure guarantee they can't use the word guarantee\nI can show you how the guarantee works\nDown inflation once you start this income folks you need more income as things get more expensive to have to have an inflation adjustment in the program\nIf you don't you just to live too long it's not going to buy much as you have to have beneficiary options if its pension money Ira money I've talked about this in previous broadcast [noise] your kids are going to get hammered with anything you leave behind in your Irish or four one K. is because I don't know how to take it out\nIf you have a bullet proof you have it in a program in a full plan that says wait a minute the kids will be able to take it over time and a boy the taxes the lump sum [noise]\nThat's what you don't have with almost all of the mutual funds custodial agreements there do not want to play with your money in bits and pieces to several beneficiary they want to get rid of it do you want to be a glued says we want to manage it for they get the money and don't get hammered that's what you need to be able to do [noise]\nSoon as a little bit of knowledge that goes on with this stuff and unfortunately most of the guys and girls that are out there that are giving you a plan what to do with your money\nThey only know about how these plans were because they don't know of them because they basically kept themselves and one little Kobe all of here's the deal here's the pitch you start with a and go to go to BC DNA and that's how we approach our clients that's not how we do it\nWe have to approach it with what your needs are and where you are trying to accomplish something that will meet your future\nFor sure not maybe let's get out of the ... business folks one eight hundred three three thirty six Ninety and that's where I sit all day long and I

hundred three all three thirty six Ninety\nAnd joined us again next Saturday answering for more of the good bad and ugly truth\nTo help make your retirement goals possible with Greg here on my investment answer\nBut we also had another incident that happened up in Lake Tahoe and I'm going to share with you because I think it shows the point that really dig a lot deeper into this concept of what you don't know can't hurt you or can hurt you\nAnd you know that my goal is to help you any way I can that's the reason I got on the air is to share with you what it is you don't know about the financial world that's what I think about this concept a lot and I had a great illustration\nIn Lake Tahoe that took it to a different level you know I was up in Lake Tahoe for an entire week recently because I graduated law school and all my friends asked me why on earth that I go to law school\nGot a successful financial planning practice I've got a phenomenal family but I just loved the debt\nAnd I'm always getting asked why did I decide to go get my law degree and the answer is it was just a personal goal so I got my law degree and our graduation was held\nUp in Lake Tahoe so I decided to take the family and we rented a cabin for the entire weekend I graduated at the same time so was a blast but one night matter of fact the last night we were there there was probably about ten or ten thirty\nSo dark outside and most of us were outside sitting around the fire roasted marshmallows and my wife had been inside for a few minutes and she came running out what that frantic look on her face\nThat told everybody that something was wrong and somehow she was able to monitor that there was something flying around in our cabin and obviously that's not good\nAnd I was asking her was it a bird was it a bomb what was it and the way she described it unfortunately kinda sounded like a bat so my buddy and I decided to investigate and\nWe went inside the cabin and turn on the lights and grabbed a flashlight so we can see in some of the dark corners and we did a little bit of hunting\nAnd sure enough we found it right at the highest point of twenty foot tall feeling there it was\nAnd sure enough it was a bat and we couldn't reach it there was nothing around there beside I'm not sure that I Want to reach it but I don't want it in the cabin but what do I do\nAnd so we Googled the fact that if there was a bat in your home what you want to do is you want to turn off all the lights and then shine a light by the door from outside the door so that the bat will wind up heading towards the light and flying right out so we thought that sounded great\nAnd sure enough we did that and then we try and the flashlight on the back from outside the door and we waited and I tried to move the flashlight around and shake it a little bit trying to get the attention and we waited\nSome more and nothing happened okay that didn't work so my buddy went inside the house and grab the towel and through a towel up at the ... hoping that maybe that would fly down and head towards the light\nAn exit the premises but no that didn't work\nAnd I don't know anything about that so I'm just kind of doing what Google told me holding a flashlight by the door hoping you apply doubt but what they do is it caused about to go flying around a little bit and the land in a place that was much lower that we can now easily reach\nBut we had to go up the staircase and kind of reach over to then get the bad and the same Google article told us that we could just use gloves or have a towel and kind of come up behind the badge just grab to that and then just carry it outside and I don't know about you but\nWe're talking about a bad I mean I've seen pictures of ads on TV and you think of count Dracula right but this is not fun at ten thirty at night with all the lights off in the cabin but here we are within range of the bat and my buddy and I are downstairs with a towel and he starts ahead that direction\nTo go get the bat and I said no no mark I'll do it because\nIt was my cabin after all it wasn't his responsibility he was just visiting you shouldn't have to do it so it gives me that's how he holds a flashlight I head up towards the bat and I got about three feet or so from the bat with Palin hand ready to mother the bat\nAnd I got to a point where I realized I don't know what's going to happen and there I was face to face with about three feet away\nAnd decided this may not be the smartest thing\nAnd you know what this is in our cabin they've got rangers I can make a call and have someone come over here and do this because I don't know\nWhat a batch response is going to be to being covered up with a towel and I'm pretty embarrassed about my next move but my next move was to turn around and say I'm not doing it let's call maintenance have them come and do it do which my buddy said here give me the towel\nAnd unfortunately I did and he went up and grabbed it\nAnd brought it outside and released it\nSo it can live happily ever after\nAnd here I Am bowing down to my buddy\nIn the shame of humiliation saying thank you um are forgetting about because I was too afraid to go get the bat and my buddy how to do for me so what does all this has to do with the world the finances here's what it has to do with the world of finance is\nIt has to do with the fact that I did not know what I could not have known and what I mean is that when we talk about what you don't know can hurt you\nWere talking about what you don't know that you should know\nCan hurt you were not really talking about what you don't know that you are not able to know\nSo for instance as I was headed up toward that bad I was not able to know what the bats response was going to be what's the ... gonna fly off of the mantle and jump on my neck and suck the blood out of my neck\nOf course apps division I had when I turned around and ran away back down the stairs but I could not possibly have known\nWhat the bats response was going to be\nAnd there are certainly different levels of risks in life that when you take 'em you don't know what the outcome is going to be anyone that's ever started a business is going to tell you that they take a chance they take a risk you don't know what the outcome is going to be because you can't know what the outcome is going to be sure you can\nTake calculated risk send you can crunch all the numbers\nAnd you could do all the research and investigation possible to get to the point where it's not blind to risk but there's always going to be risk and there's always going to be things that you can't know as you're getting into it\nAnd then of course there are things that you don't know that you can know like\nRequired minimum distribution the government says that when you reached Seventy and a half years old you have to take out a required minimum distribution and if you don't know that then there's going to be a fifty percent penalty and this is an example of something you can know\nBut because of lack of knowledge simply don't know and that's a different kind of not knowing than the kind of not knowing that you can't know because you don't know what a response is going to be to a certain set of stimuli and I think that's important to understand that there's different kinds\nOf not knowing and yet does that mean that if there was something that you can not know that you're off the hook no it doesn't mean that at all\nYou're still on the hook it just means that you off the land for the worst so what do you do if there's something that you don't know that you can't possibly know but that could affect\nYour entire retirement can determine whether or\nNot it successful or a failure [noise] what do you do I mean that's a nice car and you're listening to the Providence finance for retirement show don't turn that dial we'll be right back and\nThanks for listening to our show today in retirement you

they're still get a chance they're going to slap you what that fifty percent penalty because you didn't know so we all know that what you do know can hurt you\nAnd yet you also need to know what is

[noise]\nMany people woke up this week with the news that there may be some risk in the stock and bond markets for their investments [noise]\nBut if you're like many people you think to yourself don't worry I'll do nothing markets will come back\nEarnings are good unemployment slow wants to worry about I can wait this out I've been doing great\nSo this is just no big deal just a blip in the road what's going on in the markets this week\nWill come to your money talks I'm Jerry Lewis which I'd been managing money for people professionally just like you for over Thirty years\nI was an investment professional before the crash of Nineteen eighty seven I saw that southern mini crash in Nineteen Ninety before the Gulf War one eye witness the decline in Nineteen Ninety four when Orange County declared bankruptcy all I'd be like well who's Orange County\nBut so to Mexico so to Russia or there was a major problems back then the aging contagion back in Nineteen Ninety seven the dot com bubble burst of two thousand the aftermath of nine eleven and two thousand one I was a professional advisor during the housing debacle\nThe lesson from two thousand seven to two thousand nine and he now here we are again ten years later\nI understand that it best when he said doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results is the very definition of insanity I'm here today to talk about keeping your sanity [noise] so we're going to cover\nHow to handle your investment concerns in a fragile market and yes folks today it is a fragile market\nWas going to cover something else this week but with the what we saw this week in the markets and really started a few weeks ago and I've been talking about this the last several weeks to be quite honest with you [noise]\nThings have an air of change in the markets it's really important to pay attention\nWe've seen interest rates move higher on the ten year in thirty year treasuries than we've seen in the last seven years so highest it's been as a matter of fact we're at the same levels we were back at the beginning of two thousand and eight\nBucks for the big market decline of two thousand eight we're at the same levels now that should raise some attention because people go what do I care about interest rates interest rates another term for interest rates is the cost of money what does it cost you to borrow money\n[laughter] I have some friends in the that are in the real estate industry and in the mortgage industry and some clients that are that way as well and the thing is is that ... what you need to understand is that\nPeople are backing away for buying houses because the cost of borrowing the interest rates have gone up so much that people are waiting the cost of housing has gone up so much that people are waiting on buying houses they think it's too expensive and the their borrowing costs the interest rate is too high\nWell folks everyone borrows money we are major creditors but we're talking about investments in the stock market and the bond market if you think individuals are big creditors way do you look at corporate America\nCorporations borrow tons of money to do most everything from payroll to investments to buying other companies to buying equipment most of that stuff is bought on credit\nSo the cost of their money means less money is available to buy equipment and manufacturing goods are buying companies or or even a raw materials are paying employees 'cause their costs are going up\nFolks what happened this week changed my whole plan for this weekend's radio show\nYou need to be concerned about the risk in your retirement plan the risk to your portfolio the risks in your investments\nBecause these risks just got much much greater\nThe warning sign went off people say you know why don't they ring the bell when it's time to buy or when it's time to sell ding ding ding ding ding that's the bell ladies and gentleman\nThere was a bell ringing right now that the risks are heightened now that's not to say that the market you can't go up a little bit here and we've back and forth back in January if you've been listening to my radio program and I'm On the air for like Seventeen years\nBack in January when we had the big decline from January and February I said don't worry folks were going to re tests the old highs and we'll probably go higher and we did\nAnd we did\nThis time and saying something different [laughter]\nHave a right a lot when it comes to this thing but being wrong you don't want to be wrong and lose money you want to be wrong and lose opportunity\nThat's the key right now the old adage to buy lowered so high and I'm telling you to go and sell I'm telling you that it's time to get a second opinion on your investments and your portfolio\nAnd getting someone to take a serious look of how you can control what you already have because it's far easier to keep what you already have them what you might have lost two bad investment\nShows two people come to see me and a lot of folks set appointments with me every single day from this radio program and when they see me I show them my brochure of today and I show my brochure\nFrom almost Thirty years ago when I was at Smith Barney and I should share some lemon ... whatever we were called at the time and I showed them it says the same thing\nWe put a safety net on every single investment in your portfolio and the belief that it's far easier to keep what you already have the make up what you might have lost to a bad investment as not to the investments are bad sometimes it's that the market environment becomes bad\nWhich causes you to lose money Warren Buffett the oracle of Omaha said rule number one is don't take big losses rule number two is to see rule number one\nJust market has changed why because of interest rates you think that that's not directly rated the stock market it does relate to everything to do with the economy [noise]\nInterest rates
