right because it's published by a Latin books and it's called our police and as I told you um well I'll tell you what he wrote\nHe wrote this book was created for young people with the hope that it will help them look upon the police as friends guardians of protectors who work hard and tirelessly to keep our world safe\nAnd secure and as with all his books he asked me to write a little preference to them [noise]\nAnd um [noise] here's what it says\nGrowing up as a young child and the teenager on the streets of Philadelphia in the twenties and thirties [noise]\nMy father Jack into fun appreciation for the role of the police my parents taught us from a young age to respect the police and they're difficult job in fact two of my uncles served in the Philadelphia police department uncle willy was a motorcycle officer an uncle Jack was a traffic officer\nMy father is a deeply patriotic man with a great deal of common sense he understands that in all walks of life and in every profession man's imperfections present themselves but having witnessed recent events in related news reports painting police officers and police departments and extremely negative light\nHe felt a

then we'll get an all the rest of it\n[noise]\nPaul Ryan said something today that I thought it was quite interesting being the constitutional scholar that he is and here's what he said about birthright citizenship and the president by the way the president didn't bring it up I heard one of the miscreants on on cable say the president brings this stuff up to divide than they first of all he was asked about it he didn't bring it up\nSecondly it's not about dividing the nation it's about upholding the constitution okay nobody really knows how birthright citizenship was instituted we've investigated this\nIt started in the sixties bureaucratic like the old I started doing triggered it that way as the bureaucracy does this all the time there's been no law passed that conveys birthright citizenship on to illegal aliens\nThere's been no Supreme Court decision that definitively confirmed birthright citizenship onto illegal alien children\nNobody's a hundred percent certain how this came to me\n\nBut everybody seems to be a hundred percent certain that the president can't fix it so the executive branch unilaterally somehow somewhere in the bureaucracy decided to interpret this as it's being interpreted today nobody knows exactly who exactly what office but there it is\nAnd so the president is asked about it and says how did you find out about this yeah we're working on an executive\nNo you can't change the constitution by executive order what does the constitution confer birthright citizenship on the children of illegal aliens\nCourse it doesn't\nWhich all explaining a minute\nBut here's the current speaker of the house Paul Ryan who is silent for months but now he feels compelled to speak out go ahead\nYou obviously cannot do that um you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't like it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously it's conservative so um\nYou know we believe in and and the constitution [noise] you know the conservative I'm a believer and following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment pretty clear [noise] um and that would involve a very very laying the constitutional process\nThe ignorance on this subject like so many others is unbelievable the speaker of the house who cares not one ... about the history of the fourteenth amendment not one with\nThe so called experts constitutional experts professors former trial judges ...

anti Semitism in the United states since Trump was elected\nAnd wonder if they do they looked at twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen and then twenty sixteen\nAnd increase\nSix hundred and eighty four cases\nWhy did they start\nIn twenty Thirteen how about you start and twenty twelve one block Obama was president\nEight hundred and sixty eight cases or how 'bout twenty eleven seven hundred and Seventy one case it or how 'bout twenty ten eight hundred and eighty seven cases how about two thousand nine nine hundred and thirty one case is or how about two thousand eight when Obama was elected one thousand is Thirteen cases\nThe highest number since two thousand two\nAs a matter of fact\nIn almost every year the Obama presidency\nHate crimes against Jews was higher\nThan in twenty sixty\nNot in every year but almost every year hate crimes against Jews did CNN or MSNBC point that out did they say that the language that Obama uses one trashing the prime minister of Israel what trashing the state of Israel\n\nThe language that Obama and Hillary Clinton and John Kerry use resulted in the rise of anti Semitism intimate course not why not\nAnd for CNN and MSNBC to keep talking about the tone out there that may have led to this this Jew hater Trump hater who sought to those eleven Jews how do we know you didn't cause it\nHow do we know it wasn't Jake Tapper report that Jake Tapper did that push this guy over the edge or ...\nOr ...\nOr ...\nHow do we know how do we know it wasn't any of the hosts on MSNBC\nHow do we know it wasn't the New York times or the

wasn't there\nAnd the tone\nNow ladies and gentleman to the consternation of some but not you my loyal audience\nYou know I'm a fierce defender of this country I'm if there's defender of our principles are constitutional declaration individual liberty I may fierce defender of this nation because we are a virtuous people virtuous country\n\nNo country is perfect\nBut you don't see Americans pouring into central and South America to escape America you see people in central South America pouring into the United states to escape their countries and there are cultures\nPall over the world you see the same thing\nPeople in Southeast Asia the middle East Africa pouring into the United states not Americans pouring into those places we're supposed to pretend that culturally and every other way we're on an equal ground with them while we're not\nThis is the shining city on a hill is Reagan put it and we all know it\nBut there's a middle America if you will\nIn many respects Israel\n\nWhich reflects the values of the United states the principles of the United states\n\nThat belief in individual humanity and liberty and a democratic system in a rule of law\nAnd I've been a defender\nOf the state of Israel and the people of Israel\nEven when the media CNN and MSNBC and all over that the media\nThis tiny little country every time this tiny little countries attack by
