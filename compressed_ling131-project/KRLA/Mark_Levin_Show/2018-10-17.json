{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KRLA", "content": "Spot for after all the press and has done this guy's gotta go Saudi Arabia the lifting there are a lot of good people you can choose but NBS his painted your country and painted himself\nKind of like Lindsey Graham did his version of coming out isn't it\nEver since the ... there's been a whole new lazy Graham and he's\nHe's out these loving every minute of it I mean this isn't just for him major sanctioned the hell out of the old ... and Lindsey Graham\nAnyway a in this particular case that's what makes me nervous that is what makes me not just the the idea just say Janelle out um okay well what happens for example of Saudi Arabia is is you know what\nI Know we're kind of been with you on Israel and against Iran but uh you know when we aren't feeling quite as as cordial as we had previously\nWhat happens then\nWhat happens if they say you know what we're just gonna\nGo ahead and turn off the speaker to do back and do what happens to oil prices and see if we can do something to write the economy a little bit therefore you know Presidents Day\nAnd things that that could happen any number of different implication so I think it's easy for Lindsey Graham who's out there and loving enjoying this newfound freedom\nMaybe being the person you always wanted to be that he finally feels that at the speed is kinda fascinating if you think about it and I digress here you have Lindsey Graham is like oh no I came out I maybe said things that have always meant to be sane\nAnd people\nYou know you're talking about the Trump effect I mean it would take a look at it and the Republican Party Mitch McConnell got an incredible reception in Kentucky the other night I mean what does that ever happened [laughter] I mean it's an interesting day these people\nClearly enjoying this this newfound freedom of the Trump effect that has come over them but it's complicated it's complicated so I don't know but\nLet's just go sanctioned the hell out of all that's the best answer and I'm not sure that we're necessarily going to find our our friend who uh is seriously where exactly Jamal the soggy let's go to Aaron in Kansas airing do\nOh just a quick question if the king size any knowledge of it or not it was a body it's obviously it's not a consulate anymore give us a body that four guys in a hole somewhere still being tortured\nIt's an interesting thought a if you were going to be really I I don't know a ... if you're going to engage in a war game I I suppose you could end up putting up any number of Syria is scenarios that at least of which would be well maybe when you how the Saudi officials leave\nThe consulate bailouts with them\nYou know if your if there are any number of things that can happen I'm not sure that it would make sense for him to remain there and be tortured because well you have many more potential witnesses add a lot more difficult situation for even turkey to account for that point so\nFunny and she had to pay me a lot of legal fees and as they are going to hold on to animals from Texas who I Love just based on Texas or with a legal things are nicer plants in the fall and your whole band or you use a court room and disappointed if I say we don't pay a lot\nThat was a the president was first Reagan from Fox Business or just a few hours ago\nThough it's entertaining for sure and there are so many\nDifferent directions I Want to go by the way I Need to trick pony when it comes to references I'm really proud of myself it by a branch away from ... python or Seinfeld and the only thing I've had on my mind\nWith what the president has been up to I and I had to go back to ... because there was a magazine it was that the one the Seinfeld episode where I think it was actually Kathy Griffin who ironically enough ah Jerry was talking about said that she does stink and she should quit\nBut I don't want it to be because to me it should be the traditional route years of rejection and failure until she spit out at the bottom of the porn industry\nCan help but feel like that's what's happening\nRight here in the case of stormy you know she started out in the porn industry\nBut he knew of the interesting characterizations of her right\nYou know she'll she'll go from about a certain level of decorum you know she used a film star other time she'd say a porn actress or whatever it's uh it's interesting but nevertheless by the way\nI Am your a sound for the friend Bryan mutt doing morning show\nOn WGN in West Palm Beach a mid morning show after that W. I. O. D. in Miami\nAnd every now and then I think the ... the folks at Fox News or run out of radio people to put on TV and they put me on so you may have guessed contributor to boxing is one of the things here and there's always an honor and pleasure to be able to fill in for the great one more call then\nAnd a whole week al or this happened as well related to the whole story Daniels ... thing earlier today the president's out about four hours or so ago\nTweeted out setting Fox News federal judge throws out Stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump\nTrump is entitled to fully legal fees\nAnd a common off of that a President Trump said great Maliki go after horse face and her third rate a lawyer and the great state of Texas she will confirmed the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a toll con\nOr there you go good old horse face oh boy [laughter]\nSo that happened and then it got us thinking of some of the non physical things that are happening now there you got the Taylor Swift effect remember a couple of Sundays ago where the earth moved because Taylor Swift Taylor Swift\nShe did it after ... years after years of the entertainment industry and the folks and the left they finally got her to do it\nThat was going to move literally one of the mountains I think in the eastern Tennessee\nThey Taylor Swift effect as she weighed in with her tendency values which the first thing that I was that Taylor Swift is to Tennessee what a lizard with Warren is the Cherokee and did not want to talk oh\nWay small details I'll get there I ... I couldn't help by itself but to put together some information on Taylor Swift and on the race that she endorsed and her clear lack of understanding of any of it when I ended up reading this was a headline I Believe it was on Sunday on CNBC\nOut Taylor Swift political adores men could become the biggest red\nAt the polls pig has ripple ever as the polls [laughter] I mean that OK okay maybe just maybe not how you thought here's an actor\nLast way pop star Taylor Swift made waves by breaking her stance of political neutrality and backing democratic congressional candidates in our home state of Tennessee\nBe effective sweat surprise endorsement which was made the on Instagram post were felt right away as thousands of people between the ages of Eighteen and twenty nine registered to vote according to vote dot org\n[noise] okay now I'm\nGonna get straight to the point about the Taylor Swift the fact that some of the media recently it was a couple of days ago we're still my gosh it's happening I think it's quite a down a little bit over the past year or so because I think more of them are like being pointed to the polls and going hey\nAre you so he was up in Tennessee or the um Taylor's specific endorsement of the Democrat so Britain sending in tendencies US Senate race you see at the time of the endorsement Marsha Blackburn the Republican challenger in this race\nShe was average in a three point lead and the three most recent polls in Tennessee alright Blackburn three point lead in the three most recent polls prior to the Taylor Swift effect\nWhere she today and the three most recent polls in that particular race certainly it is now nine points\nSo oh\nNot exactly what you probably thought would happen here so the Taylor Swift effect in the immediate aftermath of the race that she finally weighed\nIn on is negative six percent in a week so I like to say you got two sides histories than one side the facts but here's the deal you got a lot of folks are if you play the millionaire the concept that for every action got the equal and opposite reaction or science guy on earlier in the show\n\nHere's the thing that I'm In in the south in particular\nYou have a lot of folks that will end up getting energized about the moment you got celebrities that are weighing in and specifically when she ended up outing herself\nPretty much immediately or her lack of understanding of pretty much everything including the person she was endorsing\nSeat if you're in Tennessee and you're following politics you might have noticed that she was a bit of an obvious hypocrites for a few reasons among others now she said that Marsha Blackburn doesn't represent her tendency values\nBut you see here is that the the dirty little detail Taylor isn't actually from Tennessee she's from Pennsylvania\nPennsylvania and she happened only moved\nTo Tennessee to pursue her music career in high school oh by the way she's lived there less than half her life no hands the you know Taylor Swift as to Tennessee values as say a Elizabeth Warren is too too Cherokee Indians you know the the person sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren better known as the bad Pocahontas\nSmelling now she spoke up supporting L G being she writes\nGB T rights as part of her Tennessee values by the way\n[noise] I guess what the Democrats the she endorsed bill Bratton says he doesn't support gay marriage and a bunch of other issues he's on the right to hurt as much [laughter] so it's clear that she's never even looked into what he believes in no go\n[laughter] and then you got the optics you see for maybe you could activate some of those young bumps and in Nashville better yeah\nBut here's the thing anybody noticed that he got Taylor Swift endorsing an old white guy who\nDoes not support gay marriage and host of other old G Beatty rights that Taylor says are part of her tendency values from Pennsylvania so she's endorsing in the old white guy bat evil these days and leftist politics right over a younger woman\nHa ha interesting\nI mean and there's a lot more we we can continue down that rabbit hole but it's not necessary but you see those instead of the they pretty much get the point to and he along a lot\nIn terms of tendency values I'm from suburban Georgia lifted Knoxville for a time when I was small and I'm pretty familiar with tendency values and they take a look at these celebrity in in Hollywood endorsements and ah well\nNot often impressed so it probably is going to continue to have the opposite of the effect that they weren't dissipating I mean come on\nAll these celebrity endorsements work right Katy Perry holding up Hillary Clinton's arm by the way it wasn't an awkward moment I mean I did the trick is does\nAnd so here's the funny thing if you're taking a look at when celebrity endorsements actually matter well she kinda Mr moment you see if she actually wanted somebody with her Pennsylvania\nTendency L G Beatty writes values\nShe couldn't actually weighed in in the primary because Columbia University actually did prove that some Democrats are impressed by celebrities for example Columbia University they did show pretty empirically that in the two thousand eight democratic presidential primary\nThat's why Matt Damon apparently took on that role you through SNL are going to stop this here is a an extra it's

this but they say extremely boring movie work ever made couldn't wait to watch the first ten minutes so\nThis is the way in which it intellectually and the ... immature people\nWere on when their world view was overturned\nI look I I think there's a great deal to what you're saying because I recently Michael Moore came out with his new movie Fahrenheit eleven nine\nUh and uh this is a movie about supposedly about Donald Trump and how he's ruining America is the end of the world and the movie had tremendous hype it had very good reviews though not so much for me and a and it proceeded to bomb nice he's actually going to end up reaching a fraction of the people you reach with death of America\nWell the thing to realize is that Michael Moore was\nTraveling with the ... or will it back in Studio give him the money to make the movies he's on every talk show he gets old ... pretty whereas I ... I mean if if my movie with ... mentioned on ABC NBC Phoebe out\nA little worried about it from CNN or MSNBC and yard at our coverage at all but the left is sort of\nThey they go out of their way or the film and yet despite all that and Michael Moore by the way open with theater for the ... theaters and we did about the same at the opening weekend up and it will be ... like a stone throw it\nHad years of guy and that makes the heart of\nIt is that look I'm not making the point you're on the ideological acts like Michael Moore first of all the aid or with a clever little ... case there are adequate yet quite at that point\nYeah well the point about this new film I I Know you haven't seen it I have Michael Moore's movie didn't ashes movie death of a nation or you can stream right now at death of a nation movie dot com\nBut the other point about Moore's movie it begins almost identically to your movie except your movie covers the materials so much better it so much more ...\nAnd it's actually very funny the way you do it what you do at the beginning of the film is you go back to election night and you show the change from the beginning of election night where the anchors the beginning they were all happy and excited they are about to welcome the first female president and Hillary of course is going to win\nAnd then you show the increasing desperation and heartbreak as it becomes clear that the result wasn't what people expected\nMichael Moore does the same thing but he doesn't play it for laughs he plays it oh my goodness this is the beginning of a nightmare and a tragedy and it's not ... I'm ... in terms\nOf my response to the film the one segment of the film that I think is most unforgettable\nIs your amazing ah interview with Richard Spencer a leading a leader of what people call

make America great again hats so clearly a white supremacy now is Dr right\nOkay but people are going to see this for themselves because what they find from Richard Spencer is that no he's a left us

that Clinton news network last several hours and I'm suffering from projectile vomiting and then explosive diarrhea and I believe from eyeballs thinking what the hell am I watching here\nThey're dead Jared Kushner and the president himself\nDecapitated and kill them all cause show geek that somehow didn't we didn't the American people have something to do with the apparent murder\nOf a journalist who's a Saudi Arabian citizen who finds himself in a in Turkey\nAnd they're constantly and somehow I think objective evidence to show that he was brutally murdered and that somehow America is necessarily involved somehow we did it that were responsible how's that possible for my way of thinking\nIt's not good and when someone gets killed it wasn't good when Kate Steinle he was killed\n[noise] it's not a good thing when hundreds of Americans are killed every year\nThrough the actions of illegal aliens inside of America is not good\nWhen six or seven hundred Chicago's Southside residents are murdered every year or six or seven hundred murdered and maybe four thousand shot you know it's really a bad thing when a half a million Syrians are barrel bombed by a by Assad\nWho was called by Hillary Clinton at one point a patriot\nNone of those things are good and I'm not saying what happened to a show is going I'm telling you right now is awful\nThere's a report this afternoon at a turkey\nAnd that uh as the event was going on to quote his fingers were cut off in a gruesome fashion and he was decapitated at the consulate as his fiance waited outside\n[noise] terrible awful let's face it Saudi Arabia is one of the best countries in the middle east one of our best friends but\nIt is an awful place to live especially if you're a woman or it doesn't hit is common in Saudi Arabia for a woman who is wearing certain western I'm tired of being beaten half to death on the streets\nAnd it's quite common if you tweet and Saudi Arabia something negative about the leaders of that great country that you're going to be put in prison for months or years until you're a pen\nAnd it's quite common to uh be hanged by the neck until you're dead or going through a firing squad for ... inside Saudi Arabia and that's still one of the best countries in the middle east compared to Iran compared to Syria ... compared to ... Iraq is one of the best prices debate and\nThere are friends that are not necessarily our enemy but assuming these terrible things happen to good people are ... assuming Jamal could show he wasn't really a great guy and he was brutally murdered ... and his fingers are sold off and he was the capital in Corning and media counts as to what happened to him\nQuote cut off she cooks you could show these fingers and then decapitated a\nTerrible those responsible I imagine we'll be held to account but it happen in a consulate which as you and I know\nIt's Saudi Arabian territory so this it appears the Saudi Arabians\nKilled a Saudi Arabian on Saudi Arabian territory then probably took ... body away in a van or put at NASA or something this is terrible\nIt's awful kind of like when Kate Steinle was gunned down by some illegal alien but for the last week or ten days the media is in overdrive the blame Trump\nOr Jared Kushner or some relationship there saying somehow we did it that were responsible that Trump's somehow with ah with um Mohammed bin Salman so called an M. B. S. than MPs to somehow\nConsulting with Trump to decide what to do ahead of time which is a bunch of crap\nNobody's in favor of this we have a western mine a Judeo Christian ethic\nWe believe and due process at least Republicans do\nSo we believe in fairness\nAnd and so whatever happened to a Saudi Arabian\nButter Saudi Arabian government in a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey is interesting but hell we got ten thousand murders in this country every year not being investigated by CNN or obsessing by the New York times and the Washington Post where he worked as a contributor\nKicked him we let it go a little bit and see what happened and when it comes out\nThat the M. B. S. directly or indirectly heck a show gave murdered in a horrible way because he was a dissident innocent Tyler Perry and offer regime and Saudi Arabia that's what's gonna come out\nI guess Trump's responsible for that to it never stops it never ends I Can't take it anymore it's awful and so can we move on from that the answer of course is no\nThis is the ah the event does your the event this week and next week they keep coming up whether it's Kavanaugh or Julie sweating ache or Deborah Ramirez or a\nBunch of other incidents that have arisen in the past several months the Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump how can we use this event\nHow can we take Christina for how can we use this event that didn't involve Trump at all and some how large this upon him insane or smear him with some news event\nThat Trump is nothing to do with doing nothing zero nada didn't happen as possible but it goes on and on I I tried to watch for hours\nWolf Blitzer and others on CNN it's impossible to watch ... MPs his own speed dial with coach dinner and Trump taking orders assuming he did it what does that mean what might be behind it is is\nThere are many in this country and in the media\nWho thinks the Iranian deal was wonderful for our country and that brought Hussein Obama delivered one point eight billion dollars in cash on governmental pilots to use for terrorism by Ron man that was a great idea we ought to do more of that\nAnd so because Saudi Arabia is the pitch enemy of Iran\nMaybe those in the media wants to get back to the Iranian deal and weaken Saudi Arabia in the middle east\nSo that Iran takes over larger chunks of the middle east Iraq and Syria not being enough maybe that's what's behind it plus as you may know if you've been paying attention Israel and Saudi Arabia have become brothers they become sisters they become friendly with each other because their enemy is Iran\nThere for the enemy of my enemy is my friend so because Israel and Iran are enemies and because Saudi Arabia and Iran are enemies now Israel and Saudi Arabia are working together and lots of areas\nSo there may be parts of America that wants to get rid of that uh that budding friendship between Israel

it occurred\nLet the Saudi Arabians deal with it if the government ordered the killing of someone which by the way America itself has done on a regular basis countries do these kinds of things if Saudi Arabian government decided to murder\nCould show gig and stupidly they decided to pick a consulate in Turkey to do the dash to lead and if that's a violation of some criminal law somewhere to the Turks are the odds you know what I say have at it\nBut according to diplomatic law the consulate Israeli Saudi Arabian territory and so what happened there stays in Saudi Arabia so whatever happens happens it is what it is can we move on absolutely not you see\nThe mid term so now only about what twenty days away twenty days from now the midterms and so things are heading toward\nThe

a pre order now save up to thirty percent you're talking about police and the way they're treated\nWell what if CNN and the national media went into the killing of police officers all over the country by individuals that have not been solved of which there are many not solved and what if they spent the time they're spending all could show ... in a simple\nFinding out who killed police officers when the murders have not been resolved including wandering barge down Kentucky with a police officer who was killed about two o'clock in the morning and they're looking for his murder he was pulling off a highway that night two o'clock in the morning and wife and two kids\nAnd some more than the court day a limb across the exit ramp on interstate highway so a police officer would stop he stopped got out but his lights on poll dilemma way and was shot several times in the back and is that\nAre numerous killings of police officers in America as I speak unresolved and if you think every life is the same which I think in God's eyes it might be Ninety percent of the murders of this outside of Chicago go unsolved\nWhat if CNN instead of caring about the show gave so much found its way to the south side of Chicago to discover why there's about four thousand people shot and seven hundred murdered every year under the leadership but one of the dailies around Emanuel or Brock Hussein Obama and Michelle Obama Jesse Jackson or Louis Farrakhan\nWhat if they would cover murders in Chicago or the murder of ... or the murder of police officers unsolved but the same level of interest that they care about a Saudi citizen murdered seemingly bothers Saudi Government and in a a consulate in Turkey\nWell what is it about this event which suddenly the entire media is in melt down as it possibly trying to tie Trump to the murder\nIs that what we had we had a caller earlier today that al Jazeera now there is a reliable news source says the U.S intelligence agencies knew about the the killing to take place at a time and didn't stop it and got a nice thing to say I hope we didn't know about it\nI Hope that we knew nothing and that or if he was decapitated her put an ad sitter tortured for seven minutes that's off what's bad those responsible should be held to account by Saudi Arabians or by Turks how are we involved why is the media trying to pin this on Jared Kushner\nHow come some murders or credit more equal than others cage dialing the person the illegal alien that killed her got off for basically nothing that CNN cover that story to the extent that hey murder goes by without punishment\nThe Democratic party's been telling us the liberal progressive socialist been telling us for decades give us complete power and you will see a complete a renaissance of the lives of individuals living under our domain\nSo they keep saying every two years every four years give us give us the reins of power give us the president say give us a house the Senate give us the Supreme Court well there are several laboratories of democracy\nThat had been fully engaged for the past not few years but few decades running north about half a century I'm Talking about almost every major city in this country controlled by the Democratic party for as long as the eye can see especially in Chicago this outside of Chicago\nControlled by the dailies by um era Washington narrowed Washington controlled by a rom Emanuel only God Knows who's next\nTime going back to the Nineteen fifties you can't find a Republican with a searchlight in a search warrant that don't exist in fact you if you're a Republican in Chicago your garbage doesn't get picked up your electricity and gets turned off\nAn age we see suddenly stops working just you don't get paid for deliveries you get nothing you're done so everyone in South side of Chicago especially are all Democrats now [noise]\nAlso we elected from their United States president we elected forty four we elected Brock Hussein Obama who spent most of his adult life in Chicago in the south side is quote a community organizer organizing their community on the Southside of Chicago with his wife Michelle\nComing out of there was also Rami manual the chief of staff Arne Duncan secretary of education more they had all these theories 'cause they practice so well in Chicago\nThat if you go to the south side of Chicago we're like a half million people in\nYou cannot think more of a hell hole then the south side of Chicago\nHow much job creation exists in the south side of Chicago right under the leadership\nOf the Democratic party of Harold Washington and ah William Daley Richard Daley Brock Hussein Obama Michelle Obama Arne Duncan Robb Emanuel Jesse Jackson throw in Louis Farrakhan\nThere it is not there is no argument with anyone in Chicago about which political party controls Chicago especially this outside and the south side of Chicago I've been many times there's little or no job creation\nAs little or no education going on the crime is rampant family formation is nonexistent\nCan you smell when I'm cooking\nSo if these series of government control your life and funding bad behavior actually worked you would see Memphis you would see Los Angeles you would see San Francisco you would see Tampa in Cincinnati in Chicago on all the other great city's Philadelphia\nEspecially in the black communities in those areas flourishing\nWater Williams tells the story the great African American columnist from George Mason and he was a grade school and high school kid in Philadelphia\nThat or many of his students many of his classmates went to college they were reading at an above the grade level\nOr his family didn't have keys to the front door people came in and out there were a black lawyers and black doctors and black farmers as a black business leaders black insurance men all over the place functioning black communities\nGenerally control by the Republican Party because the ... the Republican Party was a home of African Americans from the Eighteen sixties through the Nineteen thirties and beyond it\nWas functional and so what if CNN span it's time saying okay we're going to go to an area that's been completely controlled by the Democratic party\nFor a at least a half a half a century\nAnd see how those theories are working out to see if it's occurring to see if crime is nonexistent to see of job creation is happening everywhere to see if the education early the children are exceeding Adam above their their grade level\nTo see a families are being formed to see families wanting to move in you want to move into those communities\nAnd we want to see if there is moving trucks bringing new families in the south side of Chicago entered the burials of Memphis and Tampa and San Francisco and Los Angeles in Amarillo, Texas we want to go to the poorest areas where the Democrats have been in charge the longest to see how successful there are theories have been\nI'm waiting for CNN to do that why haven't they done that\nEverything's Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump what about the lives of average Americans according to the ... according to the department of education\nAbout half the black kids the poor kids who go to an inner city school don't graduate they give it up along the route and they have to do graduate the best academically read on average at the eighth grade level with all the money being spent in Washington DC\nGood chunk don't graduate twenty to thirty percent don't even go to school and he predicted her day the vacancy rates are through the roof and the reason is not race because most poor people in America mathematically or white\nThe reason it happens is a lack of family formation whack a job opportunities rampant crime because of drugs and the Democrats have been one was the last time there is a Republican in charge of Washington DC and the city council of the ... what was the last time there was a Republican who was the mayor of Chicago\nHope when's the last time any of this stuff went on the answer is decades up to a half a century that doesn't happen so these series of Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi or operational and they actually work\nWe would see a completely different result when we must continue now let's go to a Josh in Alexandria Josh and Alexander a welcome to the Martin live in show and Josh please go ahead\n[laughter] Bill thanks for taking my call a ... I wanted to ask one of the ... start to wonder about on other countries' businesses I mean this guy and a quarter or what happened but he's a Saudi Arabian citizen it happen in Saudi Arabia embassy in Turkey and last\nTime I checked they spent a decade saying oh why are we involved in Iraq why it out with all of what all the war crimes or with Iraq and and uh Saddam Hussein\nAnd now they want us to start meddling it just because they think they can kind of Trump to it I mean it's just crazy to my [noise]\nWhat what can we what should be the reaction I guess October the second\nOr ... was killed in a horrible way\nBut in America there are cops killed there's American citizens murder by legal aliens there's horrible domestic violence happening\nAnd that those crimes happening tonight somewhere terrible not solved why does CNN want to use that crime eight thousand miles away as a cudgel against Trump what's the reason\n[noise] I'm In Berkley I think it's because it's a horrible story and be a Trump is winning on all fronts right now and they are desperate to find a way to to bring him down and that's just one little thing they're going to try to throw them but I personally don't think it's going to work\nUm but it's a they're just desperate for anything to try to try to bring him down and tie him up at the center says she goes I\nPut this thing what is there about this thing work has showed ... I guess it wrote some comes the Washington Post who had a green card but it is a Saudi Arabian citizen killed in Turkey I guess on Saudi Arabian territory\nAnd yet and yet what ah it's it's what I mean a show interesting but when a\nWhen re most in lieu were murdered in New York City in cold blood by a black nationalist who came from Baltimore to specifically kill in uniform in their car\nPolice officers in New York City that was like a one day story nationally amended evaporated died because it didn't fit the agenda of the liberal national media can you imagine if some Trump wearing\n... Ga had had hunted down somebody to kill somewhere how big without being story how long without going on\nIn the store for a week and I think you ... for Africa only\nWho do you think are left wondering the fat and quick or a journalist or one of their own or a police officer and I say that all the people who are out of the the like police officers but they're gonna be much quicker to rush to the case of of one of their own and worked for the Washington Post rather than a sort of our of our um police officers [laughter]\nIsn't that a parent I mean why why do we spend I mean I haven't seen it tonight I refuse to watch it\nI imagine the right now it's the biggest story on CNN and MSNBC holidays as about Chris choking choking what to Jared Kushner knew who knew NBS better was a ... or was it\nOr or was that Trump did sod spend money and wanted Trump properties at some point they keep making these connections you know what I care about is the murder of re most in lieu and what that said\nAbout Brock Hussein Obama meeting in the White House with representatives of black lives matter whoever cater to murder of police officers\nAnd one B. L. M. got what they want and what are we went dead cops when you want them now and re most in lieu were tortured and killed\nThat was a one day story and the media quickly dropped it because of who did it one officer Jason Ellis was murdered in\n... Kentucky ambush killing we don't know who did it\nWhen they march around in Dallas and elsewhere what are we one dead cops wouldn't even want them now we want to kill cops\nPigs in a blanket from like bacon\n... what is it and so when we obsess over the death\nOf Jamal ... at CNN and other news organizations are now doing it's terrible that I guess his fingers cut off he was decapitated he was tortured awful Assad citizen killed in Turkey and the worst way give it to mention needs to do\nBut the only way the media will focus on a murder itself that murder can be used against Donald Trump or Mitt Romney or George Bush or some other Republican tell me how this murder so the murder of Jason Alice in ... Kentucky butchered murder\nOn an exit ramp at two o'clock in the morning leaving his wife Amy and two beautiful kids without a husband without a father there's no political benefit for CNN nothing again they can't use the\nSame way with the the murder of ...
