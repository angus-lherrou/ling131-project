George Moscone and supervisor Harvey Milk\nThrough the eighties and early nineties there was William Kennedy Smith rape trial the Menendez brothers and three Rodney King related trials\nIn Nineteen

okay Dave dino strike little pet\nSince has always tough for a lawyer when you're meeting the press okay and and that's all there is to it when you're up there and you've got this case and then you know the story is going to come out [noise] you know what I'm Linda how terrific it is when\nWhen the producers are told me that they wanted to get you on the show and they did their research [noise] let me tell you\nWhat came back balanced fair\nNon ... uh tells the way it is\nEt cetera all those\nHow about that and this is I'm not kidding you on this I mean we really\nBefore you come on here we had I did a background and we started we talk to people that you're in competition with ah we talk to people that you've covered ah people that have had bad results that you've covered\nAnd quite honestly at the end of the day we didn't find anybody who said one bad thing about you that\nIt's just wonderful and also kind of intimidating that's quite an introduction to live up to but I'm very grateful for it and it's it's worth coming over here for that [noise]\nOkay um you're working like a dog now have um we're always out yeah what are you doing right now\nI Am working on the preparations for the trial of Dr Conrad Murray there will be eliminated hearing the for the trial that's the next thing up this is Michael Jackson's doctor and uh I've covered Michael Jackson when he was alive and now I'm covering him\nAfter um unfortunately and I'm also working on the Roman Polanski case which is very interesting thirty two years later after I covered the original down what they're trying to get him back here uh to be sentenced and it looks like it's going to be a long long battle [noise]\nUh I'm also I've also been working on a story that will be coming out on the um the terrible problems we're having in the court here in California with budgetary crisis and what's going to be done to try to keep the courts open and available to the public\nYou spent more time in courtrooms than a whole bunch of lawyers I Know who pretend to be trial lawyers [noise] do you get a feel\nHow things are going as you sit there\nWell I never tried to predict the outcome of a case no no no\nI'm not talking about what you're right down not talking about deep on your\nShow I mean I don't try myself to predict what's going to happen but come on no don't do this to me I mean I Know I Know when someone has made a point I Know when when OJ Simpson got up in the courtroom and try it on the gloves I knew that that was a major moment in the case [noise]\nUh but as far as determining what a jury is going to do you do as well as I Do that they are unpredictable and that we never know until the last moment when they come in with that verdict what they're really going to do I usually have a hint usually have my own feeling\nOkay did you think ah OJ was going to be found not guilty and the criminal trial yes I did\nUh did you feel he was going to be found guilty in the civil trial [noise]\nI'm not sure I ... I was I made a decision on that one\nWasn't sure I was with um Johnny Cochrane was a dear friend of mine mine too I was with him on Saturday the very came in I think on a Monday\nIf I remember right either Monday or Tuesday we had lunch together on Saturday downtown at the Hilton Hotel than food but it was a place as easy to get those another sponsor and ah I said okay\nPal or do you think he says Tom I'm going to winter now than I've been in this jury trial business a long time Ken while like you sometimes I have a hunch I Would never go that far as to say oh when it [noise]\nBut he definitely felt on that Saturday before that they were going to quit on the criminal from\nWell I can tell you that one of the prosecutor so we'll be unnamed at this point came to me a few days before that and said to me do you think we even have a chance while\nIt brings to mind a previous program that you and I have talked about on on a number of occasions you covered OJ and as we indicated in the introduction you covered both trials [noise] I'd rather have it\nI'm Talking about Santa Monica I'm Talking about\nPasadena [noise] the fact of the matter is that there are certain things that I think the court\nShould protect the privacy and and it should be on a balance [noise] now and\nI also think that there's a whole area that have been protected that shouldn't be protected [noise] a lot of times in these products cases\nYou will go when the case of you settled a case and the automotive manufacturing will say fine will pay this money but it's confidential\nAnd then lo and behold other people get hurt by the same thing mhm we settled a Toyota case of acceleration two and a half years ago how about that [noise]\nIt was confidential quote so we couldn't name the settlement people and all that stuff [noise] and as a lawyer you say to yourself while you know I Wonder if this were public than other people wouldn't have gotten her\nYou know so right now I'm In your corner most of the time but there are times when I definitely not in your corner is I think that certain times of victims can be harmed more than the tragedy itself by the by the press\nSo sometimes the ah the position of the victim is different ah we're now in the Roman Polanski matter in which the victim has come forward has named herself she's her name's been known for a long time she's grown up middle aged woman with children\nAnd she wants the case to be over and she has filed papers over and over again same for now right now should we ignore what she has to say should we feel that she should be protected\nAnd we certainly come on come on gosh darn it would you find one can get one case where the woman huge decay okay yeah I don't watch out for Jews or whatever [noise] you don't do this I'm Talking about the majority\nOf those cases where the intrusion is massively upsetting you know what I mean and and a bunch of stuff that's not our business how about this [noise] um probably a product defect case of hurts somebody that's our business because man I better ... out\nThere I agree with you on that but you know from from what you're saying I've been covering a number of these priest molestation cases\nAnd these are the most painful and horrible cases to cover and if we didn't cover them and if we said well this is too terrible and we shouldn't know about it and nobody should know about it because someone might find out who this is that would be a disservice to the public\nAnd therein lies the tension between the public's right to know and the person's need\nFor privacy you are listening to champions of justice with Tom Gerard Ian royal oaks and our guest today Linda Deutsch Associated Press special correspondent [noise] years ago I worked in news in San Francisco on the radio and it was there for several breaking stories or when they happened and when they came across the a P wire as a matter of fact\nUh one was the Jones town story the other was the damn white story and as a reporter\nYou have a mix of emotions you just incredulous\nYou are absolutely excited and galvanized a you feel the weight on your shoulder of reporting this story correctly folk for you the first big story that you covered was Robert Kennedy being ... what was that like for you\nIt was horrible um it was a unexpected I I was in the ... bureau that night my I was very young I was just starting I was called in the bureau and uh my ship started at midnight hamster them as much as he was yeah and he was killed at twelve o five\nAnd it was very emotional it was you know everybody who came in who had been on the road with him are reporters had been traveling with them they were all coming in and tears I mean he was very much loved but the the priority for everybody wants to get the fact\nFind out who this guy was that had shot him find out where everyone was at that moment\nGet all the details so I mean our reporter Bob Thomas was incredible he was practically on top of Kennedy might have happened if he'd been any closer he would have been shot and they had the presence of mind to get to a phone and call in and that's the main thing you you put everything else aside\nAnd you just go with the story\nI was a kid lawyer\nI was there that night so you know I mean I I was at the ambassador\nAnd I remember them yelling out one of the reporters is not having those are all swelled\nThey were running around and to me is I think of my wife of various moments of my life that have been if you'll never forget I mean that that was definitely one of them we don't know that was an extraordinary [noise] and then to see\nYou know that family what had happened over the years I mean you\nLose your weight and how\nDoes that all of the stories that I've done in the past seemed to be coming back it's like everything old his new again um I mean I've been writing things on I wrote a story last summer on the fortieth anniversary of the Manson killings\nAnd I was up to the prison for the last parole hearing a ... before she died I've been doing Polanski which is one of my old cases\nA Michael Jackson of course just come back with the events after his death [noise] um it seems like the major cases that I've done in the past will never go away they're part of my DNA almost but\nAh but they keep repeating not only does but similar ones right has a sense that young a young person to five years in jail the son of a major Hollywood production yesterday you know I mean\nIt's it's interesting yeah yeah ah and I don't know if the same goes with the problems or we just know about their problems or don't know about the other problems but it it is\nYeah it was very sad that was camera Douglas yeah radio\nAnd then he had spoken openly about anti drugs and so forth his father had yes they're the bad issues and so forth and [noise]\nBut it's a rip your heart out in the one thing is to be involved in something like that in the next thing the thing that's even worse because you see it all over the press\nRight right [noise] but you know I think that um the the public is interested in these things because they think that it could happen to them\nAnd it is instructive particularly a case like that for parents that have young young kids and you know how could someone who is the heir to such a wonderful Hollywood name and you know a fortune\nHow could he get involved in this\nOn the public when your reporting on a ...\nWhat is your thought of me I Am\nI Am thinking that I Am your eyes and ears in the courtroom\nI Am there to give you every detail to try to have ice in the back of my head so I can see what's going on in the courtroom as well as what's going on the witness stand and and in the front of the well the court or I'm\nA I'm there as an observer I'm there as a chronic color of history\nBecause I Am can convince that most of the trials I Do which are very big trials\nFar mirrors of what's going on in society at the time and if you think back on things like the Manson trial which was the trial of the sixties the trial of flower power hippies celebrities and drugs\nUm that was one but there have been so many others that have social implications for all of us\nThe Menendez brothers' case which was really the first we had heard of allegations of a child sexual abuse within families um the Patty Hearst case which was really the the post Vietnam Era in which young people came back\nDisenchanted and did terrible things including kidnapping her um and how she reacted in that case had so many social implications her father was forced to give away food and food give away in the streets it was about the homeless it was about parents child\nDissension it had so many issues that touched every one where they lived\nAnd a reminder that you are listening to champions of justice with your host Tom ... joined today by royal oaks and are very special guests Linda Deutsch Associated Press special correspondent the OJ trial was it good for the public was good for the justice system\n[noise] the O. J. trial I think\nGave the the public a chance to see how the system works or they may not have been happy with it but they saw it up close and personal and as much um criticism as judge land sea though has taken I think that he was interested in letting everyone see\nAnd he also was interested in letting everyone in the trial have their say and that's what he was most criticized for because people didn't like that they also a lot of them didn't like the outcome and so they blamed him\nBut he conducted a fair trial and uh let's see though was a young judge he was a child of the TV era and so he wanted people to see it on television\nThey didn't know how to held a when they didn't know how to find [noise] they didn't know how\nAnd one day it was looking really bad and link you just said you hardly knew his name and they said don't take him he's got a drinking problem [noise]\nAnd I said I don't care what probably as you guys aren't winning [noise]\nOkay was she was that\nAccurately described in the Washington Post where the headline in the Washington Post was President Trump praise the Confederate General Robert Italy\nAnd a headline that political Trump praises Robert ... during Ohio rally\nOr is that fair he continued President Trump and he went in and he went up a lot of everyone [noise]\nAnd you know the story\nThey set diligent you can use your many more he's an alcoholic\nAnd Lincoln said [noise]\nI don't care if he's an alcoholic frankly give me six or seven more just like a [noise] resorted to win\nGrant really did he had a serious problem in Syria's drinking ... the man was he a good general and he's finally being recognized as a great general\nAlmost developed a phobia because he was having a hard time\nWas they drew great fighter and a great General Robert Italy but grant figured it out and grant is a great general in Grand came from right here [noise]\nOkay um and let's cheer for general grant look grant is getting more and more respect as a president or there's a new ... Iran journal who wrote a find biography of Hamilton that became the subject for the musical\nIn any event um\nIdea that there's something here about President Trump praising Robert easily what our last caller said there there are all kinds of generals ... who was on the other side who structured Pearl Harbor was a very very fine\nNaval officer for the Japanese you can recognize that somebody who fought against your country was a competent general and the the point about this is even NBC had to redo it's tweet tweet it out it's an awful thing it's with a clip where it just says I'm\nA watch President Trump says Robert ... it was a great general during Ohio rally calling the Confederate leader incredible\nThat was not the point he was just saying that grant was able to beat Linda get leaders surrendered then by the way\nIt most military historians would say that grant as a military leader was even greater and more formidable than Robert Daly\nUp but the idea that President Trump has accused of this is why people hate and just trust the media meanwhile there's another media sprayed it was phony regarding a movie that's pretty darn rate you should hear about it here it is

eight seven seven three one two three and one of course if you're a liberal you want to argue we'd love to have to love him more than I like a than exposing lives on the air so did you all happened to catch\nThe just athletic performance Donald Trump in that sixty minutes interview uh this weekend with Leslie stall so I'm I'm sitting there and I'm a ... at the\nKitchen table my wife and we're eating dinner and it's on and I'll watch sixty minutes once in a while not really into you know NBC nightly news or ABC News I obviously I usually just keep box on\nBut once in a while I'll turn on sixty minutes kind of see what liberals are thinking because they they try to ... portrayed as a straight news show it's not um it's really a liberal attack dog show like everything else but once in a blue moon they all have some story and it's mildly interesting so I tuned in I heard Trump is going to be on and\nIt was a complete order a dismantling I I'm not sure sixty minutes has any idea right now\nHow bad that interview really was for them\nIt was that it was a train wreck for them I mean they just got run over by the Trump train they had no idea what was coming now the interview was conducted by Leslie stall who what was I don't know if we if there is very nice personally have no idea I've never met her in my life but\nI've watched some of her interviews in the past and they are always liberal activists narrative\nInterviews now rather than just going on about the Trump interview and how great it was I Want to leave you with something I Want to I Want to talk to you about what Trump did why he did it how it works\nAnd how liberals are entirely not used to this in his style of dealing with the media now contrasted with Leslie stalls interview with Betsy Ross the education secretary which happened gosh I don't know um three or four months ago\nAnd it wasn't it wasn't a bad interview Betsy Voskuhl but she got cornered on a couple of questions and Leslie stall was trying to advance a narrative Leslie stall when she got into things like school choice and other questions like that um she was trying to advance a narrative a liberal now does she really wasn't looking for answers that's what liberals do you know when\nWhen I ran for office I saw this liberal reporters which is Ninety nine percent of them\nThey don't ask a question to get an answer they ask you a question to develop and advance a pre existing storyline on any question it doesn't matter folks throw it out there on taxes the preexisting storyline is\n... tax hikes are going to bankrupt the government and that they're always in it for the rich the Republicans ... ... they're not asking you a question about tax cuts they're just asking a question to advance the narrative that you're on the side of the rich guys screwing over the average American\nOn health care it's that you're looking at throw grandma off the cliff you're cruel you want people to die\nOn schools is that you're starving public schools uh money despite the fact that ... a public schools have records of matter of fact it doesn't matter they're not really asking questions what they're trying to do is get a narrative advance and they're trying to do what's called framing or trying to frame the question in a very specific way\nAnd they are used to doing this and winning because what happened they ask the questions the Republicans panic\nYou know listen there's this tax cuts and wealthy people are going to do well on to these types of of course they are they're wealthy they pay a lot of money in taxes of course they're gonna do well under attack that's not the question the question is are middle class Americans working Americans going to do well to what is the economy going to grow\nBut it's not a Republican just answering like that oh yeah they haven't they haw and they're terrified and they'd backtrack and they let people like Leslie stall run the table\nBy framing framing the question to advance a narrative they are not looking for an answer they're looking to put you in a corner\nWhat Trump did in that interview was just beautiful and it is a PHD course in owning the lips completely it is a PHD course in how to handle the liberal media\nHe does not accept the premise of the question and turns the question to an answer he wants to answer not an answer that's already a you know that they they think they're going to get out of abide by a pre existing narrative and trying to advance\nShe re frames it in his way [noise]\nPerfect example was the question about the Washington DC with Trump starts talking about how bad the media is\nThis is eight eight is is Trump's narrative it's a narrative that is true by the way that the media is biased against the American people are who are weapon to be conservative or even moderate Republicans this is a that's a that's a almost taught a logical\nTrump knows that\nTrump is comfortable with that territory talking about the media and they're biased towards working class Americans and others right\nSo what does he do we re frames\nLesley Stahl who's smart she's ... she's not dumb she's very bright she's just the liberal just liberal you know pretending to be a journalist right\nShe automatically census Trump's getting into this media war she knows that works for him and she tries to stop him she cut them off by the way she interviewed him I I saw something on Twitter ... sixty four times and when they interviewed Obama they interrupted him four times but we figured that because that's what they do right\nShe get the rub some to stop 'em because she knows she's now playing on on on the way basketball court here\nShe knows she's playing and his territory she tries to stop him and he doesn't have it he doesn't have it he keeps going and going because Trump knows that authenticity cells and he's going to be authentic even if it comes with battle scars at all\nThat's Trump's MO he is not going to talk and focus group tested talking points he's going to talk like Donald Trump talks period and the story right\nSo the take away fear\nFor anybody thinking about her ... or interested at all in running for office becoming a conservative activists takeaway number one is you re framed the question to reframe the arguments wouldn't answer you want to get not to the pre existing narrative they want to advance\nTrump does it all the time watch you know\nFolks they sell this guy short constantly constantly but liberal media paid this guy as some kind of a buffoon yet he is constantly having them back on their heels\nSo it makes no sense\nNow he did something else that's important not just any turn around and and reframe this thing\n\nHe got the last word and this is critical he would not let Leslie stall that sixty minutes and if you get the last word he gets a last words he did it constantly\nAnd he did it one time and what happened what's the benefit of getting the last word and they come on this is simple this is really easy to benefit of getting the last word in Utah class and that's what everybody remembers\nSalt tries to stop 'em on when he goes on this uh when he goes on attack with the media right and he keeps going and then he says at the end and you know ...\nAnd then that's why I'm president and you are not and boom that's what everybody remembers at the end\nFolks that's what\nThink this is the tough time the media is having with this guy they don't understand that it's the sense of again a battle scars and all and authentic natural way of conversations sometimes it's sometimes it's heated sometimes it's not there are hills and valleys there are ... that\nThrew vicissitudes of the ... of the conversation he goes up he goes down but when he hits hits hard that people aren't\nPractice to that authenticity\nSo we understand if he has to reframe it number one and secondly\nHe understands fully that he needs to get that last word in and he did and that's what everybody remembered\nBecause I'm president than you or not\nBut now\nThe reason I bring this up is not to just you know law does performance at the point out what he did\nWith the show you how that performance contrast what's what's going on in the Democratic party right now which is a just a litany of rods in and out of the people who are completely inauthentic\nWho they are they based their entire campaigns around identity politics and class warfare and it's collapsing everywhere exhibit number one Elizabeth Warren today\n... ... I mean a whole\nOne other president other than Donald Trump what other forget about president what other Republican\nAnywhere anywhere in the entire movement\nCould have gotten a ... a major party presidential candidate twenty and twenty twenty which everybody knows that lives with one's going to be to actually released a press release indicating that she's possibly one one thousand and twenty fours\nNative American who else could have gotten so much to do something so stupid folks whoever is running the PR shop in Elizabeth Warren staff\nShould resign for felony level political malpractice immediately I have no idea what you think you were getting out of a press release indicating that your great\nGreat great is it for grade so I'm not even sure for three great grandmothers back may

they're experts at it\nThey are so good at gas lighting remember gas lighting his\nGift sliding is when you tell a lie you tell it confidently you tell it over and over\nYou isolate people from the truth and you can get people using that technique to believe things that are factually incorrect I mean let me give you a just a quick example I happened to address this in the show it a long time [noise]\nBut how many times have you heard the the the talking point 'cause that's what it is it's factually incorrect that the Reagan tax cuts man they caused massive deficits folks that is factually not correct there were big deficits in the Reagan years that is correct they were not caused by the\nTax cuts the Reagan tax cuts after taxes were cut tax revenue went up dramatically it almost doubled by the time Reagan left office\nThat's a fact you can look that up yourself can Google those tests tax websites that go over historical packs numbers to even adjusted for inflation they went up dramatically\nBut it's evidence of the liberals tactical ability to constantly stay on message that's typically falls state that false message repeatedly use the media to isolate people from the truth because the media will parrot that narrative and I tell people that your story and get people to believe something that's factually incorrect\nIt is factually incorrect to say that the ... says the Reagan tax cuts caused the deficits tax revenue went up we just spent more money that is not a factual said but you've been told that so often people believe it\nYou don't ... the the whole thing about how Clinton Clinton wiped out the national daddy zeroed out the national ... we had no deficit under Clinton that is just not true\nSome people say oh there's a there was a Clinton surplus I I used to bring this up on the show all the time when I first started filling in for ... years ago because it's not because it's um\nIt's a it's a talking point that it it's just it's so ingrained into the American psyche do liberals effective messaging that people believe it was actually a Clinton surplus that wasn't\nThere was no year and Clinton's presidency where the government took in more\nMoney than it's been none\nThey got close at the end of his presidency but there was no surplus ever they ran annual deficit and put it this way the simplest way to describe his cars liberals always have a tough time understanding even mechanical basic for this [laughter]\nIf there was a surplus in the Clinton years answer we don't me that's right how is it that every single year of the bill Clinton's presidency every single year\nThe national debt rose please explain to me in normal mathematical terms how that happened if they ran a surplus\nIf um if they didn't pay the debt back home the debt one up every single year the Clinton presidency but no I was\nTold on TV that was that Clinton surplus the what you were told wrong I I don't know what to tell you you know you were probably told when you were a kid various fairy tales to which adds a family friendly show so I'll leave it out you know what I'm Talking about\nYou believe in those now too as well you were isolated from the truth\nWhat were you need is one now ABC nightly news NBC nightly news CNN story on how the Clinton surpluses admit they would go away forever\nBut they won't do it they do this now they're doing it now and the reason I'm bringing it up is because they are good at staying on\nMessage that's how they get these myths to persist over time Trump pass them scattered all over the place they cannot stay on message you got one guy who Spartacus you got one guy I skateboard in the parking lot better now you got one guy talking about\nFart jokes at a at a serious Sheldon Whitehouse this was the Democrats\n\nI fundamentally disagree with just about all of their policy positions but I'm telling you I've always respected there almost meticulous ability to stay on message however false that message is\nNot in the era of\nDonald Trump they cannot do it they are so overtaken with rage at\nThis guy represents the anti swab rhetoric the anti media rhetoric when they go out there and they

the gas lighting is not working anymore\n[noise]\nThe guys got what forty million followers or something on Twitter he goes out and give speeches all over the country the media is forced to cover his soundbites he re frames questions from the media turns it back on them\nHe and he gets the last word in just about every interchange even with the sixty minutes thing over the interview making sure that's the soundbite everybody remembers any talks like normal Americans\nThis is constantly has the liberal media and the liberal focus group folks and their swap rat Democrats back on their heels 'cause they don't know how to respond anymore\nThe standard arguments are no longer working there are collapsing they're falling on deaf ears\n\nYou know I've said with his fair share stuff that I was talking about before the break that this argument that Trump is Don apologizing for taking money out of the pockets of the government and putting it into the hands of the earners in this country\nEven if the owners happened to be successful and wealthy everybody you know apologize in the past oh no no we're not giving tax cuts to the rich why why are we not doing that why what because it'll look that well is it good for the economy yeah it's good for the economy so who cares that make the case something it's such a was make\nCase talked I say\nI told you the numbers before the break this one I Can't get this number out of my head\nThat do fourteen hundred wealthiest taxpayers in the country pay the same percentage of income tax three percent as the bottom fifty percent of income tax payers this whole country\n... do you understand the gravity of what I just do these four teen hundred taxpayers who are successful and wealthy pay the same percentage of the income tax load as the bottom fifty percent of income tax orders in this country\nCan't flip a delusional liberals who are one percenters themselves Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren\n\nJohn Kerry John Kerry's ... was a one percent of one percent are\nWell still insists you don't pay your fair share they have no idea what that even means it requires you to be a sucker to do no further analysis of that\nFolks turning your money over to the government you might as well turn or you might as well burn it you're flushing it down the toilet you don't Milton Friedman I haven't brought this up in a while either [noise]\nIt's always worth bringing up again the great Milton Friedman the late great milk treatment he had this thing about the ways to spend money but she used to tell people what you hear it you can never on

what's the most efficient ways to spend ... way to spend money right\nNew spending your money on yourself or your family you on yourself why\nBecause the cost of the product you're purchasing matters

you don't buy crappy suffers going to fall apart cost and quality matter when you spend your own money on yourself and your family\nWhat's another way to spend money left going down the efficiency scale you spending money on other people\nFriedman would make the argument there that when you spend money on other people the cost of what you're buying matters because it's your money but if I'm buying a product for Mr producer\nThis equality matter well I like rich so maybe but let's be honest it doesn't matter as much as if you're buying it for your wife or your family I Know richest feel a
