it's a beautiful book\nGrowing up as a young child and then teenager on the streets of Philadelphia in the Nineteen twenties and thirties my father ... found appreciation for the role of the police [noise]\nMy parents taught us from a young age to respect the police and they're difficult job in fact two of my uncles served in the Philadelphia police department uncle willy was a motorcycle officer an uncle Jack was a traffic officer\nMy father is a deeply patriotic man with a great deal of common sense he understands at an all walks of life and in every profession\nMan's imperfections prevent themselves but having witnessed recent events in related news reports painting police officers and police departments and an extremely negative light he felt a book especially geared to our young people\nWas a central so that they learn to respect law and order\nCould imagine an America without law and order it would be a place where people would be free to create all kinds of trouble danger in our lives families businesses and\nLifestyles [noise] in other words America would cease being the America we know and love the civil society with a life liberty unhappiness in the individual are cherished and protected\nWhile our government is established with various institutions that have as their purpose the preservation of our own Elena but writes in his left the law enforcement particularly our community and neighborhood police officers to ensure that our lives property in everyday activities are safeguard [noise]\nPolice officers are also in the front lines is the first responders when the public is threatened by acts of nature such as earthquakes hurricanes or by accident man than endanger the public safety\nIn certain instances are police officers service neutral protectors of our rights as citizens such as guaranteeing the safety and peaceful protesters\nWho may march down at public street chanting slogans we might find offensive\nFor these reasons police officers are often referred to as police officers\nMy father's now Ninety three years old he's offered in illustrated several wonderful children's books\nAnd each book he seeks to open the eyes and minds of young people to the greatness of American history principles and values and he wants the next generation to be proud of America as his generation\nIn our police that's the name of the book in our police my father's written in illustrated another beautiful book from my family to yours we hope you enjoy it [noise]\nI Would test alert you to the fact that the book comes out October

testifying in front of the United states the public testifying in front of a Senate committee testifying in front of the media\n... garnered more information from those two adults and you would garner from a background investigation from the FBI\nBut the Democrats were hoping that something would come up anything would come up\nAnd as I said back then it's a remarkable thing to watch the Democrats they hate law enforcement they hate law enforcement they hate the FBI they hate us they hate the border patrol\nAnd yet they tried to use the FBI's a fig leaf all through all through the ... the Kony

Danes has supported cabin all throughout the confirmation process so that really whatever the senator spokeswoman Katie a shuttle or\nSays Danes read the FBI report on the allegations and so no evidence of corroborating claims made by Christine Blasey Ford and two other women she says Danes believes it's time the confirmation moves for well that's fine but are you going to be there to vote on it if it's Saturday\nYou know there's the Democrats control the media narrative and I got to thinking I asked this question on Sunday on the program\nThe Democrats take the lead from the media the media take their lead from the Democrats I Believe the media now\nLead the way and the Democrats follow that let me underscore that point to the back veterans can repeated that the media plead the way the Democrats follow\nI'll give you an example is really precious little reporting on the fact\nThat despite all the demand for another FBI background investigation\nThat Dr Ford's allegations could provide no corroboration whatsoever no evidence whatsoever no witnesses whatsoever\n\nNo collaboration whatsoever no witnesses whatsoever no evidence whatsoever\nThey went back and they interviewed may ...\nAnd so they trashed the FBI report while they didn't interviewed Dr Ford there's nothing to ask Dr Ford and if they did interviewed Dr Ford really then you would need a criminal investigation which this is not\nA for her to explain her inconsistencies and so forth and all these witnesses who she says she has or doesn't have would have to be interviewed in that context but they aren't\n[noise] so\nThere's very little discussion about that that is the fact\nThat the FBI report found that\nThere is no cooperation is that not a big deal Chuck Grassley was pretty good today he

about the story and go to parts of the beyond Supreme Court [noise]\nThe reason I think there's been a lot of pushback across the country or what took place in the Senate Judiciary committee and what's taking place in the media is because not all Americans but most Americans have common sense most Americans are good people\nMost Americans know has set up job when they see one\n[noise] they saw the Senate Judiciary committee that apparently hates men\nThat promotes lies a mob rule that plays dirty tricks\nThat rejects fundamental due process rights that declares a person guilty without justice without evidence without any\nAnd as I said yesterday\nAmerican people saw a federal judge\nSeller reputation\nBroke the tears\nIn front of the media in front of the nation in front of the world\nAnd they saw Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee\nWho relish ship\nRelish them\nAnd they came to hate Kevin all the way they've come to hate the president because he fought back because he spoke up\nBecause he challenged his accusers the Democrats and the radical left wing nuts base want you to believe that they represent women that they stand for women's rights not only do\nThey

twenty five FBI investigations unless there's one where they can hang our hat on it's not going to matter\nBecause these are the same people who said the man is guilty it's a job interview and that he
