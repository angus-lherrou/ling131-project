wait while you have a very\nDrudge has a link to a piece in Politico which is absolutely fascinating\nFrom late last night I meant to get to this only so much time [noise] by the way we have a wonderful candidate at the bottom of the hour Rhonda Santos who's running for governor in Florida Theresa near and dear to all of our hearts so we want to focus on that but first\n[noise] listen to this and I'll tell you what I think's going on\nMahler number him\nMuller linked scene in mystery grand jury appeal the special counsel appears to be locked in a dispute with a mystery grand jury witness but much of the\nCases sealed\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller appears to be locked in a dispute with a mystery grand jury witness resisting giving up information ... and the ongoing probe into alleged Trump campaign collusion with Russia\nIt's unclear exactly what the two sides are fighting over but that case it appears to resemble a separate legal battle involving an associate of Trump ally Roger Stone Andrew Miller who's fighting a mother subpoena\nMiller's lawyers are using the case slated to be argued at the D.C court of appeals early next month [noise] excuse me to mount a broad legal a song ... most of the party of special counsel\n[noise] I don't know how this was going to turn up but you'll recall on this program this is something I've been urging challenging the constitutionality of disappointment let the chips fall where they may but it needs to be challenged and apparently that's what's taking place\nThe more shadowy case which involves an unknown person some before a grand jury this summer the DC circuit on Monday set a separate route of arguments for December fourteen to case traveled in recent months\nIt's from us district court chief judge barrel how can the U.S court of appeals for the DC circuit back down but Hal and back up again to the appeals court with most detail shrouded in secrecy another indication that much uh mullahs activity is taking place behind the scenes and Israeli glimpse by the press republic\n[noise] so this battles going on in the grand jury and their appeal is obviously taking place up to the ... circuit court which is right on to the Supreme Court\nOver whether or not I suspect broadly speaking Mueller has the authority to do anything that he's doing however a political reporter\nWho visited the appeals court clerk surface of the day when a key filing into dispute was due earlier this month observed a man request they copied the special counsel's latest sealed filing so that the man's law firm ... crafted response the individual who was asked\nFor the secret filing declined to identify himself or his client I replied I'm OK when offered reporters business card to remain in touch\nThree hours later a shield response in the grand jury dispute was submitted to the DC circuit and other detail emerge Wednesday strengthening the secret legal battles of parents high top model is pro\n\nThe first appeal appears to have been rejected by a DC circuit panel is premature\nThe witnesses lawyers asked the full bench of uh of appeals court to review that decision but in a patient in court filings says only nine of the court ten active judges participated bowing out was judge Greg cat that catches the courts only member appointed by president Donald Trump\nCats are served as deputy White House counsel before Trump tapped him for the powerful D.C court of appeals last year\n[noise] goes on\nA spokesman for Mueller's office Peter car declined to comment on the litigation\nLawyers for Trump said the mystery grand jury subpoena fight moving through the DC circuit had nothing to do with the president know ideas said Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow when shown the docket for the case [noise]\nAttorneys for Roger ... said they didn't know of anyone challenging a mile a subpoena beyond Miller Miller's lawyers agreed with Mueller's prosecutors to make many aspects of the dispute public\nNo such agreement appears to have been struck in the other fight although Mueller's team and the mystery witness did file a joint motion earlier this month the asking the appeals court to expedite resolution of the dispute\nSeveral other lawyers who represent witnesses Mahler investigation also said there were unaware of who's crossing legal swords with the special counsel's team and the largely secret case a few barebones details about the dispute are available in the public record while all records about the litigation and the district court or steal\nThe DC circuit stock it shows that the case was brought in the D.C court on August sixteen and how ruled on September at Nineteen the initial appeal was filed five days later\nTo stay with me on this because we'll try to make sense of this it's actually very very fascinating\nThe bottom line is most likely scenario someone filed a motion to quash or otherwise resist any grand jury subpoena\nAnd the judge issued an order denying that and saying the witness needs to testify said Ted Boudreau so I Know hey Gibson Dunn and crush or attorney who has handled grand jury related litigation for journalists and many organizations\nChunk clear what is the case the appeals court has agreed to here in December involves an assertion of attorney client privilege or some other privilege is framed as a broader attack on my list that's already or perhaps advances both sets of arguments\nVery hard to tell from the stock of well I'll tell you\nIt's not hard to tell at all\n[noise] Mr Miller ... challenged we know from a few months back the constitutionality the appointment of Mahler or the appointments clause of the constitution the same argument I been making\nThat professor ... has made\nI don't know exactly what kind of argument there making obviously I'm not privy to this sort of thing but it's the same person Miller and I assume it's the same lawyers who are making this argument probably challenging the subpoenas by challenging the constitutionality of Mahler and his operation\nIn the first instance\nI suspect I Believe strongly that that's what's taking place again because I have first hand knowledge but because remember what took place a few months ago\nThe grand jury cases pose a threat the mullahs investigation because they can serve as vehicles to get questions of us have already illegal legitimacy before poet judges relatively quickly and I believe that's what's taking place here such questions have also been raised by defendants and some of my list criminal cases but\nAll the human defendants who set foot in a courtroom of ultimately decided to plead guilty and drop any challenges to the special counsel the hardier tactics\n\nMystery cases moving through the courts involving grand jury matters and independent counsel matters or aren't on common in Nineteen Ninety seven conflict of interest investigation into America or chief Eli she goes fundraising activities was conducted under seal from its start\nIn the final report remains that are public view involving another Clinton era pro the labor secretary Alexis Herman and influence peddling accusations\n\nThis can't this can get a step or two weirder than it already is set an attorney representing a senior Trump staffer in the Russian inquiry Belair recall the case from a previous investigation where you couldn't even get to see a judge's opinion because there was under steal art\n[noise] I'm\nFairly confident that this is the case that was originally brought involving Miller by counsel as I said the question the appointment of Mahler or the appointments clause and the DC circuit has been packed\nA wood left is an Obama appointee so who knows what'll happen there perhaps they're building the foundation also to take it to the United States Supreme court [noise]\nAnd despite what you've heard by senior judicial analyst than others this is not the Mars and versus Olson case of Thirty years ago and bobbing the independent counsel\nThe elements in that court decision appear to have been violated in my opinion and professor calories his opinion respecting Muller and this is why these two questions are important to stay with me 'cause you're smart and you'll know you'll be able to follow all this we've talked about it before\nIs Mr Mahler a principal officer of the federal government\n\nFor is seeing inferior office\nFor purposes of a challenge\nTo the appointments clause of the constitution I have no doubt that he insists that he's in and fear officer who reports to deputy attorney general Rosen's thing\nThat he did not have to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate he's nothing more than an inferior office official like some assistant United States attorney or yesterday\nTo an assistant attorney general now you know that's not true he's got more power than a U.S attorney\nAnd the reason among other reasons that he has more power than a U.S attorneys because his initial\nAppointment was enormously brought it didn't provide any criminal basis for his investigation we've talked about that so this isn't like Mars some versus also know the court may conclude that it is but on the facts that is not\nIt's a legitimate challenge I visit sorry I don't know where it will go but I'm Glad it's being done\nOne is a criminal alien served

it's a question I I Will be the first on radio at least ask but before I ask it I'm going to look at this here with you or word right scoop [noise] everybody Brian has a list of all the crimes committed\nBy the domestic terrorist I'm not talking about ... and the bernadine darn I'm not talking about the F. A. L. and they got all the parts from Clinton and so we're not talking about this guy\nAnd boy I'll tell you what he committed a felony in Nineteen Ninety One domestic violence in Nineteen Ninety four numerous parking violations another felony in two thousand for this guy was a drug court more parking violations or had a foreclosure let's see a\nCriminal traffic violation other traffic traffic traffic has on and on how the third\nDegree felony another parking violation misdemeanors recently twenty four houses guy not in prison\nHe is committed multiple felonies but here's a bigger question for you ladies and gentlemen\nAnd this was sent to me by buddy of mine the New York times and other news outlets keep referring to this guy is a registered Republican right [noise] but he's previously been convicted of felonies according to their same store and these other stores\nSo he should have been removed from the voter registration list because he lost his right to vote in Florida\n\nYou know the Democrats and the blue states in a blue cities they keep pushing for the rights of someone's devote after they've served their time you've heard it over and over again you're hurt Gillum mentioned it in one of the debates summer pushing for the ride of felons to vote while they're in prison\nBut let's talk about the facts here it's Florida\nHe should have been removed from the voter registration list because he lost his right to vote and it could not be restored until and unless he applied to the Florida clemency board and was approved\nFlorida is one of the states that does not does not automatically restore the right of felons to vote when they get out of prison even though it soon Mike by the way because the left but a referendum on the upcoming November ballot Arnie ... to do exactly that\nSo unless he had his right to vote restored he can't be a registered Republican quote unquote so I asked\nThe news media there the New York slime constipated news network MSL or stay all of you\n\nHow did you become a registered Republican when that was supposed to be stripped off the off the rolls\n\nNow once again he don't automatically restore the ride of Ellen's the vote when they get out of prison in Florida even though the left has a ballot measure right now for this election to do exactly that so that's not job would have had as right to vote restored Yvette past\n\nHe's a registered Republican\nHow did they become or how did he stay a registered Republican given the multiple felonies\nHow\nIt can't be restored unless and until they apply to the Florida clemency board unless it was approved is that what happened are there any media outlet media outlets that want to check it out I'm curious and by the way\nI Want to thank fabulous law enforcement local state and federal fabulous law enforcement the men and women of local law enforcement the men and women of state law enforcement the men and women a federal law enforced and I'm not talking about like call me type you know what I mean I'm Talking about the men\nAnd women of local state federal law enforcement that my lack trashes every game day\n\nBack a lot that taxes racist as big in every day\nAnd yet here we had Democrats targeted at local state and federal law enforcement people\nWere fabulous they moved quickly they moved effectively\nAnd they track this guy down what forty eight hours or so give or take\n\nBut don't worry and another week or two there'll be trashing law enforcement like they always do like they always do\n\nAnd what does this criminal justice reform stuff criminal justice reform they called us how the\nHell that this guy get out of prison\nHe's got a criminal record not as long as his right arm as long as there's less than his right arm misdemeanors felonies\n\nHow did he get out and that's just the foreign criminal justice reform we spend way too much time worrying about convicted felons or people who played the felonies and not enough time worrying about victims of crimes we've spent way too much time worrying about illegal aliens rather than\nAmerican citizens we spend too much time worrying about illegal alien children dreamers rather than an American citizen children\n\nWe allowed to talk about these things I mean I'm just on talking about these things now the president has correctly pointed out I Know he's an avid listener to this program and I greatly appreciate it that the media really of lead the way\nWith the rhetoric was references to Hitler would the references to racism anyone they disagree with on the left and then he closed the media of course that's how they frame the issues get ...\n\nAnd there been a number of very smart articles written today and yesterday pointing out hey look political rhetoric even bad political rhetoric doesn't justify doesn't explain what a nut job like this thousand dead\n\nIt's simply does not I just gave you a laundry list of the crimes that he committed\nTo and through twenty fourteen Donald Trump wasn't even running for president up and to and through twenty four Cheney committed multiple felonies by that multiple felonies he was already radicalized\n\nHe didn't need Donald Trump or anybody else to push 'em over the edge you was already over there which\n\nHe started committing crimes at least from the public record since Nineteen Ninety One all the way through twenty fourteen\n\nSays nothing to do with Donald Trump nothing whatsoever\n\nBut the left the media that Democrats have a quote unquote registered Republican\n\nAnd Donald Trump and he's driving around with what Trump and Pence on his pictures of them and their names on his on his van\nSo they make this connection there is no connection there is no connection whatsoever\n\nThe media trashing law enforcement the Democrats trashing law enforcement that left trashing law enforcement and now I think we can see why we need a law enforcement\n\nExcusing antifa excusing black lives matter ignoring Obama's relationship\nActual domestic terrorists bill heirs and burning door and among others President Trump has no relationship it never did what the actual domestic terrorists underground student terrorists who are actively involved\nThe bombings not Donald Trump has not pardon terrorists numbers or the FAA all what the Puerto Rican separatists organization you can lay that on Clinton and Obama\nTrump that did that Trump very been suggested that Trump has been supporting all enforcement that same law enforcement that just tracked down that's not drop\nThat law enforcement\nBut I asked the question again maybe as a registered Republican this not job but how did he become a registered Republican how did he not lose his uh his right to vote he's not even supposed to be on the voting less or maybe a maybe there was an effort to remove them from the voting less but some left wing group said it was voter suppression\nI don't know I'd like to know but he had a real mix of things here that's very fascinating to me I'll be right back [noise] month\nYou use them in the ... you know\nThis is a court ordered notice current and former foreign

eight eight seven three five five five nine six\n\nThat was the insinuation that have pushed him over the edge and that this is what causes it sort of know it doesn't that has multiple felonies in his past the guy threatened to use a bomb and two thousand two\n\nThat's pretty uh long before Donald Trump even flirted with the idea of running for president United States he was arrested in two thousand two according to the Associated Press on charges of threatening to throw place project or discharge any destructive device\n\nAnd as pointed out in the Washington Examiner he made the bomb threat because he was angry at a Florida utility worker\nIf people do not make these threats and commit these other felonies and I suppose would be governor Andrew Gillum Mac holy land Hoosier Andrew
