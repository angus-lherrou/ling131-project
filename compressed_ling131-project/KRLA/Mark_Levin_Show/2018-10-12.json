a quiet and mysterious deaths and in the film\nThe emphasize that part of the reasons for that attitude\nWas Neil Armstrong's life at least according to this film in the book that is based on\nRelated to a family tragedy which is very dramatically portrayed on screen at the beginning of the film everyone is remarkable in this movie in terms of performance as clear foie of playing Neil Armstrong's Wife Jan\nA ... and she was a long suffering wife and she was somewhat skeptical of what he was doing she said she wanted to have a conventional life and instead here he is an astronaut risking his life constantly and that's one of the things that the film brings back\nA very dramatically I I live in Seattle as people know and we have a a museum of flight here and you can go there and you can see some of these old space capsules that they actually use from the sixties and you looked at them and they're incredibly\nSmall and rickety in dangerous and you think they really want to get into that things of this giant rocket can really into space\nAnd yes people died in the space program and that's dramatized here two of the the scenes in which director Damien ... who previously did la la land with Ryan Gosling and before that did whiplash which also won an Oscar for Jk simmons well deserved\nIf she does such a superb job I mean truly superb job of dramatizing the space flight itself the training and the Gemini flights from the dangerous flights that came before\nIt's um it's it's one of these films where you cannot take your eyes off the screen\nIt is so riveting and by the way Jason her which provides a film score that his heroic that is stirring that his captivating and very knowledgeable there's even a little bit of a nod to two thousand one space odyssey during one of the Gemini sequences where they're trying to hook up in space\nOf the only reservation one can possibly have from the film is that it's not the kind of a real wake while we've done it totally satisfying triumphant conclusion you expect it's not the right stuff\nAnd uh ... what it shows but also went emphasizes is at the space program had its elements of controversy or use your voices on screen about people who are questioning the value and the amount of money that we're spending on putting a man on the moon when we're going through very difficult times\nIn American urban neighborhoods but with all of that the caring about the characters including Jason Clarke Jason Clarke what a year for him he\nWas outstanding as Senator Ted Kennedy in a film about Chappaquiddick were Chappaquiddick\nA friend in virtually the same week as the moon mission with Neil Armstrong Jason Clarke plays astronaut E.B White who was one of the best friends of Neil Armstrong and he is outstanding to 'em by the way one quick word there's been some controversy that's been ginned up\nTo some extent by conservative media I'm afraid about oh my they didn't show the American flag on the phone they do\nAnd I don't know whether they put that in because of the protests in controversy what they don't show is they don't show a big scene where Neil Armstrong comes down in plants the American flag and I claim this land and the name of president Richard Nixon no that doesn't happen\nHowever there are American flags everywhere in this film you see an American flag being raised you see the American flag patch on the shoulders of the astronauts on their uniform\nUh there are I I saw the film with rock star great Tomlin my producer and uh he counted fourteen different flags scenes so don't worry about that\nThree and a half stars for a film that is rated PG Thirteen it's rated PG Thirteen for some very intense scenes of danger\nI imagine that most people who see this film are going to love it as I did and the uh it it is part of the succession you could have an entire sequence now\nOf movies about space program heroic movies remember Apollo Thirteen with Tom Hanks hidden

for the friend is Brian mud I uh\nAlways always privileged to be here with you do a morning show and West Palm beach W. J. you know a mid morning show W. I. O. D. in Miami and are always always a privilege to be here with you know I broke it out at a couple of concepts on you\nIn recent weeks out what it is the the premise the premise is that if you step Alicia anything at a false premise you build anything on top of a false premise it's all going to fail\nSo I don't embrace the false premise also talked about there being two sides histories one side effects\nAnd that all kind of goes hand in hand I got eight of these things over the course of time I'm liable to break them all out on you\nAs my third one told a sliding scale of morality what we've got ourselves in is a massive massive sliding scale of morality right now by the way morality is actually one name\n[laughter] it's kinda crazy right now much not by much but morality is actually winning ... some of what we're talking about a week ago had to do with Brett Kavanaugh and how the average American actually viewed cabin are coming out of those hearings quick little recap on that\nPrior to the Ford a cabin on hearing three percent more Americans according to Gallup and they have been pulling a cabin on every single day for the day after the ... nomination of him but three percent more Americans to not thought he shouldn't be confirmed\nAnd then we come full circle and after everything at the time of the vote we have one percent and more Americans thought that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed and not in other words we went back to believe in him\nAnd ultimately that close but we had last weekend was endemic of us the average American bullied brick yeah but I Believe that he should be confirmed and the United States Senate actually went ahead and did what we want it set sliding scale of morality and all told\nWe only had our public opinion changed by seven percent that entire process that was at seven percent in other words most people are pretty stuck in their basic morality\nTimes people will go you know how is it that this friend I've had over a year turned around and stab me in the back\nBut that's all part of the sliding scale morality\nAnd I'll tell you how it's playing out you've seen in your own life no doubt maybe with your friends certainly with anybody you discuss politics whether you might disagree with and just the overall frustrations you might have about politics in this country let alone\nThe moral outrage moral outrage by the media on back of ... a visiting President Trump\nHere's how the sliding scale morality works\nUnless you're potentially responded Satan you're probably not evil Joel how hold out the possibility I Know ... so maybe you know as long as you're not there the sponsors say nor oh maybe Chuck Schumer you're not pure evil and none of us are perfect\nSo on a scale of one to ten say that one is evil tennis perfection we're all two is tonight\nAnd therefore at our bass were really having a good day and where our best versions of ourself we're going to be at the upper end up whatever our morality is let's say you have a really honest in decent person really honest a decent person might be an eight\nMaybe on their worst day there are five now what does that mean well it means that\nI'm not going to hurt you even when I'm at my worst I'm not gonna hurt you because I'm a decent person more than that but let's say that you start out an outlet sliding scale morality your sex\nAnd so you're a decent person throughout much of your your life but when adversity strikes when something goes south what happens you slide back three not just suddenly were three oh sure you're going to hurt somebody if it means taking care of yourself if it means putting your interests first you will take others down\nThat's how the sliding scale morality wars that's how people will stab others in the back when you thought they were your friends are right kind of get the idea here so let's talk about the sliding scale of morality a little bit\nSo many people so many people have been reaching out been frustrated how is it still\nThat you have people that defend Christine for how is it that you still have people\nThat will say that Brett Kavanaugh's rapist when he wasn't even accused of rape by the way\nWell I mean by anybody other than ... I guess\nThe answer comes down to the sliding scale of morality if you don't have a real moral compass you don't start out in a high place around need to begin with\n... you can make it up as you go every day you view things through the prism that you create a\nLittle bit later in the show I'm going to talk about UN's climate science and went fraud they are along with Medicare and the fraud that is Medicare for all its financial for on the conversation\nThe reality it's broad bunch of people lying to you\nBut it's all part of our morality today to where I can lie to you\nIf it suits me and when politicians do it and it works you're going to get more of it and people will embrace it to the extent that it makes them feel good or to the extent that it justifies their existence and I'll give you an example\nI've always had this rule that if somebody reaches out to me and they don't use profanity I'll get around and and respond to them this was a listener talking about Christine for\nAnd I mentioned that hey she committed perjury\nAnd she I Believe should ultimately be tried for it\nNow I had somebody saying well her witnesses the ones that ended up getting her claims maybe maybe they were the ones who weren't being honest and this was their said\nThere may be many reasons why they refuted the claims one of which beat ... could be they didn't remember another might be that they didn't want the death threats to their families oh\nOkay cool cool so you can get mad felonies\nWhenever you feel like as long as your reasons are good enough if a sliding scale of morality\nAnd when we're talking about the sliding scale morality and we're talking about Kanye West and the moral outrage by the media are you kidding me are you getting me Twenty years ago today\nWhat what are we talking about and what do you think of when you heard Oval Office\nIt certainly wasn't about the president of the United states it has something to do with what was on that blue dress\nAnd so for the very media\nThat sucked up to William Jefferson Clinton to have moral outrage over profanity being utilized by Kanye West and the oval office\nThat is one heck of a sliding scale of morality and that is the world we live in today and so more than ever before it's important to know\nWhere your moral compass happens to be\nOr you five and six or seven and eight where are you where when you're at your best where are you when you're at your worst when you are inviting people into your life who are they where they\nAre they six is not a good day and three's on a bad day\nLast week I was talking a bit about beating your head against the wall a lot of folks want to know how do you become more persuasive how can you convince people of things politically\nWhat we've seen every time people get an opportunity\nWell that is an opportunity to open their mind remember was talking about just a few minutes ago sliding scale morality but also finding people who are open minded now historically we've saying well over Ninety percent\nOf black adults vote for Democrats now when\nIt with any group of people we ever agree Ninety percent of the time but why is it that for decades how we'd had black adults that were breaking Ninety percent plus it's time for a Democrat no open mindedness no division of dot\nBuying into the identity politics but nothing ever changed\nAnd we see that we are still the country\nWhere a man from the pores\nBut in the country can go on to become the most renowned neurosurgeon in the world and by the way be part of the Trump Administration and a Republican and now we see that one of the top entertainers in the world self made near billionaire\nCan also like Donald Trump and be a Republican and that is the problem because that is where the Democrats get exposed as soon as there's an opportunity for diversity of thought and that comes through opportunity\nAnd the one thing if we take a look at George W.

J. no in West Palm Beach in mid morning show W. I. O. D. in Miami\nAnd always in an honor and pleasure to be filled in for the great one more call then by the way you cannot catch me on Twitter at ... radio\nNow here's an excerpt from the president's base\nThroughout the year we've seen Democrats across the country uniting around and new legislative proposal that would end Medicare as we noted takeaway benefits that seniors have paid for their entire lives\nCalled Medicare for all the Democratic proposal what does that was a government run single payer healthcare system that eliminates all private employer based health care plans that would cost an astonishing\nDuring two point six trillion during its first ten years\nOh by the way as a candidate\nI promised that we would protect coverage for patients with preexisting condition and create new healthcare insurance options that will lower premiums I've kept that promise and we're now seeing health insurance premiums coming down I've also made a solemn promise to our great seniors to protect Medicare\nThat's why I'm fighting so hard against the Democrats plan that would of visceral right Medicare\nDemocrats have already harm seniors by slashing Medicare by more than eight hundred billion dollars over ten years to pay for Obamacare likewise Democrats would cut Medicare with their plan government takeover of American healthcare alright ended the extra there for the president let me\nPut something and and very clear terms\nThe president could not be more right\nThe omission and the media on this one beyond the USA Today piece is pretty incredible\nBut what the president is doing here\nIs an education that you can even get in school right now it's so important the greatest fraud the greatest fraud that has ever been perpetuated n excepted as the legitimate concept by millions of Americans is Medicare for all\nTalking about the sliding scale morality and how you have many\nPoliticians all political party anymore that starts out with an amoral base and it will take you if you line up with them to an amoral place immediately because it's a false premise it's based on\nMedicare for all its financial fraud what the president was pointing out there the eight hundred billion over ten years that's diverted\nHere is what actually happened to Medicare he's a hundred percent right it's not a political talking point it's a fact\nIf you go back a few years ago Medicare was projected to begin to hit insolvency and the twenty third it's kinda like Social Security but what you've seen over recent years is increasingly we're going to reach insolvency sooner now you don't have to be a financial genius to pick up on a couple of points\nReal quickly and here's the first one\nIf we already are pacing insolvency with Medicare as we know what's going to happen if we put everybody on it\nNow here's the deal according to the federal trust the Medicare we hit insolvency in twenty twenty six as it is twenty twenty six eight years from now now what happens in year one\nNine percent of Medicare benefits to party\nGone first year nine percent Medicare senior and it gets worse every year from there that currently you got Fifteen Percent of Americans that are on Medicare Fifteen Percent that's it you got a hundred percent of the workforce contributing to it but you do the math on this one real quick\nFifteen Percent on Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens when we put the other eighty five percent of the population on it\nAnd it is financial thought is bigger than Bernie made off you at a political party that's perpetuating it in Florida we got the Democratic ... a gubernatorial candidate that is running on it\nFinancial fraud running on a platform of financial fraud and by the way if you're not\nPaying attention to board has given the joy of race and you're not in Florida that's okay\nThat's okay but guess what if Andrew Gillum if the socialist when's\nWhere we've got much bigger problems because it's coming to a state near you one of the most important elections in the entire country this year is what's happening right here in my home state of Florida where we have ... who was the Trump candidate\nWho is running as the Republicans will replace Rick Scott who was term limited in running for the Senate\nAndrew Gillum is the Bernie Sanders candidate\nI Want you to think about this for a moment because you're used to for being the purple state the swing state we tend to have you know fairly moderate politicians ... no\nYou won't have the most liberal and left just governor and the entire country if Andrew Gillum wins and he got well that sucks to be one for to know it sucks to be you everywhere because here is what will happen\nWe've already seen it start start to take place Andrew Gillum was not backed by the Democrats and our state\nHe was one of five candidates running the establishment on the last ended up backing Gwen Graham within the daughter of former governor Bob Bob Graham in our state\nShe finished second to Andrew Gillum Andrew Gillum rode a wave of the Bernie Sanders support he ended up winning the Democratic nomination which is thirty four percent of the vote that was enough to get through\nWhat's happened is they now consolidated around him of course the Democrats the party Soros came in here with us money Michael Bloomberg\nJust came out to South Florida held an event for Andrew Gillum cut him a check to Ozzie or Michael Bloomberg sounded like he is the the the populist the sensible guy he's backing somebody who was a democratic socialist for governor and the state of Florida\nBut what's happening now that they're getting behind him and that he's running at this point a race to where he is a slight favorite to win\nThere watching closely and they're saying hey he's getting the young people young people typically don't vote in mid term elections\nAnd so what happens in Florida rarely stays in Florida but this race of ... is critical and again there is one platform piece in particular\nThat is really important to watch and it is the Medicare for all which by the way is all that much more ironic what you're talking about the governor's race because won't Medicare federal program that doesn't really matter\nAndrew Gillum has also run on impeaching President Trump a kid you not\nThat's part of what's going on here\nAnd now this is why it's important to educate it's why it's important to inform simple concepts like this if Medicare is already set to fail in just eight years and benefits will be cut and you've only got fifty percent on it\nIt is impossible it is a financial fraud is out and out this honest is that you could put everybody on it and it's going to get better there is no way without massive tax increases massive benefit cuts\nTo be able to achieve what they're talking about but if it wins politically than what\nWe've got much bigger problems on Iran's here's something that is the one of the biggest challenges we've got today financial illiteracy\nOne of the things that drives me crazy the average adult average adult it financially illiterate if you really want to be afraid of the education establishment be afraid of this the average teacher by the white also happens to be financially illiterate\nI'm not getting a not exaggerating I'm not making it up it's according to federal defender of has a basic financial literacy test\nAnd right now more than sixty percent of adults bail it of basic financial literacy tests and that's part of the problem we have with conversations and concepts like this\nDoesn't matter how educated one is\nGenerally if they're financially illiterate than these concepts might be bought and sold kind of like hope and change and Obamacare\nSo having these conversations making sure that your financial informed making sure your kids are financially informed pretty important not only for their everyday life but when it comes to concepts like this because ultimately it's not complicated\nRight but that was in and we got the best economy in a generation we've got the lowest unemployment rate in forty nine years weve got record low unemployment rates for everybody but pretty much why the white people\nAnd how many people actually earned the minimum wage you're ready according to the bureau of Labor Statistics point six percent point six\nThat zero zero point six percent now what's wars that Ninety nine percent of those people be point six percent are under the age of twenty five and what happened\nAs soon as Amazon raise those wages we got the minimum wage conversation come up again\nAh one of the great fraud perpetuated that's out there is still living wage is funny what actually happened a good economy economics Amazon dot com props plus spring and they had the financial wherewithal to be able to increase wages just like what we're seeing because here's another little factoids oh by the way\nWhen you take a look at the average amount of money that a person's banking not only are we finally\nJust about at three percent towards a wage where by the time yet and bonuses goes over that by the time you add in your tax cut turns out to be about another Eighteen hundred bucks for the average person working this year because what\nThe average Jeanette take home pay now of six point seven percent year over year you have to go back thirty two years to find the last time your income growth that good [noise]\nFunny what happens when you actually have a good economy living wage\nIt's just a bunch of BS selling Medicare for all\nSuicides
