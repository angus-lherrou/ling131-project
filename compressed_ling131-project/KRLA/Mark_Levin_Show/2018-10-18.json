I guess if there aren't related to the topic\nOf what we're dealing with are books that are not related to the topic but this was one I wanted to do a and it just worked out great that it was this week the book is called hurricane of love the author is Dan Wheeler former ah a sharp from QVC host I just did as a crumb tremendous a\nTelevision personality and you're seeing that on the radio and TV audiences are supposed to be the audience is now then wrote this book about his life with Beth we learned her dirty a and again I Want to kind of re set the stage here a damn we've got other stations that joined us at the at the half hour mark here and and so talk about why the book what was the journey\nI wanted people to know about wheeler she was special she was the real star of the family even though I'd been on\nTV for Thirty years uh she was an amazing woman she had a singular ability Jay\nThat the moment you met her you felt like you knew her all your life I mean when I kept her on the shoulder she gave me the biggest smile she was so inviting she taught her kids always to get to know a person's heart not to judge someone\nBy the way they looked or the past and I found that to be true on QVC you know I'd have the celebrities in and people say all they're horrible to work with you're gonna have a terrible time and I'd find just the opposite they're very kind so\nBut the but the messages lives in the moment you know we live on our cell phones and on our computers and be with the one you love and after our stage for diagnosis I just thought she's the most important thing to me and it really brought our family closer together my one daughter is a nurse and she\nTook me through all of the medical jargon and help me understand she turned me into a nurse she very encouraging Lee one night so dead you've really turned into a good nurse and you've got this uh there's there's a chapter called the scariest drive of my life when her platelets had crashed and we drove down town but anyway that's what the books about cherish the ones you love if you're facing a difficulty\nFor all of your love into a lease on Facebook so I always enjoyed down on QVC will continue to pray for him and his family and bats are dead set has bets journey inspired you worked for ... let's talk about ... for a moment of those just joining us that was launched after ... yes Beth with them and\nMy brother in law Ron did the funeral and it's on YouTube it's called the best wheeler celebration of life service I wanted to be a celebration of life and ten thousands are thousands of people watch them but I wanted them to\nYou know get to know about and I remember when my my brother in law arrived\nUm he went into the bedroom and he sat down and he said Beth how are you doing and she said well Ron\nI'm sad I didn't want to leave anybody but I'm not afraid I Know where I'm going and she was getting glimpses of heaven I Would notice her eyes locks you know have ... yeah yeah her eyes locked in the upper right corner of our ceiling I'd say one day and said what are you seeing she said have and I said it's a beautiful she said Oh yes and then she saw her dad\nUh we had just found out a few years earlier that her dad accepted the lord before he died of a rare blood disease she never knew it to her pastor called her\nAnd one morning she was high daddy and I go back do you see your dad she got this little girl grin and she kind of shrugged his shoulders like I Know you don't see 'em but I Do not want to touch him testimony\nUh I'm gonna try to grab well I'll I'll say before the break I'm going to a minute and a half to ... years was laughing at me but uh I I did um another question I wanted to ask you then that is it's not easy though to go through the process of writing a book like this yeah because you were you living\nThe it was so ... I wrote a book years ago by a lot of great athletes I've interviewed called best seat in the house and that was easy every chapter was about an athlete but to relive\nThere were days in my office where I Would just started weeping and I couldn't write a word um they all came back and I would have to push through and say God I I Know you want me to share the story but I don't know if I can do it and\nUm he would help me get through and then there were days when it flowed but it was very difficult you know the book is a must read it's called hurricane of love you can get it and hurricane of love dot com\nIt's also available on Amazon and Barnes and noble wherever you get you get your books it's but the easiest way is hurricane of love that kind of course if you're on the air with us today and send you a copy of it and we're going to have those available for his you're putting in hurricane a blog dot com is the way to get the books by Dan we'll it's this journey with his wife Beth\nTouching moving story is racial and we're getting a lot of phone calls were and go back to those and we come back from break those there was a ministry there just launched called fearless bay\nGreat inspirational videos posted each and every morning we encourage you to go to fearless base on Facebook to a great way to get these uh is fresher moment then does those are regularly with two buddies isn't just a great ... minutes back with your calls and comments that eight hundred and sixty four thirty one done in just a moment\n[noise] are you suffering from on this pain burning tingling or weakness in your hands arms or legs it could be neuropathy and it gets worse without treatment I\nOkay there's disagreements on the ... that show and there's a fairly substantive disagreement that came in from Renton, Washington from Richard\nHe says Michael in regards to Senator Elizabeth Warren ... claim of having Native American heritage it's no different than you claiming to be Jewish\nOh really I'm not a U.S senator and I've never tried to claim any advantage to identifying as Jewish just who I Am it's the way I was raised\nHe writes the name ... Eastern European that is true ... means bear in Russian and it's also means bear in check I Believe Hungarian a Serbian I Believe a bunch of Eastern European languages or I'm On the bear that walks like a man\nNamed the vet he writes his Eastern European is not Middle Eastern origin well that's true but the most common church names are Middle Eastern origin Goldberg which is a common Jewish name they were old taken a during the exile\nAnd again this is all pretty well known Jewish history\nUnless you believe the twelve tribes of Israel came from Europe no I don't according to my knowledge of the Old Testament Abraham the father of Jacob actually ever had was the father of eyes they give us a grandfather Jacob Abraham was the father of Jacob who fathered twelve sons which became the twelve tribes of Israel that's right\nWhich upon entering the promised land God commanded them to commit ethnic genocide against the pagan is well no not exactly commanding them to kill men when children obese burden while also burning down orchard et cetera a Holocaust by all measures okay so what's the point\nI Would pay for you to take a DNA test Richard says no problem and also bet you a thousand dollars to the charity of your choice if you can show you have more than thirty percent Jewish DNA you know I might take this that\nI might take this bad for the record my grandfather who was an immigrant from Germany his mother I understand was from Poland grandfather told me his mother handed down to him a solid silver Menorah which I have a very good memory of seeing as a child during the holiday season it was always placed above his fire place\nThere were never any Christmas trees and grandpa U.S House this Menorah there was handed down from his great great great grandfather to his mother does that make me Jewish\nAnd you're faithful listener Richard okay Richard ... it it does not make you Jewish because you weren't raised Jewish you've never affiliated Jewish you've never been part of the community the point about Elizabeth Warren that was so stupid\nWas that she never participated in any American indian life she was never registered with any tried there was no tradition of Indian culture in her family\nI can assure you and I have three brothers who can help prove it or even though my parents weren't devoutly religious when we're growing up they were extraordinarily committed to Jewish life\nOr my parents in fact when I was six months old took me to Israel for the first time and we do know because my mother's family had lived in ... Germany for many many years my uncle my great uncle Julius had actually traced back to the families lineage\nTo the fourteen hundreds and an old Jewish Jewish Jewish Jewish but you see this is this is not the point there are all kinds of convert to Judaism including members of my immediate family who have limited Jewish background some but limited Jewish background genetically or ethnically\nBut they choose to live as part of a Jewish community and specifically they choose to live religiously\nAnd this is really the problem with Elizabeth Warren is she was claiming to be a diversity hire at Harvard\nShe had put this in Harvard sheet even contributed to a cook book done by the Harvard Native American community called powwow chow\nAnd her whole identification with Native American identity was phony\nI can assure you if someone has been a synagogue president for Fifteen Years or in a prior life my involvement with the with Jewish life and Judaism is pretty well documented ... by the way even though my grandmother was blond and blue eyes and obviously\nWas not a Middle Eastern origin I'm pretty sure that if I Do take one of those DNA tests and maybe I Will\nI can win that that with you will save your email and uh I'm willing to to go there with you because um I I Would turn out like most Jewish people that more than thirty percent of the DNA is identifiable as European Jewish we will be right back with them at that show\nMichael ...

your participation with it and a ... and\nAmerica on purpose advertising it with cameras into which chanting with yelling and screaming and Donald Trump is now the bad guy because he threatened to defend our country\nHe threatened to send the military to protect our country\nI Want you to think about how the media is framing this today I've been I've been watching this all day long and I just keep sitting there and I'm actually the point now where I'm not even mad about it just it just becomes so comical it's it's it's so literally I can tell you what they're going to say before they say so in a normal\nWorld in a normal\nWorld that\nWe shouldn't be living in the headlines should read if you're being intellectually honest ... than the United states America promises to protect America\nBy making sure that people can't break in the country legally it would be like a good thing right like it's like a good headline it'd be the equivalent of dad puts doors on our locks on doors to protect family from criminals who are planning to come break into your house you would be treated as a hero\nBut this is how messed up of the world we live and going in this mid term elections where where Donald Trump actually protecting our borders he's now quote threatening people\n\nThis is part of the we're going to try to make Donald Trump unhinged point seven point oh eight point to Nineteen point out whatever I don't even know what number we're on now I mean the the hunting unhinged line is so often use now it's just it's become a joke\nSo the headlines are that Donald Trump is threatening like he's the agitator he's the aggressor he's the evil one he's the main one he's the unhinged once you've sent in the military to stop a migrant caravan with that has the purpose of breaking laws in this country\nYou have to understand the the the what what these migrant caravans are doing these are illegal immigrants who are chanting and saying I'm coming to break into America and you're not gonna stop me\n\nIt's no different than someone saying we're coming to your neighbor had we're going to break in your house and we're still yourself it's not any different than that is the same intense we're going to come into your country we're going to take your jobs are going to have kids that were going to steal your health care we're gonna make you pay for it and you will not stop us and we finally have a president says ahah\nYeah I Will hold my Diet Coke\nCan't make beer jokes anymore after cabinet member that's now off limits president Donald Trump said he would send the military to block the migrant caravan heading to the United states border\nI must of the strongest of terms asks Mexico to stop this onslaught and if an able to do so I Will call of US military and close our southern border Trump said on Twitter today now this is where Trump of course became on hand just as Mrs unconscionable what he's doing the southern border how could you do such a thing\nAgain in a normal world with a normal media\nThe president the United states America the headline would actually look like and read that President United States America defends lawlessness\nAcross the border and Mexico and puts Mexico on notice that if they don't stop these illegal immigrants from coming across into this country that will cause the southern border to protect our nation's interest and\nAnd it would be ... by All right because this is what a normal president does this ... what a normal mother or father would do to protect their house or a normal person would do to protect their business I mean this is no different than\nPutting a lock on your door having a fence around your house having a ... system if you know that people are coming for you what do you do your gear up\nIf I Know that someone's coming to break into my house I Am going to get ready and I'm going to warn them that if they break into my house I Will shoot them I'm going to I'm going to gear up\nTo protect my property which is exactly what the president's doing he's protecting the United states of America our property as citizens\nNow\nAll of this I say to go back to court point here I don't hate people that come to this country illegally I've said this filling in for mark before a mini that know me I I play tennis in college I was ... almost every one of my roommates in college was someone from a foreign country\n\nMy best friend is from another nation one of my other best friend just from a now their nation they both came to this country is a student with a student visa legally\nThey didn't break can they didn't come in a caravan they didn't chant they didn't yell and\nThey love America and the both of them are still here and both of them love this country and respect our laws that make sure that all their visas and everything are in order they did it the right way\nI have no problem with anybody from any part of the world coming into America as long as you do it the appropriate and the right way and you wait in line and you do it the way it's supposed to be done I have a big problem with people that just say I'm going to break into your house because I Want your TV I'm not going to go buy my own\n\nThe president's tweet today was what a strong advocate\nFor a civilized nation sets\nIn you know you look at what the media has done the last twenty four hours Donald Trump is standing with an evil nation in Saudi Arabia\nAgain he hasn't stood with them he said we're investigating we're taking time he said the day before he got on to that helicopter going to a campaign rally ... it seems that he was killed and if that's what the facts\nThey're out there will be a very strong response\nFrom this country to Saudi Arabia more than words member don't testament of actions not words when it comes to stuff\nAnd of course they say where's the outrage from Donald Trump it's one of the most irritating things about all of this story with with with Saudi Arabia and I'm using as a compare and contrast to what we're talking about with the with how the media treating him with this caravan of ... of illegal immigrants coming to America\nYou have a president that they say must be outrage and it's an outrage left on this one story but then they say this president being outraged over the immigrants coming here legally shows that he's ... he's a terrible person they should come down and she'll be loving\nWhich one is it to the media which one is the one president that defends his country and fight since country's interests were like he's doing with these illegal immigrants Caribbean and to the United states\nAnd then when he does that you criticize him for doing its thing he's on hands these crazy any meaning evil and he's so many of these poor little people meanwhile he says about Saudi Arabia which again\nI hate that this journalist was murdered\nI also hate that the media acts like journalists are somehow more important than average people\nI'm In the media I don't think my life has any more important than anybody else listening I don't think my life has any more unique than any other person listening I don't think that my job is it makes me any more significant in society\nOr shouldn't make me any more significant in society compared to someone else is just doing a normal hard day's work and something else that maybe doesn't get you quote famer or notoriety or whatever you want to call it and the media is so self righteous that if one of their own gets tack they all come and defend and they all freaked out and they all go into overdrive over it\nAnd and the fake outrageous have you not been paying attention to the human rights abuses with Saudi Arabia do you not and realize that they have killed women because the women were raped\nThey they give lashing to women who were raped because they were sexually and pure did they just sort of how women to drive and the only reason they limited drive in Saudi Arabia is because they were taking so much heat for human rights abuses against women they're like All right screw it let's give them a license that will shut up the world\n\nEvery president in my entire lifetime\nAnd it's had a relationship with Saudi Arabia I didn't ... and Saudi Arabia has been brutal he's still in Saudi Arabia they ... they were literally take off a limb\nThey will cut off fingers they will cut off risk they will cut off arms that were cut off legs they will cut off meat\nAs part of punishment\nThey will give lashing to old people and young people in the hundreds and hundreds of lashing they will throw people in prison who are dissidents or do criticize the government they been doing that for as long as I've been on this earth and I didn't see any of this fake outrage from the media when Bill Clinton was having relations\nWith Saudi Arabia and I'm not talking about sexually I Know we have to clarify what Bill Clinton\n\nNo one was freaking out when Obama had relations with Saudi Arabia\nThey weren't riding these articles they weren't they weren't demanding more out of ... Brock Obama with human rights\nMy point is the only reason why this one has gotten headlines in as taking on his own because it was a member of the media and it's horrific what happened to him but his ... but the media who's acting like this is something we must were I mean the media saying we we demand sanctions basically because of what Saudi Arabia did to this guy that's been happening to other people in Saudi Arabia\nFor as long as they've been alive who are writing these articles it's fake outrage\nI don't like how Saudi Arabia does things\nI also know why we are an ally with them because they're extremely tough on terrorism in that part of the world and they do things that we don't do\nWe also need a place that we can lay and we also need a place that we can fire but we also have it for oil interests whether you like it or not Democrats or Republicans have agreed that relationship with Saudi Arabia is incredibly important\nThey've agreed that it's important they all said it's important Obama agrees with Trump ... Obama and Obama agrees with Bush Bush or Clinton Clinton agrees with the other Bush and the other parts of grades at Reagan Reagan agrees with Jimmy Carter we've always had these relations with them\nDemocrats want as many illegal immigrants getting those countries that can't because they know that the more that get in here\nAnd the more illegal immigrants to get into this country\n\nThe better the chances are going to have to give citizenship at some point\nThey're going to have to\nAnd they know it they don't want twelve million illegal immigrants this country they want fifty million because of there's fifty million\nCan't get rid of fifty million people you've got to give them citizenship and whoever gives a joke\nWell for\nThat's their plan that's what they want to do\n\nOne a one eight seven seven three one thirty eight eleven one eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven let me go to a ...

migrants\nMigrants are people that come into a country legally migrants I Would argue or people that actually break a don't break the law there are people that advocate for doing it the right way people that say that I'm going to break into your country and many of these ... migrants are breaking into Mexico in Mexico the reason why Mexico's freaked out over this\n\nIs because they're not staying in Mexico and they know it they know they're just passing on sort of America\nSo if you want to know why Mexico's not freaked out by this unit wimax stopping this a caravan of illegal immigrant all breakers\nIs because they know they're just passing through that's what they're doing they're just passing through\nThe president's tweet today were measured his comments were measured\nNot unhinged not crazy\nMeasured\nThey were very measured\nYou're telling a country that we're supposed to be doing trade with that is supposed to uh respect this country and clearly they don't you need to stop these people and if you don't our relationship where you would you will also be in jeopardy\nAs far as far as that a news story or whatever it is a milestone now that was rehearsed I wouldn't say I want to go as far as saying that the Democratic party at that rehearsed\nOf course they do Michel ... this is all propaganda for the midterms\nThis is all propaganda for the midterms Democrats want to come out and say we love people we love illegal immigrants we Nancy Pelosi the only time she basically gets pissed off as if you were actually advocating\nFor a ... if you were trying to be a law and order president or a law and order congressmen that's about the only time that I'm supposed to be really gets mad at you because she stands up for the illegal immigrant now the American worker she stands up for people to break the law not people that abide by the wall\nAnd then she threatens people when you get in her weight just like she did this week\nDonald Trump put out I'm In a minute ago hey down to ... you know remember when they threw a big party at the White House\nThis is coming from Nancy Pelosi\nCelebrating them passing their bill to get to get protections for people with preexisting conditions I mean she's talking right now about health care to try to move away from the other issue which is she's threatening the American worker the American family with her propaganda which is to give illegal immigrants the ability to come into this country illegally\nAnd ... and do that with no repercussions and it's for one reason she desperately need

character assassination and Brett Kavanaugh and it woke up conservatives who honestly we were kind of a sleep\nWe had a big when we think are Donald Trump's doing a good job I maybe I won't worry about voting and they woke up a bunch of you and I believe without the Brett Kavanaugh character assassination we would have definitely lost his Senate I think now we're headed in the right direction it's not over yet but I think we're at least had in the right direction and Democrats are terrified\nThat they're not going to get the house and Senate and they need new voters in this country 'cause they don't have enough right now to win this thing I mean they want I mean Hillary Clinton loss of Donald Trump\nYou don't think they're freaking out right now and they need new voters and the way to

get\nSix thousand dollars a year extra from uh California senator who got a new plan to give you a six thousand dollars\n\nLet me say first off I Am always\nIn favor of lowering taxes\nOne of about tell you about is not lowering taxes\nI Am always in favor giving back the hard working Americans more of their money this is not about giving back money to hardworking Americans [noise] this is about Democrats who are desperate\nFigure out a way to get people to vote for them\nAnd they see their addiction to government aid by the people that they represent deteriorating in a very rapid pace [noise]\nWhen you have unemployment numbers that are all time low for African Americans that is the worst news for for for any democratic candidate they need people to not be able to make it on their own to stay alive\nThe Democrats business model is half people dependent on us so they cannot survive without us therefore they vote for us it's a very simple business structure of the Democratic party if you're a Democrat is bad for business to have\nPeople that are succeeding\nIf you're a Democrat it's bad for business if someone is starting to make their own money it's bad for your business as a Democrat if that person feels like they can actually take care of themselves and their family that are moving forward you wonder why Democrats don't fix failing schools\nI've said this before we're on the show Democrats don't fix failing schools because without feeling schools\nThey don't have voters Democrats are not elected by highly intelligent people traditionally their elected by people that were failed by the public school system\nWho then have such a small skill set\nThat they cannot make it on their own without the government helping them\nI Would say the Democrats have purposely set up a public school education system and not even to indoctrinate anymore it's just about making sure they're dumb enough to need you\nTo the Democratic party fix the schools in the inner city\nIf they fix the schools and high crime areas of high poverty or they think the schools with minorities\nWere they were getting a stellar education preparing them for a life after high school whether that's through vocational training and going straight into the workforce are going to college they lose out on too many voters they cannot survive with a highly intelligent voting bloc in this country\nSo they have done everything they possibly can\nTo make sure that they are consistently graduating people that cannot succeed on their own\nThat you insert Donald Trump Donald Trump said I'm going to get jobs back in this country and he's done it will get better trade deals he's done it\nI'm going to get rid of regulations are distorting American Jobs he's done it\nI'm going to give incentives for companies to work in America and not keep their money offshore and build factories in Americans of building them overseas and I'm going to fight back on tariffs which he has done I'm going to get back to the American people more their own money which he has done with the ... with the Trump tax cuts\nI'm going to have a country that has aggressively growing\nThat it's better for everybody where where the water rises and ... ships\nInsert hardcore leftist Democrat who has I Would argue virtually no show and the reason why I say that is based on facts and the way that she tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh with no facts\nWhere she did everything in her power to destroy a good man and his family name all because in the name of politics\n\nShe has now come out with an idea that many Democrats are very excited about\nShe says that American families that are making less than a hundred thousand dollars a year should be eligible for a monthly tax credit a five hundred dollars that six thousand a year\nHundred new legislation they announce today by the Democratic party this democratic US Senator Camilla hairs of California she then went on to say that individuals making less than fifty thousand dollars a year\nShould be eligible for up to two hundred and fifty dollars a month that would be three thousand a year\nNow she said quote Americans are working harder than ever but stagnant wages mean they can't keep up with the cost of living increases that is why\nI'm American working harder than ever before right now because of jobs are good and the and the economy is good and many people went from part time employment the full time employment and wages are increasing\nEverything she just sit in that sense is is is nothing but a ... a lie and for all the people that I ever are obsessed with the fact checking every Republican and everything that Donald Trump says why aren't you fact checking her on that because that statement in her own words is why\nI'm not going to focus on that for for that that's almost like a technicality like compared to what I'm about to tell you Harris says office has she rolled out this plan today cited a two thousand Seventeen survey\nFrom the website bank right dot com [noise] that found that more than half of Americans cannot afford a five hundred dollar\nUnexpected expense such as that rent increase a medical bill for childcare\nNow bankrupt survey came out and it said there had a lot of his own survey went and found the article says just four and ten Americans have savings savings they rely on in an emergency\n\nSo what you have is you have come out of hairs are saying okay Obama phones aren't enough anymore to get somebody to vote for me because people can actually pay for their own darn phone bill now\nFood stamps or not enough because people are walking away from food stamps where we are seeing record numbers of people fall off of exams cars are actually getting good jobs where they're being employed in a great economy and they're providing for themselves government aid to keep people in poverty is not enough so now I gotta do something new I got to tell you that you still need more help from the government\nAnd I'm going to do it because of a website called bank rate dot com that found that more than half of Americans cannot afford to pay five hundred dollar unexpected ...\nLet me just explain to you how worked this logic is this idea is\nI'll go back to her first part of her proposal she said American families making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred nine dollars a year\nCould be eligible for a monthly tax credit of up to five hundred dollars or six thousand dollars a year [noise]\nAnd the reason why she wants to give me that money every month is because she says you don't have you haven't saved a five hundred dollars for an unexpected bill that could come in with a rent increase of medical bill or child care so she wants to give you government subsidized money\nSo that you making nine hundred nine thousand nine hundred dollars a year\nHave an extra five hundred dollars so that she can pay for your unexpected expense\nNow my my quick question for you is this what makes you think that if you give somebody who's making nine hundred or Ninety nine thousand let me make just in the summer correctly because I said it wrong a moment ago so people on the level of freak out so that said it wrong so all correct it right now are calm down\nYou're making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred dollars a year\nAnd you can't save for five hundred dollar unexpected expense hearing idiot\nWhat\nMakes you think that idiot who's making that much money\nIs going to take your government money and then go Oh thank you you just said me for my unexpected next expense of five hundred dollars I'm going to say that money because that same dumb a hasn't saved five hundred dollars of is Ninety nine thousand dollar a year job\n\nMemory when we had the tax credit that came out Bush tax credit member that what happened everybody took their tax money and they what they do with it they went out and bought a ton of crap and boost the economy and George Bush and those economists rent 'em or right people to save that money they got extra money they went out and then it right away\nDon't look at the stats\n\nAirs she knows that they're not going to say this money for five hundred dollar unexpected expense they're going to take this money immediately just spend every dime of it every single month on average\nThe idea that someone making fifty thousand dollars a year if you give them an extra two hundred and fifty dollars a month of the government's money which is our taxpayers' dollars subsidizing people to make under a hundred thousand dollars a year but there are now going to say that money every month for an unexpected medical bill or child care you're an idiot\nThe cool part is there were pictures of the police officer doing this heroic work that are still around today he never return from his third entry into the building the tower collapsed before he could escape [noise]\nUm that officer or put his safety of his own life ahead a
