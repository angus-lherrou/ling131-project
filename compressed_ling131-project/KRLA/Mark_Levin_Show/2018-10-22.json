Gerard EMTs they are champions of justice for the little guy\nEach week we bring you this informative and entertaining our bring clarity to the headline generating legal challenges of the day\nWe're going to touch on a lot of very interesting headlines\nBecause our guest today is attorney widely taken he is the founding partner of it can it can and cone\nHe has been trial council in numerous significant tort cases involving bad the insurance practices aviation automobiles product liability business toward litigation and actions involving wrongful death and major personal injuries\nHe is one numerous multi million dollar verdicts and settlements for his clients\nHow does he do it well we are about to find out Tom\nHi Dave be no high everybody a thank you very very much for being with

the ash and he points to the bullpen points to his left hand they're bringing in none other than our gas widely ache and is a truly\nAn outstanding lawyer\nAnd he's measured is outstanding not only by plane hits lawyers like myself and Amy he's also made sure now standing by defense lawyers who ... who he's gotten huge verdicts against\nAt the end of the day there are very few people in a in a business which is very advocacy generated when you go into these cases ... versus them that's that's the way it works\nAnd at the end of that trial even if you're a massively successful for the other side to still have the same respect and high regard for you is a very delicate skill and a widely has those skills [noise]\nThere's no lawyer in orange county who's obtained larger verdicts\nPerhaps there's no lawyer in the state of California who consistently has achieved such great results for his client and I mean that very sincerely\nHe's a he's a dedicated lawyer taking on some very tough cases you know it's very easy for a lawyer to try the case which is to clear\nThe drunk truck driver who runs the little kid on the sidewalk and well\nAnybody could try that case and do fairly well

about some of those as we go along today but why Ali very nice you to come up I appreciate you or you're being here enormously and welcome to champion [noise] um [noise]\nI was enjoying that so much time I hope when you wouldn't stop [noise] um I never thought I Would have myself described as the Francisco Rodriguez of the legal profession but I consider that a a\nHigh high compliment particularly I mean from you you can tell he was in orange county guy he's he's giving an Orange County a example for the reliever tries none of area on today that writer [noise]\nHow about this ... you mean the Los Angeles angels of Anaheim [laughter] a lot faster than I could spend you know or at least I tried it out [laughter] [noise] okay um [noise]\nWhat's going on with you [noise] ah well I'm\nDoing the same thing you're doing time I'm continuing to to practice law and it's a it is a passion and it is a love and uh so I Am continuing to do what I've done for a number of years now and ... and the most recent bang what's up with me is uh\nThe ... when we talk about corporate abuse sons Miss USA and or a arrogance a I'm a I'm representing that family ah down in orange county a whose son was killed by executive of Hyundai Corporation\nAnd a Hyundai not only a new about a hit and run incident that involve one of their corporate executives their corporate culture produced it\nAnd to make it even more reprehensible day uh\nFor three days left the family wondering who it was that it struck their son in a drunk driving incident and they spent those three days helping their executives get to the LA Airport put him on an airplane and sending back to er Korea outside the jurisdiction of the United states of America so [noise]\nAh that's kept me fairly busy and it's something that ah [laughter] and I feel passionate about and I know you feel the same\nYou know widely it amazes me\nIf I go through my legal life of the stuff that goes on out there are in the corporate world\nFrom the standpoint of what they do with their shareholders from the standpoint of a situation like you just had from the standpoint of ah doing a terrible acts and the one thing I think um my mom taught me\nBecause I used to a whole bunch of terrible acts I used to throw my socks behind the door or I didn't clean up my room I didn't make my bed and there was a whole laundry list of things and you to go to confession I so well you know you try to you know but\nThe one thing that did take place is that my mom taught me how to say I did the wrong thing\nHow to apologize when you've been rude to somebody how to apologize when you whatever it was withdrawn and Jane Gerard he definitely have that down\n... already apparently is sorely missed in corporate America\nBecause as I go through these cases like some just like the ones who described you have fewer and fewer members of corporate America saying hey listen we did the wrong thing to know if if companies were to do that\nIf companies would say hey listen or we put out the bad pet food maybe your pet since died I don't know what your legal rights are enough to can sue for wrongful death of a dog but I Know this is really harm due\nWe wanted to do something for you we first of all we promise you will never happen again we would like to help you get a new dog or we will pay for that we will do those things\nThey would go they would come off is the greatest company in America without a doubt and probably wouldn't even cost them that much [noise]\nAnd it seems to me that if as I see the acts\nAnd maybe I'm John does but I Want you to tell us it seems to me the corporate America squeezes more\nAnd more a lot of people that shouldn't be squeezed and once they're caught they have no ability to apologize while you\nFelt very strongly for years\nAre working very hard as we all have uh to see that these cases are appropriately handled\nA that as soon as the insurance industry\nUnderstand there is a duty of good faith and fair dealing and they treat all their insurers fairly as soon as they health carriers and HMOs understand that there are there to provide and protect and provide quality medical care at a reasonable price\nAs soon as they accept what is clearly an admittedly their responsibility\nThan you and I would be out doing something else maybe we could start a talk show or ugly a rod go away for a buck you know because that's how you know people get upset about trial lawyers are about litigation there's a very simple solution\nA you know Dr bake safer cars drive them bar safely uh pay claims that you should pay\nA it sounds ... but the reality is there's an easy way to eliminate trial lawyers edits eliminate the causes which makes us so necessary\nYou're listening to champions of justice with Tom Gerard even joining us in Studio today Amy Fisher Solomon are just as attorney ... and the key word for the day is passion\nOr this was a man who is passionate about not just about what he does but about why he does it and for whom he does it as well he really is passionate about protecting others\nYou know I'm finally going back to my question about Merck if you and I represent the company and we said we're on the list of everyone who's had a heart attack that's been around been struck\nAnd maybe a few of them would have had a heart attack anyway but at this stage of the game we know we gave them medication that causes heart attack that we knew it before we even so the fraud and we said we want all of you to come down\nYour with your lawyer let's discuss resolution\nIf you were young person that now can't work anymore we owe you a lot of money if you're a person in your eighties we don't know you very much and let's work it out I think that several things would happen I think the world would respect the company\nAnd I think the tab at the end of the day for Merck would be much less than probably is going to be [noise]\nAh that's that's very true time and with always amazes me is is that um there is business reasons you know set aside morality set aside what's fair set aside what you just if you just look at a good business practice\nTo sit down and work these things out and avoid the incredible expense of litigation they seem to have no problem ignoring the the victim they seem to have no problem annoying the person who suffered a heart attack they seem to have no problem ignoring that individual's family\nBut they seem to have a lot of excitement about paying huge attorneys' fees to these large corporate law firms and spending all of the money is the old saying goes millions and millions and millions of for defense\nAnd not a penny for tribute or a penny for compensation to the people who'd so desperately needed\nI Would say and you would say\nThat good business dictates that you do the right thing because in the long run it'll help your business and you'll make a bigger profit we're not against profit\nI we're absolutely in favor of seeing these companies be successful this was a great country we're strong advocates for free enterprise but you gotta play by the rules and you got to be fair and when you break the rules you should be held accountable\nOkay um [noise] we have all this bad publicity about trial lawyers if in fact guys like you are so much doing this courageous stuff\nHelping the people who've been harm\nThen why are they are all these bad jokes about trial lawyers why are there any bad jokes about corporate America\nScreened over the little guy fell over\nThe water the politicians go after you instead of corporate America\nLay it on me why only while says that this is probably two different parts of it just sounds a little bit ... into a number one to sound a little bit like a an economic question the reality\nIs is we don't have the resources and we don't have the money that we're the we're taking on special interests were taken on usually large corporations with huge amount of resources so they have the ability to advertise and towards the facts and pick out full page ads and\nAnd come up with all of these various ways of of attacking and shooting the messenger\nSo there's no question that they have had a very well orchestrated campaign to shoot the messenger\nThe other thing that we have to recognize that isn't you know we were never meant to be popular someone someone says that the trial lawyers are unpopular that tells me something I think it's very important that tells me that we're doing a good job\nWhere we are a to a ... here to afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted and nobody is necessarily going to be in favor of somebody who comes in and shakes up the pot and shakes up society\nSo as soon as we started becoming the love and liked and as soon as we start being invited into all the right country clubs and as soon as we started getting invited to all the right to cocktail parties where it's not doing our job so to some degree I think we have to look at the criticism as a badge of honor\nBut it also has to be a recognition that hopefully the public will get why is that the fact that they've decided if you wanna stop\nCivil justice system if you want to stop the victims and consumers from having their rights protected then you got to get the messenger and they've they figured it out\nAnd they've spent a lot of time and effort and money and it's like I talked about corporate culture they've spent a great deal of Madison Avenue advertising dollars to create a culture\nIn which the criticism of the trial lawyers and the criticism of the attorneys is acceptable because that's exactly what they want it\nWe're talking about media culpa then you had a case or were you represented a couple against Disneyland out of Disney handle it\nWell or the case that that you're referring to is the case that involved the family that lost their son or the the wrongful death case where the young twenty two year old boy was killed on the big thunder mountain right\nAnd and the gap in the process of investigating the case that clearly there were some people uh who maintain that train a that caused that trained to crash and cause that horrible death there were people who are operating\nThe train who could have pulled a trade off the track even though they knew it was having a great deal of of problems so again you would look at it and say okay well so\nVisual as responsible because their maintenance people left it in an unsafe condition Disney's responsible because of the people who ran the train who could have made the decision to take it off the track chose not to do so uh but that's only half the story of what we discovered was\nThat this and they had a process any program where all of the people you interviewed who ran the rights that\nAre of course we didn't remove the the trade off the track\nWe would get in trouble for that they got to turn these things over we've got long lines we've got to move these people on the train and if we pull that train off the track and it was found out not to be a seriously in trouble even though we had a strong strong\nSuspicions that there was a problem with that particular train than we would be criticized and we could lose our jobs so they were intimidated not to take the train off the track\nWhat happened with the people who were were maintaining the train these individuals were had been working\nAssigned to particular rides that's how Walt Disney\nOr when we brought this case we're on the side of the Walt Disney who do we just weren't on the side of Michael Eisner the Walt Disney when he set up Disneyland had these workers each knowing each individual rights and assigned\nTo work on that ride so it to the event the problem of course along comes in efficiency genius who says well let's just have a pool of maintenance people for the whole arc they don't know each individual ride they don't know it city of St Lucy and the maintenance people are not well trained and then of course that there's going to cause a problem which resulted in death\nWhat happened in the Disney case\nWas not only did it take a long time and a lot of hard work to get the case resolved for this very very deserving family what the family wanted\nWas an apology and they wanted Disney to publicly apologized for the death of their son and we spent more time\nTo do she adding a simple I'm Sorry than we did the amount of the settlement\nAnd that is what's wrong with our society when we play so much value on the dollar and the future dollars to be made all Disney could think of is what can we do not to impact the money we hope to make in the future even though it's our fault\nHis is saying I'm Sorry going to somehow impact the bottom line down the road and that became the negotiating point even though they knew and the evidence was overwhelming in terms of the wrongful contest that as attorney ... can and buses champions of justice what your host Tom ... already joining us in Studio today also aiming for Solomon Tom so\nUm why they we represented the little boys and it got so badly hurt on the Roger Rabbit right [noise] um the ride was such that it didn't have guards and so little kids could get thrown out of it and so forth\nAnd thank goodness alliance defending freedom has won a lot of these skirmishes and they're going to continue to do so the barrel ... case has not been settled yet\nBut you can be part of it be part of this cause and right now alliance defending freedom

issue facing the\nCountry right now is um the what happened and they are in Turkey in Istanbul at the Saudi council it or where ... was apparently murdered\nAnd mark landlord writes in the New York times Mr Trump's already acceptance the Saudi explanation that Mr ... was killed accidentally and a fistfight rather than an orchestrated hit ordered by the Saudi royal court suggests how he plans to ride out the most acute foreign policy\nOf his presidency why this is a mostly to foreign policy crisis of his presidency\nWhy is it a crisis why is it suddenly news that the SAT Saudi regime is ... and difficult and problematic and by the way President Trump has not said he said the opposite he's not said that he owed just accept what the Saudis tell him without questioning\nWith the uh mid term elections less than three weeks away and a political base more focused on jobs in the confirmation of justice Brennan capital why why people more focus on that because that stuff really matters\nAnd you can say well this matter to ... but honest to goodness this is just an indication this outrageous piece that what's\nDemocrats really want is they want to use this as a cudgel it's a convenient 'cause all they want to pick this thing up and use it politically as if Trump did something wrong Trump was and they say oh it's Trump's hatred for the press that enabled this\n... and it's ridiculous I I honestly think that most Americans including Democrats purchase smart fall for this I Do not understand how anyone can suggest this is a political issue we'll be right back on the Michael ...

sponsors and affiliates most of all all of you I'm blessed to have you been my audience and they want to thank you so I'd say I'll discuss it at the end of the program [noise]\nAh I've been observing what's been taking place obviously the past few weeks [noise]\nWe've talked about what's been taking place before the past two weeks\nThis election is so consequential because it's about you it's not even about the president to not have been about the Republicans in Congress it's about you what kind of country do you want to have [noise]\nI cannot believe that we will allow these rogue leftists to control any part of our government I Want you to think about this where unmoored from our constitutional system so our governing document\nOur constitution in many respects has become irrelevant\nSo we have to decide now if we want to live in at least they relatively free country we have to decide if our children to live in a relatively\nProsperous country or whether they're gonna be swamp with debt that destroys the economy and destroys their futures\nWhen you look at what the Democrat Party is offering Darnell moderates in the Democratic party there are no centrists and the Democrat Party I'm not talking about some of you in my audience I'm Talking about the leadership I'm Talking about the people who want to be president they out radical each other\nThey do not\nHave any fidelity to the rule of law the constitution none you hear talk about how they want to destroy the electoral college and now you hear talk about how they want to double the size of the house of representatives\nAnything the ends justify the means sanctuary city centuries cities are illegal and yet there they are five hundred of them all across the country we have a caravan of illegal aliens trying to get into this country\nThat Democrats are rooting for them billionaires on the left are funding them\nThese people literally wanna destroy our culture our civil society they've done a a magnificent job and I've gone a long way and destroying our rule of law and our constitutional system of the last more than half a century\nThe issue is what kind of a country do you want to live in this isn't a game it's not politics to you and me it's liberty attorney to you and me we have people\nWho've gone to war to fight so you and I could live in a constitutional republic and be treated as individuals and we have young people overseas in one hell hole after another doing exactly the same thing meanwhile back here\nWe're confining a bigger evil\nOne that challenges the fundamental principles of the society are foundational principles they reject them\nNo we don't vote in Fifteen days this was on us it's not even on the Republican Party it's not on the president United States it's on us be detached about poisonous idiot logically left the media\nIt's not even their fault it's ours because we know that there does testable poisonous Eddie logical left media\n\nMany people say this is the most consequential election in history it's not the most consequential election in history it's the most consequential election a modern times there's no question about that\n\nSo this is about you know this is about what kind of society you want to live and how you want to raise your family and children and grandchildren what kind of government do you want because\n\nBecause we are on more from our constitutional system it appears that Congress and the bureaucracy and the courts are free to do whatever the hell they want to do which was never supposed to be the way\nThat it is\nNever supposed to be the way that it is that we've\nBeen listening day in and day out about this this a commentator this opinion writer I'm not sure what he is really contributed to the Washington Post who is allegedly and I believe he was brutally murdered\nBy the Saudis and their consulate located in Turkey and their stand ball now that's unbelievable that they would do that\nI have been off the air\nFor eleven days more than two weeks I've been off the air and the Washington Post\nAnd the Washington Post dares to write an article last week a news article by Robert Koester\nAnd another person\nTrying to use the the murder the assassination of this individual as a way not only the trash the president United States but the trash\nConservative throughout their whispering against this guy\nThey're out there when spring against it and my name appears in the article\nWell how come my name appear in the article when I wasn't even on the air when I posted nothing on social sites when I wrote nothing when I said nothing how is that possible\n\nBecause it's character assassination\n\nThe Washington Post Robert Costa and the other reporter and unfortunately my computer's going bonkers or I'd read it to you\nThey talk about and I paraphrase a number of conservatives including she our TV conservative review TV founded by mark Levin and they go on\nTo cherry pick quotes from an individual\nAnd we have scores of individuals I work for a sea our TV they don't work for me I'm not the editor I'm not there managing editor\nI don't even manage C. R. T. V. I Believe in it as an alternative to the Washington Post and the rest of them strongly believe in and my show love MTV I'm responsible for what comes out of my mouth for what I write and say\nBut they brought me up\nThey brought me up in the context of this article and then the article because they have a a\nA service a wire service or purchase service wash the Post's were their articles go all over the place my name's start showing up at all these sites these new sites and rather than even say founder one of the founders of see our TV mark Levin they start calling me\n\nCalling me it's making comments about this this fellow who was assassinated at the consulate and I never set of what they find quotation marks around words and assigned them to me\n\nAnd not a single one of these news outlets what correct is not a single one of these new outlets well apologized for and what\nDown the road is people take what they write\nAnd that put it on Wikipedia or repeat it when they write another article about me they've done this before you look at what ... now I have like the longest entry in American history because the media matters types that think progress types the move on dot

eight or ten of them\nAnd I pointed out holy macro look what they've done the Trump look what they're trying to do look what the FBI's doing look what the intelligence services are doing and it helped trigger at what became these investigations into what the FBI and the others were doing\n\nI didn't make the stories they wrote these stories I just put them together they wrote these stores because now we know senior people the FBI was leaking to the media\nSenior people in the intelligence services were leaking to the media and the media as to knock her first\nWere writing what little leaguers were saying I just happened to notice it and put it altogether what they were trying to do is take out Trump takeout individuals with the Trump campaign take on individuals in Trump world daughter

no state income tax\nAnd many of them vote Democrat\nMany of them vote Democrat not all those of you listening to me\nYou're solid but you know what I mean many of them vote Democrat because for the imaging consequential they figured they still will get a no state income tax fulfilled their pensions not going to be a problem [noise]\nIt's so irresponsible it's so fake it ... it's it's so

there was a weekend six murders now I Know none of them were journalists are contributors to the Washington Post but who are they what are their names who are these human beings these Americans\nWho are they how old are they what are their names what do they look like\nIt's not even one minute they only put their pictures on TV what about their family\nI mean I could go on and on here\nAnd Jake Tapper does a lousy job\nYou know he pushes the left wing narrative [noise] they never ask questions related to capitalism private property rights they never ask questions\nAbout century city separation of power they never asked I it's always while he asked about the Fifteen dollar minimum wage of course Gillum supports that everybody who's tried it as regretted it\nSeattle tried it it was a disaster it's a disaster for the employees\n\nIt's a disaster for small businesses they go out of business you'd been to a McDonalds lately a seal the kiosks that they're building has to get around the Fifteen dollar minimum wage and others are doing it now\nAs well the left doesn't know how to create things the left only knows how to destroy the\n\nSo Gillum support say Fifteen dollar minimum wage you know what else he supports Medicare for all do you understand what Medicare for all means you folks on Medicare means Medicare for nobody\nMedicare for all means Medicare for nobody they means Medicare as exists today even for people who are in their seventies and eighties and nineties will cease to exist as it exists today\nBecause they're gonna put tens of millions of other people into it change the system altogether\nThey want government run top down health care\nThey can't seem to figure out how to run the Veterans Administration they can't seem to figure out how to make Obamacare work so what do the last two well they nationalize more things and they control more things that some answer to everything\nThey just don't have enough government they just don't have enough taxes they just don't have enough control\nBut it's always that way because they can't work so Gillum wants to destroy medical now he talks about medicate\nTheir eight hundred thousand people if they would just expand Medicaid in Florida eight hundred thousand people so we left six billion dollars on the table here's what he didn't say and Jake Tapper didn't bother to follow up\nAfter the first few years under Obamacare were the state's bought into expanded Medicaid and many of these red and purple states did but not all but not all red states\nThen you don't know what the government's going to contribute to the state coffers state at least theoretically could wind up paying a hundred percent of it it's not free money anyway the\nTaxpayers of Florida are also federal taxpayers\n\nBut this is what we're talking about now Fifteen dollar minimum wage Medicare for all which means Medicare for nobody massively expanding Medicaid in a state like Florida which means the people of Florida are going to be left holding the bag it's only a matter of time\n\n[noise] but probably the most remarkable thing that came out of that debate again no thanks to Jake Tapper who did a really lousy job\nWas Gillum dealing did not deny\nThat local and state law enforcement would not work with us in other words let's say you have a criminal illegal alien a criminal alien in a state prison in Florida\n\nOne of two things happens after that sentence to serve only one of two things as dissenters pointed out your their turn them over to ice and the feds to be deported or you let them loose in your communities and\nGillum refuses to turn them over to ice son he would he wouldn't wind up letting them loose in your communities is this is not a big issue to Floridians ... go\nFor you honor or requests from Donald Trump's ice agents they if they provided the pain or requests for you honor as governor\nFor Donald Trump proceed with your time\nThey won't answer them Jake that's important because that's what happens when so if you're ... the curator I work with law enforcement when they're in the system they're convicted maybe they sort of ten years when it comes time to come out there's the pain or requests for life you either turn him over to ice or release them into the community that the only two options\nAndrew will not answer the question let me let me would be willing to release\nInteracted with well of course I I just think that the show boating has MS and stop\nThere there's no show boating pal\nI found a lot of that during the course of the debate these cheap shots these are these dismissive comments showboat there's no show boating go ahead\nWhat what what would we will do is we will follow the law if you commit a crime you do that times have through the Utica tore process in a judge issued a warrant for arrest or movement into an ice facility right where I think what we will stop\nThat's not the way it works a judge does not issue in order putting somebody in the ice facility the individual has done time they've been charged they'd been prosecuted they've been found guilty their sentence they served their sentence now you have to open the jailhouse store\nIs that person going to wind up in a yellow bus a yellow eyes boss that winds up deporting that person or is that person going to walk out that jailhouse store\nAnd go into your neighborhood that's the question\nAnd obviously Gillum takes the ladder position this was a big deal it's a big point he's so radical he doesn't want you to understand the process but that's the process you turn them over to the feds to deport them ... states can't deport people\nOr they're losing your community\nSo Fifteen dollar minimum wage which will bankrupt many small businesses are chase them off and by the way is harmful to many many people who work for instance in the hotel industry the restaurant industry and so forth\n\nAnd the elimination of Medicare under the guise of health care for all and a massive expansion of Medicaid which is health care for poor people\nYou know the other thing is when you're a state that has all these illegal aliens coming in and Florida is one of them in Texas is one of them and so forth and you're saying you know what we're going to pay for all the health care and medical care related to this and and so forth and so on you're going to be attracting\nMore and more people who need more and more state benefits\n\nSo you're expanding the welfare state while you're expanding the number of people who are on the welfare state\n\nThese are just a few issues out ... odd really destroy a state like Florida or a state like Texas don't destroy as they have these other states\n\nIt's a big deal\nAnd then you wouldn't really understand it because tapper never really followed up he didn't drill down he had his own agenda and of course he brings up the agenda the Democratic party in Florida I'm just using this as an example immediately tried to paint the scientist says or racist\nWhich is so sickening and outrageous\nBut that's what they do on the left and the left being the media and the Democratic party\nThat's what they do\nMeanwhile once again you have an African American running for the Senate in Michigan\n\nAnd he's conservative and he's a capitalist and he believes in the constitution and the rule of law he doesn't get the kind of attention that Gillum guess\nWhat I well you know why\n\nIt's the the media mentality we talked about the show Gabe matter briefly\nI'm trying to figure out how this story winds up being about Donald Trump how does this story wind up being about Donald Trump\nAnd where the media get off claiming the moral high ground on human rights abuses all over the world right off our border take place everyday involving far more than one individual mostly go under reported\nNot report how many stories did they do about torture and political prisoners in Cuba when Obama was opening an embassy in Cuba very few\nHow many stories that I Do have a genocidal police state in China very few\nVery few\nWere not responsible for what took place and that Saudi conflict in Turkey of course we react to it of course we should do what we we feel we need to do in order to address it\nBut we didn't do anything but blood isn't on our hands\n\nPresident's been attacked because of his heart policies on China\n\nI told your Iran has one of the highest execution rates in the world China has the highest execution right in the world as the Tibetans asked the other religious minorities in China ask any of the political dissidents how they're treated in China\n\nAnd these aren't real trials that take place in China at all All right so what should we do\nWhat should we do\nThese are
