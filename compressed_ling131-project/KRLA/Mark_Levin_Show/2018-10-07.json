these are people in desperate need of\nFood desperate need of a place to sleep [noise] these are people who are desperate need of medicine et cetera [noise] and this organization said let's do that [noise] ah they're not in Beverly Hills [noise]\nAh they're down in Skid Row because that's where their clients are and the things they do for them for the so needy towards the homeless and so forth because truly funny\n[noise] and I wonder the opportunity to share some of the things they do with you [noise] indeed do more of them left the inner city for a while to be with the mayor's office to\nTry to give the mayor's from insiders to the problem and so forth and [noise] hopefully a little bit of solution as well but it's a it's really something\nThe head head McKee what is that um [noise] so I'm going to talk to him first\nAdam tell me a little bit about this organization that I'm very proud of knowing you're just from the outside\nAnd how they get for having us today and thank you for bringing attention to this very important issue that's a really a scourge on Los Angeles a forty seven thousand people\nEvery night in the county of Los Angeles experience homelessness that's almost forty seven thousand individuals human beings who are on our streets our in our parks ah every evening every night it's really heartbreaking number and inner city Law Center is a\nVery pleased to get to work on this problem with that show or not that's used to work on we'd rather that wasn't a problem we didn't have to work on it but it's really an honor to get to do the work that we do a it's an amazing organization with very talented individuals like Greg who's here with us today and others are very talented very passionate individuals' have come together to work on these challenges\nAt and what we're talking about today we should make sure that people understand because we are heard all across the nation we may be talking about specific for Los Angeles but what we're talking about is mirrored unfortunately in every city in our country isn't it\nThat is correct you have an enormous number of people throughout the country who are struggling to get by struggling to pay their rent struggling to stay in housing and an enormous number who are unable to do so and ending up on the streets ending up in the shelters families that have broken up because of the stresses and the tensions around that\nI was a heartbreaking situation day in and day out and you're absolutely right David plays out all across the country\nAnd and so the solutions that we talked about today they can be implemented across the country as well\nThat's absolutely right and there's a lot of good work that's being done I think it's it's a heartbreaking situation because so many people are struggling with homelessness are in danger of homelessness but it's also hopeful situation because there is more attention and more emphasis being put on this challenge and more resources being dedicated to it so it's both a heartbreaking time at a hopeful taught me\n[noise] I I think when it that they are very important and critical aspects that you in ... the problem is a perception of change that she thought that we all encounter daily\nWho we perceive as home last so often it's easy for us to say\nNo they they don't take care of themselves they want to be on the street they don't want help we're not going to be able to help them and we basically turned our backs on them and turn to turn a blind eye because care the cause of their problem [noise]\nBut what I had seen inner city jail in an instrument or late tree you add your leadership and what Greg brains is this perceptual change that no no no\nBy and large the majority of the people who has found themselves on the streets are people just like us who very recently had a job and at home or apartment\nAnd they were able to put food on the table and because of an economic acute economic problem\nThey had the carpet ripped out from under down and they and they land on that state and they just need a little help to regroup\nIsn't that true that the majority of people on the streets are out of that second category\nYeah when you think about who's homeless in a place like Los Angeles or most places the country I I make a distinction the folks who are experiencing chronic homelessness and shorter term homelessness and in LA it's around a third of the people we're almost at any given night who are chronically homeless and there's a technical definition but basically it's people have been homeless for a long period of time are struggling with serious issues\nBut the other two thirds are much more who you're talking about and short term homelessness the statistic that really brings that to light to me is that between two thousand and two thousand Thirteen and the county of Los Angeles the median rent went up by twenty seven percent and the median rents are income went down by seven percent\nShe has an enormous number of families\nWho are really precariously perched just one thing going wrong away from homelessness one last job\nOne domestic violence incident one ah illness and the family one thing going wrong and they're over that hump and they're into homelessness and it's just devastating to see the number of families and individuals who are perch just that one step away\nAnd there's a lot that we can do from a policy standpoint but then Republican standpoint to intervene and help families who are facing those challenges and keep them from becoming homeless\nAdam if you've done any good have you do have some people that for homeless and because of the inner cities and next thing you know they're they're back\nYou know Thomas ... which probably the most rewarding thing about being under the Law Center is that literally every day there are families for stay in their homes who get into homes who get access to public benefits\nWho get paid money from the slum lord to have been running their buildings from a whole host of different in a whole host of different ways we literally every day see families whose lives have changed because of the worst of the people in every state law center\nAnd it makes it incredibly rewarding to do this work in an environment that generally is pretty challenging and what we see but the fact that we're able to make such a difference in our lives lives is really what motivates us and keeps us going\nTo anybody ever come back and say hey your inner city thank you\nAll the time we have clients in them back and and thanks for the work and um we have clients come back even with very meager means will come and donate to the organization none of volunteer with the organization I'm committed it's people who are facing really serious struggles in their lives and very often doing everything they can\nUm but they need assistance and and very often they're very appreciative\nOf what we're able to do and I should add here Tom it's not just the staff of inner city Law Center who are amazing\nBut it's also we have a whole network of of lawyer volunteers and paralegal volunteers folks from your from who've come in and helped and others and it's really an important way that we leverage additional resources so will the staff of inner city last hunters incredible and amazing we could not do what we do on the scale we do if it weren't for all the volunteers will come and help us you\nAre listening to champions of justice with Tom ... maybe Solomon and our guest today you've been hearing from Adam Murray the executive director of the inner city Law Center in Los Angeles we're also joined today by the director of strategic initiatives for icy Elsie and that is\nSpiegel Amy [noise] set attorney kid Greg one of the things that is and hurt quite often when you talk to to find anything for for the homeless pattern is solvable\nAnd we need to use that money back is being taught about quite edit things that are potentially solvable [noise] talk to me talk to us about solution to this devastating problem as well\nAs you know we haven't already always had this problem in Los Angeles in this extreme away the homelessness boomed in the eighties and it didn't come out of nowhere although we acted as if it did\nSuddenly thousands of people on the street of Los Angeles that weren't there before and my response was okay well we need to get the meals and we need to get him a bed for the night as if this was a a temporary situation there and we've had thirty five years of that experience and what we've learned is that there were underlying\nPolicy and permanent infrastructure decisions that created this homelessness crisis and we weren't going to get out of it with temporary solutions we need\nPermanent policy changes that would address the underlying issue so things like I'm cutting mental health care funding I'm closing mental health institutions without replacing them with anything that is funded I'm going from in Nineteen sixty the city of Los Angeles had a a general planet contemplated ten million people\nHave to really learn to walk many of the people who are homeless walked\nCouldn't walk we have\nTo train them to walk again we have to be able to do an enabled them to walk again as an analogy how do we do that\nToday but I think it's a there's a different answers to that depending on who you're talking about interacting with I think one of the things that's very important in what grade said is that there are many pathways into homelessness and there are many pathway out of homelessness\nAnd you really have to figure out where that individual is the individual person individual family than what they need to transition out of homelessness and that's a different depending on on why they're homeless they got there and what they're struggling with now um\nBut we we see a lot of families in particular who become homeless recently for economic reasons who are either to get back into a working environment to get back to a job to get back to a staple living environment and they really just need a short term assistance to do so [noise]\nUm so they need they've had something that's pushed him over the edge into homelessness they lost a job they had an illness and the family and they just need what Brad was saying about six to twelve months a cushion to get back on their feet and get back where where they where they want to be where they're easily be\nWe see other folks who need more intensive help you don't need job training services or health services or something else to get there and so that's more came to what you're talking about us I think it's important for us to just be honest about the fact that there's also a number of folks\nWho need assistance or I'm going to need assistance for the rest of their lives or their their we emptied our mental institutions onto the streets decades ago that's really\nThat's really an issue in other words are you from the police department standpoint so much of the crime or these people who have mental issues that should be being served in that fashion and they're just all out in the street\nThat's right and the police are called out again and again to be the front lines of interacting with folks which is not ah the healthiest way to do it in the most productive way to do it but there's a subset of the folks who are chronically homeless who need permanent supportive housing in her life they need that support for the rest of their lives\nOn sets the humane thing to do I know if someone in my family was living on the streets with a serious mental health issue and needed help for the rest of their life I Would want us to provide that and everybody who's out there somebody's son or somebody's daughter somebody's family member [noise] so I think we just have to own that but that's not the bulk of who's on the streets on but it is important that we recognize the bulk\nTruly are people that have this problem and then they get out and get back and so forth\nYeah and the statistics are overwhelming on that I mean okay if I Want to know those 'cause that's really important here so so you're looking at about almost forty seven thousand people who are homeless every night\nAbout Thirteen thousand or thereabouts are chronically homeless and that's the subset where there are serious mental health issues and long term assistance if needed the balance of the other folks are mostly going to transition with the right support services back into jobs and apartments and lives as we think about them for\nA really show about thirty thousand plus you think are going to get back and so forth\nIt's even more than that that that's the nightly count right so that's forty seven thousand every night but over the course of the year it's probably a little bit more than three times that that are experiencing homelessness\nAnd almost all the difference between the two hundred thousand over the course of the year and the forty seven thousand on down each night are folks who are short term homelessness that's like putting\nAll those people into Dodger Stadium and you fill it up\nTo the norm is number of people that is I think about that at every single one of them as as a human being was literally sleeping in a shelter sleeping on the streets yeah Greg\nYet and I was going to add with Adam was saying I often I hear people say well the homeless person I Know they don't they don't want to house they don't want to be off the street they want to live on the streets and\nWhat we know is that I'm most homeless people don't want to be in a shelter or our traditional shelters have\nBeen something you have to line up in the afternoon to get in with all your stuff and there's a crowd and you you line up and people pushing job and then you get you maybe sleep on the floor or a bad but it's it's not your ideal situation some people don't feel safe it's not on the shelters have limitations about who they take and who they don't take\nSome if you um have an addiction problem you're not welcome others have religious or service requirements that they don't want to do so people with mental illness as serious issues that's not an attractive situation so\nThere are many many people who don't want shelter but there are very few people who will turn down housing and that's why that's the solution is permanent housing\nAlmost everyone will come off the street if you have permanent housing that fits what they need the other thing I Want to say is that\nFor those people that need that permanently need help and we need to accept that and its services it's actually cheaper to house them and serve them than it is to lead them on the street ... on the street these are people who are not functioning so they are\nHad serious mental illness or perhaps drug addiction of both um and they are passing out unconscious and they get picked up by an ambulance and they're taking to the emergency room and there's a police an ambulance crew involved in this tons of labor it's thousands of dollars the estimates for the the most acute\nTop ten percent of homeless people costs the county of Los Angeles about eight thousand dollars a month if we ... them to provide them services it's like three thousand dollars a month we actually save money by doing the right thing if you\nTalk about they don't want to be homeless and I've mentioned this picture before but it has a different perspective and when I used to ride the train into Los Angeles or along the Los Angeles river\nUnderneath the freeways you would see on occasion a\nLittle towns suddenly being built we would call them you know shanty towns but what occurs to me is this as I watch those towns develop those people were building their own homes they wanted a place to live it wasn't just a tent\nThese were scraps of would they were able to scrounge and they were building their own homes and their own community they wanted a sense of home of community of belonging to a group of people\nAnd then about every three months of you know enforcement would come in and just literally bulldozed the entire area and those people were gone but it occurs to me that that is a demonstration that people really do want a home\nThat is so well said Dave exactly and so they don't have the home out there that can afford or that he's addressing the needs that they have and they recreate it and the improvising and as you say it's not just one lean to on its own people start living in community they're replacing\nThat what they're missing that we have been unable to provide or we stop providing\nThat goes back to your point ... these are individual fact don't stray from their geographic location jak out stick out as they are currently living situation and ...\nIt gets out there and knew community in the same geographic location\n[noise] the um [noise] the homeless problem is pretty bad for you were talking about a hundred million dollars more from the city Kan city pay a hundred a hundred million dollars more\nSo in the current budget that cities I'm putting aside a hundred and thirty eight million dollars for the kinds of solutions we're talking about [noise]\nAbout Seventy five million or so is existing money is being moved around from what used to be other priorities and putting into homelessness in the solutions we're talking about\nIn addition they've identified eight city properties that can be sold and or are going to be used to develop supportive housing for homeless people on it so that's another forty five million and then lastly\nThe digital twenty million is a proposal for a a fee on development that would\nGo to pay for so for commercial development um perhaps residential development hasn't been fined yet but that would the developer would pay a fee for the impact of the development increasing the need for affordable housing for people who work in the delta port security and for the shops and and um [noise]\nAnd for maintenance that they need to have an a a an impact fee to mitigate that need for affordable housing so that twenty million dollars would go in this budget towards at one thirty eight and then going forward that fee would continue every year so that would be in\nA revenue source to continue to pay towards that one thirty eight after this year in addition\nThe city is going to need and the county\nOf big input of money for affordable housing development for capital for really acquiring the land and building the buildings that we don't have right now and so there needs to be something soon on the November ballot ... our preference would be such as an affordable housing bond of like a billion dollars that would help us catch up in\nThirty years of not doing enough affordable housing so we need an annual revenue stream\nAnd then we need a of a one time kind of bond for capital\nAnd when you talk about if there's a huge cost savings that comes into getting these people off the streets [noise] getting a mortgage and et cetera\nYeah this is not a one way transaction where we're just throwing money into helping of certain people this is something that's going to reduce police cos fire costs\nCounty hospital costs ambulance costs um it will make our streets cleaner property values go up what we learned is that in studies is that where we put permanent supportive housing\nFor chronically homeless people the property values go up in that neighborhood because the name of it improves these are beautiful developments that I Would live in um that improve neighborhoods this is money well spent\nAnd I look at a picture and see what we need to treat them better it is a form of ages in my career which is\nOkay awesome so you obviously usage each are planning with your patients what kind of results are they experiencing in general\nAnd increase\nTheir performance whatever they do which can be sport music work meeting the greater strain greater and greater\nGreater awareness of greater perception their life experience in relationships so it seems like it's great to this

up your ballot you won't find gas tax repeat all on the ballot and then that's going to be a surprise to a lot of folks that want to repeal the gas fact but when you look for the proposition you won't find death tax repeal\nProposition sick and the gas tax repeal\nHowever the politicians are in charge of giving it a title and describing it and they described it as you ready for that repeals revenues dedicated for ...\nI Know misleading and unfair it repeals the gas tax and the car tax and uh that's all it does but these guys are trying to claim that the monies are earmarked for roads when in fact that it's not true that if they lie is\nPut into a fund that the politicians can spend any way they want and not even a single penny has to go the roads\nAre so you're urging people to vote yes on proposition six correct\nYes on proposition ... the gas tax repeal and we need your help because we are being outspent in this election and so we need every single voter who wants to repeal the gas tax to tell their friend vote yes on prop ... is the gas tax repeal\nThan we've got a a website where people can get information including fine\nKurdish a door hangers a caller for voters in your area that website is gas tax repeal dot org that gas attack\nOr kill dot org it's very simple but yeah I can tell you this Larry if we don't get people\nIn the grass roots to be involved in this campaign we're going to be stopped paying more in taxes the politicians are going to win the mob of Sacramento special interest they're going to win and so if you ever want to win one for a tax payer\nWe need your help because the polling shows as soon as people know that this is the gas tax repeal\nProposition ... is the gas tax repeal\nThey'll want to vote yes on proposition ...\nWhat is the deal with all these endorsements some you know had chambers and die transportation groups and things like why are these sucking up at the top two shouldn't they be defending the little guy\nReally never have this is part of the problem in Sacramento politics is it the groups that have nice sounding names like the chamber of commerce or or uh or the or the jobs coalition or the association of veterans groups\nAre actually lobbying groups that curry favor and sell access to politicians and so they're always going to line up with the politicians\nWe are a grassroots movement we got over a nine hundred and eighty thousand\nSignatures to put ... on the ballot half of those came from Democrats and independents the other half from Republicans are proud of the fact that uh our donor base to get the money that we have which is you know not a lot but it it always gets or our message out came from ... twenty five thousand donors state wide\nAverage contribution thirty seven dollars he can't get more grassroots than that\nAnd so this is really David versus Goliath\nYeah this is you know the average Joe who has to get on the four oh five were down where you are in San Diego the eight to one of these freeways and are in tough it out and has to pay the the pope every time they go to the gas station and if they drive a car that uses premium they're stuck it for ten for fourteen a gallon of this stuff\nHurts but but the use of articulated wells that it actually hurts\nThe little guy even more those who can least afford fuel and they have to drive for me because of housing prices that may be coming from riverside or San Bernardino and work in orange county uh they're paying more\nBut so lonely and we just released a report last week but it's called the Grinch stole Christmas out of the car taxing gas tax hikes\nHer working families and what are the the California Policy Center did the report what they did is they looked at the average a cough and then they looked at what lower income families will likely have to pay the reason why there's a difference between the average him and lower income families\nThat lower income families tend to be what we call ... commuters they can't afford to live\nNear the job centers so their commutes are much longer\nSo they're buying more gas and the study shows that for the average family the gas tax on car tax increase just increase\nWas six hundred and fifty dollars more a year for a cheap car to drive or family or a low income family it can be up to eight hundred dollars more per year\nAnd you know the gas tax the court to act as a regressive tax in that it\nTakes up a higher percentage of your disposable income\nOr the less you make it you know it's a fixed amount that hey it really is it it hurts working families and for these politicians to say that they're ... you know they're they're fighting for the little guy that shut down below me and I want to use a stronger term\nWell I Hope if they were really doing is a you know where's the double decker triple decker lanes that would be nice if they put in I mean I could get it if we can get our so some huge Vaseline\nYou know a commuter things that we could go all the way from LA to Orange County and pick that speed up but they're not building any new lanes with his money and in fact\nThey're putting sanctions on a road diet they do actually pulling lanes and they want to put you know parks and recreation and bike lanes and other things in their place\nRight more the more people worried about the gas tax increase the the more shocked they are a people don't know not only is it not earmarked for road but it also prohibits the use of gas tax to expand road capacity that was something that the radical environmentalist in Sacramento demanded because they don't like the car\nOn and so we are also a proud of the fact that this week we released an alternative plan to fix it actually could provide two billion dollars more annually for road repairs\nAnd improvements and even the most optimistic projections under the current gas tax uh and it really does catch us up on\nAll of our deferred maintenance and that is we would dedicate a hundred percent of the gas tax to roads band a hundred percent of the sales tax existing sales tax on cars would go to infrastructure and transportation which could also be more roads and so that initiative\nI filed this week in Sacramento and it is the third and final phase of this campaign but to really shake up Sacramento not only to recall state senator Josh gym in which we were victorious and uh but now we're doing the repeal measure prospects yes on sex\nBy it but then we want you to do the replace measure and that is the transportation accountability I should have filed earlier this week\nWell that really is the dirty little secret here and I guess it's not so much of a secret to politicians have been reading\nThe monies for years and spinning and other other things and even ... brow I was up to the rally the day before they approve this thing in Sacramento and I have a recording of wrongdoing yeah we took the money that we have other things the economy was bad we had to keep serving in social services\nThey admit they raided the funds that's the dirty little secrets the other problem is currently is when you look at the pamphlet I just got mine in the mail for the electric they love to throw all the arguments in there to see what will stick\nYou know a proposition six does not guarantee the price of gas will do down and all kinds of trying to dig up some argument here that the gas companies are going to fill up the difference and keep the price high you buy\nIt but no I don't either there's one guarantee is that if a prop six loses you're going to pay higher more higher at the pump um you're going to pay between six hundred and fifty dollars you know the average family of four driving a or up to eight hundred dollars a year\nThey wait Larry when you take a look at a map cost of car and fuel taxes just in the state of California taking out all the federal taxes in the state of California we're now up to two thousand dollars of pre tax earnings are needed a for each family\nFor the average family by just to pay your ... your gasoline state tax and your uh state car tax two thousand dollars in pre tax earnings\nAre and so that's way too much the cost of living is getting a drawn to hire a out you know pushed higher and higher\nAnd working families can't afford it so yes on prop sex\nShould give working families the breathing room on the cost of living that they show a desire and and it would send a message to politicians that we are not your piggy bank is not your ATM was sick and tired of stealing our money lying to us by and and this is our little rebellion so yes I'm ...\nAnd we do need the help people cannot stay on the sidelines and expect us to ... we are out gun so you got to go on line and help out at a gas tax repeal dot org gas tax\nRepeal dot org and and you have a choice you know continue to have Sacramento politicians screw you by taking your money and not getting the services that they promise you can stand up to the bully by being part of the rebellion that gas tax repeal battle it\nYeah and as you mentioned earlier the folks lining up to pay the freight for all these commercials\nYou know the bridges are going to crumble the children\nThey're the ones the labor unions that are lining up to take this tax dollar for their people\nIs a war out there they are politicians they are you know the labor interests and they want the money they're not thinking about the roads they're not thinking about your safety again what's the website\nFor our representatives who best hold our values and so that's why I Will encourage every Californian\nWho get you to register to vote and when you registered to vote make sure that on November ... you get out there and you cast your vote because if you don't special interest is going to give you the government that they want rather than the government that you you want\nCommittee California's they just want government to stay out of their life and and so they try to stay out of government and we may do that they create an opportunity for special interests to manipulate the system and so that again I Will encourage every Californian could if you're not register to vote cleaver\nThe vote over the next couple of weeks it's really easy you can go online you can register online or you don't have to go to the NBA and way low the coaches Lee long lines or go to your ... sure voters and you can just do it on line or you'll get a voter registration card you go down to your poll make sure you vote on November six\nAnd all those representatives that bet hold your values\nAre more you're on you know when you run for office you running for something but you're also competing against another individual what about this particular race science it of course what are you facing\nWell I Am running against the incumbent hum and that's always a challenge but the thing is when the incumbent running the third works elections in the United states of America\nIt does create an opportunity a for a change in California have had some of the worst elections in the nation for ... for way too long and that's\nWhat I'm seeing that I travel around the state that people are ready for somebody who actually makes a living on elections understands elections and uh it's focused on elections not on holding a entails something bigger comes up so that they can advance their political career\nAnd lastly what about election tampering some have suggested that Russia is trying to hack well how do you feel about the integrity of our voting system\nWill ... I'm going to have to make sure that everybody understands what Russians have been hacking is not the ballots what they've been doing this hacking the voter registration jerk tempting\nTo act voter registration thirty second and so so what we need to do is just make sure that we bring into our voter registration rolls the highest level of encrypted security so that way with just like our banks we need to our game on election security and\nSo with that I'm going to thank you once again for having me on a encourage all your listeners to come to my website much more your dot com and they are gay\nAnd he used\nTo\n\n\nThe department of homeland security says it has no reason to doubt statements from companies who deny being hacked by tiny computer chips Bloomberg Businessweek reported Chinese spies had played computer kept inside equipment used by around thirty companies and multiple us federal agencies\nGiving Beijing secret access to internal network he cast released a statement saying it's aware of the report that had no reason to doubt assessment made by apple and Amazon who are both challenging report\nAn investigation underway India who spray painted Nineteen swastikas and crashed the front of a Jewish community center in northern Virginia on Saturday yesterday resident Wendy Wilson said this is a complete disgrace there is no place for hey it's it's awful you know I don't want to see it\nPeople that live here and come here regularly don't want to see it and certainly I don't want\nMy kids to see this is the second time in two years at a community center in Fairfax County has been the target of anti Semitic graffiti last April someone spray painted swastikas as well as the method Hitler was right across the entrance to the center\nHappening and whether the one's going to pick up a bit this afternoon partly cloudy skies in the mid to upper seventies right now it's Seventy ...

the state of California He's doing is right now to talk about his run for office get as good to talk with you again\nHow are you doing\n... been a a few months there between the visual run back in June and now but I guess things heat up right\nThere they're moving along very quickly um right now it's a time of uh\nThe campaign that uh you know we're out moving or if we could do it twenty four seven we do it\nYou know well let's take a little time to reintroduce you because it has been a few months since the initial campaign you are one and opportunity on the ballot in November you will face and opponents tell us a little bit about yourself\n[noise] [noise] well I was a a judge on the superior court for a period of eight and a half years I'm retired last August two thousand Seventeen or for the express purpose of running for California attorney general prior to that I was I'm a practicing lawyer and the courts in\nCalifornia for the preceding Eighteen and a half years and then um\nI was appointed by George George ... mentioned in the Nineteen eighties as a deputy director for the day State Department of social services\nA hot so why would someone want to run for a gene California what would prove you\nWell you know as a Supreme Court judge you're watching 'em and working with individuals on a daily basis you see a a people coming before you on the criminal calendar and over that eight and a half years we started off when I went on the bench with a pretty robust\nA criminal justice system that was really focused on protecting victims than protecting the citizens of California for from the the criminals\nAnd over that period of eight years I'm what I watched was the systematic break down of our criminal justice system um\nChanges such as I'm forty seven the safe streets in schools act which in fact it didn't make our streets safer and certainly didn't make our schools safer what it did do was decriminalized a drug and\nIn particular decriminalized a property crimes meaning\nIt gave us a\nTicket to the to go out and steal after nine hundred and fifty dollars and quite frankly by the time those eight years ended um I'm looking at the state of California and the direction that we're going\nAnd realize that someone has to go out and make a difference and there aren't many someone and so I put my name into the uh\nUm the hopper to run for California attorney general I was fortunate enough to have the voters of California are put in the end of the top two in June and we're here\nOffering a contrast to the policies I'm coming out from the politicians in Sacramento\nShow how do you go about the campaign of getting there what do you have to convince voters that you were the person who can do and what would you do\nWell in a number one we got to get out and meet and talk to people and you do that and several different ways that's one of the reasons I said earlier that\nYou know if I can campaign twenty four seven twenty four hours a day seven days a week I Would do that because this is a big state it goes you know from San Diego all the way up to the Oregon border from the Pacific ocean all the way to the Nevada border it requires\nThere is a multitude of reasons why he says we have a short segment on the radio show is not even worth getting into the reasons why it's categorize at three basic reasons and that as a mental health care issues drug abuse issues and economic hardship [noise]\nBut I Want to talk about a program that I have on my Web site at mercury for Congress dot com which is a very detailed plan they create federal intake centers which is a thirty day center where you bring people in your house them you feed them clean them up but you do a complete\nBattery of testing on them\nTo figure out exactly where they're out on the mental issues on drug abuse issues or are they somewhat of a normal individuals who is selling hardship and hard times who need some vocational training and or transitional housing\nAnd there's a lot of really good organizations out there now offering transitional housing and basic services for those\nWho are in need and willing to get health\nThe biggest problem that we face in the valley is the fact that LAPD and the sheriff's department cannot round people up or just bring him and it has to be voluntary if you look back\nAt the lawsuit from the ACLU was Orange County Los Angeles county they were forbidden to enforce the vacancy laws because they didn't have beds you put in so they are the only place they can go to jail while they looked at that and said that's not a criminal activity homeless is just an unfortunate set of circumstances\nBack in Nineteen eighty six when Ronald Reagan removed the funding for short term and long ... long term mental health care institutions because of the abuse and and and you're just the abuse and ... of the patients and the abuse of\nOf putting people into these centers they pulled the funding so we're seeing the repercussions of that are seeing the repercussions of the ACLU lawsuit innocent human tragedy for a community as a whole you see people on the street because our normal compassionate feeling safe they people is to help out how do we help out\nBut there's everybody is so disjointed because there's so many organizations out there that want to have there's so many faith based churches that want to help [noise] there's so many people that want to help but there's nobody leading the way\nThis is where my plan take federal money that's already been allocated by the opioid epidemic by homeless this epidemic throughout the country money has been allocated so now it's going to take leadership in a strong advocate is a federal representative\nTo do a promote a program that will create these end intake centers to be able to assess people if they need short term and long term mental health care the feds need to step in along with the state and along with the counties and give these people do such a short term and long term mental health care\nYou talked earlier about illegal immigration Mali tempered story the suspect in the case in a legal immigrant possibly in the country up to seven years we've got a challenge we've immigration and discover you know we\nWe absolutely do and this and its allies in the hands of Congress and Congress and sat there and kick the ball back and forth for decades now and it's gotten to the point where it's actually a national security issue the securing the border\nAnd Ronald Reagan tried to do it Congress failed to secure the border we gave him this need to ... to ... hundreds of thousands of of illegal immigrants here is legal aliens here and now we're at a point where we're separating families and we're doing is we're doing that it's it's a major moral uproar\nCongress needs to finally sit down and create new immigration policies but his pertaining to our neighbors in the south of Mexico Central America and all of South America we need to stop\nTaking asylum applications at the border\nWe need to have real embassies in every single country down there that people who are seeking asylum in the United states can walk into the embassy be protected at the embassy sell out the application have it'd be processes right there in if it is a true need for asylum they can be flown from their right to America\nBut we are so I think it's over seven hundred thousand asylum applications that are backlog within the judicial system in these people are just wandering around in America this has to be stopping Congress is the only one that can stop it\nWhat about the catch and release of policies that you come to this country you know breaking in our borders we catch you and then you get to have a deep before a judge they let you go you don't show up\nFor this out even a day before the judge what you're given by the uh ice in by the homeland security is a court date and they don't show up for the court date but this is what I'm Talking about the majority of these individuals that you're talking about is the asylum seekers they've been coach they've been trained said what they need to say\nThey fill out the asylum paper they're given their court they and they never show up that house to stop\nSo some people like to say it's right left issue but what drives people to come here there must be fleeing something or opportunity in this country and it wouldn't surprise me if some in the business community seem to want cheap labor\nCheap labor is what drives them here is to work for you know minimum wage it is it to work for peanuts or be abused think about it and area this is the greatest nation in the world economic opportunities here far exceed any nation on the face of the earth\nHave the credentials toward\nAt ... am I agree that this is the legalities of it but you had to question what why do they want to come here they ... what do they we think of the draw the addiction of coming here\nIt's the greatest nation in the face of the earth where you and your God given right to build ... recognized their fostered they're given the opportunity to grow and to profit off of it to have a great family now this is where Congress has finally got to tell his parents up and do its job\nYeah but some who police are open borders that we should be your somebody's struggling in the world doesn't matter come to that\nThat's just insane open borders I these people that want to open borders and I want to see them open up their front door to every homeless person out there on the street and say come on and\nThey're going to be overrun you can't have open borders on a sovereign nation you have to have controlled immigration\nBut that gets into another element of economic policies with our southern neighbors we need to create economic policies that will sustain an economic infrastructure in their countries where they will will have a a quality of life worth living and they come visit here on visas and everything else\nBut this is where again Congress needs to pull it up and do its job it's not doing it right now and this is what I intend on doing\nWe're talking with mark ... running for Congress and the thirtieth congressional district in one of his mailers she says I hear you your issues or my shoes strengthen the middle class improve mental health\nHealth care enforce law and order solve homelessness reform drug rehabilitation support our veterans\nAbsolutely you know one of the biggest things is mental health care\nIn in the district and we need to really bring the funds back to our district back to the state of California for mental health care in fact de Leon past I think it was two and a half billion dollars just stuck in court because all the agencies you're fighting over the money\nWhen are we going to have programs that are established by somebody leadership why is that it's going to give the people that need mental health care mental health care and access to it\nThe psychiatry or or ... or ... or ... organization or or field has come out and said that one out of five people in America\nNeed therapy has some kind of mental health care issue and order need some of them are minor but some of them are debilitating we seen the ones that have a debilitating mental health care issue wandering the streets you know going to the bathroom right there on the sidewalks and a half naked I you know they need help\nNoodles they're the ones that seemed like they're talking on a cell phone having a conversation and nobody's on the phone\nOr like the ones in Ventura County where the guy walked into a restaurant and there was a father a white mother and a two year old son and the whole sky walked in and stop the guy in the neck with a screwdriver and kill them where the guy in West Hollywood that you know you got chopped up by ... for buying a sandwich\nYou know the mental health care issues and a drug rehabilitation issues of the drug addiction issues are only been fostered and created to be worse\nBy the fact that they're the ones being left on the streets they're not being given how\nAnd you can't you know because of the law you can't force them into help you need to be able to change that and bring him in for how\nWe talk about your race in what you have to do and the Southern California there are more damage than ours to talk about your challenge\n[noise] I don't approach it as a down Republican issue or an independent issue we need as most people do not understand what the feds can do in their district in why because the\nFederal representation we have has done nothing in the district and that's for the entire district when you have a congressman income but that's only concern with trying to impeach president\nAnd not serve the district that he's been elected to serve then you're not getting the proper federal representation\nI look at it and say look the walk away moving hash tag walk away movement I look at all the Democrats of the old my age I'm sixty one years old anybody forty five and over that was a Democrat is going the Democrat Party walked away from me\nAll the pure organic

I was in the health food store the other day I grabbed a bottle of blueberry juice a hundred and ten calories pat twenty six grams of sugar\nIn one serving wow I grabbed a popular pomegranate juice\nA hundred and fifty calories and thirty one grams of sugar\nPer serving such crazy and that's because they're removing the fiber in the process that they use their concentrating the sugar what we do ... is the exact opposite where the hydrate and the greens at low temperatures for maintaining all the good stuff fiber is there a fighter nutrients the antioxidants\nThe vitamins and minerals the plant and sometimes it's all there one serving of purity organic choose when it was only forty five calories remember this is made from real organic produce all we're doing is removing the water at low temperatures blocking\nAnd all the good and as you just add water shake it up in the free shaker cup get it into your system and it goes to work helping you\nBuy what about the science behind these certified organic super fruits and vegetables found in the organic juice cause what does the science say about getting seven nine servings of fruits and greens per day how important is that to consume those on a regular basis and what percentage of us really get enough\nBut look at my patient base I Would say maybe it's one out of twenty seven to nine maybe I'm wrong maybe it's one out of fifty I rarely see it\nAnd the problem with that is that the science is crystal clear path studies by the thousands are done and the results are in bottom line if you eat more\nFruits and vegetables whole fully seven to nine servings a day you're going to support your focus your concentration\nYour energy your skin will look better helps the eyes the brain\nDigestion elimination it's going to support your liver fat and its job of cleansing into talks to find your system\nAlso fruits and vegetables powerfully antioxidant plus they ... the body that's so important by our allies in the body you support your bone health listen if you're a fifty plus or like me and you notice that maybe your energy isn't the same and you're not getting seven\nTo nine servings fruits and veggies you said they this is one of the main reasons you're feeling this way and that's where O.

medicine and\nThen I switched insurance companies and went to a different eye doctor and he prescribed another point that you just get it over the counter\nAnd you know it helps but it didn't really work until I got some did see eye drops from you folks\nAnd I use that along with the central craving and it seemed to be working and then uh you suggested another product that you had\nThat was for particularly glaucoma people mhm but I knew I didn't have a coma right said it wouldn't hurt to use it any way\nFor the blockage correct right\nNow because the I doctor the other insurance company said well do have Claude um oil glance that don't let the oil come down and go into your tear ducts right\nAnd so I thought well I Can't miss so I'll just try it and between that and that did the eye
