E. M. S. health education maintenance and support\nSo what the heck does that mean I mean how do you find those and that's the point okay health education maintenance as well so anything that yourself needs for their health for their education their maintenance and their support\nThey can take money out of the trust for that for their benefit and they're the decider as a trustee if it fits that definition\nSo essentially what it means is that the trust has to keep them in the lifestyle that they become accustomed to okay so that if they are accustomed to a a Toyota lifestyle\nThey can't suddenly have a Ferrari lifestyle [laughter] okay [laughter] so they have to have to live within what they were living before but you know most about that I think would be okay with that so what are other advantages well suppose your spouse is not good with money you can name a different trustee to help with that\nAlso if you had the Brady Bunch family you know if if you have different children\nAnd you want your spouse to be taking care of while they're alive but upon their death you want it to go back to your kids you can do that with a with a Q tip trust so there are lots of advantages to the Q tip trust and it can protect your spouse from lawsuits and if they get remarried\nThen the new husband or wife that that is in the picture and have no access to this money so there's all kinds of benefits that distress can provide okay so it's one for your spouse and it's called a Q tip trust qualified terminal interest property but to tips easier to say\nAny way if you'd like to talk to one of our financial advisors about your estate planning about how to pass onto the aforementioned greedy ... undeserving airs a than what you can do is you can go to our website is money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd you can click on meat with an advisor\nAnd what we'll do is scheduled time to visit now when we visit this is for those of you are over fifty who are retired are retiring soon like I said that's you when we visit we want to talk about your entire financial life not just your state plant so we want to help you with Social Security decisions we want to help you with a retirement planning decisions or income tax\nDecisions you know all those kinds of things that impact someone who is retired are retiring soon we want to help you to make those decisions and if we can help you that's fantastic will do it at no charge obligation and if we can I help you that's fine too okay so either way we will part French\nWell Dorothy it is not too wonderful to be true because it is true\nSo do that okay now\nIf you don't want to go directly to an advisor than what I Would recommend is that you go to one of our seminars okay and we have seminars near you if you can you hear my voice there was a seminar near you pretty much\nAnd uh you can find those again on our website money matters dot net at the center we're going to talk about uh several things were going to talk about you know a Social Security decisions are going to talk about how to protect yourself from the next market crash which we think will happen in two thousand and twenty\nA we'll talk about ah do you have enough money to retire on all those kinds of things we will talk about at the center or some money matters dot net for all of the above\nWell you know what Jack I cannot believe that the show's over already well ladies and gentlemen I Hope you've enjoyed it as much as I have enjoyed doing it for you will see you next week same time same channel by by everybody\n[noise] telling them information presented should not be regarded as a complete analysis\nOn the subject and should not be construed as an offer to buy or sell any of the security mentioned none of the show's content that first alive investment by a professional advisor Cindy can solve them in more implementing many of the strategies presented time\nNothing investments in malls varying degrees of rent and therefore getting no insurance any specific investment strategy will be suitable profitable for a client was only a tax\nState planning information offered on this program is general in nature always insolvent attorney or tax\nNational regarding yours legal accentuate\nSounded ... should not\nBe construed as an endorsement of ... or and then W.

know that there are safe and secure waste as steady abundant income for all the years of your retirement\nHi this is David Ortiz from David Ortiz advisors I worked with a husband and wife worked in a school district and for the county office of education and way back in Nineteen Ninety One we created a plan so he could eventually quit work and collectors pension\nBecause he was several years older than her and to be able to go into a ministerial capacity in his church\nAnd then for her she would retire when she reached retirement age the question was what would it take for them to be able to retire and still maintain their lifestyle while they're not going to need that portfolio until they're in their mid to late seventies their life is in their control at this point so what's your situation comedy\nAt eight for four five eight four plan that's eight for four five eight four plant plant smarter live better paid for four five eight four plan that aid for four five eight four planned I'm David Ortiz and I work for you\nIf you want to show your whole listen to this then is prayer here Vic more carrier we're more carrying realty will guarantee the sillier home for one hundred percent of the asking price or she will pay you the difference while many real estate agents will promise to sell your home for the price you want the fact is\nMajority of homes sell for a price to fall short of what shows have been what to believe six one hundred percent of asking price guarantee solve this dilemma when you called the mark Harry and he'll prepare a total market analysis of your home\nWith CDs money markets whatever not very good as it [noise] so we're ... we're left out in the cold trying to figure out where we can get a a reliable consistent spend double income that we want to live on our house is now just to go back a little bit in September of eighty one to a few years ago [noise]\nTenure government yields were Fifteen point three two percent of those good old days fifteenth point three two percent when you love some of that today down by September Nineteen Ninety deal was down\nDown to eight point eight nine percent\nBoy you'd run to the bank in a hurry when you you'd give up every stock you got to go get eight point eight nine at a bank that's guaranteed by the government\nWell by September two thousand was down to five point eight again down say that with tongue in cheek down only a five point eight percent today the tenure level yields are about to point Ninety percent because the Federal Reserve keeps the rates low and that's after raising the rates three times this year\nWell today you put a hundred thousand dollars in the market with a to point Ninety percent right you're going to get twenty eight hundred and forty dollars\nThat's done of around Fifteen thousand in the good old days on a hundred thousand so it's getting tougher his it's tougher to find that certainty of return on your money without taking significant risk and then you take the word certainty out of the deal Scott [noise]\nSay a recent Gallup poll when you got to kind of read these polls depends on what they say and the question but you know we have something that source of information revealed in about forty nine percent of people don't expect to have a save enough money to live comfortably in retirement\nNow Americans already had a poor track record of saving why how do we know that is because the average for one day as a hundred thousand dollars or less on it you can retire in a hundred thousand dollars folks so we've done really bad planning for retirement having away\nAnd you're simply overwhelmed with the choices that are out there who do you trust\nBecause of the low interest rate with guarantees you'd take risky steps and there's no guarantees just hope that's the problem is and that's how much risk do you want to continue to take now [noise]\nIt kind of have to take control of your future\nWell how do you do that well you take care of it while you're still working and still have the ability to put money away\nNow there's about Seventeen and a half trillions of dollars in the U.S private pensions more than twenty five percent of his personal Myra accounts now in case you don't know there was a meeting that was together about says six years ago or so it was a secret meeting in New York\nAnd it brought all the people from the insurance industry all the big wigs big companies and the government sat down and said you know what we like to do with like to take this pension money and confiscate it this is a true meeting that nobody ever got it because the press wasn't and invited\nAnd what they want to do is take all that money give it to the insurance industry to create an annuity to create an income like Social Security\n[noise] that would take the the that self directed Ira out of there with that because that can be very simple are very complex deal nor deal to figure out what you're gonna do it well the government wanted to fix it\nThey want to take all that money and pay off the national debt which at that time was about what the money that's in those ... those retirement plan as well today it's a little short\nBut it would cut out six hundred billion dollars a year of interest to fund or pay for the cost of the debt said people think this debt some kind of phantom number\nWhat is it it's bonds folks it's bonds its government borrowing money but somebody bought the bond you did in your pensions or somebody else bought it in the pension they're getting paid in interest out of the tax payers pocket\nThat's what they are so the way we get rid of it let's take all their pension money and let's give it to the insurance industry or some other entity to pay it off a good part of it and then pay you an income and when you die they keep the balance that's what was proposed by mighty government just several years ago folks\nThat's the kind of things that are being bantered around today\nWhat do we call them democratic capitalistic socialistic entitlements what do we call that it's dangerous who you put in charge folks because it's kind of stuff as being bantered around quietly behind your backs now let's talk about taxes\nLet's say the tax rate is twenty percent in retirement that's what you'll pay on withdrawals from your traditional Irish\nWell to have to take it don't you\nSee you must take it because it's forced taxes when you're Seventy and a half you have to take the money what do I need it or not and they get to pay you get to pay taxes on it so you don't get to keep what you take out that is a problem is that\nPart of it goes back to the government so you'll save the money for years you know have your water cash hopefully and now you're going to create income from it to retire on her supplement Social Security or other things and you have to give some of it back\nIn fact some of it has to charge taxes on the Social Security 'cause sometimes you don't have any tax on Social Security but when you start taking your retirement it jacks up the income where it now causes eighty five percent you're supposed to be taxed\nSo now you turn tax free stuff as a taxable and you get back some of it which are taking out so you only have a net of less\nNo brainer folks but would that be a with our current tax rates are at the lowest they've ever been in a century the lowest our national debt is enormous and growing\nThose in charge and federal government shows no signs of raining in any of this spending quite opposite they're adding to it and the population is aging our national infrastructure requires urgent inexpensive repairs and so there's all kinds of bad news out there\nWhen taxes go up having a Roth IRA means you'll be eligible to ignore the taxes going up\nA no brainer folks if you could get into a Roth IRA\nYou're going to beat the system in the future you're not going to mess up your Social Security first tax ability and you're not going to pay a pound of flesh of what you get in retirement back to the government so my advice is if you can do so because it's a no brainer [noise]\nNow according to the Centers for Disease Control people who were sixty five years old last year two thousand Seventeen likely live well into their eighties\nAnd in fact if you reach sixty five men can expect to live about another Eighteen years and women in additional twenty Twenty one years so you got another Twenty years folks if you're sixty five that you have to deal with your finances are you going to do that what are you going to do and what do you do if you haven't saved enough I guess you got to keep working huh [noise]\nSee it's widely accepted again these rule of thumb that you'll need to replace between Seventeen Ninety percent of your retirement or pre retirement income\nTo maintain the standard of living that you know\nWhat are you going to do\n[noise] you've got to have money to continue to pay for housing so your house is paid for say pay taxes so that the maintenance and insurance um got transportation cost healthcare that gets worse as you get older\nA false we got food all the little things like that or insurance or pay for those insurance payments uh and then you've got other stuff you know cash for things travel entertainment those things don't go down when you retire they really don't\nYou just don't have to spend two hours on the freeway going to and from work but you have to do other stuff other stuff\nStop how are you going to pay for all of this how are you going to cover Seventy to Ninety percent of your current income if you're still working\nAnd if you're not what do you do next for do we go see we have the uh [noise] what we call the the inner circle of need for that I refer to it [noise]\nThey've got the pre sixty five or pre retirement that's the five years before retirement and the five years after retirement [noise] that's the time that you better be settled in and ready to go\nThan if you're not\nYou're in trouble it's called you can't retire but you will eventually because you're going to get sick and then you can't work and you're still level as expensive as\nNow who do you listen to what decisions do you make\nWhen you're at or near retirement that five year will be four or five year after is going to be critical peer comfortable retirement years so when we come back we're going to talk about where you go who you trust or what do you suggest we should do things I Want you to suggest to me you're the one that has to make the decision I don't\nI'm already retired I have enough money to retire [noise]\n'cause I managed properly I've set it up properly so is that well maybe we can share when some ideas so when it

and that was a twenty three percent loss in two thousand and two [noise]\nBoy that hundred grand went away and in it and you lost two thousand dollars in fees and two thousand another Seventeen hundred and Seventy four dollars in two thousand and one another Thirteen almost fourteen hundred dollars and two thousand two and when they failed to make any money well that doesn't sound fair\nWhy should they charge me for failing but they do that the U.S every year it doesn't go away and some of the same money so when you make more they charge more when you lose they still church how does that work\nOut to be fair well\nDoes it go through this cycle when you get past the ... the Nineteen Ninety nine that first two years a hundred thousand dollars up to about a hundred and fifty one thousand bucks\nA funny thing happened on the way to the back the next three years it was down down down kept being charged feces phase and by two thousand and seven you finally got back to where you were

how much did you lose to the one and a half percent fee that would've been charged every year well\nIt turns out that of that two hundred and Seventy five thousand five hundred and seven dollars you'd have had the last forty five thousand three hundred and twenty four dollars total amount of fees over the last Twenty years at one and a half percent a year he lost over forty five thousand of your two Seventy five\nBut we're not done how much money did you lose on the earnings of fees say if you didn't have the fees that money would have made the money to get you the two Seventy five but you lost earnings on the forty five also so over the Twenty years it'll last another twenty five thousand dollars of earnings on the face\nSo the total fees that you lost over the last Twenty years he was in the ... the banner to follow it down to two hundred thousand\nHe lost over Seventy thousand dollars folks\nTo fees and the earnings on the fees over the last Twenty years it's not a small amount of money has it\nNow another thing that you're told his that in the last Twenty years and they tell you before they start subtract indices bet your average total return was eight point seven five percent\nWell how did they get to that eight points since it sounds good as he points them fight every last bit of an CDs a lot better I feel good\nBut how do they get to that they take the hundred thousand you put in originally this attractive from the two Seventy five gross that is a hundred and Seventy five thousand don't abide by twenty\nThat comes up to eight point seven five percent is that really the rate of return you've averaged over the last Twenty years no because these took away a good chunk of it but it's also a bogus number that the investment community continues to use all the time it's called quote total return\nWhat is total return it's bogus Scott real what's real is compounded folks when you want to make money don't you want to interest on your interest don't you don't you want our names on your interest you want to compound so this eight point seven five which they all do and it's a lie\nBecause you don't understand how they came to it they just tell you we may point seven five and it's true on a simple rate of interest the actual compounded rate is a little better than five percent\nWhat do you want five or eight point seven five I'm selling a mutual fund I'm gonna tell you the point seven five and I'm not lying to you I'm just not telling the whole truth compounded interest is how we calculate isn't it to the last ... years ago and said you have to know what the compounded rate is when you buy when you borrow money\nNo longer the simple rate of interest but the investment community continues to lie to you by telling you the wrong number now if it was a little better than five percent average will last Twenty years compounded how much is it really when you have to subtract the fees\nOver the last Twenty years following the recipe five hundred\nWhen you subtract the fees and the earnings that you didn't make on the fees are compounded rate of return is three point six percent not real exciting is it\nIt's not something to get you just motivated to run out there and go buy some more funds does it it's not going to get you you know they're not going to hear if you don't hear that stuff on these programs do you you don't hear what the consequences are being charged a bunch of fees so let's see we got a hundred thousand dollars\nTwenty years later at two Seventy five five o seven as according to the U.S and the performance average return total attorneys eight point seven five before fees of one and a half or so we've lost forty five thousand to the the last twenty five to the army's on fees that's less than Seventy so we reduced the real return to five point one five simple interest\nThey don't want to buy verbal news anyway\nBut this is the kind of ... any crazy upside down nonsense that he wasn't aware of because the professional was an amateur first of all putting them in is not in this nonsense and then in turn having a fee that exceeds the gig tend to what\nWhy why is this this way because the professional wasn't very professional but it gets better the story gets even better\nHe also has a similar annuity with access you\nKnow knock on the company's it's just the people that are selling it's another variable annuity which has again is about two or Seventy five thousand dollars in [noise] now last year two thousand Seventy it's in the market to spread around and bonds and large cat stock Smith capital to diversify his last year as return was ten percent\nBut the S. and P. did almost twenty ... produced half\nThis year a year to date through September thirtieth it's a five percent to check we have some peas up over ten so far here today so it's making less than half\nWhy why is that for for me to half of what the market actually has done because there's yearly sees a to point three four percent we just talked about what one and a half of the money what do you think two or three quarters that's going to do here well this year it's going to take out sixty four hundred and thirty five dollars just for fees whether it makes money or not\nAnd if it loses money because in both cases this is variable annuities the man wants to retire he's got all this money into variable annuities that have no certainty of outcome\nNow they have a guarantee there's a death benefit guarantee that says if he should die suddenly then his beneficial or see the highest point anniversary point the whole ...\nWhoopi but what if he's living another Fifteen or so years and has to take income from this stuff\nWhat good is this guarantee doesn't guarantee him anything the market takes a hit the money goes down the ability to take money up those down when you're Seventy four years old folks do you put all your money in this kind of basket\nWhere it can't make money when the market goes down doesn't protect your money from the market going down and accelerates the lost by charging a boatload of fees which will kill the performance of the policy is doing just that it's performing about half\nOf what the market's done\nThis is nuts this is crazy this is bad management not on his part he's a professional another another business this is not his expertise but the people set this up as an obligation their folks implied as it may be not required to advise them direct\nAnd they put them in this kind of garbage and that's what it very well in that he's turned out to be star beach not if not in maybe garbage if you have them it's garbage\nWhy is it garbage because it alternatives what if this individual had been instructive properly and put into oh no equity indexed annuity\nWould they quality cap quality performance over the last two years of his accent contract it's made again Ken and five in a market it's up to thirty five percent or thirty percent it's made half\nThe index product the proper design would be up twenty six percent over the same period of time\nAnd no risk to the capital in the future it can't give back the earnings or lose it back into can't lose any principal now I'm I'm an advocate of index and then it's not always but in this particular case it would have worked out much better for him and it would have put him in a position where you cannot lose any money ever again because once that added in it's guaranteed\nIt's not maybe not if it's real it's real money\nWhy are people getting the message that you don't have to gamble your capital when you're at that retirement zone in that five years before or five years after retirement age\nWhich is it and what are you doing with your principal or just let it slide taken up ten percent of it and everything's fine yeah it's been pretty good for the last ten years since the end of two thousand eight when is this a parade in\nWhen we started getting hammered with the market for a while\nAnd you know when you have a lot of record timeframe you're going to have an offset probably won't be just six months or year there'd be a trend that may trend down for three or four or five years could where it's going nowhere and the fees are eating you alive and you're taking the money out so you have less and less and less\nNow he's taking ten percent up\nThat means in ten years you know having left unless the market that's awfully well then what are the odds that this market's gonna keep going the way it has over the last ten years\nA record period of time for an up market why would it go down well the Federal Reserve is raise interest rates three times that tends to make the market a little uneasy tends to make it go the opposite direction higher interest rates that could happen is happening how much more they got to do [noise]\nWhat about political consequences what if we have all this infighting carrying over for another two years or maybe six years who knows [noise]\nDoes the wall street like this uncertainty in the market on certainly politically that we don't know what's going on or somebody some Yahoo in Washington decides that we had to raise your taxes now I have to take away that tax cut and they get in position where they can what do you think the market's going at the tax cuts are basically abolished\n... goes back to whatever see it's Only Temporary isn't it it's not permanent but that tax cuts it's been a major part of why the economy has flying\nBy digests digress costs that are going to do that are they they're not going to have people reversing a good thing or are you how do you know you got US Senators senators folks that are proposing legislation take forty percent of the gain of corporate America\n[noise] that's right here to get forty percent of the game should go back to the community should be charged against the corporations because corporations are evil they only supplied the jobs they only put people to work\nAt a profit school back in the community anyway and salaries and people spend their money in the ...\nYeah but you've got a senator that's a high up or folks proposing that and again how does this look at the government get out of debt what do they do\nThey raise your taxes what happens to the market of taxes go up the taxes go up the market goes south it's that simple\nTest market doesn't like that because the consumer has less money to spend which means there's less profit for business was less things to go out and buy that were coming up for Halloween Thanksgiving how much money you spend it for the turkey and ham and what have you done a whole hog and as you are aren't you\nWhy because you have that extra money in your pocket\nWhat happens if it's taken away what happens to the market but I'm not a guy that proposes a rogue estimates what the market does not just simple practical common sense you take more money on the consumer's pockets less profits to buy stuff you end up with less money for companies to make to pass a law to re sell us all this other good stuff that's happening\nWhat are you going to do and what is it you're going to have to spend when politics dictates what you're gonna have left over and what are they going to do to you don't know but if it turns into a negative\nThe market's headed south if you're in retirement folks and you're relying on your money to pay you a stipend of income to pay your bills and be comfortable you do not have any reason whatsoever to put the majority of money in a place where it can go down\nBecause once you start headed down you can't recover because you don't have the money left in there you're taking money out as the market's going down you're going to run out of money unless you cut back on your living\nCut back on what you're taking to live up\nA few folks I can show you until you ought to do with the right way or you can keep going to the seminars lives Dubai mission of what you need to know that just we can do this and we can do that but there's no certainty in anything they're telling you not think I'd like to do and certainty myself\nBills or certain living too long a certain for most of us what are you going to do to

was approximately sixty years old\nToday how long are people living but I understand that the centenarians people turning one hundred and over is the fastest growing age move around and it's nothing today limits your late eighties or mid nineties or beyond\nAnd if you retire in your mid sixties and you live into your mid nineties well that's like half of your adult life lived in retirement and it's really coming up on the point where people are living longer in retirement than when they even work I'm Still running out of money today\nIs a big concern and I read somewhere recently that the number one fear of retirees is no longer the fear of death but actually the fear of running out of money before that\nSo I think there's a legitimate reason to be concerned about your money and running out but I think whether you're concerned about your job or whether you're concerned about your health or they're concerned about your kids are grandkids in the direction they're going\nOr whether you're concerned about running out of money or your finances in general the bigger picture boils down to one thing that all of these have in common that make your concerns turn into fear\nWhat is that it's not knowing\nNot knowing what direction things are going to go that's what turns into fear it's okay to be concerned but it's not okay to let your concern turned into fear so that it consumes you and takes away your joy and causes inactivity\nSo that you live your life reactive and not proactive\nAnd when it comes to diseases we talked about a minute ago if you find out you have some kind of\nIllness I don't have to ask whether you're going to be proactive and go get medical treatment of course you're going to do that and when it comes down to having job and security I don't have to ask you if you're going to just sit around and wait till the inevitable or whether you're going to go look for a job or start asking around of course you're going to do that\nAnd if you're worried about your kids are grand kids of course you're going to be proactive and do what you can\nBut yet I find that most of you when it comes to your money and the concern and fears that you have with your money do absolutely nothing and a part of my mind\nBecause the fear comes from doing nothing and if you want to learn more about this than I've got a book called toning financial planning right side up written by Jeffrey small just a dear friend of mine\nAnd he talks about how you can develop a plan so you don't have to worry about running out of money\nAnd if you want to copy of this book I've got a few copies laying around ... office now and I'll make sure you get one the numbers aid for for\nSeven eight eight call again the number is eight four four seven eight eight call we're not going to put you on air we've got operator standing by just leave your contact information and one of my staff or get back to your next week and we'll make sure we get one of these books in your hand\nI Can't tell you how many times they get someone in my officers in their sixties or seventies that makes a statement something like you know I should have done this a long time ago oh Thirty years ago I should have got a financial advisor\nAnd yet they didn't why because of procrastination that's it really nothing more complicated than that they just for crossing that it\nYou know if you've got cancer you're not going to procrastinate right if you're going to be out of work so you're not going to procrastinate but when it comes to your money I find that people don't give it a lot of thought\nThey just keep doing what they're doing over and over hoping that things are going to work out\nAnd then they get to retirement and they make a statement like oh I Wish I would've and then they get in the late retirement maybe it in the eighties I talked to a lot of people that are in the eighties that say oh I Wish I would've known you what I was sixty because then I could have land on living this long and I could have actually had a plan and not let retirement happened by accident\nAnd let me ask you do you want retirement to happened by accident or do you actually want to plan\nDo realize that fears go away when you have a plan and if you're sitting listening to this\nThinking that deep down inside you have some fears about running out of money or fears about how your accounts are invested or whether you're going to lose money and the next now crash and guess what I can tell you you don't have a plan\nBecause if you had a plan you wouldn't be worried about it if you knew what the high degree of certainty that you weren't going to run out of money before you die how much less fear would you out\nThere would be nice to be able to go to sleep and not have to worry about it right\nAnd all you have to do is develop a plan a plan to make sure you don't run out of money\nBut what if you don't know how to develop a plan\nWell do you do any time you don't know how to do something else you want to do if you don't feel good you go to a doctor right if you pay too much money in taxes you go to an accountant right if you're worried about your job you start asking around for employers that might be looking right you'd take some activity and you'd be proactive and you find yourself\nSomeone who can help you find yourself a financial advisor your trust ... guide you through your concerns and help you set up a plan so that you can sleep at night because you never have to worry about running out of money and yet you have to be careful because I find that many of my clients come to us because\nThey're concerned about what their financial advisors or telling them why because financial advice today as a whole lot different than it's been in years past I got to tell you in the past years it's always been buying whole not buy and sell and frayed by an whole\nBuffett has had to buy and hold doesn't work in the market like this\nAnd it's a great way to lose a lot of money the next time the market crashes and then you hear about things like the rule of four percent right and the rule for presents a decades old rule that was started back in the mid eighties that basically as a rule of thumb that says you can take roughly four percent of your portfolio\nAs a withdraw each year and be able to adjust for inflation and really never have to worry about running out of money and this rule has been around for decades\nAnd it's been followed by many\nWell recently the last few years Morningstar just dunk to that rule they basically said that regardless of the structure of your portfolio between stocks and bonds you can't afford to take more than two point seven percent out of your portfolio each year otherwise\nThe chance of running out of money is significant and yet a lot of advisors today are still following the old by an old theory and\nRule of four percent theory and unfortunately they're leading their clients to a path of running out of money if they live long enough\nAnd I got to tell you what concerns me and if it concerns you and you want to find out about a plan that can put you on the right past in retirement so you can sleep all night and not have to worry about running out of money but I've got a book you've got to get your hands on\nIt's written by good good friend of mine Jeff small and it's called turning financial

three is called why you should get out of the market and it's a very common sense a book that\nWill probably turn your thinking right side up and help you to be able to develop a plan that will

Kennedy intelligently said at the time to fix the roof is when the sun is shining will the sun is shining right now we've got a great marketing integrate economy many of you listening today have leaky roofs in your investment in in your retirement plan\nYou just don't know it yet because it hasn't been raining financially speaking for over a decade now so now is the time today's the day for you to seriously look at what action you should take to protect your money and your retirement like taking positive\nAnd appropriate action\nSo let's just get right into it the five things you should do to protect your money in retirement number one make sure you're putting enough money away\nWe used to be a TV commercial that said what's your number [noise]\nHow much income you will that number generate you remember that commercial that what your number I think it was I N G or something like that they were walking around with these big numbers and his said you know I Need a million dollars any three million dollars whatever the number was that number alone isn't enough\nBecause it's how much money that number your nest egg of a million dollars so you need a million dollars to retire some people don't have\nThat you have to do with what you can do now the other thing is what about losses see everyone's looking at what the what the number is what the goal is what about if you lose that money what we've seen since the year two thousand to market declines of over fifty percent\nThe real estate broker to thirty five percent hit [noise]\nBecause when it comes down to the old Ben Franklin team any probably never heard of this but it's a big looks like a tea and on one side of the tea is the income side and the other side as your expenses and as your income greater than your expenses walk for a lot of people who and you're working sure and that's where you should be putting money away for savings [noise]\nBut when you retire that paycheck goes away is the income from your pool of assets at the bottom of the tea\nAnd the number one answer I get is when I Need the money\nI'm Sorry that's the wrong answer she's Seventy five percent of Americans rich or poor suffer from something called financial anxiety\nOr worried about money and the reason they suffer from financial anxieties they don't have a plan for generating the income they need in retirement [noise]\nLot of people are just investing for growth hoping he keeps on growing till they need the money but if you look at retirement logically what you're really trying to do is create an income stream\nTo cover your expenses to last your lifetime ... income stream has to replace your paycheck\nTo try to take income from a growth investment but it depends on the whim of the stock market or the real estate market as to what is doing when you need the money\nWho's a thing called sequence of returns you're drawing from the stock market today you know you retired now you're probably okay for a little while because the market keeps going up so you think okay this is a great plan\nBut if you keep was wrong or if you start withdrawing at a later date with the stock market's falling income spoiling things are going down then you're compounding your losses because not only are the market's going down but as you draw money out you'll have less money 'cause you're selling the losing asset\nAnd unfortunately it could be really scientifically show that doesn't matter how much money as you can run out of money and perhaps sooner than you ever thought possible\nThere really doesn't matter how much money I forget you think well got in a few million bucks oh depends on your spending and if you're drawing down in uh down market because all you have is gross\nIt's now about growth\n[noise] she
