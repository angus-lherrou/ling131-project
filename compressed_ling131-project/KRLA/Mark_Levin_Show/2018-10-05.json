I haven't read it yet I Want to read it to you\nI was deeply honored to stand at the White House July nine with my wife actually and my daughter's Margaret in lies to accept President Trump's nomination to succeed\nMy former boss and mentor Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court my mom Martha one of the first woman to serve as a Maryland prosecutor and trial judge my inspiration to become a lawyer sat in the audience with my dad had\nThat night I told the American people who I Am and what I Believe\nI talked about my twenty eight year career as a lawyer almost all of which has been a public service I talked about my twelve years as a judge from the U.S circuit court of appeals for the district of Columbia circuit often called the second most important cart court in the country and my five years of service in the White House President George W. Bush\nTalked about my long record of advancing in promoting women including as a judge majority my forty eight law clerks have been women and as a longtime coach of girls basketball teams\nAs I explained that night a good judge must be an umpire a neutral impartial arbiters who favors no political party letting our policy\nAs Justice Kennedy is dated judges do not make decisions to reach a preferred result judges make decisions because the law in the constitution compel the result\nOver the past twelve years I rules sometimes for the prosecution sometimes for criminal defendants sometimes for workers and sometimes for businesses sometimes for environmentalist and sometimes for coal miners in each case\nI follow the law I Do not decide cases based on personal our policy preferences I'm not a ... for pro defended judge I'm not a pro prosecution of pro defense judge I Am a pro law judge\nAs Justice Kennedy showed us say judge must be independent not swayed by public pressure\nOr independent judiciary is the crown jewel of our constitutional republic the Supreme Court is the last line of defense for the separation of powers for the rights and liberties guaranteed by the constitution\nThe Supreme Court must never be viewed as a partisan institution\nThe justices do not sit on opposite sides of an island they do not caucus in separate rooms so I've said repeatedly if confirmed to the court I wouldn't be part of a team of nine committed to deciding cases according to the constitution and laws of the United States I've always strive to be a team player [noise]\nNow during the confirmation process I met with sixty five senators and explain my approach to the law I participated in more than thirty hours of hearings before the Senate Judiciary committee and I submitted written answers to nearly Thirteen hundred additional questions I was grateful for the opportunity\nAfter all those meetings and after my initial hearing concluded I was subjected to wrongful and sometimes vicious allegations my time in high school and college more than Thirty years ago has been ridiculously distorted my wife and daughters have faced violent and violent threats\nAgainst that backdrop I testified before the Judiciary Committee last Thursday to defend my family my good name in my lifetime of public service\nMy hearing testimony was forceful and passionate\nThat is because I forcefully and passionately denied the allegation against me at times my testimony both of my opening statement in response to questions reflected my overwhelming frustration at being wrongly accused without corroboration of horrible conduct completely contrary to my record in character\nMy statement and the answer is also reflected my deep distress and the unfairness of how this allegation has been handled\n[noise] I was very emotional last Thursday more so than I've ever been I might have been too emotional at times I'd rather my tone was sharp and I said a few things they should not have said I Hope everyone can understand that I was there is a son and husband in that\nI testified with five people for most of my mind my mom my dad and my wife and most of all my daughter's\nGoing forward you can count on me to be the same kind of judge a person I had been for my entire twenty eight year legal career hardworking even killed open minded independent and dedicated to the constitution and the public good\nAs a judge I've always treated colleagues and lead against what the utmost respect I've been known for my courtesy on and off the bench I have not changed and will continue to be the same kind of judge I'd been for the last twelve years and I will continue to contribute to our country as a coach volunteer and teacher\nEvery day I Will try to be the best husband died and friend I can be I Will remain optimistic on the sunrise side of them out and I will continue to see the day that is coming up the day that has gone\nI reviewed the constitution I Believe that an independent and impartial judicious raised a central direct constitutional republic if confirmed by the Senate to serve on the Supreme Court I Will keep an open mind in every case and always strive to preserve the constitution of the United states and the American rule of law Brett\nKavanaugh to beautiful lot bad won't matter one went to the Democrats or the media\nAnd the three Republican stooges are really wing their own careers and positioning themselves and don't give a wet about judge Kavanaugh his wife his kid George parents [noise]\nYou know several times the judge mentions in this op ed the constitution and therein lies his problem\nThe reason he's hated by the less the reason is under attack by the Democrats [noise] the reason the media went with gossip and rumor and really defamation is because his declared support for the constitution they do not support it\nThey do not support the constitution except protect the free press part because they think it protects them\n[noise] but when it comes to the constitution they trash constitutional originalists and ... were throwback stops you know unless we embrace the progressive agenda and and trying it\nAs a constitutional matter there by rewriting the constitution was nearly five justices\nThan we justice Kavanaugh must be destroyed it is the constitution that gets in the way of the progressive agenda don't you say\nIt's the constitution that they despise\nThey make no sense whatsoever when they talk about the constitution when they talked about precedent when they talk about precedent we know I suppose that they must embrace Dred Scott ... plus and they must embrace Korematsu that's precedent\nIt's precedent that was rejected as precedent the case of Dred Scott it took a civil war to undo it the case of plus it took fifty eight years to undo it\nCase Korematsu it still hasn't been done\nThose were activists judges who did not follow the constitution of the United states\nThat's why this is an important debate they insist on abortion it's not in the constitution so they demand precedent they insist on their entire social agenda there environmental agenda\nAnd so I don't like this notion that Christians should ... should sit idly by while the secular left destroys our liberties destroys our way of life destroys those sacred values that that underlie another guard all of our freedoms\nAre and we can't just at some Christian some passive Christian suggest\nWe can't just pray and ... got to do it all of course we pray and we'd put it under control but he put us here for a purpose we didn't just we we weren't just placed on earth to pass it by standard we need to be active and there's nothing incompatible between Christianity and political activism as long as we are acting in accordance\nWith our principles and that's what I think we try to do and I we have to fight the last as hard as they buy that we don't wanna be as dirty as they are but we do have to be as relentless and has ... chance ... and that's what we need to do and yes they have nothing to fear for much we have a lot to be concerned about in terms of what they would do to us if

S. M. C. A. as presidents calling it\nMisses now John sorry and making make back for example be alive and come back and true here in the United states over a million a factory jobs now being created and President Obama if you remember that that could not be dust that may actually it was done in this country\nYeah and and what is bizarre here is a again they not only want to raise taxes or they want to kill Medicare and effect because when they're talking about one third of all the Democrats in the house or co sponsoring a Medicare for all bill\nRight what happens to our whole Medicare system if you get into a situation where you're giving Medicare to people who are sixteen and twenty five and thirty a instead of reserving it for the senior citizens of actually paid for it\nI mean I go visit this uh this is one of the biggest thing that we have to talk about the nobody is actually talking about the thank you for bringing us up this Medicare for all the expected caught for that is thirty seven trillion dollars\nThat's ... billion trillion so thirty seven thousand billion dollars I\nMean it's it's it's absolutely over ten years right that so there's no way to that sustainable what's going to end up happening is Medicare for all the medical center nuts right as far as I'm concerned is going to be the same thing that happened with Obamacare you're basically setting up something\nThat can encode on it because they can get not survive that way for gotten ... eventually go back exactly where the Democrats want to go which is a single payer system period\nOkay right now the these congressional races are so close I I Do want people to get involved and you can get involved by going to tax cuts work dot com it's a great source of information and engagement\nAnd getting engaged is the crucial thing one of the points that people have made is that\nOne of the impact of this whole cabinet thing as a lot of Republicans who are kind of sitting back and enjoying some of the economic good news and some of the good news on foreign policy we're just taking it easy they weren't particularly excited or worried about this election time they get excited don't you think\nMichael absolutely I mean one of the things you've been around obviously a while and then re election season something called the October surprise I think the October surprise here is that the Democrats are priced themselves have this whole thing Kavanaugh thing blew up in their faith\nUm and and we're going to say that it was the other guy for example the past week alone I think we've seen that not only in the state by state level but across the country\nHave closed up almost entirely and so you know people are very upset with what went on there and at the end you know honestly this entire election Michael we weren't work hard I like the big choice election fight and voters are going to happen to make a big choice or going to have to vote for Republicans can build on this economic opportunity right\nIn can improve the lives of nearly every single American or they can vote for the Democrats with a promise to raise our taxes and throw really standing in our ears in this economy made it a choice really frankly it's clear\nI Am ... and again it and be especially clear because what you are voting for your voting for people like Maxine Waters would become a committee chair in the house if the Democrats have ever Maxine\nWaters the committee chair\nAnd and Jerry Nadler of New York he would be head of the house Judiciary Committee and he's already promised to try to impeach Brett Kavanaugh um look but we we are about to win I think this weekend a big victory on\nOther Brett Kavanaugh matter if it's crucial that we follow through and use this momentum to win a big victory in November and job creators network is helping with that go to tax cuts work dot com\nBecause if you want to protect small business if you want to protect some of the advances some of the

I was right behind the podium at the time that he was shot and\nAnd uh in the Ambassador Hotel and I was Nineteen years old this was a gigantic experience in my life and it's of course both of those things that I remember most clearly\nBut this story the bus boy whose name was one Romero is particularly haunting ... he was an a Mexican immigrant\nOf the Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegation show here at the Chuck Schumer\nSexual assault allegation show we facilitate Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations because we believe that the Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegation show that all allegations are important\nWe believe that all Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations are important\nWe believe that all Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations are serious and most importantly we believe that all Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations should be believed healing happens here at the Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegation show\nIf you would like to join the Chuck Schumer sexual allegations Joe\nYou may he'll by calling eight Seventy seven three one thirty eight eleven\nAll right so hey what a weekend it spent huh what a what a few weeks it's been\nA it is your southward a friend Bryan mud in for the great one Markel of him and by the way because there's always one\nThis is not the place to share your your Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations that people are nothing by now you go directly to the FBI and you demand an investigation and then be sure to look over their shoulder and tell them how they can conducted all throughout the course of that investigation\nBut [noise] the the absurdity of the situation is that Chuck Schumer lifestyle my uh was joining you couple Tuesdays ago and made that statement earlier in the day\nBefore we even had the hearing last Thursday\nI Believe her and that's what this really was all about that is what does it really was all about Don ... out about the Supreme Court not about crossing for is about what kind of country we're going to be what kind of country\nA desk would end up representing in a world in which someone as distinguished has incredible\nAnd you know otherwise clean as Brett Kavanaugh if he can be taken out of the highest levels of justice\nWhere alls corrode the moment that somebody comes out of left field with an allegation actually sure to a very personal story with you and I received stories from across the country and believe I'll responded to a to all of you\nWho who shared their stories about extortion about threats about people that had done bad things to you and here's the the good news and the bad news\nThe good news and the bad news of this situation is that we're not scored in this country\nThe bad news is we're two votes away today from being screwed in this country so it's a big time wake up call and a reminder reminder about several things for example\nIt's a reminder right now that if you are in Chicago and you're a cubs fan and you're a left us wow it must suck to be you right now must really sucked to bill in fact if I were you I won't even joked about what's the point what's the point you know the same\nBut it's also a reminder that we are right and and that's a line that fine line and I got a message for you if you are familiar with my work then you have hurt me talked about the premise and the premise is what out right off of I Will never embrace the\nFalse one and if you build anything on a false premise anything built upon it is indeed itself going to fail for example when you are Chuck Schumer and you say hey you know what I Believe her you have no evidence you have no testimony of nothing I Believe her that's a false premise and guess what yellows\nBut we all do so that's the the first the most important thing the second is that there are two sides to stories\nIn one side effects now you're the facts and it's something that drove me crazy crazy crazy crazy last Thursday and bless her heart\nSusan Collins who delivered a speech and among the things I never imagined that I Would be saying at any point today one that\nOh my God Chuck Grassley Jews left who\nGoes by those funky\nAnd Susan Collins Susan Collins this afternoon delivered the most remarkable speech I've ever heard a senator deliver\nWho the heck happened near\nGotta gotta lotta interesting interesting things going on but in the context that there are two sides to stores and one set of facts that Thursday you had so many people including the aforementioned Susan Collins who is unbelievable today\nWho said that you know what she was really credible really credible Christine forward you know really believable and ah you know so it was Brett Kavanaugh how many times did you hear that from people\nBut yeah you know they both were known and we're not no they were not going to be right somebody was lying\nSomebody was committing perjury someone testifying last Thursday was really really committing an act of evil\nAnd that person based on all the information available ... see filled out people are treating her with kid gloves but in this moment where by eight to vote margin we're advancing to the final vote tomorrow on Brett Kavanaugh approximately five o'clock eastern time\nIt's also important that Christine Ford saying that she is one hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her\nThat she is not allowed to just went off into the sunset is though she never made those claims now there's not going to be any accountability there's no way in the world of the the Senate Judiciary committee is going to pursue her for perjury\nThey should they should there should be a full investigation of her\nBut as long as I have an opportunity to do so which she did it's an act of evil Christine for trying to ruin a man's wife said she is one hundred percent certain providing witnesses none of which corroborate anything she said it's wrong that's wrong and it's important\nNow when we are confronted with the axis of evil in this society be false accusations by someone like Christine forward they are called out for what they are and she is made to to have to account for what she is which is a perpetrator a woman who committed an act of evil\nBut there are some folks that go yeah but she might really be a sexual assault victims okay it's ... I'm not saying she is and possibly a sexual assault victims let me ask you\nIf you have someone who is a legitimate victim of sexual assault and they go out in the murder somebody down the line are they not accountable for that murder because they were a victim of sexual assault somewhere in their life\nThey absolutely are held accountable for murder right what was she tried to do to break out and I am one hundred percent certain\nIt was Brett Kavanaugh was she not trying to effect of early ruin that man's why his family's life\nHow evil do you have to do that so I don't care if she was a sexual assault victims somewhere along the way does not give her the right\nTo do what she did and it's important once again and we don't just wide off because break out it's going to make it through this thing\nAnd ignore people who are perpetrators like Christine bored\nBecause there will be others we ended up a thorn in the\nBiggest issue we could have had in this country which is due process just go in the way of uh I don't know oh Chuck Schumer's credibility for the Chicago Cubs season I'm not trying to rub it in by the way I'm just pointing out that if I were a leftist in Chicago I wouldn't show up to vote because I mean just by\nYou know not and things aren't going you're way right now in ... what's the point\nBut that's where we are that's where we are we're on ... razor thin edge and if you are someone who believes and right and wrong if you are someone who believes in the constitution if you are someone who believes in the premise then we all need to acknowledge what happened here\nAnd who the perpetrator was and recognized in our own lives should those people come about the bay as well will be called out to be made accountable for who and what they are\nNow\nA couple of things are just getting warmed up Happy Friday by the way\nIt really has been that kind of a wake estimate that kind of couple of weeks to cut up three months I mean shoot pretty much only Clarence Thomas and and understand what Kevin has been through an emotionally doesn't know it was kind of feel like we were through another election here but his whole cabinet thing is a pretty emotional deal because there was so much on the line\nBy the way I mentioned on ... uh yourself for the friends\nI don't want to show my home station W.

wonderful day and are getting set for an amazing weekend it certainly has been an emotional time and no doubt that we're going to have must see a TV going on about five o'clock eastern time tomorrow as the final vote or should take place approximately around that period of time but at this point\nGiven that Susan Collins made her speech made it clear that she is\nGoing to be voting against foreign Brett Kavanaugh and then shortly after that Joe Manchin Democrat West Virginia\nWho is a Republican and waiting at this point I mean I ... it seems like it's inevitable at at this point the mansion is going to go and make the move maybe I after the election of but he is a he said that he is also an board so I'd be it absolutely appears that there are the boats and in fact something that's interesting that developed out of Alaska\nLisa Murkowski voted no Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no she did not want to end debate and again if debate did not end today basically Gavin I would've been dead that've been it right there at the procedural votes today absolutely critical to with her voting no\nUh you know she has come under heat\nFrom her constituents on the right\nAnd what's interesting I when you take a look at that in context is the way they've been gone about it not screaming not protesting not people they're chasing her down in elevators but there have been a lot of folks\nThat had been to lighten up her office or with phone calls them know how concerned they are there have been some pretty good pieces put out including one by the wall Street Journal that was amazing pointing out that hey you know if Lisa Murkowski or to have an ... year the ninth\nCircuit court of appeals\nWould be kind of the final say if you end up having basically this split court and you had significant decisions that would impact Alaskans the Ninth Circuit ruling ultimately if by there weren't a decisive decision that the Supreme Court that would stand for all Alaskans seems like Lisa might now actually be reconsidering\nHas taken a look at the most likely outcome here or it looked like it might be in that fifty to vote range and I we might end up there even though we were fifty one forty nine today now something that I have tried to lean on from a point of optimism throughout this process\nIs the positives that can be gained from all this\nHow many people knew how many folks were on the Senate Judiciary committee until the past couple of weeks\nI haven't known many I I mean even you and the suit listener somebody who cares and is engaged in you know but they were Twenty one members well I mean okay so twenty in Spartacus but did you know how many members of the Senate Judiciary committee there were\nWe learn that right I mean one small detail but for many folks because we don't teach civics in school this has been an opportunity and cabin on the ...\nOr ... that man when he has been through and and having a backbone of steel so see this thing through holy cow incredible person definitely a role model a role model that we could all point to\nAnd that's ultimately what I think Brett Kavanaugh's role it's twofold one\nI think he taught history by what he went through during this process and having a whole new generation of people engaged and paying attention\nSecond thing is I think we have a new role model that we can point to one of the concerns of course has been well you know Trump's going to Trump Donald Trump has been an incredibly effective president the United states not necessarily the best role model right\nBut if you want to introduce your kids or somebody\nThat seems to have all the right for priorities in the right places they just the right way doesn't back down when he's faced with adversity you absolutely can point to Brett Kavanaugh now\nHow many folks necessarily knew how many Supreme Court justices their war before all this yeah I'm sure you did but a lot of folks have learned that\nThen she said the Susan Collins said but to hell with it how voting for him anyway [noise]\nGetting kitty hitting in\nFact um it was one of the more interesting moments during the course of her fifty fifty five minutes speech earlier today which I guess it was\nI Believe the best the finest\nI have ever witnessed the United states senator delivering are just incredible incredible definitely something worth your while if you did not catch it early early early earlier today easy for me to say by the way I buy it in for the great one more call to your friend here in South Florida\nI Do a morning show on WGN out west Palm Beach a mid morning show W. I. O. D. in Miami and always an honor in a pleasure to be here with you know one of the things about Susan Collins during the course of her dissertation\nYou might have found some moments where you're wondering huh\nExpert capital really the conservative I thought he was the really the constitutional aside I thought he was not so sure already I mean that was held good her depiction of Brett Kavanaugh was health thorough investigation was\nAll the folks she interviewed I mean she laid it all out there just remarkable and uh you know it might have some some questions about how he would end up rolling on things like say\nFor life matters and there is an important point within the pro life conversation here as well\nBrett Kavanaugh\nPretty evident being the good Catholic Boy that he is he's pro life right\nBut does that necessarily mean that he brings that philosophy to the bench and doesn't doesn't necessarily it hasn't as she pointed out based upon us some of what he has rolled on and stated previously\nAnd when we're traveling down this process you're learning things that you never would have otherwise known about Brett or about\nThe level of the investigation that took place with Susan but also what obviously was not done by so many other senators and this is where it's instructive\nFor you with the folks that are in your neck of the woods you are senators how did they vote I'm here in Florida Marco Rubio ... voted in favor of ending debate today will vote for Brett Kavanaugh tomorrow got Bill Nelson he voted no\nAnd by all accounts will vote no again tomorrow night he happens to be up for reelection this year he's up against our term limited governor Rick Scott who has been no less than the third best governor\nDuring his seven plus years as governor and the state of Florida just remarkable what he's done\nA but he's in a real horse race against Bill Nelson who's already served three terms in the United States Senate in Florida could be fascinating to see how this Kevin ... plays out here\nWhat I'm looking at and I've had a bunch of people ask me this during the course of the week and I don't know the answer yet I'm Still trying to figure this out is this an inflection point in American history everything we're going through right now\nSo I Do these weekly series for my local shows and it's all about where we are politically based upon historical analysis\nAnd for the midterm elections I'll give you the Reader's Digest version we tend to be incredibly incredibly predictable in terms of political swings in this country the issues change the politician strange times change\nBut we have been incredibly incredibly consistent in our decision making a walk you back real quick to the president's election twenty six same\nI've done this for years for years are going back to the two thousand cycle but it was most notable and twenty sixteen when I was able to effectively and accurately depict Donald Trump winning the presidency\nBased upon the electoral college and the way I was able to do it just based upon historical trends\nSimply put you take a look at history back in a twenty six team we had a full term Democrat who was president there has still to this point in American history never been a full term Democrat who was succeeded by an elected Democrat not ever\nAfter eight years we tend to have enough the only time it has ever happened many Democrats as he did a full term Democrat was Truman after FDR he inherited the office yes he later ran as the incumbent and one\nBut because of that we tend to be incredibly consistent in all\nDuring the primary process especially here in Florida folks were asking me with Rubio running isn't Rubio more electable Trump's winning this can't be good this and that\nJust like vote for the person you believe in because the odds are the Republican candidate what when\nAnd sure enough there you go now in the context in mid term elections you're probably aware that the incumbent president's party loses generally in fact there was only been three times three times since we had the two party system which started in the late Eighteen fifty is\nThat the incumbent presidents party has actually gain seats only three times and they each happened with an inflection point in American history the first time was Nineteen thirty for FDR was president we had the great depression\nThe second time Nineteen Ninety eight we had the bill Clinton botched impeachment effort by Republicans\nBudget boy American history and then the next one came for years later two thousand to George W. Bush in the wake of nine eleven so it took the great depression\nNine eleven\nAnd the botched impeachment of Clinton to bring about the president's party gaining seats\nThe average outcome in mid term cycle is that the president's party will lose four seats in the Senate thirty seats in the house it's just the average outcome happened this year Democrats regain control of everything now\nThere's no chance whatsoever that Democrats will gained four seats there is a better chance at this point the Republicans gained four seats the Democrats\nAnd Republicans are almost certainly at this point going to retain control the Senate map favorable for them Heidi Heitkamp has pretty much done herself in in North Dakota she voted no today and what we've seen ever since she indicated that she was like would it be a no vote about\nTen points about ten points with the with the different than her race in North Dakota and she was already endanger their Claire McCaskill of Missouri voted no\nShe already was trailing slightly in the polls likely to end up being a big time issue for her and the Joe Donnelly in Indiana same deal voted no these are all big Trump stakes than you did have Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted yes Joe Manchin by the way is almost certainly going to be re elected on back of this\nYou know when I've been taking a look at for ... how much this vote meant and those particular states\nAn average of about ten points ... or nay because those are pro Trump\nBroke Kavanaugh states\nSo the Senate almost certainly going to stay but still the house you take a lot of getting it if you check any of the polls he checked decide to take a look at everything right now does not look good for Republicans looks like Republicans are pacing somewhere in the neighborhood of about thirty losses which will be enough for Democrats to take control the house\nBut I continually have people say that they just don't see that happening they don't see it happening they don't see it happening\nAnd my question is and this is what I'm working on because again I base everything off of information are\nAnd then plug some point in American history is this number four is Donald Trump as a catalyst just him being the disruptor as president of the United states then this Kavanaugh situation is that and now I guess to what we went through\nAnd any of those other examples not the great depression\nNot after nine eleven but if you're looking for a ... he absolutely could point to Nineteen Ninety eight ... there are so many similarities right now booming economy to what's going on right now in fact our unemployment rate is much lower than it was a Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd you have the president well he's not as popular as Bill Clinton but then again he actually isn't specifically the issue here except that they made him the issue right\nWe've had the more investigation we've had to get Trump effort since before he even took office\nThat would certainly do it hasn't risen to the level of impeachment yet because Democrats are not in control the house that could be analogous your throat cabin on the mix maybe that is too\nSo this is all something that I'm working on right now is there a chance that Republicans really might gain in Congress this year\nIs this that moment in time than inflection point in American history where things are different\nHistorically Ninety two percent chance that Democrats win more seats than not this year but there was an eight percent chance that they don't for a reason are we in that window will continue that conversation coming up next I'm Brian mud and for the great one month\nSeven percent movement top to bottom in terms of public opinion on whether or not we should confirm Brett Kavanaugh that that is really what we're looking at here those are the people that are persuadable but seven percent\nEncompasses a bunch of elections across the country usually voter enthusiasm is exaggerated because only sixty four percent of eligible adults or even registered to vote in the first place and what you take a mid term elections well I mean typically have around forty percent they actually show up to vote\nSo we do tend to often bake a bit too much into butter enthusiasm this and that\nBut it absolutely has the potential in this type of environment to make the difference which is why it's absolutely critical you want to make a difference you get your butt out there and get vote but you find those seven percent\nYou use this potential inflection point in American history and you get out there and you're trying to make a difference because we do have a different landscape it's not all day or in the polling in the in the top level numbers that are discussed yet\nBut it has the potential to be and we're a little more than a month away so that is what you're in store for you get out there make a difference if you're inclined unlike those\nAngry people that were a paid and and shouting that Joe mansion kind of winning hearts and minds at least I don't think it's going to winning hearts and minds there is this window of opportunity a moment in time potential inflection point issues that matter more that never met her before in mid term election cycles so what are you going to do with it\nAnd uh I Do I Want to give you a heads up on something that uh you definitely
