break in the case over the weekend I shouldn't say break a revelation to break in the case up in a long time ago actually but the revelation over the weekend by Congressman John Ratcliffe has been doing a tremendous job um exposing along with Devin Nunes ask Mark Meadows Jim Jordan and various others\nHave been doing a great job of exposing the a disgusting\nGovernment corruption in our intelligence community or department of justice in at the upper level management the FBI in this scandal to get Donald Trump now folks are here's what happened this week it let me put it in context for you for a moment for those of you\nI don't know seemingly missed the story somehow I don't know if you've been out in bars or whatever for the past maybe your space travel and\nIt's like that Bruce Willis movie or what was that it with Ben Affleck where they're drilling into the asteroid you've been gone [laughter]\nTo Donald Trump team was spied on by the United states government there were Pfizer warrants issued to spy on the Trump TV may have missed some of that but that is what happened in the FBI is given conflicting accounts repeatedly of how exactly this investigation started that sit in a nutshell so very wonky case\nThe my book as extensive footnotes audit even by I use liberal footnotes to that way to liberals can't repeat what they said in the past on it but\nThe cases very simple in its essence ... opposition political party from Donald Trump bronco bomb in his White House weaponize the intelligence community and in some cases law enforcement community in case and the FBI the upper levels in their management chain\nTo go after the Trump team that's it\nNow why am I bring that up now and that's it give you like oh what's great what else is there a lot to talk about I'm bringing this up so that break this weekend makes sense [noise] Ratcliffe unleashed they just a torrent of information to Maria barn Romo show on Fox News and that at Arizona on the weekends\nAnd if you think about that that's just an almost unimaginable amount of money he has given at least two billion dollars to charities since his\nInitial a cancer diagnosis and the charities have been so wide ranging and for the most part so noble pull gee Allen philanthropies\n... has been emphasizing the environment including preserving or some some wilderness areas and in global health and help\nIn with diseases like Ebola\nBut he's also had more local\nFocus and and this is one thing that I wanted to to speak about particular it's very unusual for somebody to basically grow up in a place he was born in Seattle his father was one of the chief librarians at University of Washington\nAnd he grew up here and he came back here and he's had just an enormous impact on the city almost all of a very very positive it could have been more positive one of the things that I first admired about Paul Allen is he was pushing a plan called the Seattle commons\nWhich would have been a terrific sixty one acre park right in the middle of the city where it would have replaced\nAnd a a bunch of warehouses in a very fairly rundown area of town with a great green space coming back from lake union\nAnd uh and then that would have been surrounded by housing buildings and office buildings in any event it was turned down in a city vote a right the same year that we we arrived we moved to Seattle city vote was incredibly close\nAnd but it was turned out and so now there are lots and lots of office buildings in that same area many of them by the way developed by Paul Allen's company Vulcan\nBut he built the museum of popular culture which used to be called the experience music project he was a huge fan of Jimmy hendrix who was a Seattle boy\nAnd he wanted to commemorate Jimi Hendrix originally then this developed into this big museum with a controversy old building by Frank eerie some people hate the architecture's others love it\nHe um owns the Portland TrailBlazers down in Portland and the Seattle Seahawks\nHe developed the Allen Institute for brain science and the Allen Institute for artificial intelligence she also has this other very cool museum it's called the flying heritage in combat armor museum\nWhich is a collection of vintage military aircraft tanks and other military hardware yes a living computer museum that he built the the point about this is that so many people have the idea of why don't we take more money away from rich people pull out had more money than he needed\nAnd the answer the energy and the creativity and the love with which he spent his money\nWas a a true factor about the the success that he had with these various projects and most of them were quite successful and they made a difference the notion that the government could have spent this money better\nThan Paul Allen I think is fallacious\nHe should rest in peace his sister and his other survivors should be comforted and his memory should be a blessing [noise] okay

strong evidence of ancestry now and the series of events that unfolded yesterday you had the Boston Globe that I Believe was the first to kind of lose their board over the\nStairs she has a Native American and I don't think they actually ended up really looking into the whole thing they simply don't why she she's got an evidence\nThat the Boston Globe even miscalculated battling\nOnly by a factor of about a thousand how much NATO blood she may have in her but they weren't the only wants to run with it is is CNN they ran with it to you here's an excerpt from story there's yesterday\nSenator Elizabeth Warren has released a result of a DNA Analysis showing she as Justin Native American ancestry and an apparent attempt to preempt further questions and attacks\nShould she run for president in twenty twenty\nBorn first face scrutiny for her purported Native American heritage during her twenty twelve center rights but president Donald Trump has revived an apple of by the controversy as he eyes weren't as a possible liable frequently mocking her with a name Pocahontas\nBut Warren has now been documented in obtaining documentation of backup per family lore and Mel assist of our genetic data performed by Carlos Bustamante get all of that name to write Bush to monitor\nThe name of credibility a professor of genetics at the upper end and advisor to ancestry and twenty three and me\nAnd a rollout video what bell warns heritage the Massachusetts Democrat as seen sitting behind a laptop as she calls bustamante\nNow the president likes to call my mom a liar or and ask him\nWhat do the facts say a bustamante a response back suggesting you absolutely have a Native American ancestry in your pedigree isn't that the way that humans talked to one another by the way\nI'd agree is that when we're usually like talking about a breed of an animal not this is just\nI have never in in the context of this conversation and whether it's in my family or with somebody else and talking about their answers for your your pedigree and told me about your your pedigree so anyway bustamante talks of her pedigree\nWarranted show nominee bustamante for report now\nPosted on warns website along with others supporting documents in interviews detailing her background according to the report\nOh this is just kind of a minor detail here the majority horns identifiable ancestry is European ... however the report it however the analysis also identified five genetic segments\nAs Native American in origin at high confidence bustamante is analysis places warrants Native American ancestry between six generations ago with a report estimating generations\nUh okay say go get something here\nThis is where the Boston Globe and their their mouths\nReally got off track by the way\nReally got off track trying to figure out a the the six to ten generations okay so if maybe there was a little bit of a Native American thing going on let's say ... generations ago what would that equal here\nAnd the answer Elizabeth Warren as it turns out is more lily white middle Whitey white folk like perhaps you and me\nThat is what the experts have actually been able to find after they dug into the report on our website ...\nAll throughout the course of the day\nI have heard from my my friend's ... in in South Florida as I've been talking about this and the noise continues to be allowed out there and social media and it is fascinating the doors of knowledge on this particular subject that seemingly the average left just want to be socialist\nActually has about Elizabeth Warren Connelly received a question why is it why is it that this was even\nYou well the first thing happens to be she just made in one again [laughter] and she was already ill nobody told her to go out there and get all actually President Trump did President Trump did in fact uh do you have\nThree ready [laughter] [noise] [noise] think of a [noise]\nGreat [noise] five\nA let me think about that one [noise] they face or life on being a minority [noise]\nOh God that is they always want me to apologize for saying it [noise] and I do I want to apologize all you understood I Apologize for you [noise] [laughter] oh God is that long\n[noise]\nProblems you know that name because even the liberals who say they get\n[laughter] there you go to the testing always entertaining and Russians Donald J Trump president of the United states at a rally back in July she taught test so she's the one who put it back out there you you have to wonder\nIf they think that the president prompting her like that you think she was\nTest and then you you figure she's supposed to be ideally educated right when you actually like try to figure out exactly what the results of your test would mean before you go out there and say yeah you know I'm a I'm jerky here it is and then there's ... ...\nActually no you are a wider than the average white folk here in the United states\nJust saying oh by the way but that wasn't the best smack down the ball now in the in the grand scheme of of entertainment and uh the the full fledged W W E version kinda smack down here\nThat came from none other than the Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck African junior this was the statement that he put out yesterday who\nCoined DNA test do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America sovereign tribal nations set their own a legal requirements for citizenship and wild DNA tests can be used so determined lineage\nSuch as fraternity to an individual it's not evidence for tribal affiliation oh by the way he was in a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely\nIs inappropriate and wrong\nIt makes a mockery out of

J. you know in West Palm Beach I Do a mid morning show because you just can't get enough of main four hours in South Florida so do another one from sitting until noon W. I. O. D. in Miami and uh it is truly an honor and a pleasure to be here anytime I I Am able to join you filling in for\nThe great one more call then by the way you can catch me\nAt Bryan mud radio on Twitter now\nWrapping up last hour I mentioned that President Trump\nWas likely to be reelected if for no other reason than he is an incumbent president running for reelection historically sixty five percent for nearly two thirds of all incoming presidents who run we'll win\nUltimately what we have is a presidential election it's about the incumbent president to frankly it really doesn't matter first and foremost whether it's Spartacus or Pocahontas or whatever\nIt matters who in what Donald Trump is represent what he's accomplished and you really have to screw up you really have to screw up in order to be an incumbent president and lose if you're running for re election I'm gonna come back around to the Saudi Arabian thing here in a minute\nSo when you put this in context even think about why because for folks on the left and they're just beside themselves they can't figure out how in the world on lean on and knock your ration day I had to listen to pin heads around here\nIs that where he is he's out after that I mean well first is going to be impeached but who he would never be reelected I mean people already see the mistake to me like you you you really just do not get it\nThe first thing is when you're putting down in context you have to take a look\nAt what it would take for someone who voted for that President not to vote for them again\nI mean yes you can have new voters that come about over the course of four years and if all those new voters leaned heavily in one direction maybe just maybe you could move the needle and by the way I keep track of that and I'm going to give you a little piece of a a story I'm actually working on for my local shows here tomorrow\nJust wrapped up the research on this little while ago checking in on the state's voter registration and broke into your interested to know how Florida has gone over the past couple of years since the twenty sixteen presidential election well yes up or did break for Donald Trump beyond that\nSince the twenty sixteen presidential election through today there are thirty thousand fewer Democrats registered to vote\nYeah thirty thousand fewer registered Democrats in Florida for the past few years we have fifty one thousand additional Republicans registered to vote\nOh by the way probably not going to make the news anywhere even stateside\nAnd do we do have quite a few independent set of registered to vote over a hundred thousand there\nBy pulling being given to the extent that we've seen people from a point of partisanship registered to vote like they're all Democrats even though you would think that every young person you hear all the time all the young people are registering to vote and then they're all Democrats well we heard from Joshua\nTwenty two years old Washington DC in biology last hour\nWho's a thoughtful conservative job that can happen in DC well it can happen other places too and so don't be surprised that's part of the story beyond it you've got to think about what's happening here and there is a lot a lot to feel good about\nFirst he is you take a look at the economy\nWe have the best ... in a generation I never faulted millennials are buying into the hope and change bull crap\nThey didn't know better they went through school here in from a bunch of people who didn't get in the education establishment they get out there and go yeah there's really does suck but you're a bomb and they go well I guess he's right until they actually are given an opportunity to see what the US Economy is capable of and then you got the mines that are up and\nThat's the God of me in the generation\nBut we have two Supreme Court justice is tax reform the end up the Affordable CARE Act mandate Lewis on that point in the right in forty nine years and by the way record low unemployment for all demographics except Asian and white men yeah remember our do about the white men white man\nAnd Asian men they will only demos out there that are not at a record low unemployment right out oh by the way\nBut you also have the biggest increase in their take home pay and thirty two years by the way I mentioned that I Believe on friday and I received some notes from some angry folks on the left\nHappy to try to deal with them but I Want to lay the groundwork for that one once again because not hard to get there and it was a little math and it's easier than calculating the Pocahontas map if you're the Boston Globe listening\nWorks like this you take the overall salary than the average person was making last year you take a look at what it is today by the way it pays about two point eight percent base salary year over year okay All right then you take a look at the average bonus that has been paid out so far this year\nWhen you do that it gives you a little bit over three percent\nAnd then you take a look at the average net benefit of the tax cuts which happened to be for the average fulltime employed person about Eighteen hundred bucks this year you put all that together and boom you get six point seven percent\nAnd complicated suicides histories one side of the facts Israel and by the way in the event that you're the angry leftist that goes yeah\nHaven't seen any benefit for the tax cuts well that's because you know where your employer probably David about it which by the way by twenty thirty million people who are in that situation where employers that make it adjustments you didn't make adjustments if you're not seeing it it'll be records out when you file your taxes and congratulations you'll have likely given the government and interest free one but\nIt's still there because well over Ninety percent of people do benefit from the new tax law\nBut that's all the cool stuff right I mean all of that progress that I decided you have to ask yourself well if you voted for Donald Trump why would you vote against that and two years bans are is if anything he probably is attracted more votes ... if he didn't nothing else\nNo other accomplishments they always status quo from here until twenty twenty he probably gets re elected\nAnd again sixty five percent of presidents who run for reelection so if he were less successful than he is he would still likely be reelected in twenty twenty but here's the the next point and this is the under stated point\nI'm going to work on something conceptually before I give you some facts will do that in a little bit\nHow often or are we talking about domestic terrorism thing about that how often did we have radicalized domestic homegrown terrorism in the United states prior to Donald Trump becoming president\nThat was a fairly regular occurrence wasn't it now you take a look at not have enough problems you take a look at\nNot having Tea Party and and white people specifically\nThe groundwork ultimately the groundwork under shrill now you have is our practice obviously many different sects some of which are positive\nBush is not true law in all forms is evil\nAnd by the way you do you want to argue that three laws not evil again I I guess you can but then you have to make the case that women are subservient to ... to men that if a woman is raped for example she should still be stoned to death because she had sex with the rapists\nAnd just details you know that if you're homosexual it's always about the ... come out don't understand ... ... ...\n... if you are a sexual guess what he gets do because you're on sexual or you know these days they they they just got a ways sometimes they don't get the whole formal stoning thing together they they just tell us your buildings or whatever to support the problem\nIn us being somewhat immune from the realities of Islamic terror\nWe can take for granted the safety that we have day to day that is not present elsewhere in the world a little detail for you that you probably were not aware of how many Islamic terror attacks do you think of happened that have been documented around the world so far in twenty eight to\nSay about it for a second got number\n... play one thousand five hundred and eighty nine [laughter] probably a little bit higher than what you thought to just today for example in Mali you had a terror attack a woman wanting her donkey blown up by Islamic terrorists earlier\nI'm actually going to look into all my city council people now and me and asked them 'cause I only got Twenty one days left so I got to get going\nGod Bless you brother and a duly noted duly noted I did make it kind of a a nasty stereotype about that do smoke and folks and and maybe or how they would vote so I have this is a really\nInteresting show we're having here because managers have a twenty two year old biology student last hour from Washington DC which by the way Ninety One percent of Washington\nD.
