like you know my dad in many respects I talked about um a lot and my mother\n[noise] you know uh my father wrote an illustrated six books starting at the time he was eighty five years old and his last book comes out on October thirtieth\n\nAnd he had written illustrated a book in Nineteen sixty five\n\nIs an artist and author very small businessman most of all he was a patriot\n[noise] you know or\nHis first book Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address illustrated as a preface that I wrote and in order to write it I interviewed my father humming formally but I needed to know more about him in our family I learned a lot\nOn July for Nineteen thirty seven my father\nWas twelve years old and a neighborhood buddy and they in the two of them walked several miles from their homes\nTo the parade route where the city of Philadelphia was celebrating our nation's founding [noise] and the roots stretch from center city Philadelphia not too far from independence hall to the Philadelphia art museum which Sylvester Stallone would make famous in his rocky movies\nMany years later one of the dignitaries and the parade caught my father's attention a civil war veteran a civil war veteran [noise]\nHe

veterans but of all the soldiers the veterans the marching bands my father saw that day that union soldiers stood out\n\nAnd young jak could read somewhat about the civil war in school but seeing that soldier in the flesh and trigger\n\nThe soldier would become seared in my father's mind the most costly war in American history become real to him that began my father's life long journey of self education and patriotic preaching about this great nations history and founding principles\n\nThat a young age my father had a knack for drawing designing and invented when he was Thirteen he designed an automobile window invention for contest the Philadelphia daily news was conducting in conjunction with the release of the movie young Tom medicine starting Mickey Rooney\nHe was one of only five one or city wide and learned a trip to the Nineteen thirty nine New York world's fair\nAnd Fifteen he submitted an idea would drawings for animating the story Christmas count the Walt Disney studio in

grandparents and asked whether they would allow their son's Fifteen at the time to join Disney studio they would provide them with dormitory space and schooling at the facility while he was working for them\n\nBut his parents concerned about his age turned down the offer\n\nNow my father grew up during the great depression this family was very poor his father Harry worked at part time jobs when he could find them often as a bartender [noise]\nHis mother and my grandmother Sarah I worked in a cigar factory jak was the oldest of four children and the only boy when he turns sixteen after the school day and that he would walk to the cigar factory about a mile from their\nHome apartment a few al ... worked until midnight earning the going rate is Seventeen dollars a week\n[noise] on the

three drawings\nTo manufacture cells menus the finished drawings with their customers to a few months later the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor jak spent the summer working at the cramps shipyard in Philadelphia where they built destroyers and submarines but he wanted to do more for the war effort\nLike so many wonderful young men at the time my father decided to enlist in the armed forces he wanted to be a cut debt in the army air corps which today we know is the air force\n\nBut he was only Seventeen he was too young so he got a copy of his birth certificate from city hall he rubbed out the five and Nineteen twenty five is birds here and you wrote in for\n\nJust like that he reached the legal age requirement of Eighteen get past the rigorous air core exam he was in\n\nTen would be good that she took the exam clothing students from the University of Pennsylvania but only for past including my father\nAnd not long after my father was born in you're trained to Biloxi, Mississippi for basic training soldiers stopped him and told him the lieutenant wanted to see the lieutenant who have taken a close look at the birth certificate abstract holding it was\nWhen my father told him the truth and turn it wasn't very happy but he told them when he turned Eighteen he could join up\nAnd a week after he turned Eighteen he joined up\n\nWhile in service jak would use brief respite to draw cartoons which were published in a variety of newspapers\n[noise] after the war\nAnd my father worked for company making displays for store windows and trade shows\nAround this time he met a beautiful young lady Norma room and the next morning jak told his mother that one day he would marry her she was Seventeen [noise]\nNorma headed to Syracuse University and soda jak with help of the GI Bill he earned his room and board by working in the cafeteria projects love of art and history with Lauren back to his home town of Philadelphia and after much pleading by jak Norma returned with and

carpenter\nAnd for the camp he would uh maintain the pools each stripping down every summer and paying them all by himself your mother lawns all by itself has two sons were old enough to help

Obama by attorney general holder\nThe rest of us get to speak to we may not have printing presses they may not have blog sites we may not have days are spending billions of dollars to\nBuild us up and so forth and so on but we have the right to speak to and that includes the right to criticize the media\n\nIt's interesting the media have no problem criticizing their competitors CNN actually has a

what I think it's going to happen if the people around the country are going to realize that this is not a deep blue state and people believe\nI was chairman for half a decade of the G O P s state party and that we know by data and also by looking at our legislature were split halfway down the middle and so when that happens that's not an indication of a\nOf a deep blue state where a purple state and\nAnd ... by the way and this is one of the important things that if you actually when the Senate race\nOr that could turn out enough Republicans to flip both houses of the state legislature 'cause it's one vote in the Senate and what is it one one now yeah both and so what would change one seed there and it makes a world of difference I'm Sorry go ahead\nIs on it lately right if we have our voters vote all the way up and down the ballot\nOr that is exactly what's going to happen and the other thing that people don't realize is there an awful lot of good Democrats who have become very disenchanted with their party there not socialists\nThey don't want this new vision that has been so articulated by the Seattle city council\nA lot of your listeners around the country heard about at head tax if they pass and uh we were ridiculed across the country for it because they were going to fight homelessness by basically forcing employers to lay people off\nBecause they couldn't afford to pay to head tax to the city and that's the kind of crazy ridiculous taxation that people in this state are fed up with\nAnd and your opponent is on record of wanting higher tax rates\nAbsolutely and she voted against the tax cuts in jobs bill she said she would rescinded\nA there is like all these big government Democrats there is not attacks they don't love it's another way to get people's money and the people in this country are seeing a new way and that thanks to Donald Trump kind of doing with his policies are what hasn't been done in a very long time and I particularly loved\nIn our state and across the country that unemployment rates are so low for our ethnic and minority communities\nAnd um I again you're you're running a very vigorous campaign you're out there all the time you you can't match I'm Maria in terms of money I mean she's been there three full terms in the U.S\nSenate um what's ... what would be your first priority if you actually win this thing\nWell we have a lot of priorities in this state and a lot of people may not realize that we were inundated with forest fire smoke based on very bad policy if they keep us from clearing out the under brash and getting rid of that tinder uh it's ready to explode the moment there is a forest fire we have had\nCatastrophic forest fires in our federal for us and that's got to change and that's one of the first things I Would do another thing is we are really hurting when it comes\nThe transportation because our state is so poorly respected in the halls of power we have very little cloud to bring home any kind of money from the federal government and I said I can bring home that the federal dollars for infrastructure that my opponent has been unable to do\nWas harshly because he can work with the Trump admitted to directly and and but also partially because I think you share with the Trump Administration to desire to move us to fixing our roads rather than building new choo choo train as our friend taught her refers to them yes uh that actually go nowhere\nExactly you know we're on the cusp of a very exciting time in transportation a cleaner cars and and the ability to use a a phone app to find a drivers and writers in order to a double and triple up in car pools like we've never seen before you know kind of an ...\nVersion of transportation for the community and there are so many new innovative things that are coming down the road it's just a shame to use the phrase it's just a shame that we spend so much time wasting billions of dollars on a\nOn not getting our folks to and from work and back home to visit with their families for the rest of the day so I'm I feel very strongly about this there there's another thing that really affects all of us and this is nationwide it's bringing down the cost of higher education\nAnd that we know the federal government has had a major role in increasing those costs and uh we've got to step in the time has come and it's an issue that I think all of that around the country are going to be working on\nA what a what are some of the promising ways you could bring down the ridiculous cost of higher education\nWell the the biggest one is that a federal use of of loans or that has allowed the costs at the university to go skyrocketing\nNo of course with the federal government under writing all all of these loans including for people who just go for a year or two and don't even have a college degree to show for it we're speaking with Susan Hutchison\nShe is a Republican for US Senate go to Susan for Senate dot com to read about

final debate with her opponent senator Maria Cantwell US Senator from the state of Washington\nAnd you did very well thank both of those sessions and part of the reason you do well as you were very credible on the issue of national security now I gotta say\nYour dad was a Lieutenant General in the air force your husband is a colonel and Marine Corps and I didn't realize that you have a son now is the second lieutenant and Marine Corps or what do you think about the national security implications of this now very famous caravan that is heading toward our southern border\nWell we have tested in polling over the last several months and our voters believe that immigration is the number one issue in America and even though we're up here in this northwest corner of the country\nThey really care about it because it is a national security issue and uh so the people that I talk to you it doesn't matter what party there and they are deeply concerned about what the implications are of thousands of people storming our southern border it's a frightening thought\nAnd that just as the killing of ... ... ... ... in a in Turkey and Saudi Arabia confluence Donald Trump's fault apparently so is the fact that\nLooks like more than seven thousand to me but seven thousand illegal aliens are heading for a border and you know or the storyline is that Donald Trump is politicizing it and he stoking fear\n\nAnd uh you may not know this but\nThrough September so far this year over four hundred thousand illegal aliens have been stopped at our border\n\nOr this is an invasion the media do not want to describe it as an invasion because remember what I told you the other day [noise] we used to talk about the media being independent of the Democratic party it's actually the other way around the Democratic party is an appendage of the media\nIt's independent of the media\nThe media narrative here is that if you oppose the legal immigration people just marching from one country to the next into your own country we have no idea who they are no IDF any of them are criminals actually we do some of the been deported and so forth\nIf you oppose that then you're a racist and if you object that object to it and you're a politician your fear mongering\nHere fear mongering I Want you to listen to this montage that Trump's mid term election strategy is fear and allies most of these\nPeople are was CNN some of them with MSNBC but most of them are with CNN I Want you to listen to this cut one go\nI Want to show me the big headline in the Washington Post this morning\nFrom than Republicans settle on fear and fall so it\nHasn't mid term strategy fear and in some cases live\nThere is something totally wrong with a leader who lies so much about everything but the live about public policy allies and then to to fight our country to hurt people or ... those allies should discuss other elected Republicans where are you so what's\nGoing on here are the president's allies becoming more brazen does he not know what he's saying this is not rhetorical what's going on with the president and his grip on reality loosening this as a base election and it's a fair election why\nIs Donald Trump so frightened wisely so scared why isn't quite as being shown so pathetic and little right now so slow so tiny that he's happy to create these life he\nIs taking us to a place where on cruises the order of the day\nWhere officially in affairs and in fact France on President Trump's campaign like it's too bathroom thinks pain all over again where fare is driving his political message and the truth goes by the wayside [noise]\nSee this is propaganda you repeat the big lie over and over and over again you use the same words over and over and over again vast majority of these people are on CNN not all of them some of them are actually called reporters\nAnd anchors and hosts does it sound like news to you\nSenior White House correspondent on good morning America today Sicilia Vega\n\n... news busters cut to go but\nLet me just give me some perspective here this so called national emergency actually really represents about point zero six percent of all the undocumented people already in this country\nThat we're talking about in very small fraction of people here but the president is hoping that they said that when he was trying to think this was a\nNews reporter this is the White House correspondent the senior White House correspondent for ABC News good morning America\nGo ahead\nAnd the White House to House Republicans are edging in terms of that strategy is stoking fears about immigration\nThere you go [noise] this was also an attack on New Year's eve because you're so stupid\nThat the president\nIs able to cause you to be\nFearful and scared you're so stupid you can't process what's actually taking place\nAnd besides it's only zero point zero six percent of all undocumented people already in this country and the irony is that there's so many illegal aliens in this country seven thousand or whatever the number is march into our southern border to this reporter simply no big deal\n\nPeter Alexander and other white House correspondent this time on the today show that would be NBC had tipped news busters cut three go\nYes you're right I mean what's striking here as the economy is strong employment is low but instead of talking about his achievements these days the president really is leaning end of his message out\nAs fear stop this is another journalist\nSo instead of talking about the economy which of course the media never talk about\nInstead of talking about the economy which the media could care less about the president is stoking he's a he's leaning into his message of fear not law and order remind you of course it is law and order but it's fear you see go ahead\nArgument focuses on soaking the fears of illegal immigration MS Thirteen shadowy Middle Eastern\nSide just wait a minute I happen to live in a community where MS Thirteen is a huge problem maybe these people do but in is Thirteen is a huge and going ... in a lot of states in metropolitan areas it's no joke\n\nIt ten minutes Thirteen that's stokes fear not the president of the United states\nGo ahead\nIt's what he's been trying to do recently to try to motivate his base of support his voters ...\nSee it's all about motivating you because you see ladies and gentleman enlist you are absolutely emotionally out of your mind you're not going to\nYou're not going to vote\nAnd yet is not immigration a key issue is it not an important issue it may not be an important issue\nTo phony journalists to phony anchors to phony host a phony reporters but it is an important issue to men and women who go to work every day try to raise their families and live in communities that are exposed to this\nIt is to people who break their ass everyday pain that property taxes and in some states where we have income taxes most states and so much of that money goes to individuals who are here illegally\nIt matters to people who are construction workers it matters to people who are truck drivers in taxi drivers it managed to people who work with their hands many people who work with their hands\nNone of these reporters work with their hands at least not above the table go ahead\nDemocrats from winning back the house or the Senate or both obviously what's crucial in this circumstance here is that the president recognizes that he is up against the wall right here\nThis is a reporter\n\nNow Gloria borders on CNN Today utterly and completely predictable\n\nBut we need to hear from Gloria border because she's on CNN all the time cut for it go\nYou know I'm old enough to remember twenty sixteen [laughter] this is funny\nThat's why they keep bringing up many of them twenty sixteen because they believe it was an illegitimate election by all of us stupid people who came out and voted for Trump because we're racists where Xena folks were homophobic and on and on and on just notice how they\nKeep trashing you even more than Trump it you\nKnow it's just twenty sixteen all over again and it was a gentleman election illegitimate now she was looking at this look at the race made it look what's going on\nRace baiting thousands of people who've told us what they\nPlan to do marching to our border there from Honduras and El Salvador Guatemala and other countries not race baiting gr identify\n\nRace baiting is what we saw during the Kavanaugh hearings by the left the Democrats and the media go ahead\nAnd Republicans are feeling good because if you start with Kavanaugh and then you ... you know something switched\nAfter Kavanaugh and the president is now on the campaign trail rallying days and getting them out to vote and you see in the poll numbers that suddenly\nRepublican voters are monsters energizes Democrats not quite but all of his energize his Democrats wearables as before this before this fear mongering for the for\nThis fear mongering Kavanaugh how are we fear mark and how's the president's fear mongering now he's plain spoken just like Harry Truman he's explaining what's taking place\n\nThere is an invasion taking place seven thousand people who wish to come across the border illegally what the hell do you call it a parade\nTo hold on to power it's the same party it's the party of power centralized government anti constitutional is go ahead\nAnd headed by former congresswoman Barbara Jordan [noise] we are a nation of immigrants but we are also a nation of laws is wrong and ultimately for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years and we must do more to stop\nIt [noise] I don't remember the media\nCalling him racist fear mongering scary I don't remember that do you\nHere's Obama on a legal immigration little over ten years ago cut a deal\nAnd go we all agree on the need to better secure the border and punish reporters who chose to hire illegal immigrants uh yeah we are a generous\nAnd wait a minute choose me undocumented immigrants isn't that the line now undocumented that Obama\nRacist neo Nazi language like that is very off putting go ahead\nBy the states but those were fed or the country illegally and those who employ them disrespect the rule of law or and they are the rule of law\n\nWell
