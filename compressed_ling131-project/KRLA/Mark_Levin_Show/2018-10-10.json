Harris and and uh uh Cory Booker were declining themselves with community organizing tactics after\nThe official vote in the Senate when Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in as a judge of the Supreme Court we saw them take to the streets screaming pounding on the doors of the Supreme Court\nAnd today the narrative from the media the narrative from the Democrats the narrative from CNN of all places and the Washington Post\nIs that we are the problem you and I normative American citizens who don't want to be associated with screaming violent felons in the streets\nDisrupting people's dinners in a restaurant or at least screaming obscenity is to people because they happen to work for the Trump Administration are happened to vote the wrong way from their perspective\nBecause we normative Americans don't want to accept that\nAs part of the American political dialogue because we dared to call people screaming at the streets stopping traffic and creating a violent riots in our towns because we dare to call them a mob\nWe are the problem\nWe are the problem [noise] [noise] well no I'm Sorry the mob is the problem\nAnd I would like to hear from you what eight seven seven three one three eight one one as I lay out this remarkable\nAttempt to bastard dies the American language and tell us that the mob is not the mob and this is a full court press from the Washington Post and CNN to different hosts yesterday went out of their way to try to chastise people for using the term mob with referring to what can only be described as a mob\nAs I laid out for you and explain exactly how we got here from there and why the left is doing this why they're trying to stop us from calling these thugs or the ... that they are I Want to hear from you\nAt eight seven seven three one three eight one one what are you now ready to do to keep the mob from taking power\nBecause make no mistake\nThis is all about political power\nWe heard from Hillary Clinton yesterday in her interview with Chris you and I'm a port where she said we can only regain stability if the Democrats win the house and the Senate she's basically saying no justice no peace no victory in November no peace nice little town you got there\nAnd be a shame if anything happened to it you better vote for the Democrats or we're going to burn this thing down\nSo what are you willing to do\nTo stop the mob from taking power eight seven seven three one three at one one because we have an incredibly important election coming up in twenty seven days for weeks from today for weeks from right now this moment when you tune in to hear the great one mark living on the market within show he will be discussing\nWhether we are about to embark upon two years of a Democrat controlled house of representatives which will inevitably mean investigations impeachment of not just President Trump a probably justice capping off\nOr if a mark within might be talking about the remarkable historic victory of the Republican Party\nIn maintaining majorities in the house and the Senate\n\nWhich story what we hear for weeks from tonight it really depends\nOn you and it depends on what you were willing to do because right now I have seen Republican voters in my town\nOf Washington DC and yes there are Republicans in Washington and then the greater Washington area but all across this country I assume Republicans motivated an energized and ready to walk across broken glass to get to the ballot box and that's important but it's not everything\nThe only way that Hillary Clinton lost the election and twenty sixteen\nIs because people not just voted but they told their friends to vote they told their family members to vote they made sure that they became part of the message and they said we can't let her when\nWe can't let her pick Supreme Court justices we can't let her be the commander in chief look at who she is look at what she thinks of us look at her history\nThat's what happened two years ago next month\nThat's how you win elections when you're up against the mainstream media when you're up against Hollywood when you're up against television and music and the universities and the news media\nThat's how you when you have to tell your friends and your family we can't let this happen so are you ready now\nAre you ready because they just showed you over the weekend over the past two weeks how they're going to govern the Democrats want all of those people who were screaming in the streets and screaming disrupting the operations of the United States Senate\nThey want to take them from the streets they want to take them from the gallery screaming at vice president Pence trying to conduct a vote in the United States Senate and they want to put them down on the floor of the Senate down on the floor of the house they want to hand the gavel to them and let them be in charge for the next two years\nWhat are you willing to do to stop it eight seven seven three one\nThree eight one one it started yesterday on CNN well actually forgive me it started\nEarly in the morning yesterday in the Washington Post leave these things happen and they're all coordinated have you noticed that\nThe Washington Post writes an op ed talking about how Trump is using coded language when he refers to Democrats as the mob\nTalking about how this is a dog whistle how the mob isn't really a mob\nAnd then Matt Lewis a writer at the Daily Beast he's never Trump\nConsider that Republicans aboutcom Republican but he actually I think is no longer identify as Republican but he has to be a Republican he used to read at the Daily Caller now he switched to the Daily Beast I think that's what happens when you go from being a Republican to a non Republican you switch Daily Caller the Daily Beast [laughter]\nAt that but he's a good guy and I've known that for a while he's on with Brooke Baldwin Mary Catherine ... friend of mine also would never Trump Republican she has not renounced the Republican name she writes the federalist she's also um they're both paid CNN contributors\nAnd they're talking about the instability that we're seeing in this country and we're talking about the violent protests that we saw in the streets after the Capitol hearing but frankly the violence we've seen for the last two years since the middle of the twenty sixteen election the things that we saw\nAgainst Trump voters at Trump rallies there were instigated by the left the things that we saw remember the antifa people following the Trump motorcade into a hotel and hopping over the freeway barricades to get into the hotel where he was having a fundraiser\nYou remember the mobs on the campuses at UC Berkeley and other places across the country when Ben Shapiro of all people shows up to give a speech you know little mild mannered bench Shapiro is causing a bonfire\nOnly bonfire bunch of parents ever been around involve marshmallows and small cars\nThat in the immortal words of Billy Joel we didn't start this fire\nThe left has been doing this for the last two years and now they're disrupting us when we go to dinner we've got Maxine Waters telling people to get in our faces and disrupt us wherever we go so Brooke Baldwin host these two never Trump hers to talk about what's going on and listen to how it when\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out of restaurants by a mob oh you're not going to use the law were totally a mop it is without a doubt there's no other word\nIt's a little put a stop on the mob is what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August said go\nNo isn't that like she was so ready for that by the way did you hear how she jumped right on it you know when you go on television you often deliver you're talking points ahead of time you say you know I go on a Fox a lot I mind with Tucker Carlson ... a lot a Stewart Bernie and they always say you know what your point of view give us a couple of lines as the host knows what's gonna happen\nDoor of the Supreme Court screaming with a bullhorn on your front door invading private property but restaurant disrupting people while they're trying to have dinner or no justice no peace was what I heard from them in the past and you heard Hillary Clinton say we can of civility until the Democrats take the house and Senate back there you go that's the threats so what are you going to do\nTo stop them because if you don't do something between now and election day twenty\nSeven days from now that's exactly what will happen the mob will be in charge and here's the president's Saturday Night in his rally right after the vote confirming Brett Kavanaugh as the next Supreme Court justice this was brilliant here's what he said\nYou don't have that she's doing arson has been in power to it and we left wing ma and that [noise]\n\nYou mentioned days years ago\nWhen politicians want to leave and the rule of law\nNot the rule of them are\nThere you go that's it and it and when he said that Saturday I'm telling you Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi the hierarchy of the Democratic party in this town who exploit those people out on the street who use them and harnessed them as they're based based on the president say that and they thought to themselves oh crap\nThat's brilliant because normative Americans do not want to hand power over to those people\nThat you're seeing in the streets there the directors of our society they don't deserve to be in charge of our house of representatives in the United States Senate that the winning message and that's why suddenly you can call them a mob so what do we do to stop this Dan in Las Vegas Nevada your first stop on the market within show\nHey how you doing today I'm good damn but I we need to win we're going to win

with Mitch McConnell is the majority leader in the Senate but in one respect he has done a a ... job and that is in getting judicial nominees through\nUh the president has done an incredible job with his advisors in nominating fantastic judges and in the cases of Gorsuch and Kevin ought to fantastic justices\nAnd as far as the Justice Department is concerned as far as the\nJudicial branch of our government the Senate's been doing a pretty okay job in pushing through a lot of those nominees and a lot of those judges they could do more though\nWhat is not discussed very often\nEspecially because it's now almost two years into this administration what often does not get the attention that the mainstream media should be giving it [noise] is that as of now\nPresident Donald Trump has something like a hundred and ... I'm looking for the number within this article right now something like a hundred and eighty nominations\nFor for ... positions within his administration that have nothing to do with the judicial branch have nothing to do with judges were talking about people in the state department people at the Pentagon\nThat require confirmation by the United States Senate that are still sitting and still languishing without any action from the Senate\nMuch of it is because of the arcane rules of the Senate which as we know Mitch McConnell can change right now today\nAnd he has not and this is the resistance these are the Democrats Chuck Schumer he's ... he's said going into this administration that he was going to make every single appointment of fight\nTo the death and\nAnd they would demand debate they would demand the time needed for you I think it's something like ... every single nominee that requires Senate confirmation or if they want to if they want to hold up the works they can put all of these road blocks in\nThat end up being like Seventy hours of debate for each one and of course the ... in the past they haven't done that they've been deferential and they said listen every president deserves the right and opportunity and leeway to put people in place that he has put in place and and selected to be put in place\nThat's called ... that deferential act it's called respect for our American government it's called a ... a fundamental understanding that the executive branch of the United states federal government must be field so that it can function\nFor the Democrats haven't allowed that to happen\nUh let me read this or much of this editorial for you so you understand what we're talking about anyone seeking a mid career sabbatical should seek a presidential nomination to a position that requires Senate confirmation Jewish majority leader Mitch McConnell is teeing up more votes this week and the GOP needs to move fast\nBecause the glacial pace of staffing the government will slow to near zero if Democrats retake the Senate it's it's pretty close to zero now guys [noise]\nMr McConnell has felt cloture on three nominees including two assistant attorneys general who have been in a rubber room for more than a year to assistance attorneys general have been waiting for their floor vote for nearly a year\nThink about that you want to know why the Justice Department has trouble functioning and doing things why they're spread a little ...\n\nWe can't we can't run a government this way\nAnd the Democrats are suppose they're supposed to be all about running the government they love that government why are they holding up this president and his nominations ... Phil basic function every roles in the United states government and the executive branch politics because they still think Hillary should have won\nAnd they're trying to make life a living and health for this president they want dysfunction in the federal government so they can run in twenty twenty and saying well he couldn't even run the government right\nThat's what they're trying to do [noise]\nPresident Trump nominated Jeffrey ... Clarke says the wall Street Journal editorial to run the environment and natural resources division in June twenty Seventeen\nDitto Erica dry banned for civil rights the third is an assistant Pentagon secretary who would oversee manpower and reserve affairs Democrats vow cloture on every nominee which kicks off thirty hours of debate even if no senator as opposed to understand\nThis\nBut Democrats care about the environment so Trump dominates Jeffrey bus or clerk to run the environment and natural resources division at the Justice Department in June of last year of last year\nAnd they haven't allowed us to come to the floor for a vote\nThey say that every single one of the nominees that Trump has put through remember Richard Grinnell the ambassador to Germany right now who people are saying should be the investors you and I would love that by the way wreck when I was a great guy\nHe was the ambassador of Germany he languish without a vote for over a year we had no one bastard or Germany and once he got there\nBoy he is is we're that continent into shape not just Germany he has been the the tip of the spear for the Trump Administration in on doing the uh the the free for all that happened with regard to Iran\nAnd Germany and all these other businesses and banks and industry suddenly doing business with the terrorists ... Iran because they were functioning without Trump's man in Berlin\nThey finally get rid of Grinnell as the ambassador after languishing for a year without a floor vote he gets there and within two months all these businesses are divested from around oh we had no idea that that's what America wanted we had no idea that is what Trump one way it's because they didn't have as a pastor there\nThat's just one example\nSo Democrats file clerk sure this is a Senate rule that can be changed and should be changed I don't know why McConnell's allowing it to go on as far as he had he should have just said okay we're done with us whenever a senator files cloture it means that automatically\nA requires thirty hours of debate nothing about this there's something like I think two hundred a ... roughly two hundred nominations right now there\nLanguishing for each one of them they would require thirty hours of debate they won't get anything else done they won't do anything\n\nAnd so so McConnell wanting to get stuff done has sort of just said okay we're not going to put those nominations through the floor votes because we can't just hold progress\nBecause of the thirty hours a foot and by the way the thirty hours of debate that is triggered with every single cloture that the Democrat forces\nThey might not even have a rational opposition they might not even have a reason why they oppose the person they just want to mock up the works they just want to slow everything to a grinding halt\n\nThe going back to the editorial here at the wall Street Journal which is brilliant they figure if they can't defeat nominees they can delay and consume valuable time Democrats have forced one hundred and Seventeen cloture votes\nWe're consolidated Greta we're here to give you freedom from going out for your ... and it was easy I Would call ... years ago\nOnly in my mind to sixty seven hundred by my be sixty seven fifty eight hundred why why do you do some\nReading on the surface of the some of them was among other more than three\nThe MIT we're going to be a major was equally one licensed by the corporation commission like it was not easy thirty to\nLove of country becomes overwhelming every\nThese things from our bureau [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nBlurry O'Connor in for the great one mark Levin point a lot of time on that confirmation issue but it's important\nAnd I need you to share on your social media that Wall Street journal editorial because people don't even know that this was going a hundred and Ninety eight nominees still languishing but I Do want to get to some of your calls at eight seven seven three one three at one we'll go to David Silicon Valley only got a minute though David go fast\n[noise] what's that were coming to take from you guys are being aware of the people are in the street that they always are in America and they argued that legacy of crowd Quakers didn't I didn't hear about the park and stuff up back in a day\nBy day but you're going to take power area\nWe go out to the election coming up in the stock market\nThere what if they lose what if you lose what are you gonna do they want we will be\nBack out in the street it back\nIn the streets there you go they're gonna keep all day thing he thinks they're the sons of liberty sets a nominal David thank you it's very hard to live it's important that everyone here is that the they don't want to wind power they don't want to win an election they want to take [noise]\nThat's why they're marching\nThat's why they're writing that's why they're a mob\nHe was you know it's not smart job sites that overwhelm you with tons of the wrong resumes but you know what is smart the zip recruiter dot com slash Levin L.
