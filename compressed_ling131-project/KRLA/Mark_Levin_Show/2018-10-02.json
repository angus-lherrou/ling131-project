[noise]\nYou know\nWe talk a lot and I've written a lot about the investigation of our constitutional order [noise]\nThat the progressive status reject the constitution they reject Republicanism they reject separation of powers federalism and you can see the even reject the bill of rights to some extent [noise]\nAnd the reason is they reject individuals as liberty is for individual liberty is for individuals\nAnd individual ism is not defined by how much the government can give you liberty is not defined by how much you can lobby the government\nLiberty is defined by the circle of another ... writes that is around each and every one of us at birth that humanity\nMark what does this have to do with anything has to do with everything\nOur constitution was set up to protect the individual in order to society our constitution is the manifestation the governing manifestation of the declaration of independence\n\nWhat you're seeing play out in front of you\nIs the consequence of the ... from our constitutional order that is you're seeing post constitutional as\n\nIt's always been interesting to me and I've studied this for decades\nNow Marxist socialists whatever they call themselves can talk about the people's revolution doing this and that for the people when in fact there are all about centralized autocratic iron fisted government\nElites who they call experts\nWe making society they do not like a messy society where individuals are all pretty much doing what they want to do\nBecause utopian ism is achieved\nBy the experts by the masterminds watering society\nMark I still don't know what this has to do with anything stay with me please [noise]\nWhen you have decentralization of government and I've written this down I'm just telling you as it is when you're the central location of government you have the government more and more and making decisions and yet the government more and more and making decisions about everything\n\nBig things in small things minute and huge we have a massive administrative state that does that every day\nWe also have elements within our country that have gotten incredibly strong much stronger and much more muscular than the frame has ever imagine and that's our courts especially the Supreme Court\n\nWhen you have the central location of power and when you have more and more decisions being made by the court by entities within the federal\nGovernment\nThen there's a lot at stake is it there and the federal government's making decisions the fifty states the territories are much less important must less influential\nAs the central government get stronger and stronger and more and more ubiquitous\nYou can't escape it\nWhen the federal government makes a decision it doesn't matter what state you move to you can't escape it\nIt's a winner take all situation like abortion like Obamacare\nWhatever the issue is it's a winner take all that's not at all what the constitution created and so in many respects where they post constitutional government they post constitutional Supreme Court and on and on and on we absolutely do and I've talked about by the length I've written about it at length\nSo what you're watching now is the breakdown of the constitutional order in the United States Senate\nRespecting the Supreme Court and what's interesting about this is the institution of the United States Senate as a ... today is not what the constitution created\n\nIt's not what the constitution created you had this progressive movement that became especially strong in the earliest period the turn of the last century\nThe early Nineteen hundreds of his building in the late Eighteen hundreds [noise] and you're the sixteenth amendment the federal income tax which was always\nA desired result for the heart left and then you have the seventeenth amendment which utterly destroy the United States Senate senators are elected way members of the house are elected no they're sick to your terms of course\nBut their elected by the people of the state the Senate has no actual purpose anymore\nOh I understand treaties and so that's not my point in terms of its fundamental foundational purpose\nIt's been bastard at\nThe Senate collectively was supposed to represent the states collectively and the federal Congress\nTo members from each state states would determine how they're chosen they can be elected by the people although very few where they can be selected by the state legislatures most of the more but the so called populism movement\nAnd the progressive movement eliminated that and so you have this kind of pure democracy as opposed\nTo Republicanism when it comes to the United States Senate and you see the consequences of that\nYou also see the consequences and another institution the United States Supreme court the United States Supreme court even though some of my constitutional loosened conservative friends heated Lee disagree with me I had written about this and the ... versus Madison decision the Supreme Court seized power\nSeized power from the other federal branches\n\nJefferson knew immediately what took place as did other individuals who are believed in diversified a government have libertarians today that argue strongly in favor of Madison versus Marbury and when you really read the case and you know the history of it it's\nA bastard ... not only the constitution\nBut the parties involved there's no way Marshall chief justice Marshall should have been involved in that decision I'm not going to go down the road right now I'm just\nI'm just explaining that the Supreme Court's power today is far beyond anything that was contemplated by the framers of the constitution and certainly the rabbit fires in the states these states\nWe're still very suspicious of the central government and the constitution almost was not ratified in Massachusetts\nIn New York\nAnd in Virginia hence the federalist papers the advocates for\n\nOf them from New York one of them from Virginia John J. Hamilton and mad as they honestly believe that they had created a governing system that would protect the American people not just from\nMonarchy but for mob rule and more and more we're both\nWith the permanent government in Washington DC and the lifetime appointees on the Supreme Court\nAnd Marlboro\nBecause of the the unraveling of our Republican little are Republican system [noise] so you see the development of these factions and the faction on the left has become extremely violent\nExtremely aggressive\nWhich restaurants are airports whether it's hands teeth are black lives matter before that other movements in the Nineteen sixties\nThe weather underground and the association between these radical elements and members elected members of the Democratic party is really quite shocking\nAbsolutely shocking and the association between them and most of our media is unconscionable absolutely\nUnconscionable this is why the constitution is so important and this is why Republicanism is so important\n\nAnd the left keeps trying to destroy them one of the reasons if not the main reason that you see the the obliteration\nOf the confirmation process when it comes to the Supreme Court one of the reasons you see it is because Kavanaugh has pro fast he has declared that he's a constitutional is\nBelong to them they belong to them not to the people who seek the rule is they don't belong to these various left wing causes they don't belong to women to the exclusion of men they don't belong to white people to the exclusion of black people they belong to all of us\nWere caught in this\nAs radical progressive state has vortex where everything is defined by their agenda everything is defined by their language [noise] with the media in this country largely with few exceptions which is also totalitarian in nature\n\nOh yes they are\nLiberties voice mark love fan [noise] talk that voice now seven seven three one two three one was let's take a look at the warning that we were provided [noise]\nBy some of these great man [noise] and in this case federalist ten\nAnd this would be Madison to the people of the state of New York\n\nAmong the numerous advantages promised by a well constructed union none deserves to be more accurately developed and its tendency to break can control the violence of faction\nThe friend the popular government's never find some self so much alarmed by their character and said when he contemplates the pope pen city to this dangerous vice\nHe will not fail therefore to set a do value on any plan which without violating the principles to which is attached provides a proper cure for it\nThe instability in justice and confusion introduced into the public councils heaven truth than the moral diseases under which popular governments have everywhere perished\nAs they continue to be the favorite and fruitful topics from which the adversaries to liberty derive their most specious declarations\nThe valuable improvements made by the American constitutions that is the state constitutions when the popular models both ancient and modern\nCannot certainly be too much admired but it would be an under water bowl a partiality to contend that they have as factually probably aided the danger on the side\nHas was wished unexpected\nComplaints are everywhere I heard from our most considerate and virtuous citizens equally the friends of public and private face\nAnd a public and personal liberty that our governments are too unstable\nThat the public good it's disregarded and the conflicts of rival parties\nThe People's Republic the people's revolution the progressive movement there none of these things they all overlap and what gets into their way is the ...\nAre not only participants in but they're leading the character assassination charge\nThe New York times now has a huge story out their trashing the president the United states has finances as early investments [noise] all the time of course uh for the midterm elections the New York times\nUh which has you know if you listen to this program during the Nineteen thirties and forties did everything they could to hide the Holocaust from the American people [noise]\nAnd the New York times has conducted itself all the time but in particular during the Trump beers as basically a yellow sheet for the left\nEven publishing an op ed by anonymous\nNow they go back after the president's finances to give the rest of the media something to talk about that is what they do because it will be picked up by the rest of the media these lazy more ironic tunes dressed up as journalists [noise] most of them under thirty five or forty\n\nAnd they just keep pushing this stuff pushing pushing pushing and the question is how much you're going to take ladies and gentlemen whether you're really going to sit on your backsides during this mid term election hoping for the perfect candidate even though your candidate may not be perfect\nI've told you before where I live I'm voting for Barbara Comstock I'm going to be the first one of the damned polls and I'm voting for her not because I agree with her own everything but because I Know she's not one of them\nThis is a different election years you're on the table\nThe issue on the table as in some minor issue the issue on the table is whether we're going to stand up to this crap\nThat's\nThe issue on the table\nYou've got Republicans all over this country who they are trying to take out it's up to you to stop it can you imagine if the Republicans don't lose the house and pick up some seats in the Senate\nCan you imagine what damage all due to the left can you imagine what damage you'll do to this force you should be the first one is that the\nPolls on Tuesday Morning doctors early voting you should have voted already the left well\nYou should send a signal Washington like they've never seen before that twenty six team was not an aberration twenty sixteen was not a mistake twenty sixteen is a pattern that what you need to show them at trust me they're Republicans I cannot stand\nBut look what's going on in our country here look what's going on so much of what goes on in Washington is completely out of our control\nBut we still get the vote\nWere\nReally on defense here the the issues whether they're going to do more damage than they've already done we don't we don't fight the cause of liberty anymore we don't make any any advances anymore right now we're just trying to make sure we don't fall back any further\n\nBut that is our obligation to our children our grandchildren one and a half million people have died fighting for this country is Matt Damon explained on Sunday you probably didn't see it it was eleven at night that's all last time that is going to happen at least as long as I'm a host I can tell you that right now\n\nThe admits that interview this was a great governor of Kentucky and he was terrific talking about\nOur culture our society the election all these things that relate to everybody in this country\n\nThe media in this country\nWhile they claimed to be defending a free press third dancing as more and more towards totalitarianism whether ideology what their groups and what their mayor's words are phoney investigative reporting\n\nTo stay but rock Obama Michelle Obama have they ever done and examination or their finances have they ever done an examination of the deal with Netflix and they deal with their publisher making them work a hundred million a hundred and fifty million dollars as anyone even looked at that\nThey never looked at the Kennedys they never looked at Lyndon Johnson how he became a millionaire overnight Harry Reid nothing\n\nNot so\nBasically you women in the suburbs are going to vote Democrat or not at all is that true they say you couples in the suburbs with a college degree that you're not going to vote for Republicans that you're either going to sit home or vote Democrat is that true yeah like what's happening to your country\n\nBut around you look at your beautiful neighborhoods look at your beautiful homes I'll get your beautiful ... ad that community and you can't stand up for your country truly so horrible\n\nI'll tell you what I said they talk about social media that social media has been a disaster for this country the Internet many respects a disaster though the negativity they don't hold a candle the CNN and MSNBC\nBloggers website stayed on ... ... hold a candle to MSNBC and NBC\nWould that be yes [noise] that the s\nThat's burned up on those networks like truly stupid people\nIn and day out\nI don't give a damn white Kavanaugh drank and I still like college I don't\nEther I said somebody whether we get every didn't get a lot we have a Twenty one trillion dollar debt we're\nWell borders that Chinese military is our number two are grown it's open to attack our police are under attack our constitution is ignored don't\nI think I don't\nAbout our president's just how we made money how we lost money how we made money it's not even any of my business it's not like he was tied to the mob like the Kennedys\nOh yeah New York times on ever do that story\n\nNow I got to do something I never thought I'd do\n\nI go to give kudos to Mitch McConnell don't don't get carried away not generally I think he's been a lousy generally but he's been very good on this issue with Kavanaugh very good\nHe hasn't buckled not yet\nAnd he went to the floor of the United States Senate today and in part here's what he said touch five go\nOf course from their hours after judge Kavanaugh was enough suffering the Democratic leader made the announcement that he now become famous [noise]\nFollow ... is a federal law after that another Democrat on the rich are
