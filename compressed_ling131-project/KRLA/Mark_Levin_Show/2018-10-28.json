E. E. L. as in a real a film\nHe teaches film and the law and he helps direct the street law clinic in which students teach legal concepts to high school students\nAs a law student he felt that his duty to keep liberty in the classroom and practice he continues as a teacher earning him the gratitude of his students\nNot sure what his professors said at the time [noise]\nHe joined professor David vendor in pioneering the school of laws clinical program in early Nineteen Seventy feet primarily teachers evidence\nHe combines art with the law and as analyze and observed every movie pretty much ever created about lawyers and the law\nBoy we got an interesting program for you today Tom\nHi everybody hey thanks for coming okay date dino\nEnough of this judge baloney enough of this lawyer baloney we got the real deal whole field going Airforce now I'm not kidding you on this [noise] you know the professor um is a a sucker for ... professor at UCLA\nOr his students love him enormously and he brings something in the legal profession which you don't see too much [noise]\nHe has an artistic view of things you know generally lawyers or you're right you're on your guilty or innocent Jersey and um they ... they fall in love with\nBut here the professor has gone a different route not only does he know evidence and knows how to teach evidence and those courses but also he's looked at how lawyers are the are depicted on screen and I've done this a little bit they've dino to be honest I've done a couple of 'em\nLectures on persuasion ... and how lawyers persuade\nOne of the ways you persuade is total belief in the client and one of the movies that we'll discuss here is a film about her lawyer that totally believed in his client who says\nThe defendant is not guilty [laughter] you know and uh some of the ah some of the things we've looked at her total belief in principles to cross examination of Jack Nicholson ah on the stand\nWhere he says you lie under the very freedom that I provide you and then the question manner in which I provided [noise]\nI Wish you would simply say thank you and then the cross examination question is is you order the code red your yeah right I did [noise] um so both those people believed in the principals involved and enormously and those are ways of persuasion are\nThe soft sell to persuade her [noise] Henry Fonda in\nThe jury he's in there with the jury and\nHe says well you know that knife really here let me show this knife\nAnd steady set up the jury they said there was a very unusual knife wouldn't it Oh yes it was nothing like it no there isn't a cook them all in and many slams triplicate knife on the table and [noise] so the law profession uh\nIsn't the persuasion business and how you persuade and so forth and I think that the movies teach us a lot I don't know if they're all entirely accurate or I'm going to ask professor a\nAbout his views on this but David you know it's really great to have to professor with us he's given the so much thought I'm so excited to hear what he has to say welcome professor Bergman to the show\nThank you it's a really great to be Tom thanks for inviting me how did you get this way okay how about that\nI [noise] well my uh the love of movies started pretty early I grew up in in LA uh in terms of a courtroom movies\nI when I started teaching evidence I was looking for a a way to interest students in the subject matter without just talking about principles or appellate court cases are looking for a way to have a variety of materials that we can talk about in the classroom\nBecause I think whatever you do you get bored if you keep doing the same thing every day so I I started looking for\nA clip from courtroom movies or that we can analyze a with the students just as though they were a actual lawyers doing actual things because\nYou know believe it or not Tom sometimes or judges in actual cases don't make the correct decision sometimes lawyers asking proper questions witnesses given proper answers so regardless of the truth of the uh\nTestimony depicted in the clip or the students they'll have to think about what what would you do with that actually happened in a courtroom and your lawyer involved in that case\nYou know I'm going to tell you something I did a little research on you not only from your legal background and you're teaching background and your movie background [noise] but um I have a couple of plants over there at that school off and I asked them what do you think of the professor\nIs one young woman sent me this is a true story because he only clash you never skip [laughter]\nAbout that fall a lot here that I've ever asked that question is about a nice thing to say it is lovely to hear\nA you know I think that as a law school a teacher it it goes back to what you're talking about time for a courtroom lawyer\nOr maybe just about anyone if you you have to demonstrate passion and I always feel that if I don't demonstrate why I'm interested in what we're talking about in class [noise] why should the students be interested in it so I Try to teach in a way that suggests my passion and interest in the subject matter\nYou remind me a lot of demand McClintock a partner or from\nWho's the only artistic person in the firm ... without a doubt at least the only artistic lawyer Amanda I'd give me ... ...\nOh I think they do quite a bit I think for most people\nMost of what they know about the law lawyers the legal system or comes from movies and TV shows\nUh you know not long ago it was a you've heard of the ah television judge judge Judy or the California judicial commission gets more complaints about judge Judy than any actual judge people watch that on television and\nI think that she's an actual yet and are are they object to her rulings are manner ah so yes I think people take you know in a judge or a lawyer and a movie or TV show says\nThis is a rule I think uh people uh accept that as that must be the ruler they wouldn't say it\nWhen a when a TV series a legal TV series are popular and they sort of come and go or movies legal movies become popular and they come and go when they're popular isn't it true that\nWe normally them see a boost in applications to a law schools\nYes about uh well I guess over Twenty years ago now LA law is one of the best thing that ever happened to law school or a enrollments because uh that glamorize the work of lawyers they seem to be having a a wonderful time while earning huge salaries and\nNow that motivated people go to law school a\nThousand roughly Twenty years before that when I was a applying to law school I think we had more social justice so oriented films like inherit the when to kill a mocking bird and and people saw that and saw the legal profession as a way to have a positive impact on society\nProfessor Saturday Night\nSeven o'clock ... I'm In the sixth grade Perry Mason baby man he laid it out it was a total gentleman his one loss record was phenomenal\nAnd as a matter of fact I uh I that was the reason I Want to be a lawyer later on they had another show on that was the worst for a little bit more feisty but at least Perry was awesome\nAnd matter of fact I I said this these very words to a organization I Belong to the international academy a trial lawyers and they said to me Hey Tom\nPerry was a lousy lawyer I said what are you talking about a lousy lawyer how about that one last record okay but one last record is great\nBut this guy didn't know duly squad about the case until seven twenty when polled Drake would come in with the surprise witness\nAnd indeed addict has just did a pretty good job yes she did okay [noise]\nYou're listening to champions of justice with tons of rowdy and demanded McClintock in our guest today is professor Paul Bergman is a professor of law at UCLA also the co author of real justice the court room goes to the movies will be dealing on and off with the book throughout today's program\nAnd we're dealing with as well some of the other aspects of the law and justice Tom you want to talk more about persuasion uh tell me more about that from your perspective I mean\nYou represent clients that have a lot at stake so you really need to do a lot of persuasion you know you do\nBut more importantly the words that you use\nTo make sense to the people that are listening to them [noise] it doesn't do any good to be talking a in a\nMath to people that aren't really know anything about man you got to talk to people in terms of they truly understand that just like addict has just did a few minutes ago [noise]\nAnd the ability of a lawyer I think and how you're gauge how successful you'll be his the ability to be able to persuade with the truthfulness of the case and being able to put it out there\nHow much preparation we heard earlier about the preparation middle lawyer did him in the movie my cousin Vinny how much preparation do you need to do how much do you have to be up on the subject matter that you're dealing with in the courtroom\nTons of ... you know we use mock juries a professor and um we tell the story in different ways we get a reaction back\nAnd it's all the same story but it's tools is a different emphasis and so forth and it's very interesting that um this type of ... this works on this type of ... this works because this client has everything invested in you\nAnd we're going to start the case against the Dodgers in a couple of weeks and that client has everything invested in a ... and if we don't do the best possible job is going to be terrible and\nSome days I'm especially when things work out well in a courtroom as you're driving back to the office you say holy Toledo you know can you imagine getting paid to do this this is so much by other days Paul you know it's not quite as good\nRight you're listening to champions of justice with dumped already ended Amanda McClintock our guest today is professor Paul Berkman he is a professor of law at UCLA also the co author of real justice the courtroom goes to the movies Amanda\nWhat do you think of your favorite ... how evidence of you in a movie\n[noise] well you there's so many I I Would uh I I Would give an example from a film that are probably not too many people have ever seen now I'll go back to the mid forties for a movie that I write about in real justice a called a criminal court and\nAh in this movie a defense lawyer is\nA representing the clients charged with murder as they usually are in sales at a time I know you do great work and civil cases but allergy by and large audience that seemed to like to see a movies in which somebody is charged with murder or so anyway and is a\nFilm the or a defense lawyers or cross examining a witness who claims to have been standing on a street corner a when a defendant ran up pulled out a gun\nAnd shot the person standing next to him so he's your classic eye witness who points to the a defendant there in court is the person who ran out and pulled out the gun\nI add in cross examination they a defense lawyer becomes increasingly are angry accuses him of lying the a\nProsecutor objects the judge says what's wrong with you or you know you can't behave yourself I'm going to have to kick you out of the courtroom a and a defense lawyer gets angrier and angrier and angrier and says it's obvious there's no\nChance for justice in this courtroom I'm going to have to take justice in my own hands and with that he pulls out a\nA a gun from his pocket guy waves that around the courtroom and the witness who says he stood calmly by watching this or defend it on a street corner pull out the gun a dive for cover behind a witness chair\nOr the jurors dive for cover the prosecutor dies to cover the or a spectators rush out of the uh a courtroom\nAnd at that point the or a defense lawyer goes and asked the jurors to get up and a look at a a witness who says he said calmly by uh watching a will for murder take place as he cowardice behind a witness chair\nOr so I Love that that demonstration I Love that used to be a testimony to demonstrate that uh it's implausible and what's really interesting about that is that basically took place in an actual case that was tried in Los Angeles\nOr in the early Nineteen hundreds the lawyer was Rogers are probably somebody I heard of\nThat I have indeed matter of fact I [noise] you know they they know if you take from one person it's called stealing if you take from everybody it's research I've read it early Roger stuff and I've read a bunch of a whole other lawyers great stuff and have stolen from a mall [noise] so on the way over though\nWe're talking about this amendment such a date dino no kidding is truly one of the finest lawyers in California had knowledge by by everybody hands were coming over to do the show Amanda says you know Tom women do or not treated very well in the movies go ahead man to\nReading your book cover to cover and of course it's really really a great read fake ... movies ... very few that feature female lawyer\n... positive light can you think of any [noise]\nAh well probably the [noise] it's amazing we probably have to go back about sixty years of my math isn't too good or to Adams red\nAnd uh I ... I think the portrayal of the lawyer there are portrayed by Katherine Hepburn or who really uh uh takes on a a a client who's accused of trying to kill her\nHusband because these are carrying on an affair [noise] uh and she said this is really an early feminist movie where\nAre you know she asked the or as she talks about how the unwritten law would protect demand in that situation that it doesn't protect women\nUh that uh all she's asking more as the justice that a man would get in this situation to be made it out\nFor a woman and she's probably the strongest image of a female lawyer and the most positive image\nOr that we have a sale even though that movie was made a around Nineteen fifty and here we are about a more than sixty years later still waiting for another positive image in a lot\nOf the current films that at the beach or a female lawyers a few good men was one of them are Demi Moore her character was not portrayed a very uh nicely\nNot at all she supposedly in the film the lawyer that has all the experience\nUh yet uh I Believe his name is lieutenant Kathy played by Tom Cruise\nA although he's never tried a case in his life uh spends most of his time playing a softball or all of a sudden he takes over and tells her how we're going to do things and and she just kind of fades away into the woodwork that is really an embarrassing portrayal\nThere's an interesting uh sort of a hybrid between these two and that is from the movie legally blond oh yeah ... one of their dosing legally blonde yeah take a listen to this and it kind of touches on okay here's how you cross examine but also here's how you do your research years how you know what you're talking about\nI think that's when [noise] what have you done earlier that day [noise]\nI got I got a lot say went to the gym set apart and came home [noise]\nSo you've gotten [noise]\nI Believe the witness has made it clear that she was in the shower [laughter]\nYeah I think [noise]\nWith you [noise] to a year since I was trial in that [noise]\nSo now around after I talked to my phone cut back on the outside to talk\nTo the market stretch\nFully that same day debate about the highway teach our contacts especially the completely hiked the Appalachian cat attacks\nWhy is this where I live in a I have a point I comment\nThen make it [noise] and [noise]\nCan you trace them are sort of cross lines when she got her down [noise]\nBecause they got what\nExactly it gets if not the first car no role as part of your forbidding torture ... least twenty four hours after getting upon their risk at the accident in the money and luckily [noise] yes when\nSomebody had said thirty times so far and I like the well aware it's real\nAnd in fact you weren't washing your hair your white because you're still intact when you've heard the guy\nFast on helping you recover so that sixty nine and you get the whole ... that's our final flew home people you need that girl you need that for the kids do you

fight before so never had an election or they just say the night here it is so you know where do we know how to fight them how to win\nIn fact one of the articles I read about you said that some of the other times you've run people thought oh somebody else is going to beaches and you've kind of beat the odds they're one of the advantages that you talk about having\nIs that you are one of these Congress persons who comes back to the district Seventy times or so uh you you are on the streets you in the community here in the local stores you don't make Washington DC you're home do you\nKnow we did a good Seventy trip across country last year so that's that's thirty five weeks or so or that we did the trips and and I said I Would do that I spent you know my house is in Southern California to my district or my wife said look you've never strike hearing in the community\nAnd more kids are here so I Will come back for a couple of Southern California um but that that was a commitment and I've done that on and people see you know I was\nI had Fifteen minutes in between appointment yesterday and I stopped by vons to grab a couple of times\nAnd the guy saw me and earning seven minutes great are always seeing which way they were in a in a park that uh that we like about you so you know that that's part of a deal to hear what you've got to be able to uh look people in your age and will do and say hey here I Am or you got\nSo as we mentioned Democrats have targeted your district and others to try to retake the house how important the easiest that voters get out to the polls and keep you in office one easy at stake in this election\nOh there's a lot at stake um yeah we talked to a friend with them and people out there that say you know we don't want to be in office I say well you got to get your your folks to your friends your\nYour um Facebook friends at all that out to vote because uh you're looking at a corner me right now whether it's exploding\nAnd ah you know Herman forty seven years that we actually have more young people to take the jobs where the three point seven percent unemployment hits the lowest unemployment for black and Latino that it's ever been recorded\nSo these are things that we should keep going and the other thing is\nYou know a year ago you would start a conversation or the or are we going to go to war with North Korea that's not conversation right now because of foreign policy that it actually work with its foreign policy but actually walking so there's an awful lot to look out and uh and say\nBoy it so it's good out there but if you want to keep it going this is the way we're going to do it\nSteve night is with us twenty fifth congressional district going for reelection there\nSaw an article in I guess it was one of the Senate rule or the Southern California newsgroup papers that said Republicans in California have a tough go at it because\nThey want to support Donald Trump but they don't want to lose voters by being too supportive what what do you think do you support the president are you standing with him or do you have to distance himself to win\nWell I I you know I get the same thing with the president that's in all they're doing something good that they're saying hey this is a great a great is becoming aired minutes or something that we have a a we'll talk more than we are vocal there to 'em\nAnd and we get that went with the terrorists so newspapers are good though jerks of solar I I did that on to a discharge petition that building in Congress so\nWe are supportive and ah and if there's something that we're not only will make it go but\nBut we're always very respectful are just like we were President Obama on the administration but in this administration has been very open to working with the issues the terrible newspapers was was turned back very quickly and I think that's part of walking with us\nSo it's not a it's not a distinctive or anything like that it's just to say hey I'm represent my district and uh and these are the issues that are coming up so can we talk about them and then very very open to what was so so that's been good\nYou know congressman night defined your candidate\nYour candidacy and defined your opponent what are the differences people have to I mean they get inundated with these you know car just come in the mail and they got to sit down with their ballot and figure things out there in in your most direct way help us understand the two paths there's a clear path between your candidacy and your opponent\nWell you know I I don't talk about my ... year I'll give you a good in a colonel\nOr example of how it's going I I don't see my opponent out in the community and the creator you tells me that we we never see her she ah it obviously good primary or so we think it should be doing that but being out in the community is a big part\nOf the record I sat on a city council and the assembly in the Senate and now in Congress and I understand how a lot of the workings of government or ... and how to get something done\nAnd then the connection to the community and getting something done through their one of the biggest items in Korea is the same exploit that's been going on for twenty four years I mean this last debate\nMy opponent said you know I didn't even know what that was until just recently and you make a big deal out of it is a big deal it's the biggest deal for the community\nAnd they told us that over the last four years so I think that that I'm not just the experience because that that that shows by somebody who's never been elected in office\nBut just the nobody can tell me what she wants to do we've been very clear and what we ought to do was stand up for the military in aerospace veteran care small business loans are our priorities\nAnd uh and we're very good at it what we hear something from that says hey it's just this is what I wanted to do what I get in Congress except for that particular to our work with people or I Want to get things done no thank you so we've been we've been direct and we've been successful\nNest talked about rallying the campaign getting people out to the obviously the way it works in his shoes you got to get more people to vote for you then for her what is your strategy how are you how are you connecting how can you choose this takes place\n[noise] so what will get a lot of things there are many other campaign don't that we can talk about because we're successful at it\nBut it it uh at the totality of the whole issue I mean social may have shared all male male and radio and TV I have a huge role but it's also getting out and talking to many people as you can I just came from a group of about ... veterans\nDay and I told each one of them have to keep this don't you've got to get ten people and so on the Gulf War commits to get out and vote then they're not you know it's it's a little cohesion than the last couple of elections\nBecause social media in such an impact but still it's still call can hurt many people as you can\nAnd it pressing on them home for ...\nCents when they called retail politics where you you you meet and greet you you know she can ... babies whatever it takes to meet people you're doing is you're getting out there\nAnd you're in the community and that probably has a greater value than a flyer just lands in your mailbox junk mail\nOut or we we absolutely who though because fires or you know Ninety protest about politics and people get upset at politics after after a while\nWell we trust the person on the person who's written for interviewing there shouldn't be in the nursery and you know this is this is what we've done that's wicked crossed the politics of all the nasty camp during\nA work to some extent also work in the ... and we're really hold up the milk or in the community in court and the people who are just always being and for those people builds up frost book people will continue to vote and then we'll we'll Homer so\nHow can people hope you you're going to retain the twenty fifth congressional district where can they go to go on line what you do the ...\nUm wouldn't go online and we tickle in tears of course we know a whole whole or me or ... we all know oh boy we're working on about thirty five hundred forty four hundred doors ... day\nA war movies in your little rural ... eight to ten thousand cold cold in the interest making sure that people know the ... the huge\nIt's a little hard so it's just a war zone and this is all the suits you go when they go to sleep for gr American can help us solve this would want to we would love to have all\nNight long religion the twenty first congressional district like so much for taking time to be with us on the program today burglar are always a pleasure\nTo politics issues with Larry marina marina ... joining us yes on proposition ... spokesperson for that thank you so much for being with us on the program today\nThanks for having me what one is proposition eleven\n[noise] um so I think it's best if we first start out with why it's on the ballot and then that will help you get a better idea\nSo in two thousand sixteen the California Supreme Court ruled on a decision that had to do with private security guard in their breath breaks and it said that private security guards could no longer be reachable tearing their rest break even

from Washington DC and local news or do we cover everything happening here in the morning every one Monday morning it's on a on a Saturday the answer\nYour dishes with Larry marina [noise]\nOne of the propositions that voters will face on the ballot in November proposition eight\nHas to do kidney dialysis\nAnd to help us understand that some of the new on each side we are veterans John Roberts\nEasy to follow just as a kid the doctor in riverside\nThank you so much Dr Robertson for being on the program today\nThis morning I guess we need to kind of back up and\nReally kind of get the big picture on this story because we see a lot of ads we hear the term dialysis if someone has kidney disease in his own that they probably understand what that is but give us a few working definitions of the year you were talking about here\n[noise] in in America we have about thirty million people with chronic kidney disease\nIncreasing uh primarily because we have an aging population and an explosion of diabetes which is probably the biggest contributor to kidney disease and if you get kidney disease it progress to slowly over time won't do a lot of things are hard to protect its progression but\nMany do progress and when it progress as to the point where you have less than Fifteen Percent of your function left\nYou require something called dialysis are renal replacement therapy\nFor various forms the most prevalent in in this country is called in center\nWill look I also see where it where you probably have ... side of the road centers where they there for ... for the vetoes name on it and and and these are outpatient settings where\nPatients with kidney failure or who've been identified in various ways um get their treatments usually three times a week or a on a ship either modeled on the friday or Tuesday Thursday Saturday\nAnd so so do we have this ... dialysis as these centers that take place what is proposition eight about what is it asking us to do\n[noise] um it's confusing because the people that sponsored proposition may have a motive which isn't clear\nAh what what they want to do is limit the amount of profits for dialysis centers can charge private insurers are above Medicare and in a state that this er this for quality purposes but the problem is\nThere's no mechanism on here too I'm actually rebate that to a patient or took quality care it actually goes back to insurers and the people that are sponsoring is are are in the FBI you ... ... in it's in an attempt by using a sort of a smoke screen of\nA quality a to a list of providers that having complied with allowing them to unionize because the people that work in these centers haven't elected voluntarily to\nJoin a union which have a right to do and so ah their second approach is to make this very uncomfortable for these providers to basically three segments of the market there's\nA company called the Vita dialysis or the health care\nThere's that for seniors medical care and then there's a bunch of independent film in California the biggest independent non profit provider is is satellite dial says primarily in the area but there's some representation as well\nSo what do we as voters need to understand it sounds like it's kind of a personal battle between labor and insurance companies and big companies where where do we fit in what what do we need to understand\nWell first it's complex but the first thing you need to understand that if it had an immediate and significant negative impact patience\nIn other words people that receive dialysis are quite vulnerable as you can imagine they're quite sick\nOr you don't survive if you have your kidney function and if you go to a center to get treatments um ... you covered that spot go to the center and get your treatment and then go home and take all the medicines you need to stay alive if this proposition\nUm which focuses on the main area that these companies make their profit\nThey they see it's harder and harder to make a living in California hotter they'll put gas in the tank how to pay for rent\nFor college to safe for your children women just do simple things that's going on vacation or you know having a meal out with your family it's people are you know don't believe that governments working for them\nThat the special interest in Lafayette and the corporations are the ones who control Sacramento and we just keep on seeing higher taxes and less services and I want to go ahead and exposed to that and bring my experience as a as a businessman out to the controllers office\nSo you're looking to find things that the state is buying that they shouldn't have to or they're overpaying are kind of walk us through a for instance\nSo for instance let's go ahead and take the high speed rail\nIf I take the high speed rail and I look at that as a controller sees nothing wrong with that project and I say that because she has refused to audit\nWhen I take a look at a project that says we're going to have a hundred miles north of track and now it's five hundred and twenty and they're cutting now for cost\nSavings when it's supposed to be a high speed rail up to two hundred and twenty miles an hour now one third of the track is going to have speed restrictions were getting these up up up to a hundred and ten miles an hour top speed on certain areas\nYou using union Pacific lines that even high speed lines child from twenty twenty completion to twenty thirty three if we're lucky and they take twenty thirty three we can only reach that date possibly is instead of spending three point one million dollars a day we're spending twenty seven million dollars a day\nBut the price tech has jumped up to a hundred million a hundred billion dollars\nAnd the controller says there's nothing here to see now the biggest problem that I have besides colonel auditing this program\nIt's to realize that when voters approve this back in two thousand eight under pop on a mandated about one third of the funding would come from the state government one third from the federal government and one third from the private sector or the federal government has stopped paying for this\n[noise] excuse me and the private sector has not have been put one penny into this and if that was the authorizing age and it mandated that funding parameters why the state funding a hundred percent of this so I'm going to go ahead and whole payment on the high speed rail on day one\nAnd the fund is because it doesn't comply with the authorizing agent and the well the people so on day one I'm planning on saving taxpayers a hundred billion dollars\nShow if you do this you know that people who make a living off that those who are the labor and the material and what this is a big boondoggle that sentence or will it they're not going to support you you know the right\nOf course they are supporting a candidate and that's why a I'm a controller for the people\nThat's why I refuse to take political action committee money a lobbyist money union money Oregon we get blamed as Republicans you guys are big corporate is I don't take corporate money\nFor its not grass roots grassroots organizations I don't take the money people have to know I'm ... I'm a man of principle um even if I did take a you know say a pac man you're special interests\nIt wouldn't change where I Am but I Want to make sure that people understand I won't take it and that I'm going to do the job that needs to be done because it's not currently being done so they can go ahead and come after me all they want\nI don't mind I'm here to protect the people I'm here to be the chief taxpayer wash out to California needs\nConstantly knows who does is with us running for controller so when all is going on with that in your right the cost overruns the a boondoggle it is how come it continues easy truly Jerry Brown's legacy that he's popped up\nWell I think there's just so many picks up a trough that are high you know feeding off of this from union to ah there's a lot of uh you know you would say supposedly business organizations that are supposed to be business friendly that\nI Want the high speed rail so there's interest kind of on both sides unfortunately uh from some of the cloning or Republicans to you know turning a blind eye because they're you know business backers are making millions off of this and just like the unions and all the other government contractors in workers that are\nMaking money off of this and we know the trains not going to be high speed we know it it's not even getting a help with traffic congestion whatsoever our own studies say pass around one percent and I think that's being generous\nAnd it's going to be slower and it costs more money to take a train from Los Angeles to San Francisco and then it would be to take a plane I mean you could literally get on the plane from LAX flight to San Francisco get off fly back and you still wouldn't make a one way trip\nUh with the suppose that high speed rail so this is just a perfect example of government waste and corruption and it needs to end and the controllers position is the perfect position to highlight this and stop the payments and finally I killed this project\nDemocrats seem to have had a lock on statewide offices over the past decade ... going on and make that happen and how do you feel that can be broken\nWell I think one of the problems and issues that a lot of people have is they go into the voting booth and they just don't see people don't see Constantine Australia's they the Republican and it's hard sometimes to break through that paradigm where people say hey you know not all Republicans I was saying there are some Republicans are just shouldn't vote for\nI'm not going to leave my my message of fiscal responsibility of protecting the taxpayers\nTo being that person who says hey you know I'm not taking that corporate money I'm not taking that union money I'm not taking special interests I'm the I'm legitimately the person that's going to represent you and your interests and I think that crosses party lines I think\nPeople are so frustrated what's going on seeing you know reports and polls done I think it was in the LA Times recently that Seventy percent of people don't want to vote or feel frustrated because they don't think government work for them that it's no big business and a big special interests that control everything so why bother\nOr they don't believe they have a boy so I wanted to make sure that people know they have a voice\nThat I think that's what's going to cost ... party lines and you know also I think people are frustrated with how California's being one and I think people are more likely this election cycle well to cross party lines and vote for the white candidates instead of\nSimply voting for their party that they'd been for years because it's gotten us into a huge amount of back here in California\nThere is a ballot item that he's going to bring attention this year the choice the voters have to repeal the gas tax that may have a lot of people to the polls have you uh chosen to weigh in on that one or have used stewed away from endorsing her not liking your particular item\nOh no I'm actually the co chair of yes on sex with a gas tax repeal [noise]\nUm and I am fully behind it and yes I Do believe it's going to drive people to the polls that are behind it not because of that I Would still take it if it was an unpopular position because it's the right position when we take a look at\nBefore the gas tax increase only twenty percent of the gas tax what's going towards road repair when I had a debate with my opponent recently\nAnd we're talking about you know the money that's being diverted and she says she admitted it she says you know it's because of deferred maintenance and that's why we we need our tax increase but you don't need a tax increase\nOr you just use all the money stopped diverting it use all the money and let's start using our money and patiently and effectively we pay up to four hundred and Seventy percent more than three four hundred and Seventy percent more\nTo maintain a mile of highway\nAnd free way than compared to other states are ministry of costs are up to three hundred and sixty percent more than other states when you combine all road maintenance is and so forth it's two hundred and fifty percent more that we pay\nWe have the amount we have the money we're wasting billions of dollars and we're diverting were using for ... projects and shoring up pensions and other things we have the money should stop\nTaxing folks seven hundred and Seventy nine dollars and twenty cents for the average family of four maybe nothing to Sacramento politician that might be the costs of bunch for them with their lobbyist friends before we'll hardworking Californians\nThat's a lot of money it's time we stopped taking advantage and sort of representing the people and make sure they have that money in their pockets so they can provide the things that they need I mean that is literally for the average people spend on ... ah the to the average tuition costs for a college student for one year of books\nThat's around eight hundred dollars this is a lot of money and they just think it's nothing and it's time we go ahead and take back our money this is our pop Thirteen of our generation it's fine\nTo put a check on the politicians that just tax us tax us taxes with no accountability and the problem with SP one especially there is that it's not a one time tax increase they don't want to have the discussion again every year the taxes will go up based on the consumer price index of two thousand and Nineteen\nThe taxes go back up two thousand twenty and so forth and so forth by two thousand and twenty ths estimated we'll have about with regulatory fees and taxing feet up to two dollars per gallon and feeds it's time we put a stop to this and that's why I'm yes on prop six\nMy final thirty seconds where can people find you know well\nIf you want to learn more about me Constantine Australia's for California state control of the best place to go to my website and that the A. as in California so see a controller dot com and that's Constantine us for a gift for California state controller and you can reach me at the a controller dot com\nLet's talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're found in our diet and all are considered supersede the green tea human humans ... why do you want to combine to read there's always a message to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect do you make each other more spin corner real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason to\nPut them all in separate product they do go very well together as you said they're all food derived so it's kinda like you can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and\nThat's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in\nGroups of protective compounds that are both antioxidant so they actually retired the aging process of the cells in our bodies\nAnd protect our organ systems till they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough I also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting resume or a trial\nIn one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nIn the headlines in the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing\nI Know in Asia and they've been using it for thousands of years for healthy aging but what you've seen recently in the press you know you told me the nutrition research journal and it's July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased\nPlasma anti ... activity in whole blood get assigned to recap\nSome of these headlines you tell me why you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume that don't actually\nWind up in the body in any significant amount\nThe green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world\nAre very well absorbed they improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is you get this great concentration of antioxidants substances\nWhich a protective compounds floating around in the body and protecting the cells\nOf your body your organs every part of your body from premature destruction due to exposure to environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to fire on when we take in\nThe right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are the right antioxidants our bodies produce more of its own super protective compound called glue\nTo ... so you're taking the green tea extract\nYou build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called\nGlue the thigh on so it is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplement ingredients do\nBut it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nLet's switch gears and talk about this for human which is number two on your list by the way these three ingredients are all found in the new green tea combo formula would be offering free brought on a few minutes we'll talk to me about the human which is spelled C. U. R. G. U. M. I. N. now most people haven't heard of him but scientists and researchers know it's one of the most\nPowerful supersedes on the planet\nYou can positively influence R D an AA meeting joint comfort healthy inflammation in more can you share some of the incredible headlines on human and tell us why you use this patented B. C. M. Ninety five formula of crude human which seven times ...\nOkay well first of all I think while people might not know the term Kirk him and they may well no ... which is a yellow spice and it shows up in curies and\nIt's part of the five thousand year old Indian ... system of medicine I've been studying tumor wreck and its derivative ... since the Nineteen seventies\nAnd I'll say this right off the bat that they are almost no plant materials in the world as extensively studied as there's a couple of thousand studies can be found in the scientific and medical literature we know that Kirk human is powerfully antioxidant\nWe know that it has a remarkable capacity to protect the liver and deliver is our primary detoxify Oregon\nIt greatly enhances joined health so people are experiencing joint discomfort due to overuse this really helps to relieve that and it's also what we called cardio protective\nIt helps to protect the heart it helps to maintain normal healthy cholesterol and one last thing that is really kind of astounding is that Kirk human\nActually causes your body to produce what are called neuro protective factors in the brain so it causes your body to produce these\nAgents in the brain that protect the actual to issue of the nerves in the brain itself there's almost nothing else that we know of that does this and specifically the B. C. M. Ninety five that you mentioned offers about seven times\nThe absorption of any other Kurt cumin extract so when you take two hundred fifty milligrams of this stuff about seven times the activity that you would if you took say a comparable amount of another curriculum and extract so this in my opinion is\nOne of the most life enhancing protective totally beneficial substances on earth and it has just decades of scientific and medical studies to back it up\nChris I Know that we talk to them or do you buy the green tea in the current human your new green tea GR liquid ... formula which purity is given away for free today just tell me about the third nutrient on the list the rich ritual which is super hot right now here was on some of the headlines and the science behind ... spiritual\nI notes from red wine and French love it but why is it on your shortlist\nWell Rivera trial is one of those remarkable compounds\nThat I just sort of shake my head at how many different things that does it is found in wine grapes it also shows up and cranberries what we know about resveratrol is that like green tea and also like Kirk human extract it's profoundly antioxidant\nBut more than that it shows significant properties when you look at some of the things in the body if that happened during aging as a result of\nFat accumulation in tissue and insulin sensitivity resveratrol helps to protect against those things so it's a powerful immune regulator and\nYou know our immune system is responsible for keeping us healthy it is remarkably beneficial for the heart and this is why it's considered one of the key is to the so called French\nParadox you know the French drink a lot of red wine they eat a lot of cheese they smoke cigarettes and they stay slim and they have good cardiovascular health but was there a trial appears to be key in math and additionally\nThere is a brain benefit like there is with the current cumin\nWith blood flow to the brain\nSo when you take ... you'd get rain blood flow this means you get more oxygen to the tissues of the brain your brain cells stay healthier longer your mind is clear sharp and focused\nSo this is on my short list for all those reasons and for about a dozen more that would just plain take too long to explain\nAgain we're talking with Chris killing all the names the Indiana Jones of natural medicine sometimes ... medicine hunters well first let's laser in on this wonderful formula you greeted to junction ...

techniques of a a little\nProvidence financial retirement show we're Cantonese ...\nWelcome to this week's show\nI'm Anthony ... and you know that I spend a lotta time on the show talking about investing for income as opposed to investing for growth\nAnd the primary reason is because my practice focuses on working with\nAre people really within five or ten years of retirement\nThat lets excessive their retirement is going to depend about how much income they have coming in not how big the size of their portfolio is at our core value as a firms to help you protect your principal and get the income you need from your portfolio to be able to supplement your other sources of income and Social Security and so on\nAnd still make sure you never run out of money\nAnd this is one of the reasons why we don't recommend our clients have a lot of money in the stock market\nThe stock market doesn't match up with our clients core values I mean think about it while the stock market protect your principal no\nEnd of the stock market give you income and the answer again is no so if your goal is to protect your principal and get income in the form of interest and dividends than the stock market just simply doesn't fit the bill\nAnd that is the primary reason why we focused on investing for income for my client base now at the same time I think it's important that you do understand my thoughts about the stock market because that's certainly going to have an influence on our recommendations as well\nAnd for those of you that I've listened to my show you know that I've been up there on the market now for probably three or four years maybe even five years at this point\nAnd yet the market seems to defy gravity and continue growing but if you're a quieter mind I think it's important for you to understand that my primary motivation and helping you invest for income doesn't have a lot to do with the stock market\nBuff more or less has to do with the fact that it does not support our core value of protecting your principal and giving you the lifetime income you need so that you don't have to worry about running out of money\nAt the same time I do believe that the market out some problems ahead and I've been concerned about the market for very long time and I'm Still concerned\nAs a matter of fact the longer we go without a big correction more concerned I be gum\nLike energy products including gasoline like taxes doesn't even count taxes so of gasoline and taxes go through the roof then guess what that is not going to affect the CPI but there's one other thing that doesn't affect the CPI is well\nInflation rate and that is food\nThe CPI does not count food items food prices can also go through the roof but that does not affect their increase the CPI numbers\nBut at the CPI does not even count food how can this be a true measure of inflation the answer I Believe is it can't\nAnd yet this keeps the reported inflation rate artificially low but it's really not to present like we're being told but then we have to ask well why would the government want to keep inflation figures low in the first place why even falsify this information why don't they count food and their inflation figures\nWell there's two reasons first is that if inflation is increasing the Federal Reserve has to raise rates so that the economy does not overheat and if the fed raises rates it increases the amount of interest the government must pay on a stat well let me ask you if you happen to oh Twenty one trillion dollars on a credit card you on interest rates to be high\nOr do you want to interest rates to be low of course you want them to be alone and this is why the government is keeping rates artificially low for every quarter percent that the fed raises rates it costs the government fifty billion dollars a year and interest\nYeah you heard me correctly that's fifty billion dollars a year in additional interest but that's okay for a minute\nBut there's another reason why the fed wants to keep rates low too\nBecause of Social Security every year Social Security recipients are supposed to receive a cost of living adjustment right the state pays with inflation\nBut for the next Fifteen Years or so\nThere's going to be ten thousand new baby boomers are starting to collect Social Security every single day today ten thousand new people filed for Social Security tomorrow another ten thousand well while the next day another ten thousand fathers and this is going to go on for the next Fifteen Years\nNow if the government has to increase your Social Security checks to adjust for inflation do they want inflation to be high or do they want inflation to be as low as possible\nOf course they want it to be low so they exclude energy and taxes and food items so that they come up with is artificially low number so that they can avoid or minimize the amount that they have to reduce your Social Security every year kind of makes sense right\nBut it's a very misleading you have the government promising to give you a living adjustments\nOn your Social Security and yet at the same time the same government is in charge of determining what inflation is in some regards it's almost like having the Fox washing the hands that's right and all of this is\nA part of why I Believe the recovery over the last decade has been based on artificial information and again if you want to learn more about this and dig into this a little more than you got to get your hands\nThis book that a good friend of mine Jeff small wrote called turning financial planning right side up and he talks about all this and he talks about where it's going to lead and what the end result of the market is likely going to be and unfortunately his conclusions aren't great\nAnd if you want to copy of this book you can certainly go on to Amazon and buy it the author's name is Jeff small\nAnd the book is called turning financial planning right side up or we have a few copies left here if you call us before we run out I'll be more than happy to get a copy in your possession and I won't even charge you for it will just mail it to you but you have to call me so the number to call us aid for for seven eight eight call again that number's eight four four seven eight eight call\nOr if you would rather just tax that word a book\nTwo three one three one three one\nAnd one of my team members will get in touch with your next week and let you know what you need to do to get your hands on a copy\nBut Jeffers pretty clear and pinpointing some of the problems that he thinks are stock market in the economy we're going to go through in a fairly short period of time\nBut in addition to the fact that the government printed money for\nSix or seven years and what is in the Twenty one trillion dollars of debt which ended up itself as artificial and in addition to the fact that the unemployment and inflation rates are really artificially manufactured numbers that don't really add up to reality\nThere was one other thing that's going on out there that has been a primary driver of the market over the last couple of years and really the primary reason why the market in two thousand Seventeen and Eighteen has done as good as it has and this is something that you don't hear talked about a lot but\nI think it may be the most egregious reason as to why the market is avoided a correction up to this point\nAnd that is stock buybacks\nCompanies buying back their own stocks you know last July CNBC published an article that they titled companies by back their own shares is the only thing keeping the stock market a flow right now in this article goes on to discuss how important stock buybacks have been in propping up the market in the article author makes this statement\nSocks right now are hanging by a thread boosted by a bonanza of corporate by on rivals in market history\nAnd the NBC is not the only one talking about this Fortune Magazine titled an article\nWhy stock market buyback should make investor nervous forms also wrote an article that was titled why it's raining share buybacks on Wall street the economist has called them and addiction to corporate cocaine\nWriters had called themself cannibal as Asian the Financial Times is called them an overwhelming conflict of interest and also in an article that won the McKinsey Award for the best article the year Harvard Business review\nHas called them stock price manipulation that's right stock price manipulation\nWhy is it manipulation when a company buys its own stock back while there's two reasons\nFirst it creates an artificial demand for the stock when there's a demand for the stock the stock price rises right so by purchasing its own shares the corporation creates a demand for the stock which causes the share price right but does is increase due to the fundamentals of the company or is it artificial\nI think you know the answer the second reason that stock buybacks manipulate the stock prices because of the earnings per share ratio you see earnings for shares of ratio that investors look at to determine how profitable the company is the more earnings per\nEach share of stock the more revenue a company is bringing in and presumably the more profitable therefore when evaluating whether to purchase the stock or not the earnings per share as one factor to consider\nAll be at a big one and the higher the earnings for share the more attractive the stock and therefore the greater than men so I'll hire a PS increase of the man or stock and yet\nOnly two ways to increase earnings per share the first ways to increase the earnings right now more earnings company has a higher they eat yet so other companies' earnings increase sodas if if he has but there is a second way to reduce the number of shares as well\nWhen it company buys back its own shares it takes shares out of the marketplace while\nLeaving the earnings the same this effectively increases the earnings per share making the company look better than it is but the company has not sold a new product they're not taken on a new customer they're not gained a new subscriber but yet the earnings per share has increased making the stock price more attractive\nWhich in turn creates a higher demand but is this the man based on fundamental or is this demand artificial clearly it his artificial Anna CNBC suggested it should make investors nervous\nHousehold names like Wells Fargo Pepsi Google visa and even lows have been buying back their own stocks and let's not forget the king of stock buybacks\nApple you realize in the first six months of two thousand eight dean apple bought back forty three and a half billion dollars of their shares is just unfathomable forty three and a half billion other shares\nGoldman Sachs has estimated that by the end of two thousand Eighteen stock buybacks will have hit the one trillion dollar mark that's trillion with the tea and because of this the stock market has been driven to record highs over the last two years amazing\nSo you might be saying okay so what what's the big deal companies are buying back their own stock here's the big deal we have to ask where they're getting money from after\nMost of them are borrowing the money at low interest rates to buy back their own shares so all they're doing is manipulating their balance sheets and because the Federal Reserve it kept interest rates so low it's given them the opportunity to be able to do that and corporate debt now is at an all time high\nBecause they're buying back their own shares manipulated their own stock prices and effectively and manipulating the stock market once again\nArtificial and it gets worse why because there is a
