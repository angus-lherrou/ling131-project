Supreme Court justice in history who was a big hero to liberals you know who it is right to William oh Douglas from ... Washington\nAnd justice Douglas or for thirty six years on the Supreme Court he wrote some of the most important legal decision some of which are kind of nutty but they're very important\nAnd justice Douglas had so many ethical problems and just named one of them she actually because he had so many alimony payments he had three ex wives\nAnd he had to write little articles to help meet the expenses because he wasn't generating enough money and he wrote articles\nFor a guy who happen to be a pornographer who had a case before the courts and he later than pay the money back but he was caught with that\nAnd and then she also wrote articles that had appeared in like a magazines that were some justices thought were pornography he didn't\nAnd just that plus the fact that he got involved with a Twenty one year olds who had been assigned to do a term paper and her college about justice Douglas he was married at the time he got involved with her it could be construed as sexual harassment and today's terms it didn't ruin his judgeship\nA and by the way there were attempts to impeach him and they were foolish and I opposed those attempts\nOr they were led by Gerald Ford who later became president of the United states\nAs a point over here is that when people say oh because he said I'm some in temperate things when he was giving testimony he can never be taken seriously as a judge\nClarence Thomas has had a fine career on the court he's made some by the way brilliant and amazing speeches since being confirmed on the court\nAnd uh I don't think he has been ruined by the charges against him or let them ruined him at all David I appreciate your call very much um do we have a time to go to the audio\nJeremy for from Cairo okay we are coming up well we're coming up to um somebody who is way beyond criticism Iraq [noise] well maybe not so beyond criticism and this particular movie remembered rock was going to go to the world's tallest\nRescue people flying through the air well the movie's called skyscraper worth checking out on DVD and video on demand\nWill tell you [noise] ...

of the clouds the\nNecklace fools into dereliction continue to protest the judges enter the Supreme Court complex today because they will not give up their incentivized by people like Hillary Clinton who gave a stupid interview to cross the on I'm On poor and what should she said Democrats cannot be civil with Republicans anymore\nQuote you cannot be civil with the political party that wants to destroy what you stand for and what you care about quote unquote says Hillary does in the same thing it apply to Republicans assuming Republicans want to\nOppose the Democratic party and what they care about why would Republicans ever work with Democrats they answer courses they cannot\nYou cannot be civil war the political party that wants to destroy what you stand for says Hillary in a tweet that to me means it's time to declare civil on civil war with the Democrats which is what the Trump Mr dead and did so well and let's put some of this in context\nAbout two or three days ago Republican Sen Cory Gardner of Colorado on Sunday a couple of days ago said his wife received his wife received a graphic text message with a video depicting ... heading at the gardener voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh's record on Saturday thousands of demonstrators spot and paid for\nBy George Soros stormed the halls of Congress of course Thursday Friday and Saturday and that protests continue today on Tuesday unbelievable also last week democratic intern Jackson Cosco\nWas a charge were burglary theft or personal information all kinds of crimes felonies\nWhen he a one on line and release private information about three senators sitting on the Judiciary Committee that being Senator Lindsey Graham Senator Mike Lee of Utah and Orrin Hatch of Utah\nIncluding home addresses and their personal cell phone numbers and of course Jackson Cosco was the so called an unpaid intern working for Sheila Jackson Lee a real clown from Texas\nAnd the truth came out he was on paid not by Jackson Lee but by George Soros funded group so somehow\nThese liberal left wing hid groups have hired so called interns to work for the Congress and the Senate\nAnd he has worked for senators before to dig up dirt on Republicans\nThird paying their home addresses and shipped out to many others then of course you had a two female activists bought and paid for by George Soros cornering Senator Jeff flake in an elevator screaming at him he had ten Cruz and his wife Heidi how that all of a restaurant by protesters\nPreparing the senators who questions about Kavanaugh than early on a junior at Sarah Sanders and homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen getting the same treatment of restaurants\nAnd so what's happening is they teach you all are head of the Democratic party Hillary Clinton\nIs telling her Davao taste to confront Republicans wherever you can find them make their lives uncomfortable how is that possible how's that fair of course it has not and so we're left with a situation where the American people have got to choose for weeks from tonight for weeks from today will be election day\nSo in twenty eight days we have to decide whether Maxine Waters and Hillary Clinton and the war war hero Richard Blumenthal and ah and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi should be in charge of the Congress where this behavior will become even more mainstream which to me is impossible winners and losers\nI was talking to Richard Samantha and author Richard Valdez earlier the great producers in the ... show to talk about the winners and losers of what happened with a with a course today Kevin ... on the U.S Supreme Court number one the biggest winner I think is due process in fairness\nThe principal and old fashioned principle that the mob does not rule and not the presumption of innocence supplies and that some sort of substantive and procedural due process must apply the second big winner is my president Donald\nJohn Trump notch you one more victory and his first what a twenty two months in office that Trump's scored a hundred and Democrats have scored zero\nThe economy is percolating like crazy the Mexico Canadian trade battle has been won by Trump including South Korea\nNext fall will be the goddess havens in Beijing and communist red China that takes about five hundred billion dollars a year so it in the last ten years they've taken out something like five trillion dollars to build their country and at the end of the day they need us\nA lot more than we need them so when Trump gets done with the Chinese is going to be the same thing that happened with Canada Mexico and South Korea\nAnd now according harassed mustn't that came out today that Trump's approval rating is sort of fifty one percent\nSo whether it's the economy immigration are federal judges I could not think\nOf a better president than Donald John Trump he makes Reagan almost looked like a liberal because unlike Reagan and the bushes who were pen cushions this guy fights back when Trump is hit he hits back Carter what he did on a Monday Night last night\nWith the Supreme Court saying that I hereby find you not guilty judge Kavanaugh you are an innocent man\nAnd he went after the Democrats with the other eight members of the Supreme Court sitting there and the Republicans to me it was beautiful it was wonderful this guy's got no backup ... stack up it continues to teach all of us about winning in Trump's world it's about the fight and you're fighting spirit and your ability to be\nKnuckle and think about this Kavanaugh\nWas a Yale middle aged judge who are educated and yell undergraduate and Moscow spend about twelve years on the second circuit court of appeals [noise]\nHe's not the kind of guy to fight like Trump\nBut when they push Kevin off further and further and further Kavanaugh\nKind of local looked over Trump and said that's my model that's the guy I Want to be they never imagined that it will be middle aged judge from Yale\nHeaded in him to fight back and no holds barred straight broiler fashion But Kevin all studied Trump he learned from Trump so all of his brilliance and eloquence all of his ah all of his grade school girls' basketball coach and you're teaching at Harvard would not helping all to win this fight\nYou at people like Chris Wallace of Fox News who said after the testimony of that liar and she was a liar Christine for she lied about what happened at a maximum she was mistaken at a minimum we might go over that later\nBut Chris Wallace of Fox News said after she testified that it's over for the Republicans the Republicans had a bad day I'm a trial attorney I see it all the time a witness testifies and you and you buy and hook line and sinker and then the other witness testifies and you say you know what\nI don't know what to believe now Kevin all he ... he in a sense hypnotic late took on Trump's personality any thought no holds barred bare knuckles and guess what Kevin all one by Trump rules he knows that if you want something in your life bad enough you gotta fight for justice Trump proved\nAnd ah he won the Supreme Court after\nChristine forward testified about the second front door and about afraid to fly and about the claustrophobia and how it changed your life\nAnd I thought okay that's under refuted evidence Kevin all got up and spoke and you know what I thought I cannot believe cabinet and then I waited for the next week to transpire and a dead and the next week clearly demonstrated that Christine forward was not telling the truth what was she lied or not to a different matter\nBecause she said there were four witnesses and every one of her witnesses refuted a story or had no memory of the gathering question whatsoever the therapist notes were critical to this\nThat she released to the Washington Post but not to the U.S Senate committee she said for boys tried to rape her when she was in her late teens and the time was in the Nineteen eighties now she says it was one boy\nAnd it was a in at the age of Fifteen not or late teens and it was Nineteen eighty two not the Nineteen eighties and she ...\nIt's on that because in the Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not even in Maryland He was in Connecticut so everything she said that the therapist was probably accurate because she said at six years ago before politics entered the fracas so when she said for boys tried to rape her\nShe she was in her late teens what Eighteen or Nineteen years old and the Nineteen eighties Nineteen eighty four eighty five eighty six\nThat didn't fit the scenario of Brett Kavanaugh\nChurch she flipped and change what she was saying in order to\nTry to take care of an old down and it didn't work and the second front door was put in twenty overweight and twenty nine because she wanted her psychologist slash therapist to have an office\nAnd direct entry into her house into a room so the second front door was put in not because she was scared of only one exit but because a person she wanted to run out some of her house\nTo a small business owner a psychologist to have a direct entry way and of course the other thing was she was afraid to get on planes her boyfriend of many years testify they took single propeller planes all over Hawaii that she traveled to Haiti travel do ally travel to Central America to travel to South America travel to Israel and travel to Europe\nHow is it does she swim all these places you know she flew everywhere including on single propeller planes which are quite claustrophobic if she was so nothing she said had any relationship to reality and over the week delayed brought about by Jeff Flake\nWhose last name by adjective describes his character refuted what she said and that's why Susan Collins put up on

Kennedy violate the norms of the presidency when he passed off as a young in turns to\nOther male cohorts in the White House to perform oral verbal services on them was that part of the norms and the presidency when LBJ\nLied about the Vietnam War getting sixty thousand of my generation killed many murdered the Nixon violate the norms of the presidency with water great in line did he violated how 'bout Jimmy Carter his mirror presidency\nViolated the norms and the presidency so please save me the embarrassment\nI'm trying to convince me that Trump is somehow violating the norms of the

totally agree with you I also wanted to add Chuck Grassley to your ... park that he really had to hold the line on some pretty\nStrong personalities your water to pull any direction the courage of cars much trouble are great courage\nAnd I just wanted to ask him to the list and that was that otherwise I'm I really enjoy your show\nSharon thank you may have shown as your question talking about the norms and all I'm Liz wants to be a liberal media today because they think drop last night violated the norms of the presidency by being political in front of the U.S Supreme Court\nDid Kamala Harris violate the norms of the presidency how about Cory Booker the one with the crazy eyes crazy eyes Booker\nCity violate the norms of the center of their behavior in front of Grassley in front of the nation Grassley cannot even make an opening statement into Kamala Harris and Cory Booker in the war hero Richard Blumenthal\nDid they violate the norms of the Senate and did that eight hundred people who showed up and about and I don't know how many two hundred arrest inside the Senate did violate the norms of the Senate do think a little bit\nI think all violated annoyance than I think that behavior was extremely heinous and I think that you know age ... now marker for maturity and I think it was terrible\nAnd another point and the third debate I can recall Trump answering a question about whether he would accept the outcome the twenty sixteen election and the third debate Trump said well it depends on what happens and he didn't give a hundred percent yes answer\nHillary Clinton and the liberal media viciously attack Trump for saying three weeks before the election in November owning a member of the eight twenty sixteen better mental and might not accept the election since the election has Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party accepted the outcome of the twenty sixteen election\nOr haven't met become what they criticized\nOh absolutely and worse and worse because they are determined you can see the devotion and dedication to things that do not bring this country together in any way it's terrible it's really very very bad and I think it's so as far as I say it's sick\nAbout accepting the results of the election whether\nIt's the Russian collusion delusion or what whether it's all the other investigations because we have a foolish attorney general named Jeff Sessions who should have resigned as soon as he resigned from the Russian collusion delusion and as soon as he could not do his job as attorney general\nHe should offered his resignation at that moment and right now the Senate seat would not be in democratic hands without Jones' character out of Alabama but what happened is\nThat that uh one Trump is criticized for not acting normally if this is abnormal\nIf this economy as a result of an ... maladies I say let's have more of it\nIf the southern border which has been guarded by this president is abnormal please give me more of it if we have the trade deficits we used to have with Canada and Mexico and South Korea this president has corrected the trade deficits and the only reason the communist read Chinese are doing what they're doing is they're going after the Trump voters\nThe Trump base in states like Iowa where the president's going to be the night\nAnd and at some point the Chinese need us more than we need them at some point they're going to recognize that they rip dissolve for five hundred billion dollars a year and that's way too much so\nFar this is abnormal Sharon I Want more abnormal because if this is a normal I cannot think of something better than what we have right now\nAt an intermediate school in the area of Rosemont Minnesota that said the following quote so who's going to take one for the team and

paying all the fines how 'bout doubling and tripling the fines and making a lot of money and make Soros pay\nI could say wait a minute something's going to get shot but they're already half\nAnd so what the left is doing right now the left of riots in boycotts and protests and marches and confrontations in airports in elevators and restaurants are more is urging that Kavanaugh will be killed\nAccording to the store and the ape you are a spokesman for the FBI FBI Minneapolis Monday Night confirmed that the bureau was aware of the ... quote so who's going to take one for the team he killed Kevin ...\nAnd of course the addresses of the Supreme Court justices and US Senators had been made public by democratic operatives working inside the federal government\nWhy isn't this a big story shouldn't in mainstream media covered this as much as they cover a lot of the crop against this president must continue with your calls us go to a let's go to Jeanie in El El Paso Texas and Jeannie in taxes welcome to the bill Cunningham show pleased when you go ahead\nWell thank you so much for taking my call one of his leisure [noise] little nervous here either okay and\nAre keeping with what you just said you kind of answered it but I'd like to know why\nUm these people who are running Republican side or restaurants getting in their faces going to Mitch McConnell house at seven thirty in the morning and shouting and demonstrating they arrested for disturbing\nBecause they're left us and they represent the viewpoints\nOf the political leadership in charge of the city's Washington DC is in charge of a left wing radical progressive female mayor\nWho kind of wants to protesters to do it in Minneapolis I guarantee you I don't know the the politics of Minneapolis, Minnesota but I can all but guaranteed to you in his left wing extreme politics that governs that city and whether it's Portland, Oregon or San Francisco or New York city\nBecause the police department is handcuffed by the political leadership they can't do their job isn't that sad\nAnd makes me sick and wives\nAnd some are saying and Christine Ford you lied about the second door and the front of your house you lied about not taking an airplane you lied about no one helping no one ticket and pass a polygraph test\nYou lied every part of your testimony was either a fabrication on outright lie why isn't someone saying let's investigate Christine forward for perjury why not do that\nOne of 'em dead um ah\nThe senator I'm practically losing my memory I'm so nervous talking to you I'm Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham she ... she needed to be investigated\nHours and that's the way I feel\nFor every name she supplied of witnesses turn out to be false every factual detail that she provided turn out to be false you know I I think what happened Jeannie in reality\nIs that when you go to a therapist or to a doctor\nYou are incentivized to tell the correct story because you're seeking help for your problem so if tomorrow Jeannie you go to a doctor and say my left hand is hurting the doctor believes what you're saying if you go to a therapist\nHas that Christine for dinner and twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen well before Brett Kavanaugh percolated and she told the therapist that there were four boys who tried to write me when I was in my late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties you know what I Believe that\nHappened I Believe something fundamentally bad happened to ... Ford which is why she's been seeking mental health for all these years and probably what she told the therapist\nIncentivized to do to do so to get help was accurate that four boys try do rape her in her late teens and the Nineteen eighties I Believe her\nBut somehow in her mind shared recovered memory instead of four boys it became one instead of her late teens and became the age of Fifteen instead of the Nineteen eighties and became Nineteen eighty two because Brett Kavanaugh was available and Marilyn\nIn Nineteen eighty two to be around Christine Ford\nBut you see the media doesn't pursue that angle do I think something happened to that woman yes and I think what she told the therapist and twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen was accurate when she sold a therapist\nWho rented a room in our house that caused sort of put the second front door in our house so patients who come in and out of her house she accurately\nTold the therapist six years ago that four boys tried to rape me in the in my late teens\nAnd the Nineteen eighties than some out in her mind to get fame or to get money\nShe decided to switch it up a little bit instead of four boys you said it was one instead of late teens I was Fifteen set of the Nineteen eighties let's make it Nineteen eighty two and so somehow her mind is twisted in turn by left wing democratic politics to Stanford University\nAnd she could not recognize reality which is why she did not want to come forward because she wasn't clear about what happened and it took the Democrats are wrongfully leak her name which by the way it's a crime Dianne Feinstein office it was a crime so as to incentivize and encourage them require her to come forward\nAnd when the Senate said when the Senate said will come to you in California\nWill make it private her lawyers Deborah cats and others did not tell their client that offer was made because they wanted a public humiliation\nA Brett Kavanaugh and that's what happened\nOther people have\nOn the radio has said she was a con artist because her answers or show perfect for um her response is drew out\nI'm feeling some sympathy say we're absolutely perfect um to make you on her side and afraid to challenge her\nI'm sure Deborah cats who's a democratic activist in California Lawyer\nReferred by the way by Dianne Feinstein can you imagine a senator referring a witness to a particular client that's a friend of yours in which case later on you have to judge the credibility of a witness\nThat you have given that witness a lawyer that's another completely different issue but this woman probably had something happen in her life involving those four boys or tried to write a paper and that's damaged her life\nBut it didn't damage your life so much that you didn't successfully complete high school without incident then damage your life so much you didn't get two master's degrees and a doctorate then damage your life so much has not been a teacher for twenty five years have Palo Alto University in Stanford\nAnd and not so bad she isn't written coauthored sixty one books and periodicals\nWhat was she would have done Seventy one books in periodicals there's no evidence that affected her life at all and every factual statements she made before the Senate was either falls or purposely ally one or the other they've all been proven not to occur\nAnd Jeanie you're a woman and of course your femininity it's been hijacked by the Democratic party\nDo you want to live in a country where your son your brother and your father does not have due process\nAbsolutely not I Am a Christian and I follow what the Bible says I think a man should be the leader of the house um I\nRead that you you you can't say that you can't say that you can't say I think that I did ...\nI'm a Democrat to please Jeannie ... don't do that because men and women are equal in fact women are ... you know the best people I've known in my life or women whether it's my wife my sister my mom passed away about five years ago\nMy granddaughter those are the best people I Know and I'll be damned if I'm going to sit there and be told as a man that I don't care about sexual assault against women when I think about women are thinking about my wife or forty nine years as an appellate judge and the state of Ohio\nI think about my sister who's the co chairman of the Republican Party in the state of Ohio I think about my beautiful little granddaughter I Want to protect\nThe women around me and make sure they have all the rights privileges and immunities every citizen but I also want to say that there are times ten to twenty percent of the time when men are wrongfully charged with sexual assault and due process\nFerrets out the good from the bad the right from the wrong and then we from the chaff\nI wasn't Mendez due process rights because that guarantees down the road that wrongful convictions for rape and other crimes which happens hundreds of times every year in this country will be less likely I Want women to be protected and I think men have rights too in a sense the me too movement there's nothing wrong with the me too movement\nAs long as rights and due process goes along with it\nAnd if somebody's charge whether it's a title nine violation or rape or sexual assault or a groping I don't want my white groped or my sister broke that's disgusting and if somebody groups a woman I Want them to be held to account but every now and then a woman Cristina forward either doesn't know the truth or tell us ally\nWell you know you walked on

I Want to encourage everybody to donate all you can do it through came out and cheer volunteer all you can if you can't donate then get they're not the worse if you see a sign for you know the the other side the Democrat\nBe as nice as you can cause you can try to gauge as people why why you've just curious why you vote for for this person because the reason\nYeah because you know there's you know there's plenty of reasons not to vote for him and just being is not just in about it but in a gym and try to get him to talk a lot of people you know they they're bandwagon fans or whatever they don't really know what they're voting for they're just you know want to be part of the crowd so trying\nTo talk to me about ... or ... even ... is that close could Ted Cruz actually lose in Texas Senate seat to a clown like beta O'Rourke is that possible\nOr it is possible I don't think it's going to happen though because\nYou know the betas got this Kennedy esque vibe about him you know he was young and yeah he's you know some people I guess finding physically attractive eight different strokes for different folks or whatever but um there's been a lot because Texas economy is so strong we've had so many people moving in from out of Texas\nAnd yeah there there's obviously some liberal natives here in Austin area and some other Houston Dallas\nA but most of most of Texas is pretty normal solidly conservative normal there are no yeah yeah but uh yeah yeah we've got people moving in her changing the demographics and so\nIt's important for everyone to get every vote here in Texas we cannot let cruise flus we've not we've got to have him where\nShe what's happened in Florida is too many New Yorkers have moved to Florida\nAnd they're taking their virus in their cancers ideas with him from New York\nFrom the Empire State to the sunshine state they're taking too many New Yorkers are moving in New Jersey I Can't stand the place anymore and moving to Florida so Florida I think is kind of like a purple state at this point\nIs going to be hard for the for the governor when the U.S Senate seat but\nYou know Scott ... is pretty good governor but nonetheless you bring up a good point that the goal of if they flipped Texas or Florida and then the country's done if we lose those twenty nine to thirty five electoral votes either one it's over with and and Trump can't get reelected heck a Republican can get elected\nIf in Florida and New York they begin to be as one in uh Texas looks the same ... New York then we're done because Texas and Florida would tip the think permanently\nWell I'll leave you with some good news or play I I I was not a Trump fan okay I was pretty hardcore and for Ted Cruz for president\nAnd I have to admit I was dismayed by what happened and you know not that I just wasn't a fan of Trump because I wasn't sure that he was going to be conservative you know and I was sure that Ted west so\nThat's why I I thought when Trump got elected he would run toward the center and kind of be a New York Republican and I supported Ted Cruz in the beginning goes I thought he was a real Bible believing conservative from Texas who was bright and smart and knew what he was going to do but\nDonald J Trump has done governance what Ted Cruz would have done and you have the star factory is going to be in Cincinnati on friday and I'm going to be with them a little bit on friday and I've been in his presence of these rallies\nTrump is a rock star it's like Elvis it's the Beatles it's Michael Jackson and Ted Cruz Lindsey whoever you want to say\nDoesn't have the rock star status of forty five Trump is a rock star and there's the animal magnetism that I see president I think is an Iowa tonight he hopefully it will be out every day between now and election day\nAnd when he comes to town and in Des Moines Iowa eleven thousand on the inside and ten thousand on the outside and this Friday there was like an eight thousand seat facility he's going to speak on friday north of Cincinnati and Warren County it's already sold out\nAnd there's going to be twenty thousand people show up those guys ... a conservative politics\nHe's done exactly what Ted Cruz would have done but crews doesn't have the magnetism doesn't have the charisma doesn't have the charm of whatever you want to call it\nBut Trump is a rock star and if you have a shot Chris getting his presence go to one of his rallies and all like the Beatles circa Nineteen sixty five or Michael Jackson circuit twenty over for or Whitney Houston circuit twenty oh three this guy's a rock star\nAnd when he shows up in your town it's a wonderful thing to watch and when you got that magic in a bottle that you catch with Trump you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Glendale", "day": "09"}
