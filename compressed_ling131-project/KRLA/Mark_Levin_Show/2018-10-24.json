Democrats take the house Democrats for taking\n\nMy words will be ... by the Soros funded this dire funded a left wing billionaires funded front group ... think tanks and media sites that gives that crack\nSometimes you've got to stand for something and you have to speak yeah that's what my parents taught me\nThat when it gets harder and harder to speak out as your opponents are more and more poison it sort of vicious you need to speak out more and you need to stand up more\nThe Democrats selection are also promising Medicare for all all you folks on Medicare and want you to listen to me you really need to pay attention to this\nInvestors business daily nails Democrats won't tell voters how radical Medicare for all actually is she ladies and gentlemen Medicare for all what they mean by that is Medicare for nobody\n[noise]\nOne Republican said that Obamacare was designed to fail so Democrats could push single payer\nThat was called conspiracy monitoring but guess what Obamacare's family and Democrats and not pushing Medicare for all quote unquote as the solution\nHere these Democrats running for governor like Gillum and Florida here them running for the Senate and house Medicare for all Medicare don't show a lot Medicare [noise]\nThe trouble is Democrats aren't telling voters anything about what Medicare for all actually means probably because the plan would be the most radical socialization of health care on the planet\nEvery one from New York socialist Alexandria Ocasio Cortez the Texas Senate candidate beetle O'Rourke to Florida gubernatorial candidate Gillum\nThey've called for Medicare for all this is now the official position has every Democrat running for the house every Democrat running for the Senate every Democrat running for governor\n[noise] this is their collective position [noise] now what what Medicare for all what what to do\nWell here the fetch based on the bills the actual bills in the house in the Senate\nYou would lose your existing playing what ever plan you have\nOn Medicare employer plan it doesn't matter what outlaw existing private health insurance number one all of it\nThat includes all employer provided plans individually purchased insurance every single union plan it also means an end to the increasingly popular private Medicare Advantage insurance plans all gone\nThese private insurance plans seniors had been flocking to specifically to avoid enrolling in existing Medicare plan if you like your plan you're guaranteed not to be able to keep it they will all be outlawed that's what they mean\n[noise]\nI Know you didn't hear this on CNN and MSNBC\nI Know you didn't hear it on good morning America or the today show you hearing it from me\nThrough the excellent writing investors business daily second\nMedicare for all will have the government pay all\nMedical costs there'd be no co pays or deductibles on anything from doctor visits surgery and drugs to long term care dental and vision the only thing not covered would be cosmetic surgery keep in mind no other country on the planet does this\n\nEven in socialist countries like Sweden Denmark\nPeople by fourteen to Fifteen Percent of health costs out of pocket candidate doesn't cover prescription drugs and private insurance picks up Thirteen percent of the country's health care bills\nEven in China people buy private insurance to cover it co pays and deductibles and the Chinese pay almost a third of health care costs out of their pockets so Democrats\nLesson are rushing to endorse a plan that is more socialistic communist China's plans\n\nNow Medicare for all the what also nearly double\nThe size of the federal government double the size of the federal government a recent analysis of Bernie Sanders current Medicare for all plan which is supported by Gillum and people like him\nFind said it would cost the federal government thirty two point six trillion dollars over the first ten years and we know these analyses are always wrong they're always low thirty two point six trillion dollars plus free college for everybody\nRight free health care\nThe trustees Medicare say Medicare's going broke and eight years eight years so that Democrats have a plan massively expanding and destroyed\nThe incredible\nAnd that's vast understatement of it is true costs since the analysis assumes draconian payment touched the providers an unrealistic savings on administrative and prescription drug costs but also ignores the enormous cost of delays and rationing that invariably result from government run health care in other words\nAll the people who will die all the people who will suffer when the government takes over a system like this\n\nDemocrats pushing Medicare for all say that those costs are irrelevant\nBecause people will no longer have to pay premiums are spend any money out of pocket but they don't say is that everyone would face huge tax increases to finance this government takeover of healthcare Bernie Sanders plant starts with an eight point four percent hike in payroll taxes\nSharply higher income tax rates and more none of which would fully cover the exorbitant costs\n\nHow many more failed countries ladies in general must we taught me this is Venezuela this was the prescription of Venezuela\n\nSony support for Medicare for all Democrats\nAlso point just surveys showing strong support [noise] choose me for Medicaid for Medicare for all a Reuters so St Paul found Seventy percent backing it including majority Republicans but that's because people have no idea what Medicare for all actually means\nRun Reuters substitutes the term single payer or government run health care support collapse as little as forty percent down from Seventy\nPercent and that's exactly why the Democrats camouflage their true intentions lie to deceive the American people [noise] but even that's probably too high forty percent\nA separate Kaiser Family foundation survey found almost half of Americans wrongly believe they could actually keep their existing health plans under a single payer system incredibly Democrats are the most ill informed the poll found fifty two percent of Democrats think there'll be able to keep their health care plans\n\nI mean that's absurd right if they're going to nationalized healthcare a single payer system destroyed Medicare destroy all private insurance including your employer insurance by going to keep your plan still lack of public support didn't stop Democrats\nFrom opposing Obama Care of the nation eight years ago won't stop them from opposing quote unquote Medicare for all they ever get the chance the only way to prevent such a disaster if they keep Democrats had a power at least until their socialist fever breaks this is another reason you need to go to the polls ladies and gentlemen\n\nThese rogue leftists are so thoroughly completely irresponsible they want to impose their ideology on you and these have real\nLife consequences it matters to your family it matters to the health of your family it matters that people who have private insurance it matters that people who are on Medicare\n\nIt's incredible what they'd been proposing Cory Booker and opportunity account at five fifty thousand dollars for it get there's no end to what they want to do how they want to manipulate us control us take from us from us\nWhy I say all the time that progressive ism is an American it's absolutely\nOn American there's absolutely\nNo constitutional support or basis for progressive as ... which is why they're truly

liberal darling\nThat he wasn't a democratic nominee for governor of the state this this kind of scandal would have sunk him and there's something else that that people are just wrong about I mean one of the big democratic\nIssues that they're trying to raise across the country in the last Thirteen Days the election is that President Trump is they hate filled beget and he wants to make war on transgendered people and wipe the mountain sending a concentration camps et cetera et cetera et cetera\nAnd or can we agree here that gender identity should be an inter individual matter and that it should not be decided by the federal government\nAnd basically that is what the Trump Administration wants is not to impose federal standards about how you respond to somebody else who says I'm a woman even though he may be biologically equipped as a man\nAnd by the way in the New York times they have a\nA a big piece very sympathetic is transgender as Mrs anatomy does not determine gender experts say but there's this section and that I think is fascinating\nThey write no one knows for sure why body and mind sometimes do not match\nBut being transgender is not a matter of choice Dr safer they quote this expert says ah it is not a fat or a whim for transgender people that have generally an overwhelming sense that their gender is not the one on their birth certificate and gender is not about whom they're attracted to it's about who they are\nBut see if they get the right to be who you are that doesn't mean that you have the right to demand that the government force everybody else to accept that\nCan we leave this private choice and get the federal government out of this and at the very worst have some kind of state policy concerning bathrooms but for God's sake it's insane\nIn to think that anyone gains by having the federal government in Washington [noise] uh decide who goes into which bathroom now one of the ways you decide who goes to which movies is on by

speculation is already beginning it's like after a mass shooting it just can't stop on the speculation is being promoted in the media and by politicians and that's who always promotes speculation say deadly serious matter I underline the word deadly\nDeadly we've\nTalked about the rise in violence in this country and are concerned about it about anti offend black lives matter and about attacking public officials in restaurants\n\nSo we've said over and over somebody's gonna get hurt\nAnd we have no idea who's behind this we have no idea of the quote unquote political affiliation of the people behind it we know all of those targeted are Democrats and CNN that\nWe know\nThe white comic beyond that because we don't know anything else and yet that's what's taking place now\n\nAnd there's something really grotesque\nAbout the media in this country\nGoing on and on today about\nThe heated rhetoric that hateful rhetoric 'cause they're meeting in this country understand that they are leading the charge\nOn the heated and hateful rhetoric to you know yesterday alone Donald Trump I counted for four times was compared to Adolf Hitler on MSNBC and CNN six times he was called a racist\n\nAnd that they they wanna know if Donald Trump is responsible for the heated and hateful and divisive rhetoric that's going on\nDonald Trump compare somebody's Adolf Hitler\n\nAnd he's called a racist all the time\nSo the media do not hold the high moral ground the media do not hold the high moral ground\nElectric and the people in the United states about the rhetoric Schumer and Pelosi put out a joint statement today they don't hold the high moral ground on this I had to get into this but it's going on all around us what am I supposed to do with north\n\nThat is a very very serious matter\n\nAnd we need to know as soon as possible who are home is responsible for this\nThat's what we need to know but we don't need lectures\nFrom the media as soon as this story began to break that more and more of these packages were were uncovered\nIt was obvious read between the lines are not the lines\nAre becoming more and more bold oh where the media are going with this\nThey can't help themselves\nCNN received one of these packages outrageous that they received a package am I wrong Mr producer didn't somebody tried to break into the Fox local channel and Washington DC yesterday\nWith a weapon and they were shot I mean somebody was actually shot\n\nI get death threats\n\nRush gets death threats Kennedy gets death threats but I Know I get that threats\n\nIt's not fun\nIt's not fun and you worry about your family you're worried about you you look over your shoulder from time to time it's not 'cause you're paranoid just you had to be a little bit more careful\n\nAbout one in ... out there in a tape is filled with violence it's the most violent organization I'm aware of in politics today it was downplayed by most of the media downplay same what black lives matter downplayed\n\nAnd I'm not saying this is exclusive to the left\n\nNot saying it's such closer to the left at all we want to know who did this as soon as possible and I believe the FBI we'll figure this out because nothing exploded so they have these uh these packages and these devices are in their ah originally form\n\nWhich will make it much easier for them to track down ... they'll get the guy or gal the guys or gals\nAt least I Hope so I think so based on my past experience of the department of justice they have a ton of evidence now and they're going to be able to use different methods of tracking this down\n\nAnd they begin to pull strings and then the strings begin to pull the fabric the fabric begins to unravel and then they they're able to track people down but they need to find this person or these people because they may do it again they may do more of it\nThat's all we know we don't know their motives\nWe don't know their motives well we know the motive uh obviously is the threatened if not harm if not killed the people they targeted\n\nBut there's a lot of speculation out there now why why can't people just white particularly in the media\nNow you can see the crescendo building that somehow this is Donald Trump's fault because the way he goes and speaks at rallies and the language he uses about this that or the other I Am so sick of this you have no idea the president of the United states without question faces death threats all the time\nIs it because what the Democrats say about him is it because what Joe Scarborough says about him or Don Lemon says about hammer she'd go bears says about him\n\nThe other day the president et cetera rallies in a rally I think it was used and then he says he's at nationalist well I'm not a naturalist but not for the reasons the Democrats on the left say he's a nationalist now we know what he means America First and so forth\n\nAnd they try anti attend Nazi isn't ... or ... these this is in the media\n\nNational socialist party notice when people proclaimed that their socialist they don't try to tie them to the Nazis it is nationalist socialist right they didn't say that about Bernie Sanders hey he's using Nazi language he's using Stalin his language no of course not\n\nMost of the media in this country they revealed themselves so for them now the sit back for the most radical among them on cable TV on MSNBC and CNN for the most radical among them on the today show good morning America\nFor the most radical among them now point a finger at Trump go absolutely nothing to do it this\nIs really just further evidence of how outrageous they are\n\nThe person or people who are responsible for this are responsible for this\n\nAre responsible for this\nDo you think the media in this country over the last\nTwo years have been responsible do you think the meeting this country over the last two years have been measured\nYou think the media in this country many in the media in this country cross the line with their references to Hitler Stalin and racism and all the rest of it\nDo you think Joe Starbucks cross the line or make a ... or Don Lemon or Chris Cuomo on the list goes on and on you think they crossed the line with their heated rhetoric what their point something language\nAnd now\nYou're going to tell you shoot calmed down stop the rhetoric\nThe heated attacks we must bring it down it's too much having ... the flames now they're the firefighters\nAnd same with ... the things that she has said and same with Schumer the things that he is said and the things that they did to a guy like Kavanaugh to a guy like Kavanaugh\n\nTo create the tensions in this society and the anger in this society do they have any responsibility for a\n\nWhile if Donald Trump does surely
