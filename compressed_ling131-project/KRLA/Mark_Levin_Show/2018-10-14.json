background and we started we talk to people that\nYou're in competition with ah we talk to people that you've covered ah people that have had bad results that you've covered\nAnd quite honestly at the end of the day we didn't find anybody you said one bad thing about you that\nIt's just wonderful and that kind of intimidating that's quite an introduction to live up to but I'm very grateful for it

I'm covering him\nAfter um unfortunately and I'm also working on the Roman Polanski case which is very interesting thirty two years later after I covered the original down but they're trying to get him back here uh to be sentenced and it looks like it's going to be a long long battle [noise]\nUh I'm also I've also been working on a story that will be coming out on the um the terrible problems we're having in the court here in California with budgetary crisis and what's going to be done to try to keep the courts open and available to the public\nYou spent more time in courtrooms than a whole bunch of lawyers I Know who pretend to be trial lawyers [noise] do you get a feel\nHow things are going to sit there\nWell I never tried to predict the outcome of a case no no no\nI'm not talking about what you're right down talking about deep on your show\nI mean I don't try myself to predict what's going to happen ... come on no don't do this to me I mean I Know I Know when someone has made a point I Know when when OJ Simpson got up in the courtroom and try it on the gloves I knew that that was a major moment in that case [noise]\nUh but as far as determining what a jury is going to do you know as well as I Do that they are unpredictable and that we never know until the last moment when they come in with that verdict what they're really going to do I usually have a hint usually have my own feeling okay\nDid you think uh OJ was going to be found not guilty and the criminal trial yes I did uh did you feel he's going to be found guilty in civil trial [noise]\nI'm not sure I I was I made a decision on that one wasn't sure\nI was with um Johnny Cochrane was a dear friend of mine mine too I was with him on Saturday the very came in I think on a Monday\nIf I remember right either Monday or Tuesday we had lunch together on Saturday downtown at the Hilton Hotels than food but it was the place was easy to get to those another sponsor\nAnd ah I said okay pal or do you think he says Tom I'm living in a winter [noise] now than I've been in this jury trial business a long time and while like you sometimes I have a hunch [noise] I Would never go that far is just say I'll win it\nBut he definitely felt on that Saturday before that they were going to quit on the criminal from\nWell I can tell you that one of the prosecutor so we'll be unnamed at this point came to me a few days before that and said to me do you think we even have a chance while\nIt brings to mind a previous program that you and I have talked about on on a number of occasions you covered OJ and as we indicated in the introduction you covered both trials [noise] I'd rather\nHave it three trials I covered the one in Las Vegas says well last year while\nWell on the two trials will to murder trials of the one criminal the one civil we have Robert Shapiro on the program and we asked him what was the difference\nTom what was his answer you know what I'm you would love this is a reporter [noise]\nYou will go when the case of you settle the case and the automotive manufacturing will say find will pay this money but it's confidential\nAnd then lo and behold other people get hurt by the same thing we settled a Toyota case of acceleration two and a half years ago how about that [noise]\nIt was confidential quote so we couldn't name the settlement people and all that stuff [noise] and it was a lawyer you say to yourself while you know I Wonder if this were public than\nThe other people wouldn't have gotten her\nYou know so right I'm In your corner most of the time but there are times when I definitely not in your corner and I was I think that certain times of victims can be harm more than the tragedy itself by the by the press\nSo sometimes the ah\nThe position of the victim is different ah we're now in the Roman Polanski matter in which the victim has come forward has named herself she's her name's been known for a long time she's grown up middle aged woman with children\nAs she wants the case to be over and she has filed papers over and over again same for now right now should we ignore what she has to say should we feel that she should be protected and we certainly\nCome on come on gosh darn it would you find one ... one case where the woman huge K. okay yeah I Do watch out for Jews or whatever [noise] you don't do this I'm Talking about the majority\nOf those cases where the intrusion is massively upsetting you know what I mean and and a bunch of stuff that's not our business how about this [noise] um probably a product effect case it hurts somebody that's our business because man I better worried about\nTheir I agree with you on that but you know from from what you're saying I've been covering a number of these pre smell station case and\nThese are the most painful and horrible cases to cover and if we didn't cover them and if we said well this is too terrible and we shouldn't know about it and nobody should know about it because someone might find out who this is that would be a disservice to the public\nAnd therein lies the tension between the public's right to know and the person's need\nFor privacy you are listening to champions of justice with Tom Gerard Ian royal oaks and are just today I went to George Associated Press special correspondent years ago I worked in news in San Francisco on the radio and I was there for several breaking stories or when they happen to them when they came across the a P wire as a matter of fact\nUh one was the Jones town story the other was the day I'm white story\nA and a as a reporter\nYou have a mix of emotions you just incredulous\nYou are absolutely excited and galvanized a you feel the weight on your shoulder are reporting the story correctly vote for you the first big story that you covered was Robert Kennedy being ... what was that like for you\nIt was horrible um it was a unexpected I I was in the ... bureau that night my I was very young I was just starting out as the cubs and the bureau and uh my shift started at midnight temps them as much as he was yeah and he was killed at twelve o five\nAnd it was very emotional it was you know everybody who came in who had been on the road with him are reporters had been traveling with them they were all coming in and tears I mean he was very much loved but the the priority for everybody wants to get the fact\nFind out who this guy was that his shot him find out where everyone was at that moment get all the details I mean our report about Thomas was incredible he was practically on top of Kennedy might have happened if he'd been any closer he would have been shot and and they had the presence of mind to get to a phone and call in\nAnd that's the main thing you you put everything else aside and you just go with the story\nI was a kid lawyer\nI was there that night so you know I mean I I was at the ambassador\nAnd I remember them yelling out one of the reporters let's not have another Oswald\nThey were running around and to me is I think of my wife of various moments of my life and then you'll never forget I mean that that was definitely one of them without a doubt yeah that was extraordinary [noise] and then to see\nYou know that family what had happened over the years I mean blows your weight and how does\nHis and all of the stories that I've done in the past seemed to be coming back it's like everything old his new again um I mean I've been writing things on I wrote a story last summer on the fortieth anniversary of the Manson killings\nAnd I was up to the prisons for the last parole hearing of ... before she died I've been doing Polanski which is one of my old cases a Michael Jackson of course just come back with the events after his death\nUm it seems like the major cases that I've done in the past will never go away they're part of my DNA almost but\nAh but they keep repeating not only does but similar ones right of a sentence that young a young person to five years in jail the son of a major Hollywood production yesterday you know I mean\nThis is interesting in it yeah yeah ah and I don't know if the same goes with the problems or we just know about their problems we don't know about the other problems but it it is\nYeah it was very sad that was camera Douglas yeah radio\nAnd then he had spoken openly about anti drugs and so forth his father had yes they're they've had issues and so forth and [noise]\nBut it's a rip your heart out in the one thing is to be involved in something like that and then the next thing the thing is even worse because you see it all over the press\nRight right [noise] but you know I think that um the the public is interested in these things because they think that it could happen to them and it is instructive particularly a case like that for parents that have young young kids\nAnd you know how could someone who is the heir to such a wonderful Hollywood name and you know a fortune how could they get involved in this\nOn the public when your reporting on a case what is your thought of me [noise] I Am\nAm thinking that I Am your eyes and ears in the courtroom I Am there to give you every detail\nWell to try to have ice in the back of my head so I can see what's going on in the courtroom as well as what's going on the witness stand and and in the front of the well the court or I'm a I'm there as an observer I'm there as a chronic color of history\nBecause I Am can convince that most of the trials I Do which are very big trials\nAre mirrors of what's going on in society at the time\nAnd if you think back on things like the Manson trial which was the trial the sixties the trial of flower power hippies celebrities and drugs\nUm that was one but there have been so many others that have social implications for all of us\nThe Menendez brothers' case which was really the first we had heard a of allegations of but a child sexual abuse within families\nUm the Patty Hearst case which was really the the post Vietnam Era in which young people came back disenchanted and did terrible things including kidnapping her\nUm and how she reacted in that case had so many social implications her father was forced to give away food and food give away in the streets it was about the homeless it was about parents child\nDissension it had so many issues that touched every one where they lived\nAnd a reminder that you are listening to champions of justice with your host Tom ... joined today by royal oaks and are very special guests Linda Deutsch Associated Press special correspondent\nThe OJ trial was a good for the public was good for the justice system [noise] the O. J. trial I think\nGave the the public a chance to see how the system works or they may not have been happy with it but they saw it up close and personal and as much um criticism as judge land sea though has taken I think that he was interested in letting everyone see\nAnd he also was interested in letting everyone in the trial have their say and that's what he was most criticized for\nBecause people didn't like that they also a lot of them didn't like the outcome and so they blamed him but he conducted a fair trial and uh let's see though was a young judge she was a child of the TV era and so he wanted people to see it on television\nAnd people became so and gross that it was a worldwide sensation I I was in Hawaii at one point during the trial very briefly for a program and a taxi cab driver pulled up to me and said you have to\nProfessional experience guiding good folks like you to investment concerns in a fragile market just like we have today and that's what today's programs all about\nFolks what happened this week changed my whole plan for this weekend's radio show\nYou need to be concerned about the risk in your retirement plan the risk to your portfolio the risks in your investments\nBecause these risks just got much much greater\nThe warning sign went off people say you know why don't they ring the bell when it's time to buy or when it's time to sell ding ding ding ding ding that's the bell ladies and gentleman there was a bell ringing right now that the risks are heightened now that's not to say that the market you\nCan't go up a little bit here can wave back and forth back in January if you've been listening to my radio program and I'm On the air for like Seventeen years back in January when we had the big decline from January and February I said don't worry folks were going to re tests the old highs and we'll probably go higher and we did and we did\nThis time and saying something different\nHowever right a lot when it comes to this thing but being wrong you don't want to be wrong and lose money you want to be wrong and lose opportunity\nThat's the key right now the old adage to by law would sell high and I'm telling you to go and sell I'm telling you that it's time to get a second opinion on your investments and your portfolio\nAnd getting someone to take a serious look of how you can control what you already have because it's far easier to keep what you already have them what you might have lost through a bad investment\nShows two people come to see me and a lot of folks set appointments with me every single day from this radio program and when they see me I show them my brochure of today and I show my brochure\nFrom almost Thirty years ago when I was at Smith Barney and I should share some women ... whatever we were called at the time and I showed them it says the same thing\nWe put a safety net on every single investment in your portfolio and the belief that it's far easier to keep what you already have them to make up what you might have lost to a bad investment and it's not that the investments are bad sometimes it's that the market environment becomes bad\nWhich causes you to lose money Warren Buffett the oracle of Omaha said rule number one is don't take big losses rule number two is to see rule number one\nJust market has changed why because of interest rates you think that that's not directly rated the stock market it does relate to everything to do with the economy\nStraight set the terms of our cost of money everything from credit cards home loans car load to business loans and businesses borrow a ton of money just could have an adverse effect\nOn your investments and your retirement\nI Am really urging you\nTo not do the same thing that happened to you potentially if you were around and had big money in two thousand and eight and lost fifty percent of your money or the year two thousand if you're old enough and lost half your money to time since the beginning of the year two thousand two times says the new millennium\nAnd a lot of people the planning for retirements just about saving and investing money well it's part of it but there's so much more to it it it's a milestone in life in March the most significant changes perhaps your marriage or the birth of your children because it marks the kind that you will no longer be drawing the paycheck for work\nOr maybe a reduced paycheck for those who think that they're going to reduce the workload and they own a business or something is going to have some residual income coming in it for a part time job\nBut the risks are much higher the closer you get to retirement a rat retirement because for most people would mark the time when their savings and investments are at a maximum right you don't have the most money when you're forty and then retire at sixty sixty five saying well I got less money now there was forty no\nYou don't have usually more money when you're Seventy five or eighty because usually you're spending down the money so what is it the highest in your latter years fifty five sixty seven sixty eight years old is when you have the most amount of money to any market decline any small mistake\nIn your investments could result in a serious hit\nTo your overall network\nYou don't want to have that happen to you now especially when you can control it is just most advisors have no idea how\nIt's simple and easy you just need to take the time\nTo sit down and talk to a professional that knows how to manage the risk call one eight hundred for for nine nine five zero one you can text me to one eight hundred for for nine nine five zero one here you know again and again I hear now again all the time people tell me oh I'm doing great in the markets\nWhen reality the only thing you're doing differently is writing a market that's been a rising\nManaging money professionally for over Thirty years I heard the same comments before the Nineteen eighty seven crash was first Gulf War Nineteen Ninety four the dot com bubble burst in the year two thousand I read all kinds of people I heard people\nIn their seventies ... you know only all these dot com mutual funds in you know Nineteen Ninety nine\nI heard the same thing before the real estate debacle from two thousand seven to two thousand nine and now I'm hearing it again today\nDon't be one of them it's a problem when you don't have money for obvious reasons but it's a problem when you do because you want to protect your money you want it there for you you already have your money the last thing you need to do is lose it to a bad working\nDoing the same thing over and over and expecting different results is the very definition of insanity so said Albert Einstein and I said the same thing in today's fragile market climate\nI've got Thirty Years' professional experience doing this if you're an investor and you don't have a plan to manage the risk if you don't know what would make yourself each one every one of your investments and is there a minute for the long term we're all in it for the long term let me just give you that what you either got to be dead or broke I mean that's long term\nBut to hold to say I'm going to live in the same house from the day I'm born till the day I die I Want to drive the same car from the day and get my driver's license until the day I die to wear the same clothes from the day I really don't start dressing myself to the day I die it's ridiculous it's ridiculous don't talk that way about your portfolio because\nIt really to a professional like me\nIt sounds ridiculous\nThey're our environments to be in certain investments and there's environments to be out of the investments as just like a race car driving I'm not a big NASCAR you know open the wheel cart racing but they slow down in the corners they take pit stops eight ten times in the course of a race where there are a race for their tires off\nYou know you should do the same with your portfolio\nYou don't have a plan to manage the risk in case of a substantial market downturn right now in your portfolio than we need to me\nI was called a safe investment strategy demonstrates the

one of the first ten colors right now one eight hundred for for nine nine five zero one to get a free\nFive point check to make it simple and easy\nTo focus on the five most critical factors that affect your money in your investments today can do a risk analysis of your car holding will look at cash flow projections for\nIf prop ... passes California will still have the fifth highest gas tax in the nation and will be in the top five in car taxes so you know the question that people always ask\nAnd it's a good question Larry is what are they dealing with the money we give them now\nThat's always a fair question and the answer is they'd been wasting it\nAnd they've been diverting it so we should not reward bad behavior vote yes on prop six and a and understand that the bell label is very deceptive just just remember prop ... is the repeal of the gas tax\nHow's he doing because the other side admittedly has more money they've got lots of friends who are lining up to the trough to uh you know make money off the labor unions the workers so they're happy to donate money to run these ads that say our our freeway bridges are going to crumble it's all about the children whenever they say\nWhat's the truth zero or they slightly had what what do you showing\nWell ... it depends it depends on how the question is asked if the question is what you liked the rollback of last year's tax increases\nUh there's overwhelming support but when people just read the ballot label or we don't fare as well now my hope is that despite the fact that they will spend us\nProbably ten to one of bill probably spend about forty million dollars a lot of money or misinformation and you're right the money's coming from major construction firms who stand to benefit very very\nMuch of this by the trade unions who again they will make a lot of money\nUm and you know anybody associate with the construction they're the ones who are funding it you know ... ... you would think that if you just the maintenance of our roads were issue\nThere'd be more grass roots support for their side but there isn't the grassroots support is on our side middle class families who are suffering from high gas prices and high ... car taxes so um\n[noise] ah we think that if people and by the way the ballot arguments\nAbout labels unfair but they can't control the battle arguments we have for example someone who was on our side who is a former director of Caltrans you said the money's being wasted so I think if people actually read the ballot arguments that helps a lot\nAnd of course if they understand that prop Sixers the repeal of the gas tax uh it it will pass it's going to be very tight it all depends on voter turnout you know one of the things you you know you sometimes you don't think what this\nFor example the justice Cavanaugh a hearing you have to do with the gas tax well it's all about voter turnout and I think conservatives are kind of motivated after what's been going on in Washington DC so we're keeping our fingers crossed on that one and it uh and I am cautiously optimistic\nHide so yes on six repeals the gas tax puts six hundred something seven hundred bucks back in our pockets most families if you vote no on it that tax continues understand the way they built a they indexing for inflation they're going to take more from us right\nYeah it's going to it's going to go up and definitely you know ah ah so ah I just posted something on Twitter that the price differential between an average gallon of gas in California versus the average in all other states as eighty nine cents so we're paying almost a buck more average than the rest of the nation gasoline\nTaxes and that's just the ... that's that's ridiculous\nSide so yes on six there's another initiative proposition on the ballot you want to talk about what it has to do with what\nWell one of them is a is run control proposition tend would repeal\nIt current restriction local governments from being able to impose rent control we are\nAre we are opposed to proposition ten because it would dramatically expand\nRent control in California and\nYou know we understand that there was a housing crisis in California there are all kinds of legitimate responses to that including building more building more homes or removing some of the red tape but rank and file is just the opposite thing to do it we will result in a\nLesser of housing stock and you know there's an old joke that's been going around among the economist for decades and that is there are two ways to destroy a city one is\nCarpet bombing and the other is rent control and uh we we've seen\nThe ah we've seen the ill effects of rent control in many jurisdictions in California like Santa Monica San Francisco with these very politically powerful regulatory boards called a rent stabilization boards you'd be you'd be increasing you'd be increasing the\nNumber of these big bureaucracies dramatically and also many of them would regulate\nWhat you could rent your own home for so this is if you're an owner of a single family residential home building that prompt in little impact you it will because it's again government intrusion into the price of real estate and the price of bread\nJust doesn't work you don't address the ad they run this one and with this man with a blue shirt on just kind of looking at the camera he's got a little bit older and he's kind of concerned about having a place to live what do you say back to those I mean are those\nAimed at trying to do to convince is that somehow limiting the rent is going to bring more units on line it's not\nPeople are not going to rent their place out they're going to sell it if they can't get enough to recoup their investment\nYeah we we we would say that he's he's correctly identified the disease but this proposed his proposed medicines exactly opposite you don't take poison\nTo to ah to cure an ill hum and this would just exacerbate the housing crisis again um there are other answers ... removing red tape allowing more construction of units\nAnd we began to see a little bit of that happening already 'cause I think even progressives have come around to the notion that\nCalifornia's housing policy is policies have been counterproductive and by the way many of the progress of social justice organizations\nAre actually a a opposed to prop ten because they they studied it and they understand it the day that it would hurt their interests of keeping real estate values are are within the reach of the poor and middle class\nJohn to part with this hour German taxpayers association is the president of our job is exposition proposition Thirteen and Gavin Newsom you wanted to talk about something that was recently said\nYeah very scary in a in a debate with the Republican or a candidate John Cox uh the moderators ask them a uh ask Gavin Newsom directly she said a is a is prop Thirteen on the table\nAnd he said very ...\nVery this made me very nervous is a direct quote was everything's on the table well we now have someone running for statewide office who openly admit that prop Thirteen is on the table and this is consistent\nWith what he has said before about prop Thirteen so if if anyone is concerned about the preservation of Thirteen\nUm you've got to look at this particular comment\nAnd I'll take that into consideration when choosing who you're voting for for the governor of California that to a very very troubling very troubling or a comment and I'm\nA we hope that if he's elected he will change his mind\nOr whether he's elected or not people can understand that the average average taxpayers\nYou shouldn't ah will defend who the death proposition Thirteen as we have for forty years\nYou know it's it's hard to sing forty years have gone by 'cause I remember the commercials and the other side ran that said if you voted for proposition Thirteen essential services will be cut by two thirds you remember that it was kind of you you you you\nDo it and my my favorite one is they hired a a they got some economists I think it was from UCLA sold the guy who was staring at the camera and he in tone with a very serious vote if proposition Thirteen passes California will be plunged into the deepest recession never seen will prop Thirteen passed\nIn the economy in California exploded in the uh in the early eighties so everything everything that the progressives claim would be bad as a result of prop Thirteen has turned out to be just the opposite end\nAnd you know carry that forward today everything they talk about in terms of housing policy prop Thirteen transportation you know the promises all this stuff has good great high speed rail would be you know we've got to take\nThese promises in these representations by progressives who they are huge grain of salt but our strength is in our number so we hope people a joiner organization and learn what's going on in California but going to all the resources on our website which is age ... or\nThe props to vote for and against take us through them year\nSon six no one can and be very careful about the gubernatorial race or because of and we even doors John Cox by the way because of our nervousness with Gavin Newsom\nI thank you so much junk to Paul how are Germans taxpayers association thank you so much for being with is always a pleasure [noise]\nWe have gone too far and and that's enough from the state\nMy son always running sixty six assembly district I you are Republican you have a democratic incumbent you're running against what is the difference between the two\nWell he gave everything I spoke about the embraces the he is absolutely the opposite of me now\nI'm a guy a so I've always signed the front of a paycheck what that means is I've always owned a business and I understand the struggles that a small business man has to go through now the the funny part about that is that the struggles that a small businessman has to go through affects his employees\nAnd if one of them as the struggling he can't provide necessary thing too\nCloistered to survive and so you know we need to help the small businesses succeed in California and make a living for the people that worked for them so my opponent just the absolute opposite polar opposite of everything I've been talking about he supported the most bizarre things\nTo use the the last vote for to prop six or the gas tax bill is that the one\nHe was the guy that we can contribute passing that bill so he he alone is the one that we need to talk about for that but most importantly these guys\nAre really talking about getting rid of prop Thirteen then that's what most people should be fearful of but if you own a home for like that and prop Thirteen goes away when the grandfather you gonna devastate for every one that lives with the California could could cause another recession there's no doubt about it\nCertainly are a big issue if people want to follow you where do they go to uh learn the latest about the sixty six assembly district in ... a run for it how do they tell you\nWhat's real simple and you can usually go to Frank at Frank Scott says she'll teach you dot com or French got it for several yellow said will get you to the same place and we'd love to have people go on there and and read about what's going on and we hope to make a change in California\nAnd the last twenty seconds to say something to our listeners on why it's so important this election to get out and vote\nIf it is important because\nThat enough is enough we need to get our legislators to understand that we have people that are standing there saying that you got to learn to spend the money we give you rather than ask for more money\nFrank Scott Oh thank you so much running for sixty six assembly districts appreciate your time with his thank you so they ... they cannot go by coming up Michael Bustamante from know on top ten will discuss the proposition that will appear\nOn the November ballot he says it's flawed and you could actually hurt the rental market\nMost congressmen Dana Rohrabacher will join us he represents California's ... congressional

rare that I ever came across the guy who I had a beer with ... with all of us we were in combat them by taking\nIt was a Marine Corps about it is\nWhat they put on that Europe or what they go out

let's see if we can get you out to pay to go to relieve factor dot com\nI Am a Seventy sixer [noise]\nYour\nIssues with Larry marina Michael Bustamante is joining us we're going to talk about no on\nMichael thank you so much for taking time to be with us on the program today it's good to have you on\nThe Laurie nice to talk to voters are going to be Brian is with a bunch of different ballot measures and sorting it all out and tell us which one number ten is\nWell positioned tan would repeal the existing law um to to repeal wreck control um and then in exchange\nFor that it would do several things that would\nBe most importantly for the first time I'm have rent control on single family homes with also established about five hundred thirty nine different boards unelected 'em to tell us what we can and can't charge for apartments Oregon are single family homes\nAnd you are no on this let's walk through the arguments on this issue obviously\nThe other side says it's getting very expensive to live in California it seems like you know the landlord might raise his ranch here there and we got to do something I've seen the ad on TV that they're talking about this stuff you know I mean it is expensive here but it sounds like you're saying this isn't the answer\nWell you know there are some there is there a dispute about the fact that that we have a housing crisis but proposition ten will make the housing crisis worse than the reason why we say that several first off I'm would\nAh with this some sort of eyes any kind of building going forward for affordable housing which we all know here in Los Angeles and across California we're in desperate need of where this is a disincentive proposition tendons a disincentive to do any any further building\nYou know and and that will make it difficult for for ... the other thing it'll do is is is it will it creates a perverse incentive for folks who currently\nHave apartments in you know we're talking about small a apartment owners you know that I own a couple of of a duplex says or maybe two or three small apartment complexes where it's essentially say you know what I don't want to do this anymore I Want to get out of the market you turn those into condos or\nUm you know to to we're being be or other kind of vacation rentals but in the end what it does is it takes away stop from the from the rental market\nNow it seems pretty simple supply and demand kind of sets the price but if these folks come in and they set up these boards and somehow they tell a landlord you can't charge enough to make back the expenses you put into it and a little bit of extra\nWhy would you be in the renting business right\nWell that's correct in fact you know really that's one of the reasons why some folks may just simply say I don't want to do this anymore convert gr apartments in the condos and cell and that doesn't do any any good for anyone who is looking to try to find them apart and all that does reduce the overall stock of\nOf of ... apartments which by the way are you know kind of hard today\nYou know to find a more we suggest to something else\n... um ... and let's work with the legislature and local jurisdictions to create incentives you know either to reforming sequel or providing affordable housing bonds or the like you know could build a product and it'll it'll just simply do the reverse it'll make the housing crisis worse now\nIn California is not doing much to make it more affordable would legislation I recently read in the future they passed about requiring solar systems on houses that's going to raise the price of houses as you mentioned secret people don't know what that is but there's a set of laws\nTo make they do have a choice of clear one yes and\nThe main thing is they need to know that this is what this is about if they go one way with their votes are saying yes to\nFunding of illegals with health care\nThat saying yes variety of the century state\nFor whatever I I think the illegal immigration issue is one of a primary issues that will decide votes here because it's it is basically attacking our quality of life and actually attacking our safety as people\nBut there are some other major issues that are at hand the sober living home phenomenon for example a it's a I don't know how my opponent feels on that but a lot of people and his party feel oh no you can't do anything to\nA rain that ... program in because it's the same to helping people [laughter] well yeah we want to help the ... you know people who are drug addicts and people are alcoholics we want to help them when they shouldn't be putting these homes in the middle of residential neighborhoods\nAnd if they wanted they could have a solution in areas like the commercial areas are or areas industrial areas in the city but not now and then somebody ... neighborhood and I have a piece of legislation that says\nThe states and the ... and the local government should have the right to regulate sober living homes because what's happened because of the Democratic party and so far to the left have co opted\nThis in Washington so we have the sober living on coming here\nLocal government has been neutered they can't even a zone them out some legislation that I've been proposing\nTo actually get the power back to the local community to zone out and the license and give license and only those with licenses would be able to set up sober living homes and only the only their neighborhoods that are shown to force overloading\nWe heard today at an event in Newport Beach where they were saying are under six people and there's regulations at all these things that's right\nWhat's happened is again with the best of motives you know the liberal left in this country has the best uh motives I think they want to help people and they feel\nThat other people who believe in the rule of law and want local government to be responsible for things rather than having the federal government wants yeah they well\nThey don't see that that way and so we end up ramping all sorts of powers to the federal government should be done at the local level\nAbout what's at stake in this midterm election then why it's so important to get out the vote\nPaint the picture of what's going on dams want to take back control of the house there's a certain number of candidates they feel\nThey can pick them off so to speak with their people and then they can go after Trump that's kind of what's up right well\nWhat's happening right now really is\nA something that's been going on since\nThe Hillary last the last election\nObviously from the investigation into this Russian collusion\nWhat we're finding is there are a group of high level Democrats in our law enforcement intelligence agencies they were the ones who are committed not permit Trump to become president and once he did a they are committed to not allowing them to assume the authority\nHas said they will now obstruct his ability to become an exercise the presidency and this is what we are up against a mayor indeed we lose this election if it would go over the Republicans lose control like for example if I lost my seat and\nAnd my opponent was in a Nancy Pelosi than would be responsible perhaps getting control of the house\nAnd they would waste the empire next two years\nTrying to destroy Trump rather than trying to get some things done for our country so this is not just the joys of philosophy but let's let's recognize that Trump won the selection of two thousand sixteen\nI must make sure that we operate and and do the Democratic process that what he has to get things approved by Congress or we shouldn't have\nAn obstructionist Congress just as regular do nothing but get him and that's what would happen if I lose the Democrats get control of the house\nAnd and so that's why it's so important in this election as they say could be the most important also things like\nExtending the tax cuts and some of the things that are being done to try to help the economy dams would like to take that back while\nThere's a lot of things that that this president has done\nA if indeed uh the Congress decides is just a\nTarget the president rather than targeted being positive things\nTarget the president to attack him and get him to fail and that's a so whether it's a tax policies are regulatory policies on some great things for example you know I think what he's doing with the China trade policy is a good thing were challenging the Chinese\nTo treat us fairly\nAnd they say well you're going to create a a trade war with China the Chinese have already been a trade war with us we just haven't been doing fighting protect our own thing\nAnd so there's a lot of great things as president was done with an executive order that and that's one of the reasons why our economy is doing so well right now he really is taking\nAccess bureaucracy and and government controls off of the back some of those people who want to create jobs who want to get things done that make us more competitive so uh uh we need to make sure that uh that isn't done\nBy giving either house up to the Democratic party which is\nLate targeting the idea of making sure Trump fails\nCongressman dinner Roebuck ... is with us or running for re election in the mid term election there's a lot out there in the so called mainstream media that has jumped on the Democratic side you watch CNN MSNBC or ABC CBS [noise]\nAnything that needs to be cleared up that you see out there I mean they have no problems are just picking on Republicans as you know being tied to Russia or being tied to this or that well\nThat's a good example because here we've had a special prosecutor in place specifically because you've had fake news creating destroy that there was some collusion with Trump and the Russians that's what's holding election\nBecause they can't admit that Hillary was a good candidate and the American people don't want to go as far left as the Democratic party is trying to take us no Trump won but no they had to blame it on collusion with had\nOver a year and a half an hour with a special prosecutor norm is powers and they have not been able to prove that they wasted our time and my opponent for example ... time in our time\nAttacking me for that same thing all supposedly I'm too close with the Russians that I met with there's a sitter surely scripts that I've met with this Russian about Russian or what they leave off\nIs the fact that I Am the chairman of the committee in the United States House of representatives\nAnd the chairman of that committee that has jurisdiction to oversee our relations with Russia\nI mean you're doing your job yeah that is right leave that out of the equation that may sound sinister that I've met with a number of Russia sold a lot I I actually met with more anti Russian Ukrainians for example\nMy job is to me with a with people of every point of view from the countries that are overseas\nAnd Russia is the area where I'm the chairman of the comedy that\nHas the jurisdiction to oversee our relations so anyone\nWho sees those slate to go out in the mail and extremely tries to tell you that is why do you want to tell them oh wait a second I'm doing my job\nAnd they they they need to understand that you're up against\nPolitical party and how that is trying to base campaigns number on allies\nDestroying people to try that we've seen that done the forest for judge Kavanaugh and what are they feeling just us and saying the attacks on on\nOn him and now we know that no males do that as a conservative or Republican can expect that they're they're not going to try to use this tactic\nWell somebody who says they were with you when you were drunk than a teenager [noise] uh I mean this is just incredible\nAt one of the warnings on that is it good people\nWill say it's not worth running it's not worth going after public office if that's what they're going to destroy\nYeah yes and this in this case we had a wonderful guy with a great track record of public service\nAnd now he's being dragged through the ... with no there's no collaboration of anything that's in charge against him and said they are the fake news as again just spread it all out as if it's true\nAnd they love it that they did boost their ratings they you know we had a story to cover felt that the the dirty little secret to the media right well we're just a double standard\nWith the media and with these people who've been attacking judge Kavanaugh\nUh just overwhelming I mean these are people who do you have women are begging for help or about will come\nAnd many of them not just you know water and we had ... Kennedy again was in from us in Washington for\nThe type of things he was doing any of them in restaurants et cetera and went out and then I went out and then actually drowned some rural\nAnd left us sane and he said people are touching Kavanaugh for what he getting drunk and maybe doing something which we don't know [noise] ah [noise] ah they attack him really as if he's a rapist and yet they have Teddy Kennedy and ah\nLet's talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're found in our diet and only considered super feeds the green tea human humans very ... why did you want to combine just read there's always a message to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect to make each other more spend you know in a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason to\nPut them all in separate product they do go very well together as you said they're all food derived so it's kind of like you can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that\nAll of these are very very rich in groups of protective compounds that are both\nAntioxidant so they actually retired\nThe aging process of the cells in our bodies and protect our organ systems till they maintain\nA healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough I also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting resume or a trial\nIn one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nInto the headlines in the research especially on the green tea because you absolutely amazing I Know when he shouldn't have been using it for thousands of years for the G ... what are you seeing recently in the press you know you told me the\nNutrition research journal in July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased plasma anti oxygen activity and have blood get assigned you recap some of these headlines in ... while you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume but don't actually\nWind up in the body in any significant amount\nThe green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed they improve\nPlasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is you get this great concentration of antioxidants substances\nWhich a protective compounds floating\nAround in the body and protecting the cells of your body your organs every part of your body from premature destruction due to exposure to environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to fire on when we take in\nThe right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are the right antioxidants our bodies produce\nMore of its own super protective compound called glue to ... so you're taking the green tea extract\nYou build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called glue to fly on so it is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplementing gradients do\nBut it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nLet's switch gears and talk about this for human which is number two on your list by the way these three ingredients are all found in the new green tea combo formula would be offering free bought on a few minutes we'll talk to me about the human what'd you smelled C.

and one thirty three twenty six now we're going to bring fill assign she's got an awesome testimony on her skin cancer\nMilitary there I'm here All right so you what was your problem\nBefore I tell you my problem I just want to tell you how I started listening to you and when I first of all I read the Bible all the time I've never thought about oil seeming me and then because of your program I thought\nGod would never have this in the Bible these words in the Bible to get there to help me and I have to tell you that I bought some of your house I called you and you were very kind and and uh help me with a lot of things and then I\nOrdered some of the oils and found that they worked on me I had skin cancer on my nose semi cheat\nA that I was going to have the doctor remove but I've been through you know that painful procedure beforehand and yes and I wasn't looking forward to it in half my nose is bright red and when you scratch it leads and it wouldn't kill and so after I heard your program and I bought the oil I put it on twice a day\nFor a few days and then my skin on my nose started to peel off and I repeated this for about three weeks and each day I peeled off\nThe skin and it was a little less red underneath and then I finally was what was left with just a dot of blood and I kept repeating what I didn't tell the dog was gone and so now my nose is he'll perfectly and now I'm working on my cheek and that's almost healed all ready to go and\nVery little is left and then I had cancer or removed on my lower ... by a surgeon and a four inch piece of skin was cut out and I ended up with six stitches and that procedure was very painful\nAnd it took about six weeks to heal and uh now that same cancer that was in that way I traveled a little further down my leg and it's on the lowest part and I didn't want to go back to the doctor and have\nYou know the pain of drama and big bill again and so I've applied the oil there and now I'm ... it's peeling off on my leg and the cancers disappearing and\nThis cancers deep and so it's taking longer than three\n... but I see that it's getting less and less and and it it just now so I Know it's healing yeah yeah mhm\nAnd so then I also have painful arthritis in my shoulder and the fix it all this lessening the pain so now I can fix my hair I Do my own hair and I can't raise my arm against\nAbove my head without pain I thought what am I going to do now and I couldn't believe the fixes oil just after a matter of days it seemed like it was easier to live my arm over my head\nStart and train to junk out so yeah right\nNow so I'm really anxious to get into all the other Bible oil is too because I've got I'm eighty three are almost eighty three and a there's lots of things on me that I could you know he'll yeah God\nHe provide for us he did\nHe he certainly does second Timothy three sixteen says all scriptures given by inspiration of God and his profitable for doctrine really commit any proof correction and for instruction in righteousness and so I Believe that to be true and uh I I'm Glad I found something that helped me\nYes well I'm thrilled and it helped you and I'm Glad it doesn't usually take four to six weeks to the average for the Catholic Church support\nTo have the results but again if they'd be for it yeah it is sometimes it takes a little bit more but you just you know let us know if you knew anything more beyond that they can only tell you there too so\nOkay that followed eat a lot more things [laughter] well I thank you for coming on and really appreciate it\nOr ... God Bless you thank you thank you God Bless you buy\nSo I wanted to go over the specials that we have on the chances for we have the um getting cancer support down is sixty nine dollars but today we're going to allow you to get two for Ninety nine actually", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Glendale", "day": "14"}
