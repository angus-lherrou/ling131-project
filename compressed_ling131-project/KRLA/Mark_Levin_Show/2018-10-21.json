I tried it I thought okay\nI'm On what's going on with you [noise]\nAh well I'm\nDoing the same thing you're doing time I'm continuing to to practice law and it's a it is a passion and it is a love and uh so I Am continuing to do what I've done for a number of years now and ... and the most recent bang what's up with me is uh\nUh when we talk about corporate abuse sins misuse and or\nA arrogance a I'm a I'm representing that family ah down in orange county a whose son was killed by executive with Hyundai Corporation\nAnd a Hyundai not only a new about a hit and run incident that involve one of their corporate executives their corporate culture produce that\nAnd to make it even more reprehensible they are\nFor three days left the family wondering who it was that it struck their son in a drunk driving incident and they spent those three days helping their executives get to the LA Airport put him on an airplane and sending back to er Korea outside the jurisdiction of the United states of America so [noise]\nAh that's kept me fairly busy and it's something that uh I feel passionate about and I know you feel the same\nYou know widely it amazes me\nIs I go through my legal life of the stuff that goes on out there uh in the corporate world\nFrom the standpoint of what they do with their shareholders from the standpoint of a situation like you just had from the standpoint of uh doing a terrible acts and the one thing I think um my mom taught me\nBecause I used to a whole bunch of terrible acts I used to throw my socks behind the door or I didn't clean up my roommate didn't make my bed and there was a whole laundry list of things and you to go to confession I said well you know you try to you know but\nThe one thing that did take place is that my mom taught me how to say I did the wrong thing\nHow to apologize when you've been rude to somebody how to apologize when you whatever it was that was wrong and Jane Gerard he definitely have that down\nJane sorority apparently is surely missed in corporate America\nBecause as I go through these cases like some just like the ones who described you have fewer and fewer members of corporate America saying hey listen we did the wrong thing to know if if companies were to do that\nIf companies would say hey listen I we put out the bad pet food maybe your pets have died I don't know what your legal rights are enough to can sue for wrongful death of a dog but I Know this is really harmed you\nWe want to do something for you we first of all we promise you will never happen again we would like to help you get a new dog\nOr we will pay for that we will do those things they would go they would come off is the greatest company in America without a doubt and probably wouldn't even cost them that much [noise] and it seems to me that if if I see the acts\nAnd maybe I'm John does but I Want you to tell us it seems to me the corporate America squeezes more and more a lot of people that shouldn't be squeezed and once they're caught they have no ability to apologize\nWhile you and I know that the most devastating thing they can have it in a courtroom and for good is when somebody walks into the courtroom and accept responsibility and says I'm Sorry uh but you and I can count on the fact unfortunately ah that that's not going to happen 'cause they don't accept\nThat responsibility and the only way we can make them except that responsibility a is through the marvelous system we have in this country in the right to a civil jury trial and proud members of our society\nA and I want to speak just for a moment about civil justice system and about the the right to trial by jury or oftentimes we hear criticism of it and oftentimes weird Phil why do we need a jury why why don't we just have a judge [noise]\nWell there's a couple of really disturbing things that have been happening as we know for instance when we a garden in the courtroom and gotten the common person who sits on juries\nTo stand up and speak out against this corporate abuse this corporate fraud this corporate arrogance we're now seeing an act of Supreme Court there that just this week we've seen a front page article in the Los Angeles times\nOr this was a man who is passionate about not just about what he does but about why he does an for whom he does it as well he really is passionate about protecting others\nYou know I'm finally going back to my question about Merck if you and I represent the company and we said we want to lose to everyone who's had a heart attack that's been on this drug\nAnd maybe a few of them would have had a heart attack anyway but at this stage of the game we know we gave them medication that causes heart attack that we knew it before we even sold the drug and we should we weren't all of you to come down\nWith your lawyer let's discuss resolution\nIf you were young person now can't work anymore we owe you a lot of money if you're a person in your eighties we don't know you very much and let's work it out I think that several things would happen I think the world would respect the company\nAnd I think the cab at the end of the day from Merck would be much less than probably ... ... is going to be\nUh that's that's very true time and with always amazes me is is that um there is\nBusiness reasons set aside morality set aside what's fair set aside which just if you just look at a good business practice\nTo sit down and work these things out and avoid the incredible expense of litigation they seem to have no problem ignoring the the victim they seem to have no problem annoying the person who suffered a heart attack they seem to have no problem ignoring that individual's family\nBut they seem to have a lot of excitement about paying huge attorneys' fees to these large corporate law firms and spending all of the money is the old saying goes millions and millions and millions service for defense and not a penny for tribute or a penny for compensation for the people who'd so desperately needed\nI Would say and you would say that good business dictates that you do the right thing because in the long run it'll help your business and you'll make a bigger profit we're not against profit\nI we're absolutely in favor of seeing these companies be successful this is a great country we're strong advocates for free enterprise but you got to play by the rules and you got to be fair and when you break the rules he should be held accountable\nOkay um [noise] we have all this bad publicity about trial lawyers in fact guys like you were so much doing this courageous stuff\nHelping the people who've been harm\nThen why are they are all these bad jokes about trial lawyers why aren't there any bad jokes about corporate America\nScreen over the little guy blah blah\nAnd water the politicians go after you instead of corporate America\nLay it on me why only while says this is probably two different ... for the island's a little bit ... into a liberal and the sound a little bit like a\nAn economic question the reality is is we don't have the resources and we don't have the money that were they were taken on special interests were taken on usually large corporations with huge amount of resources\nSo they have the ability to advertise and twist the facts and pick out full page ads and\nAnd come up with all of these various ways of attacking and shooting the messenger\nSo there's no question that they had a very well orchestrated campaign the shoot the messenger\nThe other thing that we have to recognize that isn't you know we were never meant to be popular so when someone says that the travelers around popular that tells me something I think it's very important it tells me that we're doing a good job\nWhere we are to a ... here to afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted and nobody is necessarily going to be in favor of somebody who comes in and shakes up the pot and shakes up society\nSo as soon as we start becoming the love and light and as soon as we started being invited into all the right country clubs and as soon as we started getting invited to all the right cocktail parties where does not doing our job so to some degree I think we have to look at the criticism as a badge of honor\nBut it also has to be a recognition that hopefully the public will get wise to the fact that they've decided if you want to stop\nCivil justice system if you want to stop the victims and consumers from having their rights protected then you've got to get the messenger and they've they figured it out\nAnd they've spent a lot of time and effort and money and it's like I talked about corporate culture they've spent a great deal of Madison Avenue advertising dollars to create a culture\nIn which the criticism of the trial lawyers and the criticism of the attorney is acceptable because that's exactly what they want it\nWe're talking about me or culpa and you had a case of where'd you represent of the couple against Disneyland out at Disney\nHandle it well or the case of that that you're referring to is the case that involved the family that lost their son at the the the wrongful death case where the young twenty two year old boy was killed on the big thunder mountain ride\nAnd and the gap in the process of investigating the case that clearly there were some people who maintain that train a that\nCaused that train the crashing cars that horrible death there were people who are operating a train who could have pulled a trade off the track even though they knew it was having a great deal of of problems so again you would look at it and say okay well so\nDisneyland responsible because their maintenance people left it in an unsafe condition Disney's responsible because of the people who ran the train who could have made the decision to take it off the track chose not to do so uh but that's only half the story\nOf what we discovered was that this and they had a process and a program where all of the people you interviewed who ran the ride said\nOf course we didn't remove the the trade off the track\nWe would get in trouble for that they got to turn these things over we've got long lines we got to move these people on to the train and if we pull that train opposite track and it was found out not to be a a seriously in trouble even though we had strong strong\nSuspicions that there was a problem with that particular train than we would be criticized and we could lose our jobs so they were intimidated not to take the train off the track\nWhat happened with the people who were were maintaining the train these individuals were had been\nWorking I find to particular rides that's how Walt Disney\nOr when we brought this case we're on the side of Walt Disney who do we just weren't on the side of Michael Eisner the Walt Disney when he set up Disneyland had these workers each knowing each individual rights and assigned to work on that ride so it to the event the problem\nOf course along comes in efficiency genius who says well let's just have a pool of maintenance people for the whole part they don't know each individual ride they don't know it's it is secrecy and the maintenance people are not well trained and then of course that there's going to cause a problem which resulted in debt\nWhat happened in the Disney case\nWas not only did it take a long time and a lot of hard work to get the case resolved for this very very deserving family what the family wanted\nWas an apology and they wanted Disney to publicly apologized for the death of their son and we spent more time\nTo do she adding a simple I'm Sorry than we did the amount of the settlement and that is what's wrong with our society when we play so much value on the dollar and\nThe future dollars to be made all does need to think of is what can we do\nNot to impact the money we hope to make in the future even though it's our fault his is saying I'm Sorry going to somehow impact the bottom line down the road and that became the negotiating point even though they knew and the evidence was overwhelming in terms of the wrongful conduct\nThat as attorney ... embassies champions of justice with your host Tom ... joining us in Studio today also aiming for Solomon Tom\nSo um why they we represented the little boys and it got so badly hurt on the Roger Rabbit ride [noise] um the ride was such that it didn't have guards and so little kids could get thrown out of it and so forth\nAnd with that family wanted this was after your case was more than anything they wanted some medical protection for the little boy\nBut they they wanted an apology\nAnd I'll tell you a great of a story little boys in the hospital you been in the hospital for many weeks and there was an interview by the uh Orange County paper\nAnd they asked him his favorite person\nAnd he said oh my favorite person in service just alone\nNow somehow this interview got back to history Stallone\nThe next thing we knew without any press conference without anything else Sylvester Stallone drives down to Orange County with a bunch of rocky memorabilia sees a little boy gifts in this stuff\nSigns a bunch of autographs for him wishes him to get well et cetera this to me was the greatest story of a Hollywood actor that I'd ever heard of and I didn't know Mr Stallone at all he didn't know anybody had he wasn't doing this for the press release\nAnd then you have your adjusted gross income then there's deductions which many people itemize now they've raised the introduction because they figure now sixty percent of people use to itemize the government thinks that less than ten percent of people who itemize going forward that get your gross income\nMinus your adjustment because you're just grossing modest your deductions and exemptions equals your taxable income then you go to that tax\nCable and the tax tables had been reduced to get the total tax and then you have credits and credits or write offs like for example your child credits\nSo you want to adjust your adjusted gross income is a key element to determine your taxes a lot of things depend on this 'cause this is your tax rate there is tax credits et cetera but again it's really important to search your tax planning and look at ways to adjust your income if you have especially in your investments\nTo adjust that do see you if you want to do something the other way to reduce your taxes to give money away but you want to do it tax efficiently like for example if you want to make a significant give to charity consider giving appreciated stocks or mutual fund that you vote for many years instead of cash this will super church you're staying power with your generosity\nSo that's really important in terms of\nHow and what you give us a gift when you give it a lot of people who are terribly climb and they have in their will and the last will and testament earn their trust to give money away to some sort of journal there's ways to get the duck shouldn't today for that\nIn your lifetime that will still help the charity equally just as much as giving away after death but can help you today\nYou don't believe people should start up a business set up a home office there are deductions that you could get through that want to avoid double taxation on your investment there and he's still a lot of people think okay let's reinvest our decadence reinvest and if you reinvest these extra shears that increases your tax base of senior fun\nThat can reduce the tax will gain or increase the tax law sings when you were deemed shares in taxable account\nSo forgetting to have these reinvest uh dividends as part of your basis you're giving up some taxes that's a costly mistake\nMight want to consider tax free bonds there are a municipal bonds state and federal tax exempt\nThose things can pay very good money and they're very very safe\nYou want to use insured investments to defer taxes there are several investments that offer hire safety because if the insurance companies that are insured they offer guarantees many times he can offer income for life and they offer tax advantage growth\nMeaning you don't pay any current tax as a whole lot of these investments there's a number of strategies out there\nWith a lot of people say they're like my passion yeah I'm passionate about helping them navigate your financial life in today's environment so today we're talking about tax so simple steps that if you bother to take them you can really reduce your\nThese about this whole situation you see eighty five percent of adults suffer from financial anxiety I can help reduce that stress by breaking down the financial side of taxes into simple steps that'll create more income\nWhich you know putting that into an actual number will save you money over your lifetime\nWill do simple cash flow analysis so how much of your money you have to pay in taxes out of cash flow well if you could keep more of that you can maybe retire early ribbon at full retirement you can have more money for yourself\nWhat we do is we do a full review and apply some little known tax strategy that can legally reduce your taxes this will have a direct effect\nOn how much money you could keep in your pocket and making this offer the first time caller this is all for free with no obligation\nHave a hundred thousand dollars of investor the last call right now one eight hundred for for nine nine five zero one you can call or text right now one eight hundred for for nine

this will help put you on a path for success with your money in your retirement I call it a safe income tax strategy for success call or text right now one eight hundred for for nine nine five zero one one eight hundred for for nine nine five zero one\nSo you know there's been changes to the itemized deductions okay um you you know it used to be the standard deduction for a single person was sixty three hundred now it's twelve thousand if you're married couples was twelve thousand seven hundred now Mary joint is twenty four thousand\nPersonal exemptions used to be four thousand fifty they took those away you don't have any ... any more so it's important that you understand and a lot of people itemized while they gave you the twenty four thousand marital deduction or twelve thousand individuals actions you do not so medical\nAnd dental it used to be have to have ten percent of your income was spent on medical dental ... only seven and a half state local taxes the change that where the property taxes and state taxes can only be ten thousand dollar deduction max that that are hurt a lot of California's because we are very expensive house\nThe mortgage interest deduction has change if you buy a new home it's only seven hundred and fifty thousand dollar mortgage but you are grandfather a ... million if you own your home for a long time\nCasualty of death last people you should you know say well I lost my wedding ring or my car got destroyed you know which does happen and uh they wouldn't be able to write that off charitable gifts the increased that right off of used to be fifty percent of your income up your terribly climbing voice sixty percent of your ankle\nAnd again there's other miscellaneous deductions that have been taken away as well the tax bracket to change how some people depending on your income you're going to be in a lower tax bracket but your first Nineteen thousand dollars worth of income is ten percent tax bracket\nAnd then you're married filing jointly your adjusted gross income Seventy seven thousand four hundred I remember I said deduction is twenty four thousand\nTwo Seventy seven plus twenty for me do you make a hundred thousand dollars in your household or less your maximum twelve percent tax bracket so those things are good those things have been reduced down\nNow these tax credits have changed again family tax credits are better if you have kids that used to be a thousand dollars per child and you get phased out now it's two thousand dollars per child and it's not getting phased out a foreign tax credits well that's you know because they want you to invest in America\nAnd again there's general business credits that helps businesses dramatically so there's a lot of other changes as well or that have happened that affect Roth IRAs and affect the state taxes were down ... twenty two million dollars is not tax for a married couple\nBut the biggest change was in the corporate tax bracket went from thirty five percent of Twenty one percent that's huge it help businesses and there was a twenty percent tax breaks for small businesses that I don't think a lot of people even know about\nThis was huge and that's why the stock market's been doing so good but it's important to understand that when you invest\nYou want to invest in companies that are making money and investments that are trying to give you\nA total return which is income plus some growth yet there was a lot of people out there that are investing straight for growth because the tax laws were different were the capital gains tax were lower than the income tax this is going to level the playing field\nI think people seniors who want more income and safety there are going to benefit from this because the capital gains tax\nBecause of the total return\nIs income plus wrote an ordinary income taxes have been reduced and the capital gains taxes haven't been charged but it's really important there's a lot of moving parts the biggest question is is who's going to pay for all these tax cuts\nWho's going to pay for is it going to be you\nWhere's he going to be someone else back if you made any financial decision to the last ten

broadcaster those ... and we're not necessarily those are ... to Washington National security for to flee to\nThe radio station ... sesame not be suitable for all investors investors must make your own decisions based on their specific investment objective measure circumstances how was the situation with the budget for committing any of us and decision\nDoing Jim was grocery route to walk into some of the issues that are hockey she wants to people in the district or about\nWhenever I go around and talk to people they raised the issue of immigration pats away form healthcare said at the end education these are all important issues that we can talk about one of one of the ... or one at a time\nAren't let's start with immigration choose to be a hot button issue they're very big differences between Republicans and Democrats in the campaign as far as what people got to be done\nShirt when it comes to immigration I think we need to talk in the sense of being fair like parts of like me who came to the United states uh through the legal process worry the America gave us an opportunity to succeed and that's\nWhat my family did so we got to be fair for those people who wait in line for years and years and years after to just have the same opportunity that we did but we also need to be compassionate for the people that come across the border out of desperation to fully persecution fully they're\nCommunist wage and they are also coming up for and we'll I think the same American ... for the stadium and democracy that America provides we also need to make sure that those white here in the United states\nSuch as the DACA recipients saving here for generations and America provided public education we invested so much in that we need to find a way for them to stay here legally and also once they have that legal status\nStay here and apply for a U.S citizen a chip the same way than most people dead that we need to secure the border so we know who is here and cutting across the border illegally voices illegally and we need to make sure that people do not come to cross the border to engage in a criminal illegal activities\nSo when I talk about immigration I'm Talking about the fair compassionate and securing the border we can all agree that a secure border is part of the solution we can do this compassionate and I also disagree with the economy and it stretches policy that's separate families and I said that in the very strongest time\nWe talked about taxes and the economy first taxes you saw it on ...\n... in California we know something about losing jobs to stay thin countries with more competitive tax rates in the United states as a whole hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs have left to China Mexico\nAnd other countries for passage of tax reform I think we're blank nearly lasting competitive tax code like thirty one out of thirty five or something\nYou know something like that so we something has to be done at this economic news that we see is largely positive uh economies on the rise and unemployment rate it in its lowest\nDictate that we've ever seen people with al ... case are up like forty percent fit the bill passed and take a pay increase at the highest rate since the Nineteen seventies\nSo California and because of our state and local taxes we didn't see as much of a bump in California and that's something I Would like to work to fix when I get the Congress and I love to see Sacramento work on lowering taxes to bat Allen hold my breath they're\nStill when I when I get to what he said of course I Will definitely work on bringing back for solved and mortgage tax deductions and make middle class tax cuts permanent\nDon't give them the judge says the economy are so tied together you talked about the taxes what else about the economy maybe do some work I mean we are two things are better paying job which do other things you can be done to help out\nBut like I said when I get to Congress I Will work to ensure that we bring back the crap that's been put on salt and more than ... that's just what was that good things in a way to do with this tax rate why aren't we also see a lot of companies cutting back\nFrom overseas that means companies are hiring more people at the local level people are getting more job that nearly as strong economy leading to stability in our communities and our local economy and family will have more stability and that's how we changed things and help our local economy\nIn other words you you mentioned the hot right now is health care what do you see on the topic\nI think this is where I have a stark difference between me and my a corner and we need to do more obviously to lower the cause any polish people to make their own healthcare decisions my opponent supports the government's dictated single\nPayer health care system that is not the way to do it we also have to make sure that we have on the open market competition that will lower health care costs provide more generic brand medications to be afforded we need to allow individuals to be able to practice their health care insurance than\nBest fit their family's needs and again contrary to what you hear coming from my opponent\nI Am very concerned about being able to provide insurance coverage that\nIncludes the pre existing conditions I'm the one that I just talking about a second child was the one who live where the brain tumor she had to have to open brain surgery is still living what they exist preexisting conditions and these are important component of whenever we talk about improving or doing reforming our current\nHealthcare system and this is a very important provision for me and also having wait for children to make sure that she didn't that at the age of twenty six are covered under their parents' insurance plan\nJim is running for Congress to reunite district in orange county we'll talk about trade you mentioned that as a key issue what about do we do this\nYou know on trade we need a ... failed America's when when there is a lemon flavor feel we would call it or we innovate more\nMrs especially true in California I think the president's has part of the equation away you know we we he wanted to I\nWent on to say probably the the goal is to get to zero terrorists and hold everybody accountable playing by the same trade rules um if there is any one country\nThat we're doing a trade and Betty doing it in an unfair way and stealing our intellectual property to the tune of six hundred billion dollars a year\nAnd there are those like that and so we need to address those issues that we need to do it in a share and that you know get all of our trading a light a allies together\nTo ensure that everybody plays by the same uh same tray international trade rules thirty ninth congressional district gateway to Pacific ran we also need to engage and promote more robots trade because that will help our regional economy\nWhen you're talking about ... what about these cherish do ... or disagree with the strategy that the president is using to use to his way to get these countries to come to the table and be more fair\nI disagree with presidents or Terry policy as I mentioned the goal is to get to zero terrorists that uh we cannot do that on the backs of hurting other trading partners or their I Try to play by the same rules\nUntil I you know if we are dissatisfied with what a China's practices and I think that was the initial and kind of why he went this way or we need to do that in a a you know you deal with it and the one country at a time\nThirty ninth congressional district ... talked about the campaign or you should\nAnne's visiting a lot of places what are you doing to get the word out\nThat the exactly what I'm doing every single day out a throughout the day I said I like having four five six at different events anywhere there is an event going on anyway there was an opportunity for me to go and talk to the voters and residents\nThat what I've been doing this is nothing new to the cause I'm running for office this is something that they're in a I Love connecting with the community I Love going out to the community that the world\nI mean people need to know who they are representative as people will tell somebody that sent over and over who is fighting for them and that's what I've done for the last two decades and I'm going to continue to do that this is the district I Know I Want to give them the confidence that one way like way\nThrough Congress man would continue to see a representative who are working hard on their behalf\nDrinking moment to introduce yourself to those who may not know you just going to be one or two people out there what do you want them to understand about who you are\nAn

have to make sure Republicans maintain control of the house\nBut yet there is this you mentioned millions of millions of dollars being pumped due to our region to trying to defeat you to try to defeat the others there is a team of Republicans that our names would need to be remembered Dr ... which kind of the Republican congressional Orange County teams you'd like to go to like\nI Would love to see Dana Rohrabacher reelected I Would love to see young kids elected and that in the ... seat I'm Diane Harkey in the ... the seat and of course myself\nUh to be reelected and those are the four seats that the Democrats are really targeting ah as I mentioned before I'm Nancy Pelosi is desperate to get that gamble that and so they are ... billions and billions of dollars into our racist thinking\nThat they can defeat us you know Orange County it's like the holy grail for the Democrats because Orange County has always been conservative and if they can take Orange County in California they think they want at all\nSo we have to be very very conscientious of that and we have to make sure that Republicans get to the polls\nThere are a you know shifting demographics but still there are a lot of people\nWho kind of stand with the Republican ideals here and really you know want to see a thriving economy like what's being done it is it really just to the left you just can't believe that the Trump one did Hillary didn't get it it was supposed to be in the bag for is that what it all comes down to\nI think it is I mean I I Want somebody who didn't think that Donald Trump was gonna win either\nI mean I was really surprised that media and all the polling they were showing it was was saying how Hillary was definitely going to win and then you saw the reaction when she did it and people were absolutely shocked and I really truly believe\nThat they still haven't gotten over the fact that Hillary has it you know didn't win it fell to the far left not everybody in the Democrat Party of course you know it's it's really the far left for the most vocal if it's the far left it's people like my opponents of followers\nWho are a A R super super vocal you know the Elizabeth Warren

[noise]\nYour dishes\nWith Larry marina when you go to the polls are vote by absentee ballot you will have many choices to make one of those is proposition than it has to do with went to want to find out about it it's the talk of the new on tend to decide right now Michael Bustamante is joining us Michael thank you so much for being with us\nSo fake your joke first off what's explains in terms of what used to control\nWell rent control hum is who was part of the\nCost of ... that was passed about a little over Twenty years ago that essentially sets the ceiling in terms of what you can you can charge for partners um and\nProposition Ken would seek to repeal ending its place\nUm allow five hundred and thirty nine different boards across California to determine units that are available for for rent control and for the first time actually also cover single family homes which which would be just devastating to the two owners California\nShow how would it work if I had a home to rent I Would have to go to the board and say okay this homeless X number of square feet and I want to make X dollars on a charge this amount of money and they can say yes or no how would that work do that's\nCorrect I mean they can say now um and I mean I was a you know I moved to Los Angeles from Sacramento and had a you know wasn't ready to sell my house yet wasn't sure want to stay inside in Los Angeles\nSo we we leave spouse too to some doctors um and I would have have you ever gone to rent board in Sacramento to\nJust charge what it was\nYou know covered for just a mortgage I'm and I'm you know and the property taxes are assurance and if they said no that would mean that I Do that for a position that I got to eat those costs which\nReally isn't fair to me I mean I I think you know for the most part folks are trying to do right\nUm you know we heard an awful lot about the ... you know a a about the corporate landlords and all the proponents of prop ... styles but the fact of the matter is there are hundreds of small apartment owners are folks who have used this for their retirement\nUm and and it really really make it would really hurt them\nIn the pocket book um which is which is a sweater\nShow the folks behind ... if you give them the benefit of the doubt they're they're just trying to rein in the cost of housing in California but saying yeah housing is expensive but his wouldn't do that right\nWell I don't think there's any arguing about the fact that we're in a crisis wanted right now as it relates to affordable housing proposition ten does nothing to alleviate these problems are factored makes the housing crisis worse and here's why\nIt is a perverse incentive to create any kind of future building going forward which is exactly the opposite of what we need\nWe need more house and we need more apartments not last and proposition than what actually create as I said that perverse incentive to do just the opposite it would make us take several steps backwards in the end with all the people you know Latinos of African Americans and folks who are\nUm who who you know right now or or are suffering and trying to you know going from paycheck to paycheck to make ends meet those are the kinds of folks that frankly will be the most and that's why you know a word game folks are voting on proposition\n... it's really kind of a supply and demand thing if you if you sell something and you're limited in the price you can get for it to the point where\nYou're not recouping your costs into making a little money\nTrial attorneys and factual interest have tried to apply that to the ruling to private private security guard to private ambulance companies\nSo if that decision were applying to private and be like ... ... it would end the longstanding practice of paying private and cave and paramedics to be reachable\nCarrying their work breaks and this is a common practice for the last ... years it's the exact same way that police\nFire I'm looking to see them paramedics all public safety personnel operate and there have to be reachable during their break in case that they're the closest one to respond and and I think that the definition of I'm a first responder and emergency response\nSo to put this in perspective of the implication of the security guard rolling and what that can do to California's health care um private EMT the paramedics respond to about Seventy five percent of the state not among calls that's massive show proper a lot better well established\nA are long standing practice of paying anti the paramedics to be reachable during their break at all that much that into law and it on shared the closest ambulance can respond when a patient called nine one one\nReally that's the heart of the Niger and I think that's why we had twenty five newspaper editorials law enforcement local government attacks haired business groups all supporting a ... a lot and today so responders\nYeah who's against it who stands to ah to lose under this if it passes\n[noise] um I don't think anyone does it take great things for like the paramedics\nAnd like the trial lawyers you mentioned the bank they would like to have a cottage industry you're this kinda herds them being able to go after you make it\nQuick buck and they they weren't\nVery good luck is literally a so but I mean this really points out the problem that has been going through California businesses would wage and hour lawsuits lately just one piece of it but it's more than I think\nI guess people can kinda see the logic on if you're a security guard you get your walkie talkie there you know you're eating a sandwich somewhere and suddenly hey we've done tutoring area to you know it's like oh I got to know that because I'm eating my lunch right you can't\n... and not to downplay the job of security guards that pain that intense paramedic is entirely different um\nIt really is a matter of life and death and studies show that for every minute that passes without the yard for later your chances of survival decreased by seven to ten percent\nWhat is the is there any economic impact on this one way or the yeah\nYeah that's a great question though the nonpartisan legislative analysts office\nDid an analysis of proposition can and they talked about what would be the implication is the security guard rolling that's applied at private industry what would that look like especially because they answer Seventy five percent of the faith nine one long calls\nAnd they estimated that it would cost local government tens of millions of dollars annually because they may have to subsidize\nThese companies to continue providing a service\nIn their area so it's probably a lot of impact that it would actually save local governments tens of millions of dollars annually um the LA oh also estimated if the security guard ruling applies to the private industry in trial attorneys are successful\nPatient could potentially the longer wait times because the companies that have to negotiate um\nYou know\nAverage higher response time the counties to to a comedy that so they say rolling by trial attorneys or the sad attempt by trial attorneys would really put patient care and safety at risk\nSo how would you get around this would you have to have the cost of having a second EMT team it's set in their skin who from the first one so that one can go all the other wage doubled the equipment double the vehicles doubled expenses\nAnd it really just can't be solved by that but the issue is\nTied to anti them paramedics have always been hate to be reachable during their break I think that is an emergency response to it the same way that they're public counterparts\nA public and key then paramedics firefighters and police officers all operate so the security guard decision but only applied to private industry and not public\nSo daily buddy right in opposition the booklets for this\nNow there is no opposition argument and the voter information God that's a great question\nNobody you know they're\nJust trying to make these EMT people work harder without getting more money I mean you know I mean I'm trying to think who would see that but you're right that's their job right it is\nIt is and they want to respond they they want to respond Larry I'm that's why they got into the profession\nIs really about protecting against the law suits would've come because of all of a court ruling\nAnd about and sharing that when a patient called nine one one that the quote that they knew it can respond captive they've always done\nNow you haven't seen no ads on ... you know people saying shame on you I mean this is so different than some of the other campaigns that have been so contentious you're not saying\nIs this year there are some opposition groups that have popped up in the last couple of weeks I what are they saying it\nThey're trying to get more money for the people that\nI think that you hit the nail on the ... and\nThen if you're going to make me beyond called and you've got to come up with the whole scheme well I Know in the private sector if you miss a rest period or a lunch they're using economic value to in like an hour we pay or something that ...\nYeah and proper one can say that I wouldn't take that away it would start paying even paramedics can be reachable during their break that can break and they're not able to reschedule it like you mentioned it would continue California law makes sure that they have extra pay\nAnd then all the other workplace protections like I'm facing out their meal breaks so they can read the raft and they need to know\nThat way their employer can't say ... you know you're launching it clocking\nSo that that the great thing and then it also says that employers should maintain hina staffing levels they're able to accommodate for break so it's got a lot of great things and I think that\nThey don't look anti the paramedics should support it and and the public\nSo for the regular people who have\nYou know the hourly jobs in California it was launched by the fifth hour of break halfway in between forehand another break halfway to the you know eight ... you know before the eighth our and that's kind of it and\nThat fits our lunch has become a very contentious litigated point by attorneys using what they called pogo lawsuits he's he's just under that same era that do the same rulings and the same Supreme ... they're trying to we're winning Judy's EMT firms\nSo Larry I don't know the details of some of the cases against some of the small mom and pop and the only company but I haven't heard that some people have to talk to them\nYeah yeah so you're issuing ... you're encouraging folks to look at proposition eleven and vote yes on it because if they do then what will happen and if they don't what will happen walks through the ... rate\nSo if you vote yes on proposition ... it will allow I think he's an aromatic can chicken there a long standing industry I think after years of being paid to be reachable during their break why\nSo that the closest to me on can respond when you call nine one one it's that simple a proper live it also cuts into law that\nEvery can paramedic ... hate mental health benefits and the early training got famous standard for signing natural for responding to natural disasters and active shooter incident it just\nIt makes common sense and with this many wild fires and the doctors and shootings that we think we should have every ... medical training and so that\nWhen something happens I think will happen if we can all hands on deck ...\nShow the last show people understand where they vote on something by figuring out who put this together who circulated the initiative who got the signatures that kind of thing can you tell us a little bit about the funding behind it where it came from\nThe American medical is the founder of proposition a lot and it's supported by the California ambulances says eight and twenty five papers across state tax hair grew at ... for\nCitizens against the law is at the California in your advocates sleek scenic chamber of commerce and it's got a widespread support local government law enforcement so we have this frog coalition that I really believe that\nTo get a good Haley shows so much that I Love\nSalmon but I'm not going that far ah Sherry I didn't know that there were sixty plus human clinical studies in this specific natural form of ... and that happens to be impurities asked the ethics formula\nTalked about
