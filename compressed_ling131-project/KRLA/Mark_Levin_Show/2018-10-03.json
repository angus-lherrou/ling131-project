B. A. P. go\n[noise] Hi Mark hello [noise]\nIt's just a real pleasure to be with you thank you um the reason I was calling is I I just had a quick palm at\nActually a couple of them I had an epiphany for an old person I was thinking about in the news um some time back when Obama was in office and they talked about if I call year than if you recall I think that he had admitted to um [noise]\nI'm doing a little Tokyo and [noise] um yeah he was a ...\nYeah exactly and I had my court judge Kavanaugh is the best\nYou can tell you you can tell the guy is that fair on it and it makes me emotional and I'm Sorry yeah but I got up and I urge everybody out there get out there though because I was fired up about the election as I was\n... thank you for one thing to me and I'm Sorry\nNo don't be sorry Victoria thank you\nYou know or\nOver the weekend [noise] uh [noise] I was in Florida looking after my parents [noise]\nAnd er at night when I left him and I went back to my home in Florida I was thinking a lot about the Kavanaugh situation not in the way that all the talking heads where I said what really bothers me about this what does\nBecause the New York times if it's anything it's subjective not\nIn any headline of the pieces Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he re britches from his father now the Democrats have been saying that they're going to get a hold of Trump's taxes should they took her to the house and you can see how they work hand in glove with the media\nAnd so what does a president to do what is it personally Donald Trump to do with an article like this that goes on and on and on and\nHe can't win he can't win\nBecause what are you going to do put out a a a thirty thousand word peace\nDenying it all and then they come back and hit you again\nI told you this was a coup and that's exactly what it is\nBut let's let's or the sub headlined the president has long sold himself no see this is a new story\nThe president of this long sold himself as a self made billionaire but at times investigation found that he received it lasts for ... at least four hundred and Thirteen million in today's dollars from his father's real estate empire much of a through tax Dodgers in the Nineteen\nNineties I'm surprised they didn't go back to his high school years now\nThe New York times is located in New York City ladies and gentlemen Donald Trump's empire is located in New York City Donald Trump's been there a long time he's well known in New York City you may have seen his name's on a few buildings as a matter of fact [noise] probably sell them on TV for a period of time\nBut the New York times is writing this now\nReally\nPresident Trump participated in dubious tax schemes during the Nineteen nineties including instances of outright fraud that greatly increased the fortune he received from his parents an investigation by the New York times has found\n\nMr Trump won the presidency proclaiming himself a self made billionaire and he has long insisted that his father legendary New York city builder Fred see Trump provided almost no financial help but the times investigation based on the vast trove of confidential tax returns and financial records\nReveals that Mr Trump received the equivalent today of at least four hundred and Thirteen million from his father's real estate empire starting when he was a toddler in continuing to this day now you got to stop and ask yourself apart from the slings and arrows hear\nHow the hell did they get is confidential tax information\n\nHe's not a public corporation\n\nWhere did this come from did it come from the U.S attorney's office did it come from the attorney general of New York's office did it come from the local da ... of whom are some of whom have been demanding apparently documents from Trump world\n\nIt doesn't get any worse than the folks that surely does not\nMuch of this money came to Trump because he helped us parents dodged taxes that's at least the fourth time they use dodged taxes in this and I'm only on the uh let's see third paragraph he and his siblings set up a sham second time sham corporation to disguise millions of dollars and gifts from their parents records and interview show\nRecords indicate Mr Trump helped his father taken property tax deduction worth millions more he also help formulate a strategy to undervalue is parents real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars on tax return sharply reducing the tax bill with us properties were transferred to him and his siblings\n\n[noise] listen to this these maneuvers met with little resistance from the Internal Revenue service the times found little resistance from the Internal Revenue\nIn other words do you think for two seconds if the IRS thought that any of this was illegal\nThat they wouldn't be resisting it the president's\nParents Fred and married Trump transferred well over a billion dollars and robbed of their children which could have produced they tax bill of at least five hundred and fifty million under the fifty five percent tax rate then imposed on gifted in Iran says now that is absurd you have all kinds of deductions over a period of time\nYou have what's called adjusted gross income\nShe don't just apply the fifty five percent tax\nRate\nBut the Trump spade a total of fifty two point two million about five percent tax records show\n\nPresident declined repeated requests over several weeks to comment for this article but a lawyer for Mr Trump Charles Harder provided a written statement on Monday one day after the times sent a detailed description of its findings\nThe New York times allegations of fraud and tax evasion or one hundred percent false and highly defamatory missed art or said there was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone the facts upon which the times spaces it's false allegations are extremely inaccurate so somebody\n\nSomebody that looks like not reading further because I don't care too committed a crime or some at that these are individuals group of them committed a crime\nBy releasing somebody's confidential tax in from it you know this really is kind of style and stuff it's really grotesque\nThey have your health records they've your financial records you have to give him under penalty of perjury or they'll come after you give him in and that that are leaked\nThe Irish didn't claim anything oh the IRS just turned a blind eye don't you know ladies and gentlemen because we all know Donald Trump controlled the IRS in the Nineteen Ninety how ridiculous\n\nAnd noticed the New York times never produced is something like this on the Clinton Foundation in library\nRight on the nuclear deal\nTwenty percent of the uranium the speeches and all the right now don't\nBother to the Clintons no no way\n\nHarder sought to distance Mr Trump from the tax strategies used by his family send the president had delegated those tasks to relatives in tax professionals well of course he dead you know if that's in yourself it's the same exact way the family that owns the New York times handles if they don't do their own taxes\n\nPresident Trump that virtually no environment whatsoever these matters he said the fares were handled by other Trump family members who are not experts themselves and therefore relied entirely upon the aforementioned licensed professionals to ensure full compliance with the law why\nDoesn't the New York times except that point even as they go on they can't accept that point that Trump didn't do his own taxes and then he relied on professionals and others the president's\nBrother Robert Trump issued a statement on behalf of the Trump family are dear father Fred Trump passed away in June of Nineteen Ninety nine eleven mother marrying Trump passed away in August two thousand all\nAppropriate gift an estate tax\nReturns were filed and the record taxes were paid our father's estate was closed in two thousand and one by both the IRS and the New York state tax authorities\nAnd our mothers are state was closed in two thousand for our family has no other comment on these matters that happens some Twenty years ago would appreciate your respecting the privacy of our deceased parents may God rest theirselves\nTell you\nBut the Irish looked the other way ladies and gentleman\nMoney so vote [noise] our constitution was married for her was married only for moral and religious people and all inadequate for government sort of any other country really agree\nBut it doesn't do us any damn good we're living in the middle of this thing and we're trying to save it right\nRight that's where we need to get people back to religion with morality her but I also have a question you know from a terminal thing just watching all nonsense are wondering how many people would have in politics Fifteen foolishness disqualified them [noise]\nWhat we'd have very few in the Republican side on the Democrats' side how many people who your politics of adult foolishness a defined them in I think every day and want to thank you for your call my friend\nAnd the worst the higher up the Democrat chain they go Bill Clinton's accused of rape they nominated for president Ted Kennedy or with Chappaquiddick doesn't require any further explanation\nOr he's the darling of the left and always will be right wing go right down the list the White House has responded to this New York times hit\nFred Trump has been gone for nearly Twenty years and it's sad to witness this misleading attack against the Trump family by the failing New York times\nMany decades ago the iris review and signed off on these transactions the New York times and other media outlets credibility with the American people is it an all time low because they are consumed with attacking the president and his family instead of reporting the news\nThe truth is the market is an all time high unemployment is a fifth year low taxes for families and businesses have been cut wages are up and so forth and so on [noise] perhaps\nAnother apology from the New York times like the one they had to issue after they got the twenty sixteen election some virus only wrong is in order [noise]\nWe don't know why the Irish didn't look at it they gave it a pass says the New York times isn't this fascinating know who's going to do an anal exam additional burger families officials burgers or the New York
