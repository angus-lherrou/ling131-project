happens in DC right the Supreme Court\nA showdown and and all the other stuff happening but local ultimately what's really important is what's happening in your backyard and I think a lot of people don't pay attention to the city council meetings don't pay attention to in this poll code and ordinances that really dictate your life so very important that we start doing that we actually show up to smart city council meetings\nUp here in California or we should also pay attention to proposition ... I mean everywhere you should but ah here in California\nWe've got a big one that's a real controversial one\nAnd the first one I heard about it I thought oh my gosh I think we might have an answer to skyrocketing up prices when it comes to housing you know rentals and you know even buying a home so you've heard of proposition ten right everybody's like proposition ten it's like you know she just old guy come on the commercial talking about you know I don't\nHave a place of that and unless your bank is filled with money\nOr you know you got to vote yes on prop ten and then you get these other guys coming on like the family it's like oh my God like working class family right the commercial a pop ten ... ten it's going to hurt us homeowners that are working hard and those are those are homeowners you know kind of raise your eyebrow\nAnd think wait a minute all got hurt us what so so let\nLet's demystify a little bit of all that madness because I Want you to go to the polls you need to vote and you devote responsibly and be well informed I Will tell you\nIt it appears it appears because I Believe I still need to do some more reading but I Would argue\nYes on ten is probably what's going to happen in my book and I say that because we really do have to do something about the housing crisis I Can't tell you how many stories and pictures I get from family members in crisis that their grandma with cancer on her left leg is about to get kicked out of her a apartment because\nThe new landlord now because of you know rent control or you know laws and a different regulations they can't just kick out\nOf a guilty do they're smart they say Graham oh we're going to give you you know whatever extension it takes to get you out just a couple of months of that and once we moved out of the house of or the apartment during the year rank control department\nWe turn it into a condo you remodel and once you do that you can now hike up the price and taking that crazy vast\nReturn on investment and make lots of money and I mean I Want people to make money right that this is capitalism but I think the greeting is is a little bit out of control\nTruthfully uh so so ... ... what does ... really do All right let's bring in now ... ...\nIs a ...\nIn essence let me let me look Carol I had it right in front of you know just escaped me [laughter] All right ... would repeal the cost of Hawkins rental Housing Act you know what that is right\nNow I ... yeah it makes it possible I'll tell you the second one is but uh it makes it possible for city and county governments to pass rent control policies at well okay so the cost of Hawkins a rental Housing Act was passed in Nineteen Ninety five and what it did was limit municipalities\nTheir ability to enact new or expensive rent control policies\nSo here's the deal if you vote yes on prop ten proposition had\nIt's not exactly going to give rent control by it's not going to enact rent control automatically doesn't mean that cities will now have rent control ability it what it what it will do is it's going to clear one of the hurdles meaning it's going to give\nA these local governments the opportunity to an actor own rent control policy in the future which still means that you're my friend have to show up to the city council meetings and understand what they're trying to do\nIn terms of shaping what that policy rent control policy would look like if they even consider it or not\nBecause let me tell you the ... you know realtors association builders development\nThose folks are an incredibly powerful special interests lobby and in fact they import in I think something like\nYou know ten times the amount of money that the yes on ten folks have you know for commercials and all the ads and whatnot leading up to the election and apparently you know they've been outspent I mean these guys on the ... have a lot of serious money and you're going to start seeing a lot more ads as we get closer to November sex\nBut uh in fact you like you know you got huge real estate equity firms like Blackstone real estate partners and also apartment management companies like western national group\nUh that are pumping and millions of dollars you know on the nonprofit ten campaign or it looks like a date outspent them the yes campaign three times over ... you know so it's quite a bit look\nI think that it's incredibly important that we start somewhere I personally think it's kind of a poorly written proposition I would've liked the yes on ten meaning it's going to give rent control period to municipalities ... and\nI'm a homeowner I mean I don't I mean I'm sure I think that we're all entitled to make money but I mean [laughter] to what extent I mean people that own\nEquity firms people who own these big development\nListen ... just relax you survive you only drive one Bentley at home I mean how many families can you drive at the same time ... I mean seriously it's like the greed that control like we need to find a way to still keep families together and our seniors\nUnder a roof I mean I'm not kidding I Can't tell you how many stories I go out to and I talked to a lot of our elderly say we can't afford to live anymore and right in there or rent increases that we're still kind of you know trying to follow and and and survive with but\nYou know the fact is rent control is one way I'm not saying it's the final answer but it is one way\n... it was a specially\nYou know looking after our seniors who do you live on a fixed income or disabled family members who are at some point maybe have to live by themselves are not in a group home remember you have institutions or by law that are being shut down so where do all these special needs loved ones go\nThey have to go into the community and uh where do we place\nVulnerable soul you know we have to find affordable housing for them and I think there should be some type of rent", "show_name": "Sunday Morning with Elizabeth Espinosa", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "14"}
