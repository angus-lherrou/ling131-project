Want you to go to the polls you need to vote and you devote responsibly and be well informed I Will tell you\nIt it appears it appears because I Believe I still need to do some more reading but I Would argue yes on ten is probably what could happen in my book and\nI say that because we really do have to do something about the housing crisis I Can't tell you how many stories and pictures I get from family members in crisis that their grandma with cancer on her left leg is about to get kicked out of her a apartment because\nThe new landlord now because of you know rent control\nOr you know laws and a different regulations they can't just kick out\nOf a guilt they do they're smart they say Graham oh we're going to give you you know whatever extension it takes to get you out just a couple of months of that and once we move out of the house of or the apartment you know the rank controlled department we turn it into a\nCondo you remodel and once you do that you can now\nHike up the price and taking that crazy vast return on investment and make lots of money and I mean I Want people to make money right that this is capitalism but I think the reading this is a little bit of controlled truthfully uh so so ...\n... what does ... really do All right let's bring in now ... about ten\nIs a ...\nIn essence let me let me look Carol I had it right in front of me now just escaped me [laughter] All right but then would repeal the cost of Hawkins rental Housing Act you know what that is right now\nIt makes it possible I'll tell you the second one is but ah it makes it possible for city and county governments to pass rent control policies at well okay so the cost of Hawkins a rental Housing Act was passed in Nineteen Ninety five and what it did was limit municipalities\nTheir ability to enact new or expensive rent control policies\nSo here's the deal if you vote yes on prop ten proposition ten\nIt's not exactly going to give rent control by it's not going to enact rent control automatically doesn't mean that cities will now have rent control ability it but it will do is it's going to clear one of the hurdles meaning it's going to give\nA these local governments the opportunity to an actor own rent control policy in the future which still means that you're my friend have to show up to the city council meetings and understand what they're trying to do\nIn terms of shaping what that policy rent control policy would look like if they even consider it or not because let me tell you the ... you know realtors association builders development\nThose folks are an incredibly powerful special interests lobby and in fact they import in I think something like you know ten times the amount of money that the yes on ten folks have you\nKnow for commercials and all the ads and whatnot leading up to the election apparently you know they've been outspent I mean these guys on the ... have a lot of serious money and you're going to start seeing a lot more ads as we get closer to November sex\nBut uh in fact you like you know you've got huge real estate equity firms like Blackstone real estate partners and also apartment management companies like western national group\nAre that are pumping and millions of dollars you know on the non ... ten campaign or it looks like a date outspent them the yes campaign three times over ... you know so it's quite a bit look\nI think that it's incredibly important that we start somewhere I personally think it's kind of a poorly written proposition I would've liked the yes on ten meaning is going to give rent control period to municipalities ... and look I'm a homeowner I mean I don't I mean I'm sure I think that we're all entitled to make money but I mean\n[laughter] to what extent I mean people that own equity firms people who own these big developments\nListen ... just relax you'll survive you only drive one Bentley at home I mean how many families can you drive at the same time well I mean seriously it's like the greed that to control it we need to find a way to still keep families together and our seniors\nUnder a roof I mean I'm not kidding I Can't tell you how many stories I go out to and I talked to a lot of our elderly who say we can't afford to live anymore and right in there or rent increases that we're still kind of you know trying to follow and and and survive with but\nYou know the fact is rent control is one way I'm not saying it's the final answer but it is one way of ... it was a specially\nYou know looking after our seniors who do you live on a fixed income or disabled family members who are at some point maybe you have to live by themselves are not in a group home you remember you have institutions or by law that are being shut down so where do all these special needs loved ones go\nThey have to go into the community and uh where do we place\nThese vulnerable soul you know we have to find affordable housing for them and I think there should be some type of rent control so that we can all you know live in peace and well together so\nI mean look there's a a number of groups have already endorsed uh the yes on ten campaign I Know some of the newspapers the Sacramento Bee anyway one of the most influential they say newspapers in California\nAs indoors proposition ten and um and I would say that uh you've got a ... it's just you got a fighting chance or you know to help families so why not so of course we'll post on his information on our website but just keep reading guys I don't want your showing up to the polls and just thinking like\nOh yes or no let me see I feel today\nThese are so important this is such an important proposition ... and in fact I'm pretty sure right what do you think we should actually look at some of the other ones I think there's there's a funny one about uh should paramedics take an interruption breaks a on a shift while someone's dying it'd be hard to accept\nWhat [laughter] raising your ...\nI I I Am ... words right
