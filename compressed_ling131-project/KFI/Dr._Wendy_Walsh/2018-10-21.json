{"year": "2018", "show_name": "Dr. Wendy Walsh", "day": "21", "month": "10", "state": "CA", "content": "Welcome back to the Rick Adelman show when's the last time you went into a supermarket shelves like yesterday maybe today\nCertainly probably going to go tomorrow or I mean that's one of the things I think a lot of we all have in common is going to the supermarket and we all have pretty much the same experiences and that supermarket we wait in a pretty long line or to go through the check out and we're always looking you know if we go into that ten items or fewer\nLine I guarantee you're counting the number of items that guy in front of you has right 'cause we've got eleven you're annoyed well\nGuess what's coming the cashier less store in San Francisco the first one has now opened its called standard market it is the first completely automated cashier lists store\nYou download and out and after you've done that you go in your grab what you want and you leave that's it nothing else to do cameras using facial recognition identify you and what you bought\nThis new start up is raised over eleven million dollars and venture capital they formed partnerships with for retail chains their goal is to add their technology to one hundred stores a day a day one hundred stores a day by twenty twenty\nOh by the way five of the seven founders of this thing came from the SEC where they built a a software used to detect fraud and trade violations they're now using their expertise to help see if you're going to steal from the store\nSo wow pretty interesting uh illustration of the technological changes that are coming to society I talk about them a lot in my book the truth about your future that's what it's all about exponential technologies and how they're impacting every aspect of our daily lives\nHere some of the latest and greatest announcements that have recently come out in the field of quantum computing this is the entire next generation of computing Google Microsoft and tell them IBM they're all investing in this or over Seventy prototypes already\nThe U.S house of representatives just passed a bill the national quantum initiative act\nTo accelerate education research and development they say that the quantum computing can lead to new pathways that will cure cancer explore the universe develop an imagined new materials and soft complexities of our own human biological systems it's really kind of amazing when you think about what's coming next you know it's already here\nAI\nHelp catch criminals in China police in his shoe east railway station have caught seven fugitives who we're connected with major criminal cases they have found twenty six other people using fake IDs you know how they did it\nThey're wearing special eyeglasses that have a I built in\nThat give them facial recognition so just by looking at people in the crowd they're able to identify if you're really you or not\nYou know we just talked about a new supermarket where there are no cashiers there's a coffee shop near Brown University where students are the customers\nAnd they get free coffee\nNo cash is accepted the university students however in order to get the coffee for free have to provide their name and phone number email address and their major\nAnd they also have to provide their date of birth and their professional interest and the coffee shop collect the data\nAnd sells it to corporate sponsors who will then reach out to the students through logos and apps and digital ads and screens in the stores and on mobile devices and another are you willing to give away your personal data\nIn exchange for free stuff\nThat's the premise of this coffee shop and it's raising a lot of eyebrows among those in the privacy war\n[noise] meanwhile in the field of medicine a Chicago start up is now three D printed a human cardiac patch it's a major milestone leading to bio printing fully functioning Oregon's you take a patient's own blood cells you reprogram them into stem cells you'd make the stem cells into three D. bioengineering\nAnd human heart becomes viable for transplantation\nIt's the first time a cardiac patch was bio printed three D. with multiple cell types the human heart is made of\nMeanwhile researchers at the University of Oxford department of clinical neurosciences has created the first robotic system that operates on a human ... a robot doing surgery on your side\nThey insert the robot in to the pupil ... an incision less than one millimeter inside the surgeon than operates the robot via a joystick it eliminates the worry that the surgeons hands might shake or accidently move or whatever\nThe robot has already been used to conduct two routine procedure removing a run brain from the retina\nAnd dissolving hemorrhage is under a retina and in both cases the results were better than what human doctors could do\nAt Johns Hopkins scientists have developed an electronic skin that can fit over a prosthetic hand it allows the user to feel sensation including pain\nThrough a prosthetic skin pretty amazing the FDA has now approved of the day I system that will assess whether a patient has a disease that might lead to a vision loss it's eighty seven percent accurate and it's the first screening device that doesn't need a human clinician to interpret the image a robot system doing it all by itself\nThere's an atomic trust has invented a by on a contact lens that lets people see three times better than twenty twenty\nHow would you like to have binoculars in your eyes\nOr being able to look as if you're using a microscope that's what has already been created with a by on a contact lens\nThese kinds of innovations and more are going to radically improved quality of life for pretty much everybody on the planet once they reach mainstream production\nSome other a fascinating changes going on in the field of exponential technologies of MIT they've created a wearable interface that knows what you're thinking without you having to say anything out loud it's a white plastic strip it hooks over your ear goes below your jaw\nThe electrodes pick up a neuro muscular signals that are released when you think of a certain word sort of like saying it in your head\nAnd it's accurate Ninety two percent of the time so people wearing this device say they're paralyzed and can't speak or say they don't have a voice box so they have some kind of physical disability just by thinking they're able to communicate\nIt's amazing what's going on in the field of medicine but it's not just the field of medicine where we're seeing some pretty amazing\nInnovations in the field of robotic scientists of MIT of made a robot that can teach itself to see and identify objects and how to manipulate them as well know robots been able to do this before this robot is capable of picking up an object it's never seen before\nAnd without resorting to trial and error it knows what to do with the object of how humans do it you pick up an object you've never seen before and you know how to pick it up without breaking it you know how to turn it so that you can examine this robots able to do the very same thing\nThis is just a few of the illustrations of what's going on in the field of exponential technologies and how they're going to radically improved and\nAlter every aspect of life that you can think about and that's why we encourage you to go to her YouTube channel\nGo to YouTube dot com slash Edelman financial and you'll see the Twenty one videos that I've recorded that teach you\nWhat's

next week\nOr next and the doctor Wendy Walsh show is the federal government trying to change the definition of sex again is there a mental health crisis in your child's college dorm and are you getting the right macro motives in your love relationship this is KFI and kale S. P. H. D. to Los Angeles\nElection whichever way you're voting doesn't matter we show up in midterm elections people are notoriously less likely to show up and vote and then they spend the rest of the year complaining and fighting on Facebook\nWith probably a Russian bought who knows [laughter] so just just get out there in ... you know I I live in Venice so our voting a\nPlate and what do you call it voting place it was called polling place is the lifeguard headquarters and it opens at seven AM and I'm usually one of the early years there in line as soon as I get my kid off to school I ride my bike up\nAnd I'm like only in California can you stand on the sand and line up at a lifeguard stand to cast your vote\nAnd I don't know it's just a nice ritual and I remember the very first year to do it I became I live I've lived in this country for Thirty years and lived for much of it without a voice and in two thousand eight\nI decided to become an American I Am grateful to be an American I'm very proud patriotic American and so I remember like taking my kid down to the convention center where I got sworn and it was under bushes regimes that he was there on the big screen and\nThen on I brought her with me to vote so that she could see because you know if you just do it when they're at school the kids don't get to have a model for them that this is what\nAll family should do this you participate in the process\nSo enough about that get out and vote in November six I'm\nI was reading in the New York times today a very interesting article that the current administration is considering narrowing defining gender as a biological immutable condition determined only by Jenna tail yet at birth\nI'm so basically the\nAh which agency would be doing this health and Human Services of course department of health and Human Services they have proposed that they will have a definition that would define sex as either male\nOr female on changeable and determined by the genitals that a person is born with now\nThis was surprising to me because I thought that politicians especially people working in the department of health and Human Services would be a little more scientific and would understand more about the definition of sex so\nI felt like I should just take a moment and define what sex is I mean\nMaybe we'll just believe that biology defined sex and the sex is always a binary affair you're in one camp or the other that's it um\nAnd and even though this idea that these weird left wing people are post modernist and they've been just playing around with gender bending ideas for decades there is this idea that sex is ex biological sex is sex and sacred and it means you're either biologically male or biological female\nBut here's the problem biology doesn't work that way [noise] biological phenomenon\nDon't fit into human ordained ... binary I'll get the word out I narrate categories so even though we as human beings insist like we need the world to be in this neat little order of black or white male or female ideology doesn't work that way\nHave you noticed how many colors of roses there are what if you only like red roses and white roses you would be pretty upset with lavender roses or those greenish roses that they sell at Trader Joe's right so let me explain how biology doesn't work that way\nSex sexual differentiation is a combination of a few things first of all your chromosomes we know that we have twenty three pairs of chromosomes and the last pair number twenty three or the sex chromosomes and you can be\nEx ex and be a woman you can be X Y and be a man hold that thought\nBecause there are variations on those chromosomes then there's go NATO sex and that's what's going on inside do you have ovaries or do you have to Estes then there's internal genital sex do you have of China are not a prostate whatever and there's external genital\nSex Libya Eunice\nAnd here's what's interesting babies pop out nobody has a chromosome test nobody has an X ray to see what's going on inside and instead they simply look at the shape of what's on the outside\nAnd decide that that that's the sects you are male or if it looks more like a penis or more like Libya than that of all the that's what you are\nIn truth huge chunk of babies that are intersect and may have a genitalia that could go either way and in that case you want to do a little more looking then you add on to this\nHow this child is ... and from all of these combinations they take on a gender identity or a gender role now I mentioned I said hold that thought when we were talking about the sex chromosomes so they have identified over Seventy\nDifferent variations of the sex chromosomes alone for instance if one is born with Turner's syndrome a that means they have forty five chromosomes instead of forty six they have an ax and then the missing one there go novel sex would be fibrous streaks of ovarian tissue inside\nTheir reproductive internal structures would be a uterus fallopian tubes there external genitals normal female but they'd be sterile\nAt puberty undeveloped brass\nTheir gender identity tends to be female then there's Kleinfeld her syndrome\nX. X. Y. an extra one they're born small to Estes a normative male internal structures and undersized ... what happens at puberty feminine station and they often grow breast and round body contours um they often have a lot of gender identity confusion\nAnd there are ... and ... and ... nice females their ... insensitivity syndrome there's ... deficit males I could go on and I could go on\nSo for us to play God and say your one or the other because we looked at a piece of tissue in between your legs externally is not fair so I'm just saying I Hope the department of health in services reads a few scientific sex books textbooks\nActually sex books [laughter] textbooks on biological sex All right that's all I'm going to say about that I'm off my horse hey did your kid go to college this semester or they alone in a dorm with a roommate\nFrom El well you may not be right now college campuses are experiencing maybe a mental health crisis and maybe your kid might be affected let's talk about it when we come back you are listening to the doctor Wendy Walsh show on KFI am six forty labor out you have the news ...\nThinks or would it help workers are they are seeing signs of mental stress and residents was it a week of hurricane Michael\nThose problems tempted to throw a long term recovery level two years after medical assistance team says there are serious when he was one of the nation

they Joseph talks about the future of health on too if I Am six forty keyword health\nPrimary reason to get more cops on your\nMorning between five oh five five twenty and I are harboring station [noise] [noise]\nHey if\nI Am six forty you have Dr Wendy Walsh with you hear that promotion says that we're giving away a thousand dollars all week long on weekdays\nWeekends too and I get to give a thousand dollars today so hang in there it's coming up I Swear it's\nComing up you know they control when I can actually do it or there's only so much control I have here folks\nI'm already talking about mental health and college students you know you send your kid off to a college dorm you make sure you buy that special size single bed sheets and all the little\nThings that they need for their door dorm room and it drives them they're yellow dirt and you'd think to yourself they're going to just have a great year it's all about studying rights\nBut actually the pressures that kids have when they're away at college the pressure to succeed academically the pressure to deal with finances for the first time I will tell you\nMy kids in her third year and I have never sent her a penny [laughter] she has three jobs so yeah she's stress stress me um and socially trust me they're having to build new friendships new relationships there's so much social stretch that goes on\nI'm at a time when the changes in the brain during the early twenties affect how these new experiences and new pieces of information can be sympathized\nBecause the brain growth tends to coincide with the same time with a loosening of a parental controls important and all this freedom freedom of attending college and this can cause a lot of stress\nSo what if your kid is experiencing a mental health issue here's the problem\nUniversities don't want to deal with it because they want to keep the campus as safe as possible so there's a catch twenty two\nIf your child shows up\nAt a health clinic professing to have anxiety depression whatever they are generally sent home\nSo this makes friends and the students themselves less likely to report\nSo it's kind of a hard a catch twenty two in fact there were in today's article about this in the New York times there were a lot of quotes from former students about things that happen to them uh one thing that she suffered from suffer from crippling depression anxiety and insomnia\nI'm and she spent a week home with her parents for realizing that being home\nA and without a structure routine was making things worse and decided returned to college another kid was expelled for having auditory hallucinations and was sent home\nSaw a doctor and then was told she actually had Lyme disease didn't even have a mental health issue and then the school she was sort of embarrassed to go back to school because it was like she was expelled\nFor being crazy so there's this stigma peace\nNow what if your child\nIs doing quite well but has a roommate it's experiencing mental health issues so they could be eating disorders like anorexia or bulimia\nPersonality disorders paranoia obsessive compulsive addictions a big one alcohol opioids tobacco mood disorders depression bipolar\nAnxieties phobias\nAh and then the the big diagnoses right the thought disorder schizophrenia can come on I think the most important thing that you need to tell your young adult child is they must report somebody\nThey have to reach out to adults the thing about mental health issues is they generally don't go away\nAnd one in five Americans suffer from mental health issue at some point during their lives and it's estimated that about twenty percent of college students are suffering\nOne in twenty five Americans live with a lifelong chronic mental health disorder that may require medication\nAnd the time that these diagnoses ... in our in the early twenties\nSo let's talk about the symptoms that your child should be on alert for and you should be on alert for with your own child and I know it's hard they're away in a dorm their face timing you every once in a while they just want to get off the phone and get back to their friends but you got to try to figure things out\nThings like anger substance abuse isolation if they're being alone or if they're having any delusions course confused thinking mood swings\nWell mood swings are very teenager anyway but I mean with a lot of these other things combined excessive anxiety unexplained physical ailments interesting enough\nWhen we don't have the communication skills or the permission to talk about our feelings with others our bodies speaks for us and so our mental health goes into our body\nThings like changes in sleep patterns change is an appetite or diets um or impulsive behavior like in terms of travel spending money or sexual relationships right so if you're a college student listening and you see this one of your classmates you need to report it to somebody now\nThe question is are you the one who's going to get them kicked out of school I you know I'm of two minds have this should it be a university's job to educate\nStudents or should it be their job to be their health care provider now to some degree they do have healthcare services so basic run of the mill mano strep throat whatever I'm there they're going to treat\nBut what if this mental health issue is going to be a chronic lifelong thing is it the university's job to treat this while they're trying to educate a student I don't really know the answer I don't like to hear stories of anybody being discriminated against\nOn the other hand we've had enough college campuses shot up by children who suffer from children young adults who suffer from mental illness and so we want to protect all the students\nUm so anyway it is it is an issue check in with your student to a lot\nAnd educate them on what the signs are to look for now\nHaving said that\nReaching out for mental health care in America\nCan be a challenge on its own I mentioned one in five American adults have experienced the mental health issue if I had to look back through my life I Would say I had postpartum depression twice\nA probably in my teens I suffer from a major depressive episode or I look back on it and I'm like oh my gosh I Can't believe how you know in my room crying for hours and nobody attending to it\nAnd then one in twenty five Americans live with a serious mental health illness such as schizophrenia bipolar disorder or a major depression [noise] um\nAnd the mentally ill in our country and in our city who have nowhere to go and find very little sympathy from people around them these are the people that land in emergency rooms in the county jails and on our city streets\nWhatever your age range county register successful aging experts as something for you with fun activity exhibited screenings and educational presentation Saturday October twenty seventh Hyatt Regency Orange County and mission and parking are free to go to a successful aging expo dot com or twenty first warfare today on the radio\nI took out all of our guy Tyrone radio view of the Rio Grande episode with the ... own garden me\nNo I'm In ... talking about his new album and of course some discussion about a little band called the Beatles refused ... news radio ... if I was very oh\nWhat are you doing [laughter]\n[laughter]\nOh hell man a\nMan if I Am six forty have Dr Wendy Walsh with you it's funny I was\nJust talking about mental health care for college students\nAnd didn't mention physical sickness that happens to kids and when they're so far away how you know just how difficult it is for parents who worry so much\nAnd while I'm doing it that segment my kid from her dorm room is texting me about how sick she is and she'd gone to the urgent care earlier they gave her some anti nausea med it's not stopping its three three days into it she stressing about all these midterm she has coming up and I'm like she should have been listening to show I'm like\nEmail your professors tell them what's happening communicate with people go back to urgent care ... ... what can they do I want to go jump on a plane and hold my baby that's what I Want to do\nThis is how they grow up in separate from us and I wanted to close my little talk on mental health care before I get on to our relationships by just reminding people that if the very first line for you if you have health insurance is do go online and look on the website and find a mental health provider that your insurance covers\nA check with your uh insurance policy to see how much they cover\nAnd if you don't have insurance for mental health care you know every major university that trains good clinicians\nAs a student counseling center I'm ... where they're supervised by licensed psychologists and psychiatrists so you know sometimes you can get services for as little as ten dollars a visit\nSo calling UCLA or USC or some of these other major universities in town they might have a healthy for you [noise]\nAll right can we talk about our love lives\nUm before I Do that I could just keep delaying because there's something else I wanted to mention um I'm noticing on my social media that people are telling me that they are in different places Florida Kansas how is this is it you're listening calf I Am six forty dot com on the Internet is that way and Josh and attack the there is nodding his head\nThat's so cool so do me a favor if you are listening from somewhere that is not Los Angeles can you posted for me so I can see all the places I have listeners is fun um my Instagram is at the our Wendy Walsh and that's the same for everything Facebook\nAnd Twitter whatever so you can go to whatever when you use and just tell me where you're listening from because it's so fascinating to think that it's all Internet based now and you know you can always find me on the eye heart radio at especially on Sundays when the chargers are playing here in Los Angeles I ... special show just for you people and go to her radio app\nA or listen to a calf I Am six forty or\nEnough let me move on your relationship uh I Love love and I love to think about what makes love work\nAnd the scientific piece of it and rather than studying dysfunction I Am most interested in reading the research on happy successful couples and so when this research came across my desk today I found it very fascinating and it was a new study published in the\nJournal of family theory and review and these are researchers at the University of Illinois\nAnd they basically say that you know for many couples in relationships just being together is good enough but others want to see your their relationship continue to grow to move forward to get better and better and they are willing and\nReady to put effort into their relationship to make it get better I Believe that relationships are a gymnasium for our minds\nAnd their relationship is over when both partners have stopped growing or one partner has tried for however many years to get the other person to participate and is unable to\n'em now keep in mind that I'm going to have you guys calling very soon in the next hour or for our should I stay or should I go segment I'm\nYou know a really she just got to be pretty toxic for me to ever say that you should throw in the towel right ah I ... at when I say toxic relationship I mean where there's addiction chronic cheating domestic violence child abuse these are not healthy nest to raise kids in\nIf you have children in your nest zero to Eighteen I'm probably going to suggest that the two of you stay together for the sake of the children because their research in science supports that\nActually the pressures of maintaining two houses the financial pressures are more likely to throw kids into poverty and the kids being bounced back and forth between households is not good for child development so you know what you signed up for Eighteen years and I know what you're thinking if you know anything about me you know I've been a single mother for fourteen years um\nAnd I will tell you this that there was a toxic events", "station": "KFI", "city": "Los Angeles"}
