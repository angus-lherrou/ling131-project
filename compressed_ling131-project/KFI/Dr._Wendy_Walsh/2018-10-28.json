cost of college this year went\nDown [noise]\nThis is the first time in over twenty five years\nThat the average cost of tuition declined at both public and private colleges are you ready for how much prices fell\nOne hundred dollars\nWell okay let's not get terribly excited but look I mean college costs have been rising seven percent per year on average for the past twenty five years according to the College Board and now\nPrices were flat they didn't rise seven percent which means of college was going to cost ya twenty five grand\nIt's not twenty five grand one hundred as opposed to seven percent increase of thousands of dollars so this is really very exciting news and demonstrating\nSlow but sure\nThat college is becoming more affordable I Believe are going to see this trend continue we already have colleges that are freezing tuition we have private schools that are offering to charge with public schools pay we have out of state schools charging with in states students pay\nWe had states that are providing free tuition half a dozen of them so far around the country we have companies that are providing free tuition as an Employee Benefit Disney Chrysler gee uh see I\nUh we have Walmart and Starbucks all offering free tuition for employees it's really very exciting it doesn't mean you don't need to be saving for College of course you do the good news is the amount of money the parents have saved for college in college five twenty nine plans\nHas said an all time high of more than three hundred twenty eight billion dollars [noise]\nSaid a lot\nIs for for the city's\nPlan network the average account as only twenty four thousand dollars yeah that's not going to pay for college for your kid and oh by the way less than half of parents who have a child headed to college less than half of parents\nAre saving in a five twenty nine plan\nSo none of the parents are saving for college not enough for setting in the right place and not enough for setting enough money so yeah college costs it looks like they're stabilizing but that's not enough to do the deal so um I Hope you're paying attention to that and I want to share with you the best way to go to college that anyone anywhere has ever figured out\nAnd it's been designed a poster child for this was a woman named Martha ... she was profiled in the media not long ago\nShe goes to Harvard and she doesn't pay anything for tuition at Harvard she doesn't pay anything for room and board you know why because she goes to Harvard but she's not a student she works in the kitchen\nAnd while her job in the kitchen typically pays in Boston less than twenty seven thousand dollars a year she earns fifty thousand a year why she making\nSo much money as a kitchen employee at Harvard University because Harvard has a policy that requires service workers to be paid the same pay and benefits as other university employees so she gets a much higher salary she gets full health insurance and pension benefits paid vacation childcare assistance\nShe has discovered that the key when going to college is to go get a job at college not classes\nI'm Rick Adelman you're listening to the record them and show it would

and call in for my drive by makeshift dream analysis is has KFI and coast HD to Los Angeles [noise] twenty\nIn freak a again if you've been listening to show regularly you know I had an emergency room visits three years ago and I was put on this\nA high fat low carb diet so I figured out a way this weekend how to make fried chicken I it was I was a hybrid from a recipe I saw on Instagram there all these Quito chefs or cattle chefs on Instagram which are fun to follow\nSo listen to what I did because you can't do the breading right there's no grains no sugar no bread on the way I eat they've been craving fried chicken legs\nSo when I did is I fried a bunch of ... you know it's basically bacon bits right they have um a Trader Joe's in little packets and I got two packets I fried him till they were really brown drained them so they were dry and then used a rolling pin and just ruled them out until they were just so they became like my flower\nI'm mixed in with a little omen flower\nA little bit of parmesan cheese and some salt and pepper\nAnd I think a little ... in there too\nAnd then I soak some chicken legs in heavy cream yum yum yum high fat is good soak them for like twelve hours so they were just using in heavy cream mixed with I think I put a little vinegar and it just to make it like fake butter milk\nAnd then I roll them in this reading that was basically crushed bacon bits parmesan cheese at Albany flower zero carbs everybody zero carbs and I bake them in the oven at four hundred for thirty minutes oh my goodness they tasted just like real fried chicken just thought I'd throw that out\nPerfectly my producer broke we should put this recipe down and put it on the Web sites that case you missed it it can get it okay I'll do that\nOr she will do that one of us would do that we got a lot of women looking out for you okay KFI listeners and also Tony's here in the booth and Larry's in the news but it's so we're we're equal gender here\nLet's go back to our relationships why the isolation why the increase in mental health disorders the question from the KFI listeners is it social media\nIs it the Internet what is it and I said ... it all started with the need for mobility with a big rise of\nSuccess in modern American Capitalism\nYou know the Nineteen fifties after World War two where a nesting face for this country and then in the sixties and seventies corporations picked up steam and became very very efficient and one of the ways they became efficient\nWas they could rent office space you know these big suburb in office parks in small or medium sized cities where the rent was a very cheap and they could've entice workers to come now and developers follows along and built very affordable housing in a suburban developments\nAnd so humans in America\nWere forced to leave their family of origin\nNo longer do they have a grandmother in the house which was very common for every generation no longer do they have cousins down the block\nNo longer did they have inlaws around\nAnd so because of this mobility we started to become more and more isolated and the only thing we did is we raise the expectations of our marriage\nWe put so much pressure on our spouse to beat the be all and everything to be the grandmother to be the uncle to be the cousin to beat the sibling all these important social relationships we needed\nFor our mental health we needed them for our emotional health are social support\nSo as I was saying to the women today at the lift IQ event and like don't expect you to do to be your girlfriend that's like a prescription for failure in your marriage right and the guy was when he was like yeah I told her yesterday once I saw a star is born and then we went shopping and then she wanted to go get her nails done I'm like a punch my\nGuy my mail dance guard too many times they are going to pull my card if I Do it this with you [laughter] so it's true you know and then the same sense guys you know I Know you can buy her a ... it's even in a woman's size now but she's not your dude friend\nOkay don't put everything you need to have a wider social circle you need to find other people to help maintain you okay [laughter] because we put too much pressure on our marriage is that's what we do now a days and it stays high expectations where we expect a guide to be\nOur you know emotional support our intellectual stimulation are great lover our best girlfriend are massage therapist right it's too much\nThis is not what marriage is supposed to be a marriage is supposed to be a piece of a very important integrated social circle\nHumans were never meant to be isolated and they weren't meant to be alone with one person they were meant to have\nA patchwork quilt of all kinds of degrees of relationships\nAnd I think that's what we need to work on more than ever we need to find a way so that we can extend our social world be more open more loving more compassionate and spread around you know sprinkle it around water down the milk with a bunch of different kinds of friendships [noise]\nOh right enough of that when we come back\nI saw the movie star is born on friday night\nI hated it

first I Want to say one thing going back to cause a lot of people were texting men sending messages about this\nSo even though I hate a star is born for the fact that there are no females in it and it's all about her hooking up with a guy a rescue fantasy we don't need a rescue fantasy I also want to tell you some very important positive news for women and movies this week\nThe new sequel to

the age of fifty five\nSays Jamie Lee Curtis this star\nI guess she was the first one ... back in Seventy eight and she's been in many of these movies since ... along the way she became a mother and grandmother she's a grandmother now her character [laughter] um I don't know about real life but her character a and R quote is\nUm let me be the bell ringing banner waving representative of generations of women who've been in the music business and I've got no use the movie business and I've got no recognition let me be the one who stands up and says we can do it we did it and we will do it again\nSo now we have Wonder Woman in Halloween [laughter] that's great uh as making huge strides historic strives at the box office so if you're out there and you're writing a screenplay and Gina Davis likes to say this and her talks with the Gina Davis Institute if all you do to make movies even for women you don't change\nOne thing about your screenplay not one thing not one line nothing you just go through after you finished the screenplay and you take fifty percent of the men and you cross out their name and you just put in the woman's name\nIt's that's how you get fifty percent of the rules for women it's so simple basic math okay enough of that let's talk about traveling for sex Shelly so this is Los Angeles we are a horizontal city\nMost of the city it seems is on one dating app or another I see you all out there whether you're in bumble tinder the league right yeah match they're all out there and and you know we have a term in this city for dating called G you\nHave you heard that before or have you used it before you you want to date somebody but they are to gene you\nStand for geographically undesirable because in this city people do not want to drive far for sexual opportunity\nAnd now there's research ah this was sent to me by one of my linked in contacts actually from a website called Sufi dates dot com not one I endorse necessarily because it's all about a casual adult only sex which means that it's filled with all guys [laughter]\nI'm Sorry but there's probably ten present women if that on that website so good luck to you but they do promote a kind of travel sex dating not not prostitution just like I don't know those tours I guess to go meet people for casual sex I'm not the demo for that so what can I say who am I to judge I'm just not the demos um\nAnd I like to protect people from STDs so use a condom folks please I'm All right so but they did some research and this isn't science is his infotainment they asked their users of sassy dates dot com how far they would travel for sex now\nThey asked specifically not a date actual uh you know you knew it was going to happen it was actually sex and they found that a very high percentage of men were only willing to travel between ten\nAnd fifty miles fifty miles is a lot not that five hundred miles that you would walk but it's still a lot\nSo ten miles just think about this that's from Venice Beach to CNN at in Hollywood right that can be during rush hour traffic because they do that drive regularly an hour\nThat's a long way to drive for sex an hour across the city and heavy traffic on the other hand I Will say this is the more time you have to think about sex before it actually happens the better the sex will be didn't you know that wanting is a much stronger feeling than having\nAnd the longer we want and think about it and save or it the I I don't care if it's an ice cream sundae or a new car\nOr sex the better and more exciting it becomes right so learning how to delayed gratification folks for everything is life in life will make the acquisition of that thing feel that much better so if you are sitting in traffic for an hour thinking about\nThe pot of gold at the end of the rainbow then maybe you will be more Randy when you get there\nNow this data was picked up on this website both in the u._k. and here in America\nIn the u._k. thirty three percent of men it's about a third of men were only willing to travel ten miles that was their boundaries that's it\nAnother third we're gonna rise up and Randy and ready to travel Seventy five miles for sex so let's analyze this for a minute oh and if we get deeper and deeper\nI uh you know the song is I Would walk five hundred miles well that came out in Nineteen eighty eight Thirty years later one in twenty men in the u._k. five percent of men would actually travel one thousand miles to meet a woman for sex so why is this well it's\nThe explosion of dating apps and dating websites that make romantic opportunity so easy and so excessive all even in rural areas people can find somebody they don't have to travel that far\nHowever they're also a group of people usually men in why I'm Talking about men chasing after sex is basic bio one on one right you know that sperm chases egg not the reverse so if you're carrying eggs and flying around the world chasing down men\nIn
