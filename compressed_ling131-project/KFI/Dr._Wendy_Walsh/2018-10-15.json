{"year": "2018", "show_name": "Dr. Wendy Walsh", "day": "15", "month": "10", "state": "CA", "content": "All right I just like I like some woman swooning from a cafe in Paris in the Nineteen fifties\nProbably a black woman went over there and we loved wait another lover that's what you don't buy low oh I Love that old jazz you know give me some at a James any day I'm All right enough music let us move on I asked a question and the question I asked\nIs a and nobody wrote to me so you just couldn't you're sending me other messages about other things which is really nice thank you very much a but could you think of an alternate use for a paper clip or a brick let us start with paper clip producer Brooke ... what would you do with it the\nOnly thing okay I had the I think the last time I use the paper clip other than for papers was when I had like I think it was my cell phone or something and I had to like I think some people might use a pencil tip ... tip to get into this little little\nThe whole you have a Pratt fix something or to reset exactly that's my figure use it as a tool yes okay do you want what would you use that I've been really sorry what's an alternate use\nI'll tell you the second jewelry a paper record necklace or British\nAnd says okay and uh what would you say me dear\nFamous broken like a little too ... in some way right okay when I was asked this question I had very linear connection it was like well a chip clip or a hair clip it was like I was verbally focused on the word clip\nA so I Will say out of those three answers I'm going to go with you on being the most creative out of the bunch a okay I'll be pretty creative when I think of it sometimes\nWhen you think of putting that little paper clip and the whole in your iPhone because you had to take the paper clip you have to and [laughter] you have to like you know for it to your ... you hear me\nOkay no a brick ... saved drawn to the end but Amy what would you an alternate used for a brick were hit somebody over the head with it [laughter]\nI Do do you think about which I Am\nI'm well this is so and creative though all I could think of is like you know the standard doors stop\nThe doors stop Okay John I'm really excited if you're you\nKnow again again would lose window destruction\nYou know the Starbucks right across the street from my house had brick put through the window this week ... they tried to break and I didn't know what they would find like all the cream is locked up in the fridge with locks on it what is there really they take the cash away at the end of the night [laughter]\nBut uh anyway All right so this is commonly used for as a ... a part of a battery of tests to determine if somebody is non neurotypical potentially on the spectrum\nAnd it is a creativity test because there is some research to show that adults who are either have a A R autism spectrum disorder\nOr a D. H. D. um it was thought that they are not creative but they're actually more creative because their last linear they don't do chip clip and hair clip they think completely out of the box and this may be\nUm ... you know a trait that coveted in the workplace so ... when I asked my daughter a few years ago when she was littler and she has both ADHD and mild um autism spectrum disorder although I think she might be tested out of that right now 'cause I got so many interventions when she was young I'm\nWhen I said the paper clip she said oh which is nails\nWhich is now put them glue them all and you'd have these cool wiring nails and then she said braces I can make braces with them okay again pretty creative thinking\nWhen we got to bricks I I don't know she was so creative and so far out of the box I don't know she immediately without even housing for a second I said can you think of another use for a brick she goes well they had to make a hamburger\nBuns I'm like okay that's a really creative thinking [laughter] so they've\nActually done a little bit of research on okay and there has been some talk that people with ADHD might face challenges it could hinder their future employment but the research is showing that they actually feel empowered to do more creative\nUm cash because they resist conformity they ignore typical information and they move on so their work could be in marketing product designed technology and computer engineering so in one study they ask people to design an alien fruit from another planet\nThat does not exist here on this planet and if you didn't and they had to you know the control group of people who did not have a diagnosis for ADHD and they're the fruit that they came up with where'd you river tips they were somehow like an apple or like a strawberry\nBut if you had ADHD you would\nCome up with something completely crazy and they actually when I say crazy I mean different off the map out of the ... out of the box and when they also asked them to design some labels for new products the ADHD group created labels that were way more unique and so far less similar than anything that exists\nSo I Love the fact that we are learning to embrace\nBeing neuro typical or not um\nAnd I I think it's just important that we understand their diversity and that we're all different and that we're all okay and we have places in the world All right you know I'm obsessed with attachment style and I talk a lot about romantic\nAttachment when we come back let me ask you this do you know the attachment style of your boss ... it can impact your work environment you're listening to the doctor when he well Shawn KFI am six forty\n[noise] think due to when I Am what ... what about you can with your best shot at a thousand dollars on Monday morning between five oh five five one\nK. pacify Angeles Orange County\n[noise]\nFirst ... now when the king live from the camp by twenty four hour news room the rain has cleared but forecasters are shifting attention to the danger is provided by high wind and storm runoff drier weather\nThey're available they're supportive\nThey maintain a high standards for themselves and for others so I always say like a good boss is like a good parent right if you had a good parent they listen to you\nBut they still have the rules you couldn't run the roost right even ruled the roost you gonna run over the house you can't run everything just because you're an employee but they'll listen to you know there'll be understanding they might make some concessions but the rules are the rules and they lead\nAnd that's good I well here's one of the things the research did show them these researchers by going Ninety remember they they did this to have to Ninety seven fortune five hundred C suite incentives\nDidn't miss dismissing and avoidance styles are over represented among the ranks of leaders and make sense you know our society values hard charging goal directed\nCharismatic people um but they might not actually be the best sponsors\nSo you're sitting there thinking so what do I do if I have a boss who has this problem well if your boss is dismissing and avoid didn't you need to not take it personally right if you're the kind of person who are emotionally activated and you get upset\nUm then you've got to gather yourself and cool off before you go into this boss's office because what happens if you do a display of emotions to Abbas who's more emotionally and boy did is they will want to run from you because they will feel smothered by your feelings so just step back\nOn the other hand if your boss is anxious you have to understand that you've gotta give verbal feedback you've got to respond they can't stand it when you're silent even if you're just in a row being a really good listener in a meeting ... ... ... at least give them some nods some active listening\nBecause nothing activates a preoccupied anxious boss more than talking to a follower who shows no facial expect expression it makes them absolutely anxious\nNow the most important thing about everything I'm telling you about whether your boss is avoid inter anxious is that you need to know yourself\nYou need to not take anything personally because it's not about you and you need to know what activates your attachment style maybe you're somebody who has a lot of anxiety around attachment and if you don't get good feedback from your boss on a regular basis\nI'm raising my hand as I say that me me me right um I I've actually in the past a different job gone to boxes and said I Need like a state of the union head to head I need to know how I'm doing I Need feedback\nOtherwise I'm like oh they must surely be planning to fire me that would be the only reason they're silence meanwhile what I've heard from bosses in the past is it the reason why they don't give me feedback as you're doing a good job so we just ignore you your junior everything's great [laughter] I'm like oh great that's not what I said I'm On the other hand\nIf you are avoidance now research has shown\nThat doing some personal disclosure and workplaces not\nViolating boundaries and all that kind of stuff but you know just being a human being and being authentic actually creates a workplace where there's far more productivity so if you're avoiding\nI Want you to think about ways that you can disclose it in the workplace or to your boss that you will appear more human to them\nAnd it it's a lot to think about the no oh you're thinking about right now is not even your work because I told you this plays out and romantic attachments you just thinking about your husband your wife your boyfriend or girlfriend aren't you because I'm telling you the anxious in the avoided person always find each other on dating sites and they often stay together for a really long time but they're not happy\nBecause one is longing\nAnd never enough love is never enough and the other is avoidance and feeling smothered all the time and running away [laughter] okay so uh when we come back\nI'm going to do my drive by makeshift dream analysis you have a dream you'd like to share with me were opening up the phone lines
