arguing\n[noise] God Bless your heart surgery of thought oh how errors happened\n[laughter] something on energy that's good stuff right there I'm curious to know if there are huge so afraid militia no one doubts your bona fides you're the chairman of the council of economic advisors can you not just say\nHe was wrong absolutely not yet you lose your job you lose your job they are not allowed to say he was wrong they they cannot they will not say it\nUm what he did go on to say is what is true is that it's the highest in ten years he said at some point somebody probably conveyed it to Trump adding zero to that and they shouldn't have done that so if somebody else's fault\n[noise] just say he got this one wrong and then you just\nDo we just read an excerpt from the Bob Woodward book about deny deny deny never be at fault yeah I mean that's just kind of his Emma\nCarrier when you buy a new record [laughter]\n[noise]\nAnd it's coming to the ... already all\nOur\n\nWatch\nThe comedy tonight or tomorrow or the view of coal your ...\nFor a local [laughter] well I\nBack to the doctor Wendy Walsh show on campus I Am six forty and we talk about love [noise]\nI often ask myself what is something that rolls around in my brain on a regular basis [noise]\nWe certainly know what must is we know in our bodies have a huge physiological reaction\nAs a response of sexual responds to somebody we're attracted to but why that person and why is it triggering that in us\nWell there's the visual peace right and there's sometimes it's just anthropological predestined that men tend to be attracted to women who are more useful\nA more facial symmetry higher softer voices um a higher waist wrist ... waste to chest and and hip ratio an hourglass All right ah women tend to be attracted to men who have deeper voices were taller with symmetry of muscles but then there's the social thing to\nDo they speak our language they live in our world and they make around the same money that we make 'em do they follow our religion too they eat the foods we eat they have our political persuasion that's a piece of it too\nAnd I could talk for days just about the physiological responses and all the social factors\nAnd I'm most interested in the psychological peace of love\nHow is it that we have this blueprint for love in our brain and we go out there in the world trying to find somebody almost like a missing puzzle piece that will match our blueprint for love\nSo what is love well love first of all is an exchange of care adult romantic love is an exchange of care and that care can take many forms it can be sexual care it can be financial care it can be domestic responsibility care\nCan be instrumental caregiving when someone is ill\nIt can be emotional support care\nIt can be um\nIntellectual stimulation care\nAnd the list goes on and on and on when you look at a relationship from the outside sometimes it doesn't seem fair but it does feel fair and right to that couple who is continuing to exchange care\nBut what about this blueprint for love it's not love isn't just about what you do and how you care but it's about if that love feels familiar\nSo when the first three years of life when we are pre verbal when our brain stores memories not as narrative not us stories but when our brain stores memories as feelings\nWe start to create this picture of what is love and particularly in the very first year of life when our brain triples inside and it's asking questions and I trust the world can I trust love is this normal\nAnd how what child is parent it in those vulnerable first ... years starts to create something known as they're attachment style now they're attachment style\nMay be one that is filled with contentment feelings of security happiness or they're attachment style might be filled with feelings of longing or loss\nOr discussed or even fear\nOn how these parents relate to this baby now another piece of it of course is it babies come into the world with a biological predisposition to how they will attach\nSome babies just naturally have a gene for lots of anxiety and they need lots of closeness they need lots of touching they need lots of cuddling they cry a lot we call these babies high need babies\nAnd there are other babies would come into the world who get relatively unscathed by what happens\n[noise] these kinds of babies then meet parents and parents had you know are just babies and grown up bodies still trying to work out some of their own stuff themselves\nAnd parents may have read parenting books telling them to go against their stomach and let a baby cried out the parents may have an alcohol or chemical dependency where they are one parent one day another parent another day depending on how they're neurochemistry has been hijacked or not\nThere are parents who are just naturally close and loving and their parents who had distant parents themselves bundle up that baby and leave it alone\n[noise] go back to our hunter gatherer passed for a moment how where humans babies raised and were raised with lots of skin to skin contact there was no Gerber Baby food they were raised with breast milk until they could grow two year old mothers to jump on a leg they were breast fed\nAnd they were given eye to eye contact skin to skin contact and they were carried untouched by somebody else\nToday we have invented a host of contraptions to keep us separated from her baby and if you want to see Dr windy mad ever walk down the street and see people pushing strollers with little tiny babies facing the street instead of mom or dad\nHe don't even have the visual you know at that age they don't even have object permanent in other words if they can't see their mom or dad they don't exist why do you think babies always laugh\nMean release tension\nDuring the game peek a boo because when you were parents put their hands over their face the baby if they're less than six months old imagines that their mom and dad at that moment and they're filled with terror and when the mom removed the hands and says boo than the baby\nStarts to laugh because they're getting rid of that pent up stress intentions from being so afraid so parents love this game and they do it all the time\nLet's get back to attachment so at some point in those first three years depending on how close parents are or maybe how intrusive and smothering they are\nChildren get a sense of what is familiar to them\nAnd then they go out into the adult world later as adults and they look for somebody who will match their blueprint we call it I call psycho babble likes to call it they look for an object in their world will meet their needs for love that's\nAnd after a while your brain actually get to customers to having all that wonderful chemical reaction in the brain and it loses its ... right and so with couples do is they will try it you know do different\nPositions where different clothes have sex and different rooms until that sort of Peters out and then they have body parts sex well I'll just give you this sex and you give me that and we'll just get out the door we satisfied or whatever and they work out details\nI Do think that there are ways to reignite a sex life that has died\nOtherwise although sex therapist's wouldn't be in business and one of the things they do our sense said focus exercise is\nOne of the problems when a sex life goes down is that a woman's oxytocin goes down and a man's testosterone goes down so the trick is to try to find a way to raise his testosterone oh but not too much 'cause then he'll go searching to spread that testosterone all over the tribe a and razor oxytocin\nYou'll hear men say in therapy all the time when they're in a relationship that has become a sex lists marriage you'll hear men say you know she would just have sex then she'd feel better\nAnd that's actually the truth but no woman wants to have sex when they don't have enough oxytocin\nSo how do you raise a woman's oxytocin enough to make her want to have sex\nYou do it with other kinds of touch non sexual touch\nShe will get some oxytocin on your hugs and kisses your neck massage is touching toe to toe while you're watching TV and then she'll eventually snuggle in and move on defects now this non sexual touch has to be a standalone touch\nCan't come with the expectation that it's for play that it's leading to something else because that will shut down and will feel like a trick it'll feel like pressure just being affectionate helps women have more oxytocin and ladies for guys you know how to raise his testosterone he's got to have a win\nMen's testosterone rises even when their own team wins that they're watching on TV but it also rises when they get a complement to pay attention to your words\nHave you been with a man for so many years that you've forgotten how fabulous he is have you gotten to tell him how great he is complement that man\nLet him feel like the king he is and the king you want\nFinally I Want to say one thing about healthy relationships healthy relationships are always going somewhere here's the deal were always growing were always becoming different people and so constantly discussing what your relationship and life goals are is really important\n[noise] the reason why that fifty percent divorce rate kicks in around the twenty year mark is because the main product of the marriage has been raising kids and once the nest becomes empty\nThese people haven't retool their marriage they haven't talked about what their next school is or they'd been sinking quietly about what their individual goal is not shared goal\nSo discussing goals along the way is so important to having a healthy happy marriage figuring out that you're on the same page and you're getting somewhere together as a team and keep you together for a very long time\nI got more when we come back you're listening to the doctor Wendy Walsh show on cap I Am six forty one [laughter]\nTo the doctor when he well Shawn Camp I Am six forty and we talk about love [noise]\nOften ask myself what is something that\nRolls around in my brain on a regular basis [noise]\nWe certainly know what must is we know in our bodies have a huge physiological reaction\nAs a response of sexual response to somebody we're attracted to but why that person and why is it triggering that in us well there's the visual\nPeace right and there's sometimes it's just anthropological predestined that men tend to be attracted to women who are more useful\nOr more facial cemetery higher softer voices on a higher waist wrist ... waste to chest and and hip ratio an hour glass or write\nA women tend to be attracted to men who have deeper voices were taller with symmetry of muscles but then there's the social thing to\nDo they speak our language they live in our world do they make around the same money that we make 'em do they follow our religion too they eat the foods we eat they have our political persuasion that's a piece of it too\nAnd I could talk for days just about the physiological responses\nAnd all the social factors and I'm most interested in

the list goes on and on and on when you look at a relationship from the outside sometimes it doesn't seem fair but it does feel fair and right to that couple who is continuing to exchange care\nBut what about this blueprint for love it's not love isn't just about what you do and how you care but it's about if that love feels familiar\n[noise] so when the first three years of life when we are pre verbal when our brains stores memories not as narrative ... stories would when our brains doors memories as feelings\nWe start to create this picture of what is love and particularly in the very first year of life when our brain triples in size and it's asking questions and I trust the world can I trust love is this normal\nAnd how would child his parents to it in those vulnerable first ... years starts to create something known as they're attachment style\nNow they're attachment style may be one that is filled with\nContentment feelings have security happiness or they're attachment style might be filled with feelings of longing or boss were discussed or even fear\nDepending on how these parents relate to this baby now another piece of it of course is that babies come into the world with a biological predisposition to how they will attach\nSome babies just naturally have a gene for lots of anxiety and they need lots of closeness they need lots of touching they need lots of cuddling they cry a lot we call these babies high need babies\nThen there are other babies who come into the world who get relatively unscathed by what happens\n[noise] these kinds of babies then meet

hunter gatherer passed for a moment how where humans babies raised and were raised with lots of skin to skin contact\nThere was no Gerber Baby food they were raised with breast milk until they could grow two year old mothers to jump on a leg they were breast fed and they were given eye to eye contact skin to skin contact and they were carried untouched by somebody else\nToday we have invented a

always laugh\nMean release tension during the game ...\nBecause when you what parents put their hands over their face the baby if they're less than six months old imagines that their mom and dad at that moment and they're filled with terror and when the mom removed the hands and says boo than the baby\nStarts to laugh because they're getting rid of that pent up stress intention from being so afraid so parents love this game and they do it all the time let's get back to attachment\nSo at some point in those first three years depending on how close parents are or maybe how intrusive and smothering they are\nWith men and women are still wired to bond\nEvolution designed this amazing it's almost like a drug effect that happens to our brains when we fall in love our brains get assaulted with a cocktail of neuro transmitters and hormones that make us feel feelings of euphoria\nLast time he fell in love you remember what it was like you barely needed to sleep you could go and very little sleep you're up all night thinking about that person\nThose are those hormones at work and why did Mother Nature have us evolve to have this fabulous delusion and it is a delusion\nAnybody who's ever been deeply and romantic love with somebody and then looked at them ten years later while you're living in them thought what have I done here [laughter] well it should convert to intellectual decision love right but it was designed to get people together\nAnd hopefully keep them together long enough to protect offspring\nBecause if you were to leave were born so premature if you think of it every other animals up running with a pack within hours of birth but not humans we need like a five year in arms face before baby strollers right and ... and everything else we carried and so if you had two people who had a biological interest in that child\nThat was more likely to survive and those people were more likely to stay together if they had strong feelings of love both for each other and for the children lost hello we evolved to experience love because those people had more offspring that survived and they had the same feelings\nSo times have changed their new cultural pressures on couples\nIt's hard to raise kids when both people are working so I Do think a lot about the big picture social policy on families and at the same time I think about the little picture the intimate profiles of our lives as we want to see and be seen\nWhen we come back I Want to talk specifically about the psychological factor of love what is love what does it do to our brain you're listening to the doctor Wendy Walsh Sean KFI am six forty I'll be right back [noise]\n\nWith the doctor when he well Shawn half I Am six forty and talking about marriage talking about the science of love in the next hour I'm going to have a special guest on a tune who specializes in helping men with their online dating profile\nGuys I mean this deep for many years for the most visually wire gender guys haven't thought about your own optic [noise]\nBut instead of spending just an hour [laughter] talking about what men do wrong [noise] it sounds a little bit first\nAbout the mistakes that\nA book one called the girlfriend taffy data will argue and I interviewed a hundred married and I basically asked them\nYou know why did you Mary Hartman why didn't you all the rest of us and I got some interesting [noise] into what women do\n[noise] um [noise] ladies we know that your ... [noise]\nAnd we know that men\nWant to have sex with [noise] otherwise they wouldn't be on a day [noise] but [noise] leading with sex and sexism and then feeling heartbroken later when it doesn't turn into a\nQuote unquote real relationship is probably the biggest mistake women [noise] in the early stages of dating they feel that female female from petition\nNowadays we have so many women who have such full rich exciting sex lives that they know these men have access to all kinds of sex around [noise]\nSo they think of themselves [noise]\nI'm going to be nice girl I mean these funds are all I'm going to be the girl that just like any fresh [noise] going to make it easy [noise] and then you want to be with me forever because it's so easy [noise] no you know what he's going to want it to he's going to want to leave\nAnd he's going to leave you for a woman who is much more demanding and you're going to be shot [noise] because at the end of the day", "station": "KFI", "city": "Los Angeles"}
