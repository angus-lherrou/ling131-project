fascinating changes going on the field of exponential technologies at MIT they've created a wearable interface that knows what you're thinking without you having to say anything out loud it's a white plastic strip it hooks over your ear goes below your jaw\nThe electrodes pick up a neuro muscular signals that are released when you think of a certain word sort of like saying it in your head\nAnd it's accurate Ninety two percent of the time so people wearing this device say they're paralyzed and can't speak or say they don't have a voice box so they have some kind of physical disability just by thinking they're able to communicate\nIt's amazing what's going on in the field of medicine but it's not just the field of medicine where we're seeing some pretty amazing\nInnovations in the field of robotic scientists at MIT of made a robot that can teach itself to see and identify objects and how to manipulate them as well know robots been able to do this before this robot as capable of picking up an object it's never seen before\nAnd without resorting to trial and error and knows what to do with the object of how humans do it you pick up an object you've never seen before and you

radio station [noise]\n\nAnd my eight and four and a half a doctor when he was with you I can say about the darker sides of\nThe human personality we have certain traits hard wired and us and you don't like to look at them but we can pull him out from time to time\nFor instance\nWe are all a little bit vain and over confident did you know that we walk around with absolutely inflated views of our abilities of our qualities we all think we're good drivers we all think we're smarty pants and we think we're a lot prettier than we are ...\nYou know this is because if we didn't have some low level narcissism we wouldn't even be able to get out of the fetal position in the morning we'd be curled up in bed\nAnd we'd be like no I Can't do it right so in order for us again always going back to our evolutionary past in order for us to\nHead over that mountain and see what was there we had to be brave we had to think we could do it a lot of humans died along the way trying to figure out stuff um it's kind of funny because research shows that the least skilled among us\nAre the most prone to over self confidence\nIt makes sense they'd really be in the fetal position and never get out of bed so this is what we do it even jailed criminals think they are kind of more trustworthy and more honest and the ...\nA bridge member of the public ... where you are All right here's another part of our a dark trait that we all have and this was this research wasn't surprising to me every single one of us hopefully not I would love to think it's not me but apparently it's possible\nEvery single one of us is a potential troll\nDid you know and if you have the ability to be anonymous you will say things mhm you will say and do things\nOkay have you ever stolen a roll of toilet paper of bathroom knowing that you wouldn't be caught\nI did when I was Eighteen and poor yes when I was a young model in Paris and had like four girls living in a tiny apartment and we had like no money 'cause we weren't successful models [laughter] we're just they're struggling [laughter] we used to go to a five star hotels and we would put a roll of toilet paper in her purse and on everybody\nAll my moral reasoning went out the window because of the anonymity well now because of the Internet a new study has just revealed that it just being in a bad mood\nOver being exposed patrolling by others doubles the likelihood that you will engage in trolling yourself you know what trolling is right just getting on line and sing really mean people mean things to people\nMaybe a you're fighting about politics or something stupid on line going vote don't argue on line going vote do something physical or just go for a walk or meditate [laughter] um so there you go just depending on your mood or what's been going on you a dark side of your personality can come out\nOr this is the one that gave me the Hebei GBDs but this is true study\nWe are more sexually attracted to people with dark personality traits uh-huh\nSo sometimes we elect people at a public office with psychopathic trades um we've done it over the centuries many times I'm ... women tend to be sexually attracted at least for short term relationships do people displaying what psychologists call the dark try at\nTraits of narcissism psycho pathology\nAnd Machiavellian\nSo one study found that women's physical attraction to a man was increased when he described himself in dark ways if he said he was self interested manipulative and insensitive\nSo why would they be\nOne theory is that dark treats somehow\nSuccessfully communicate like high mate status like in other words I'm so self confident I'm willing to take risks I Will break the rules if I Need to for survival so you know she wants to hit her wagon up to his
