why do you know what I mean John and can we do to fix on KFI\n\n\nAnimated by handle here on a Thursday morning a\nBig story that we are covering today as the aftermath of hurricane Michael also up on the handle page website uh my voter guide and I'm going to be doing that every ah Tuesday [noise] alright [noise]\nAlso lots of social media every every day we post a new stuff on ... handle show Facebook and Instagram and we also have\nTwitter and we have a\nA brand new or not a segment we have a a a a brand new item that we're covering John is putting together every day a forty five minute pod cast of sort of the highlights of the show they show done and their little commercials right\nNo commercial no commercial ah no bumps no bumps no commercials which means that no one will ever be listening to this broadcast again I think that's\nFair to say All right now here it was going to happen we know there's going to be a downtown downturn economically speaking there's no way around it what goes up has to come down\nAnd the problem with it here in California it's going to affect us the hardest now it used to be the California because of our strength economically we were the last ones into a recessions a recession and the first ones out\nWhy because our economy is so diverse\nWe're the largest agricultural a producer in the country\nOr we have Silicon Valley a Hollywood producers films that go all over the world is a huge market for what we do so why would California be in such trouble if a recession comes well I'll tell you why\nBecause it used to be the middle class paid all the taxes also used to be before proposition Thirteen that our property taxes were through the roof\nOr that's no is still high but they're not crazy high\nAnd so in the aftermath of the aftermath of prop Thirteen California had to spin and figure out a whole different way of making money so it's done it with taxation but here's the problem with California and that is the state income taxes\nAre certainly by far the highest in the country and it's the state income taxes\nThat keeps this state moving as many other states however it's the wealthy they're paying the majority of the taxes\nBecause there was a philosophy held in here in California you soak the rich now they call it you have the rich have to pay their fair share even though the top one percent or some ridiculous figure\nPays twenty percent or they taught me put it this way the top twenty percent pay eighty percent of the taxes and so that's\nTheir fair share in under new some and a a new well the existing legislature I think that's just starts that's my personal opinion but the philosophy is you go after the wealthy here and we have tons of wealth California's no has more billionaires any place else in the United states or maybe in the world\nYou know what happens when there's a downturn vote wealthy get less wealthy\nThere's less income that comes to them because when you talk about how rich people make money if they're not on salary\nIs that might be pull a paycheck which continues on its dividends are\nIt's money that's invested in real estate annuities that bonds they go up and down with the economy and when the economy goes down the wealthy people simply make less money now I'm not arguing that oh poor wealthy people so when you go from two million to a million and a\nHalf dollars okay that's not the end of the world\n... from from two million to one million stop the end of the world except\nWhen California relies on that extra million dollars\nIn taxes to pay its bills all of a sudden that disappears and what happens well the state gets screwed\n\nAnd you have a or B it's just going to be a mess lack of affordable housing or the housing market is destroy the state I mean people just can't afford housing anymore it's worse than it's ever been the disparities is worse than has ever been\nAnd\nUh the argument I have is the way the whole tax system is set up a guarantees that the disparity\nGrows bigger and bigger now the government is trying to do ... you know especially with the housing but his little bits and tiny little pieces it's all incremental there's a ... at the edges of the problem\nTo really deal with the housing problem we've talked about before is a massive influx of money I'm Talking about tens of billions of dollars where it becomes a good portion of our economy\nSo what a mess all of this is\nIt's just they well\nIt's it's a philosophy too\nAnd that the England had this going for a long time and that is if you earn a lot of money you must share it and there's something inherently kinda sleazy about you earning all that money when you have so many people that are earning less and the disparities disparity\nIs so big and the cost of housing is so ridiculous and it's so difficult for people to really do well in California unless they're well off and if you are well off then you've got to pay the full load\nWell the cost of the wealthy people paying the full load is when they become a less wealthy\nBecause the economy goes south California pays the price especially now that we need so much more\nMoney to do everything what do you think it's going to cost to put housing up for the homeless\nWhat do you think it's going to cost to hug literally do with our infrastructure that we have left alone for fifty\nYears and not maintained our roads\nRight the highways the bridges none of that has been maintain why well because it's easy to kick that down you know it never gets re elected to say I want to maintain the roads that is what I'm moving on that as my platform my campaign platform\nSo what does my answer and what am I said there's always take away here right handles takeaway should actually
