deadliest mass shooting in Las Vegas but the day attributes is playing and it starts with the sunrise remembered service right\n[noise] yeah like uh I'm right in the ... over\nThe mountains here and the names of some of the victims are going to be um spoken out and of course remember 'em but it's not just the fifty eight people were killed here Jennifer and that's what differentiates this particular attack from all the other day\nYou've been subjected to in this country you know you know I mean\nThere was a guy Stephen Paddock shooting from the thirty second floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel into a culture where there were twenty two thousand people show not only were there ... people killed four hundred and Thirteen people physically wounded by bullets bullets another four hundred and fifty or so\nI'm hurt and injured in the resulting stampede to get out of there but there are tens of thousands of eyewitnesses not only in the contract but all around Las Vegas in the strip it was ten PM you know it's a it's\nA city that never sleeps so so many people were up aware watching it hearing the recur shades of bullets at cooling down the concrete Kenyans of the strip 'em and all those people took that home with them and show you know what I'm finding route reporting over the past week just touching base with\nPeople who are involved in who we interviewed\nIs that the trauma really lingers for so many people and they ended up taking that up taking that home with them to wherever they lived across the country um and people are still really struggling with this kind of thing\nOh undoubtedly and I know here in Southern California it hit us particularly hard because so many people at that concert where from here and so ... and that's what each story after story that I read over the weekend of families who you know this was the first anniversary\nFor them with their loved ones somebody who was killed in that attack but also I heard even a woman who was saying she re watched a video\nOf her during the shooting saying to her friends and family\nI don't know why everybody's freaking out it's just fireworks or something I ... I actually saw you know that that was awful but the carnage was around here it's occurred that long to realize it and it was interesting in the in the a little snippet that I heard\nShe's talking about it and say you know and she's kind of joking like at the beginning and then within ten seconds just breaks into tears\nYeah you know there's a cognitive dissonance when your brain can't quite fathom what's happening around you and I'm sure that happens a lot of people um who last night I interviewed a couple\nI'm from California city and there that night and I'm\nA Todd Todd and ocean Todd took three bullets and he didn't even make it sound any immediately jumped on top of is a girlfriend at the time and took the bullets with his body\nUm they got up and started running a another burst came in he jumped on top of her again and again got shot 'em then they got up and they finally tried to make it out of there and he got hit a third time in spray bullets um\nAnd he was able to keep walking and he was bleeding profusely but you know very heroically he's a he's a calm\nCalifornia city actually a corrections officer and so he kind of knew what to do 'em and you know they made it out of there alive and instead of wallowing and instead of\nKeeping the memories of traumatic from that day what they decided is that the girlfriend boyfriend will get married so they're making the getting married today\nAt four thirty PM\nAt a local chapel here they're trying to rewire their brains and create new memories I'm trying to think of the good that could happen I'm from an event like that and you know for many people could separate them or could send them each individually spiraling into\nTrauma and Pete DSD which both of them obviously suffered but in this case um\nIt they didn't because together they got themselves through it and so people like that but I think that's kind of the tenor of what's going on here today Jennifer you know people are engaged in this memorials but they're also trying to think about the good that happening meant outpouring um the fact that people so quickly\nWomen to come forward and say oh yeah ... that was there he beat me up with a bicycle chain while raping me and not taking videos in there somewhere out there I you know you're going to see some crazy stuff All right let's do it are you ready to do it let's see that Yes sir or your yes

could have put him in a lot of trouble and he settles just a few days afterwards this is a settlement which is virtually nothing\nThat's what I thought it virtually an object that look and we're just really really offered him though yeah they originally offered him I think two years time out but he would have had to admit some kind of wrongdoing and he walked the well though in a hot I'll tell you why and they're like the next day or something he ...\nHe can admit wrongdoing because that opens up by a shareholder suit that\nWould just nail him because uh the value of the company dropped about seven billion dollars and you got some shareholders that are not very happy so they sue him and especially if he admits liability if you'd miss wrongdoing\nOr it's over there is not even a trial there's no arguing it's just a question of how much money that I lose so that's why these folks never ever admit liability they settle without admitting liability\nThat's how it makes sense the Las

let's go ahead and finish handle on the news Jennifer Jones where you win Resnick and meet\nTeam of researchers at Stanford University and some place called pace policy analysis for California education they released a massive study let me bottom line it for you if we want our schools to do better we're going to have to spend more way more\n\nWhich incidentally\nThere is no correlation between how much you spend in how well the kids do yeah because there are states has been more than we do that have no better and then there are states to spend way less than we do that do have better scores but here's the fun part in order to make the in order to raise the money that they see is needed to bring\nCalifornia schools up to whatever level they say is is appropriate which we don't even know if that would ever happen it would require a one hundred percent increase in state sales tax\nSo that would now you have state sales tax go up to twenty percent if a if you do it that way or a twenty five percent increase in income taxes\nFor a one third increasing property taxes sure why not\nYou know what I what difference does it make\nYou know at this point California's on its way well it's already the most tax state in the union by a long shot but this would make it by a long long shot this is breaking the world record by a ... a order of magnitude\nI'm blown away by this next

reached the American flag yeah insane\nDid you know the one part of the games it's mandatory that you go to the bomb shocked to blow up a wall across the board that was part of the gutter and better

controversy or because he's pro Donald Trump's\nHe wears make America great and therefore what a horrible thing of course Hollywood is in an uproar\nAnd I think they just ran out of time and he just kept going and going and they had the end of it but I think the issue also is that the fact that he wore the hat and it was and to and our backs up Donald Trump I mean that's a huge huge story now in the meantime every award show Rick send the Trump\nI and just ... ... is horrible to the Republicans for some reason that's okay because you're west can't do his thing\nWell they didn't air it but you can see it at KFI aims six forty Viacom key word and\nAnd I think the other thing that's making people mad here is that they had had Matt Damon earlier in the show a as a I don't know raging Brett

talk about today I guess the biggest news is all over the weekend a deal was cut between the U.S in Canada so now the north American free trade agreement NAFTA is sort of back\nAre in play except a Trump version so I'd tell us what happened and why are so important for candidates to cut ... well\nYou know it's our largest export partner it's you can have a deal with Mexico and not having to deal with Canada I think most people understood that they also need to get it done they had they had a deadline set for October first\nIn order to make everything work with the Mexican so they wanted to get obviously a deal with the Canadians done so there was all the deadlines pointed to the last day in September they were able to pull it off\nIt's huge for our dairy farmers that's what President Trump was pushing a for us to be able to export or dairy products to Canada in a more favorable way\nYears ago handle here and a good morning on ... on Monday October ... gathered on hearings on Capitol investigation is going on right now for winter we talk to an FBI agent seven o'clock hour you may want to pod cast that\nAbout the investigation how far it goes what it means and right now diet Donnie ... who are Monday\nGuy is heard a a CNBC every two o'clock during the day or every day at two o'clock a fast\nMoney on CNBC\nAlright guy the other big story is uh the ... mosque agreement with uh the SCC and this it it it occurs to me that you learned must just got away clean on this one relatively speaking\nHundred percent and you think about it and just for some background on August for those who don't know the story on him out on Twitter and said he had secured funding to take tests for private at four hundred and twenty dollars a share and there was some talk that the\nSaudis sovereign well fun was behind it and the market went nuts to stock traded up they halted the stock turns out though that was it the case um and the FCC got involved with the securities and Exchange Commission got involved and said he never finalized the deal and they basically slapped them with fraud charge\nFor misleading statements\nUm but they gave him an out last week they offered him a deal where he didn't have to confirm or deny any guilt and he said no so the market and the stock traded off down to two hundred and sixty dollars a share something happened over the weekend and he had some sort of come to Jesus moment\nBecause then he subsequently said you know what I'll take the deal he's\nTwenty million dollars which is chump change to him the company's paying twenty million dollars he's no longer the chairman for the next two years but he's still CEOs so basically to your point\nI think he got off scot free less the forty million bucks twenty from Yemen twenty from a company and the chairman job which he basically shouldn't have any way um it's amazing that he's coming away as clean as he did ... given what was pretty I'm\nIncredibly thoughtless comment on Twitter ...\nAnd there's a big difference between thoughtless\nAnd criminal and criminal fraud friday is with the intend to deceive\nAnd if there is any legitimacy and I'm assuming that we'll we'll negotiations going on with the sovereign fund or he just didn't make this up to increase the value I mean there had to be some legitimate discussions and you didn't go far enough or to ... jump the gun so to speak\nI don't think I I don't think there's anything I don't think he thought anyway and criminally whatsoever I think keys I just think he's sort of a gunslinger they think he thinks everything is a bit of a joke and I don't think he he thinks he doesn't have to play by the rules of everybody else\nAnd although this is a publicly traded company he views it as it is and he can do whatever you want\nI think he's learning the hard way that when you are publicly traded company and you take the public's money effectively their rules that that are that come along with that and I think that he's starting to figure that out so maybe he grew up over the weekend so I don't think he had any criminal intent\nI think it's just him thinking he's the next Thomas Edison or you know going back to the wizard of Oz theme he's effectively the wizard of Oz but as the wizard learn you know he's not all powerful and knowing\nAll right so guy I have two questions one how much on\nA pardon\nOne speeding punch question what is\nA question one is uh how much oversight will a new chairman have on his actions the c._e._o.\nI Hope a lot I Hope they bring in the new board of directors I Hope they they bring it as a chairman that actually it's not just got a rubber stamp things um so that's my hope I don't know if that's going to actually be a ... you know I don't know what's going to come to pass\nAll right now the next question is ... inning of itself as a company and that is a within three years every single major car manufacturer is going to have an electric cars matter of fact I foresee every model will be manufactured in two versions electric non electric\nOr what does test would do with that one because now right now tests have the entire market what happens in three or four years\nSo you're speaking of the competition factor and that's what a lot of the test for the stairs will say that it will Tesla faces a huge amount of competition you're probably getting emails from Audi talking about how they're making electric car jihad General Motors Ford BMW\nThey're all out there so and three to four years to your point everybody's going to be in the same game and test what might be rendered obsolete the decision\nYou have to make as an investor it as a traitor is\nIs that for a electric car company or the something much bigger are they looking to change the power grid in the United states they some right right exactly the technology company that's going to be um ... we talk about the same way we talk about Amazon and commerce\nThat's the question I don't know what the answer is right now the market is saying a Tesla it's far more than a car company because if it was just a car company and it was just so extra car company with a competition they have to start would be one third the price that it is now\nAnd uh when you talk about uh the new technology do is there any insight as the general consensus weeds in the company that in the technology and go to battery for example and the grid\nAnd home systems connected to solar is that where the company is going because they figured that's where the new world is\nYes that's exactly right and that's what the Tesla believers think that it's far more than just\nYou know the cue cards we see on the road that are pretty by the way pretty unbelievable to drive it's much more that the car is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the technology and the technology is going to be um it's going to change the way we live our lives that's what the real believers think again I don't know if that's the case\nBut the real must believers in the real test of believers and to a certain extent the real basics believers think that this man is a visionary and this company is you know the cars are just the tip of the iceberg of something that's going to be transformational\nYeah and I'm assuming a space acts as a great model it's not a question new technology he just made a cheaper better quicker and uh that's it's a better mouse trap you well\nYou also can land a ... I mean they can take even he could shoot a rocket into the sky and land a thing on a\nOn a thing the size of a you know on the dashboard of your yeah exactly that's what yeah All right it's pretty cool\nYeah All right guys thank you a young man All right take care guy a nominee who is a on CNBC every day two o'clock\nOn fast money All right uh coming out to Vegas shooting is the other anniversary that are here today a first thing we talk about of course is the first Monday in October Supreme Court sits today and there is a world to that\nAnd then the\nVegas shooting in what's going on in Las Vegas how they're dealing with it and a couple of new laws that have not kick in this is KFI A.
