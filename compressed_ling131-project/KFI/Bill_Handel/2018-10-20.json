by ten dull and two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to those willing to give details of any abuse\nMeanwhile the almost five hundred other cases against handle and the school are still pending in

peace with the seven to ... victory in game six last night's\nThe better the park and you know and look there's you could seek out is so clear you can see Catalina Island [noise] are you are you going on on on good days even summer are awesome that's obscure it's so clear to you can see Catalina and the waves\nAre a pretty high not that I'm a surfing expert but they seem pretty high like six eight yeah Sam and they're large serve dozens and dozens of surfers out there yeah\nAnd so it is a beautiful Huntington Beach day and we're going to have the directive their show at ten Fifteen or and or another stuff did you hear it Gary yes I yeah it is scary happened when I was the number number eight after they get a good time or an hour long flight that was really really cool\nYeah I'm going to try and you know sign up for next year and see if I can I can do and I know I may be a little bit too big for a cause I Know there is a a a weight\nLimit I'm probably pass that uh you know several tens of pounds ago\nYou'll like a decade ago when when I was sixty pounds a lighter\nThan the key is to not try to do a media flight in a big market that's why we're screwed in LA because you know they're going to take Dallas rains and they're gonna they're gonna take you know everyone else before too We're on the lowest rated show\nWell how did you ever you know and he he had it for ten years serious when he went at it every single year the key one time in climate falls Oregon they had run out of celebrities in getting they did big Billy and\nSmith Wesson the local morning shows they did the local weather girl and they they had two more days of media flights they ran out of celebrities so I was in the Oregon armed guards at time during the public affairs and they gave me like a two hour ride\nAnd they the other people they they were they had fuel to expand and they had no solicitor fresh out of celebrities and so we got we got a free ride so that's the key is like for you like go to Reno uh do a media right up in Reno\nAnd then you get a weekend a RINO you're going to media right but yet those don't Tritan LA\nOkay I mean that's that's good advice alright so uh I'm going to talk to the director but I kept the highlights for you and I am assuming pretty much the same uh air people are going to be in the air in terms of the Arab addicts in terms of the thunderbirds I'm assuming we have some parachute team that's going to be coming down they usually do\nAnd so for you highlights\nThe thunderbirds or or the other big highlight\nAnd then what um but you know for sure for sure noise and speed and majesty it's tough to beat the military\nDemonstration teams because they have a bottomless budget that kind of a bottomless budget but I Do I Do what I Love about the shows that you have a lot of these private guys season wealthy dudes who are uh you know modified planes like this the act one town that we're going to see it's a pair of\n... fifty five ... it's a Russian made Arab ... specifically in everybody plane uh the guy married two of them with the center wearing and put a jet engine on it\nAnd those those are really cool because you really get the spirit of an old time air show because it's a guy and his money in a warehouse or a hanger somewhere\nAnd uh you know doing his own you know Arab addicts and then they come to something like\nThis and a son that's that's a really really cool part of which went you love to see a by playing with a wing Walker on it they they're still does really and then they go from plane the plane like at the Oshkosh air show so much still does that the other really cool thing as an official\nNot a very shows about this one is that usually with ... with their shows whether it's the LA county wound up in Lancaster\nYou're still a mile away from the planes when they're flying or half a mile this one is over the Pacific ocean you know so we're you're out on you can go on the pier if you want to go on to the VIPs and go right up to the surface you can you can paddle out there\nNot past the boys but you're you're right under the planes and that's that's really rare the only one I've ever seen like that is the fair in Seattle where they fly over the lake\nSo this is the Huntington beach is brilliant because they're taking advantage of the water you know and and you're you're not kept a mile away from the performers you're you're right up against the water so where\nSo where do they parking the military planes when they're not here\nI think it's I think it's either Miramar last several meters or Long Beach are very you know I literally thirty seconds by air I Know the snowbirds that Canadians were here last year\nA and they were ... I Believe they were just at at at Long Beach and so they they took off and they were right over the beach and starting to show so there's no there's a delay or or anything like that but um\nNow I was a I was expecting a zillion people on the beach I mean it's crowded but I had heard we'll talk to the director and a few minutes a I had heard that there will be north about a million people up and down the pier or up and down the uh the sea board and I don't know if that's going to happen\nAlthough it was last year he says this is what's crazy weather kind of help people off you watch the this is you you will not see a open beach from the pier a mile down and it it's great\nAs you mentioned I mean the day is a spectacular day I mean the weather is wonderful visibility is completely in sane or not only can you see\nCatalina but I think you know little bits of Japan over there I mean the\nFact that is not Catalina that is Japan\nVery large it literally is looming it is that clear and then\nI'll look at ways how those are ways I Can't tell but they look what they're an expert out there twenty feet tall good how's your seeing eye dog doing I Hope well uh where you know I Can't tell six eight feet you know either they're spectacular\nOn for a pretty calm day are those are some nice surf but you know and that's another consideration for the show is is the wind there's there's no when two years in the LA county or show I watched the thunderbirds of the LA county air show in Lancaster two years ago they had to hold up the show\nAlmost two hours 'cause 'cause of the wind it was fifty mile an hour winds so they went and burn fuel and nothing happened here uh it's everything is going to hit like clockwork\nAlright I'll take a break come back and we're gonna talk to a director of the year show and I get some information 'cause I got it but I Am a few questions that you probably can't and\nSo there's I think that's a fire but there's no way county fire about it looks like a tugboat and big yeah I Know what awesome radio dishes but there is a a funky looking boat that I don't think it's a fire but\nNow bringing your where they can actually see because this is radio\nYeah I just why already made that joke\nI understand that but that's a I went to refer to\nThat Joe there's ... there's a tug duck buddy thing and also by the way they did this last year they come they do the demonstration they start spurting large streams into the air\nAll right we're gonna come back and talk to the director of the air show a handle and suits suits and handle here at the Huntington pier the great Pacific Air show the show starts at eleven thirty rent some four Fifteen and you can download the heart app and listen because you'll be able to hear\nThat you hear the exclusive air show or the announcer play by play 'cause obviously it gets a little noisy I and I can't do it on the radio here on the pier All right Brian suits and handle we'll be back in just a moment KFI am at six forty and let's see uh Rivera was some news\nThings down well it all comes down to a game seven today for the brewers and Dodgers any and I'll see at\nThe winner will play the red Sox in the world series ... in Michigan and say they removed the remains of sixty three feet from the funeral home in Detroit in a standoff between huge crowds of migrants trying to reach for us and Mexican police continue continues at Mexico's southern border check whether Andrew drive in the nineties\nGeo we BPL it'll keep your cool but it's hard to spell\nCall right now okay\nHere's the deal you're a freelancer hired\nSome made self own businesses one whether you're a contractor creative director working so you're the boss and that makes things easier and less of course you're trying to get a mortgage when it comes to qualifying for cash out ... ... workers come with more obstacles more complexities and more stress right\nDial paid three three four four to cash and one of our cache of mortgage specialist will help you qualify for the lowest interest loan regardless of your source of income is the easiest coal you'll make all day three three four four to cash make the cash\nToday the first one in fact more than ...

have here and this is directly from the military correct\nCorrect yeah we have a we have our our tasty one thirty five we mentioned the previous segment we have the air force thunder birds we have the Seventeen um and I think that that this\nYear round numbers ...\nUh not to be miss those guys are fantastic uh they're great to hang out with\nAnd they're going to be opening our show today bringing down or glory and they also do another jumped there in the middle of the of the show so actually they come down to jump out they come down they land they grab their parachute they get loaded into them they go back to Los I'll get back on the chopper and go back up to jump in the middle of the show just for us so it's quite a hustle for them and we really appreciate\nI'm assuming they we packed a

what they're doing\nNow is it has to be one of the biggest air shows out there but a way ... was talking about the size of their shows\nAs far as the size of their shows this this air show I Believe my attendance numbers is is pretty close if not the largest we keep saying it's the largest because\nI think uh places like Chicago who are announcing a billion people are talking about everybody who might glance out of an office window and look at an airplane but we can quantify people by counting up the number of people on the beach we actually have the technology to take photos of the of the sand and and there's you know selling\nThe inauguration exactly yeah there was a\nShow of this type I'm assuming are not unique to the United states or are they primarily an American thing\nNow there is there shows all over the country or I mean all over the world frankly in a in general aviation is growing huge in China and then there's there shows in Canada or where they have millions of people so I mean it is a big thing and it's one of those things that brings all people out the cool thing about doing an air show at the beach frankly as opposed to the airport is you don't have to be a passionate avid aviation\nFollower I mean you've got to really love planes the one that goes down in the hot tarmac all day you don't necessarily have to know a lot about planes to want to go sit on the beach and one from fly so that would bring the masses down\nOh here's another big difference between\nInternational ourselves in American or is that there was a a hold on a minute a\nJobs thirty
