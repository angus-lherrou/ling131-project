I'm Sorry that's just me but that was not a pretty ...\nYeah see I was a man you talk about controversy on one hand I hear some announcers I I hear them talking on the radio one way saying you know you can tell he didn't mean to him he didn't go for his ankle at all he barely even touch them and then you had the TV announcers saying something totally different so it's that that was a very controversial little move last night for sure\nThere was a lot of space on that base I'm Sorry I I think he could have easily avoided it but that's just me and if he does come to the next year I'm sure I'll be seeing a different\nTurn ugly All right so let's talk about now USA Gymnastics Mary Bono was president an interim president there and just after a week at our new gig all of a sudden she resigns what happened there's a lot of back story on this one there\nThere is and keep in mind we got a flash back a couple of months when Mary Lee Tracy was hired to add up the USA Gymnastics and she resigned three days later after a it was revealed that she actually defended Larry Nassar too\nAs as women were coming forward and and accusing him of sexual abuse so she was out they need to fill that spot okay let's bring in Mary Bono as an interim replacement she takes the job late last week and\nWhat are you know civil Simone Biles picks up on a tweet that she issued back in September of basically ripping Colin Kaepernick and the Nike ad ah she's caught in an image blacking out a Nike swoosh on some golf shoe she had to Simone Biles we set out by the way by all is\nA is a sponsored by Nike so um but that being said I mean you don't want to be turning sponsors away 'cause that's essentially what your main goal is to try to bring sponsorship USA Gymnastics\nBiles brings that up and then in the meantime uh there's this other controversy that's brewing as two of them that Boehner worked for that actually a defended Larry Nassar at least it created excuses for him as to why he was gone and twenty Fifteen while all these allegations an investigation\nUnderway they weren't forthcoming in saying\nThat he was under investigation for sex abuse so a boat was being questioned as to the law firms response it never responded back in an alley raised when got involved and\nNow five days later four days later a all of a sudden resignation appears on the table of USA Gymnastics\nYou just think I I mean\nIt collectively as in you you just got to wonder what in the world with USA Gymnastics thinking to bring somebody on was it just because she was the name and she was like that they thought OK Mary Bono we put her as the face people will go along with it I just feel like they didn't do a lot of vetting because this seems like stuff that would have been pretty easy to have found out\nYeah exactly and you just set back this program another few weeks right I mean if not years because we've got Tokyo coming up and twenty twenty twenty months away or you've got to get someone in this\nWhy can't it be a it 'cause it's one out of four hundred and something million that line\nI understand that one but it's never going to be you\nAre you part of the lottery pool here

students who were defrauded by for profit colleges\nWe're seeing is very divided or who is not\nParticularly pro student the secretary of education and I would say it's fair to say that her philosophy use to dismantle education in this country and so ah the an Obama era by law or policy that said ... students\nAre getting their money back 'cause there's tons of these for profit that fraud students well she put a stop to that the return of the money to these deprive students which of course means that they would get their money back\nOff from the government and so that causes more taxes and Betty to Boston and I think it's fair to say that it's a question of saving taxes for her as one Portland these students getting their money back the court said nope nope these guys get their money back and ah ... ah you're wrong\nSo Betsy I'm Sorry not bad bets Betty is never mind it can do a cow joke but I'm not going to All right not hurt by the way just name so I just want to make that clear or not shaming her at all All right no Cal face here I mean seriously\nUh well we finally found out what can motivate the LA city council to change their ways\nFor a long time in LA there was this provision where if you wanted to build a homeless housing and get funding for it you had to get a letter of acknowledgement from the city council member\nWhose district yeah discovered and so that would allow the council person to basically block oh yeah well it meant by not issuing the letter no question about it and my brother who's been involved in development for years and\nYears first thing has to do is couch out at the council member and die ... council member has the right to stop any project and God help a developer who gave money to uh the opponent in the run for office\nSo now but no longer because Governor Brown signed a law that would ban any state money or tax credit's going to any development if that system is in place where the council men can withhold writer and so the LA said oh now it affects money coming to my district okay we'll get rid of the whole\nWhich was ridiculous to let one council member and weren't talking about having gone through planning having gone through the entitlement process having gone through everything and a council member says no\nAnd not for any good reason it's not a question of appeal ability is just no it's crazy\nAnd now they're going to argue well we did it to increase or the park area the green or the Green Zone yeah\nI think if enough people yelled at the council when we don't want it why they might say All right I'm listening to our my constituency well no longer\nAll right well you already have to ask for a straw and now you won't get a plastic one even if you do [noise]\n[noise] yeah it's only going to be much drive by twenty Twenty one now [laughter] they just disintegrate and there's nothing like a\nMuch she [noise] ... yeah it's just fabulous isn't it [noise] this is just an idea at this time but

where some woman with their pants off\nGoes into the restroom stall with some guy I guess they were going to you know if you all around in there and they say these looted ... becoming a growing problem fool around as opposed to some hooker\nGoing in or is my guess\nAnyway this has to do with the metro expo line or being extended and that that becomes a problem because for some reason these uh whenever you put a metro station or what happens it just like a magnet ah people like this come in and if there's a park nearby guess what\nWe've got to number six yeah yeah sure about the cookies yeah much better\nThere's a Davis high school student who allegedly baked your grandfather's ashes into about your sugar cookies and then gave him to her friend's\nRoom ... this is a spectacular story

relationship with Saudi Arabia so ah the president is taking a very measured position and when he takes measure positions\nI it's interesting how his philosophy when it comes to ... when it comes to president gee when it comes to a president Rodrigo of the Philippines\nOr when it comes to been Saul ... who is a virtual dictator or he's he doesn't go that we're not going to criticize very much course when it comes to any of it is a domestic detractors are there it's just vicious just vicious so it's sort of a contradiction here in the meantime I\nIt's virtually certain and we know I think it's already happened that the Saudis said yeah it happened but these rogue agents inside we're fully investigating it\nAnd as I said yesterday what's going to end up happening couple of guys will be a ... will be the ... a finger pointing to them they will be picked up they will be deported or recalled back to Saudi Arabia there'll be tried it will be given lengthy prison sentences and then somehow magically or they're going to disappear and be granted amnesty or something\nAnd I ended up getting a a pretty good pension I Would think but this is all in the future in the meantime the president has to deal with the fallout 'cause the rest of the world the western world going berserk here\nBecause you're talking about a government\nTorturing showing\nThis membrane and turning off the pieces of ah someone an adversary in a foreign country now it's Saudi Saudi constantly as in old conflicts and embassies are sovereign\nPieces of land I mean that to its Saudi Saudi soil when you talk about it called constantly or an embassy no matter where it is but it's in Turkey\nAnd or to God is not very happy so what the president is doing is as everybody else in the world is screaming and reviewing their relationships corporate ah business interests are turning around and cutting ties with Saudi Arabia like crazy\nAnd that's very important to Saudi Arabia because one of the things had been Solomon wants to do and desperately wants to do with his heading Saudi Arabia\nIs to get away from just oil\nHe understands at at some point oil's going to run out and ... and or alternative energy is going to kick in in a big way and oil simply not be as valuable\nSo he's moving in the direction of doing business with the rest of the world as opposed to just selling oil well that took a little bit of a nosedive because as a result of this so the president's main position\nBefore we quote jumped to ... to a jump to conclusions here we have to take into account\nThe arms sales of the United states cells are the arms United States sales to Saudi Arabia hundred and ten billion dollars a year\nAnd it's the jobs and I think it's a legitimate position\nI mean it's not insane it's not crazy but then it's a question of right what's right is right and at some point you just do what's right which never seems to happen in the world of politics certainly in this presidential world\nRight coming up Ted Cruz and a Beto O'Rourke is a bean or battle Bechtel yeah\nUh he is a democratic opponent and it's a it's a good one boy there's a lot of these going on in the country so uh

trailers fifth wheels gas and diesel ... fifty brands one thousand choices with model you're in close up saving the one hundred thousand of them is or be video ... dot com or the ... by me for twenty two Westminster [noise]\nThe moral never stop it's constantly changing\nProposition sex will make things even worse\nProp six eliminates more than five billion annually and dedicated transportation funding [noise]\n... they the repairs to thousands of miles of roads bridges overpasses and freeways\nAnd six and kills local traffic really projects already had her away\nThe safety of wrote in Britain makes it harder to respond during an emergency and makes traffic congestion even worse\nThat's why the California professional firefighter in American society of civil engineers and the California association of highway patrolman all said no I'm saying it's a dangerous road [noise]\nA four by non ... stop the attack on British road safety sponsored by business labor local governments in transportation advocate\nMany major funding from California light for jobs\n[noise] why do you hear what I mean John can do to fix on KFI [noise]\nAnd this\nIs I Can't find do handle here\nIt is say Wednesday morning of big stories are recovering the lottery second biggest in history five hundred million dollars a Dodgers\nGame a five [noise] starts a when next Tuesday I think [noise] and ah they\nOh today I'm Sorry today Tuesday oh today Wednesday All right and that's in Milwaukee right\nNo year oh okay boy ...\nGot it I have that right okay I I was going to do a lot with Warner we still have plenty of time for that but I'm listening to the commercials for the props which obviously\nThey're spending a lot of money on and uh I I I'm ... every\nYear I don't know why but every election cycle I'm totally stunned as to the disinformation the exaggerations obfuscation\nOr that comes in a publishing and are doing in airing these commercials\nAnd I mean both sides I mean everybody does it obviously because they want to get their pitch across and sometimes you just go what are you talking about\nI was listening to for example uh the pro prop six that ran in the last commercial break the anti prop six that ran and lost commercial break and the pro prop six people I I Love statements like ah they're going to spend no money on roads\nThat's the entire point to the proposition ... a statement of fact they will spend no money on roads up where does that come from it just is thrown out and\nThen uh the anti prop six\nRight it's a you're taking money away from these projects infrastructures ah we have road repairs of places a disaster and you don't want to take money away from that leaving out of course is that a year ago\nIt was a twelve cents per ... per gallon increase\nAnd then we have the way these propositions written the attorney general writes this and ... six is written in such a way not one word of gas or tax or repeal\nIsn't the proposition and what is it it's the gas tax repeal it starts stops right there\nShould be a three weren't proposition there were only Seventeen gas tax repeal yes or no I mean that's the proposition but\nWhen you talk about those opposed it's really not about to repeal the gas tax it's about taking away money from the infrastructure it's about a rose being cry crowded it's about bridges falling apart\nYeah but how about the issue here it's a gas tax repeal oh no no we're never going to mention that why because as soon as you say gas tax repeal then all of a sudden a public sentiment ships\nAnd what happened to Josh Newman thrown out of office why 'cause he voted for the gas tax so now to maintain the gas tax\nWhich is what the attorney general wants to do and you could tell them the way you wrote the proposition to guarantee to confiscate to our ... our uh\nOfficers ups ups yes to confuse God I it's amazing I make my living\nDoing this off you skate thank you very much uh the issue it's what's moving over in that direction\nWas moving over so people don't think about a gas tax singers was moving over to where it's about puppies and kittens and saving our environment and keeping our roads in good shape and making sure you don't fall off bridges that if you're going to\nTake a swan dive and commit suicide off of a bridge that collapses first so you don't have to worry about jumping off\nThat's the way all of these should be written right it is I mean it's good for the media are these propositions or the best thing in the world for television it's insanity radio is great\nFor the printing houses wonderful for the voters\nHorrible horrible\nFor the strategist fantastic I should actually asked John Thomas how much money is he making from all this but what you're kind of this John and you know he'll say it will say well it's ...\nI go I Can't understand what you're saying ... to you know oh come on give me a figure well okay All right that's what we're going to hear probably so welcome to prop ... and so what I've always said and I'll keep on saying uh whatever's for\nOh it's really against whatever is against as always for just the other direction and you'll have an idea which way to go on this\nOr just listen to Chris and Carlos podcast is proposition podcast\nYep oh I'm doing one uh and uh we're doing the uh twenty Eighteen voter died was the same thing I'm doing propositions I think most of us have when John and can have one Johnny kenner great no on everything [laughter] ah so ah there's is literally one word\nNope nope except for prop six that's

relating to you and your job if you don't mind shirt or does do does the government react when you come out and do a story 'cause in private business certainly does\nI absolutely think that politicians especially bureaucrats react when any reporter\nErrors or print the story that exposes a problem exposes that they should have that she they should be doing something about this or that they probably should have been doing something that a long time ago I think they react to news reports all the time 'cause they're fearful that they're not going to look good but again if government
