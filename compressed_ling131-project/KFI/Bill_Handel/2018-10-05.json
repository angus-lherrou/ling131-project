half\nHour away I'm Jennifer Jones Lee live from the KFI twenty four hour news from Senate Republicans are working to confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh this weekend senators are meeting this morning to vote on whether to close debate a voter who says she's a sexual assault survivor ... confronted West Virginia democratic Senator Joe Manchin yesterday at the Capitol\nAnd these allegations or not only the sexual misconduct allegations\nWhich the Democrats they are still there and the FBI did a horrible job of investigating as and not really an investigation but also whether he lied under oath in front of the committee\nSo you see some Democrats they all went to social media of course ah to air their frustration\nAnd one former deputy assistant us attorney general who had previously worked for the Democratic side or even call for use in peace and peach mind from the federal judiciary which we're not talking about just people that are upset we're talking about people that are fairly high up in the world of\nThis this area and\nUh this is a Lisa Graves who wrote a column September seven so and this week before the New Yorker published the then anonymous sexual assaults\nAh the claims of Christine Blasey Ford and she testified later on as you know Gray's wrote that Kavanaugh had misled the Judiciary Committee about the stolen\nDocuments that she had written is chief counsel for the nominations of central Senator Patrick Leahy\nWhen he was chair of the committee excuse me\nKavanaugh she said lie under oath and did so repeatedly\nTherefore he should not be confirmed but here is the problem is that even though a there are a bunch of lawmakers who have voice to these kinds of concerns about Kavanaugh's integrity\nAnd dishonesty dishonesty for impeachment to fly\nIt has to be so blatant ... because if you look at what the constitution or how he defines a impeachment high crimes and misdemeanors is the basis for impeachment uh and treason\nOr no one has any idea what high crimes is no one has any idea what misdemeanors or treason is fairly easy\nAnd there have been a couple who have been tossed out for treason but the rest of it is can it be political yeah Gerald Ford yeah that Gerald Ford\nA when a guy he was a representative talked about impeachment and said impeachment is anything that house of representatives says it is\n\nAnd you say really he said that we that house are the ones that in fact do the impeaching and we look at the constitution and it is so vague that we we have the right let's let's take a break and\nCome back on

Che\nConstituency isn't to worry about to Mitch McConnell calling him up and saying hey you don't vote this way you're going to suffer dramatically which is what a majority leaders of speakers do I mean the arm twisting that goes on is astounding when you talk about ... what happens in the the houses I mean it's just\nAnd six skills local traffic relief projects already underway\nAnd make traffic congestion even worse\nThe California professional firefighter in American society of civil engineers and the California association of highway patrolman [noise] all the ... it's a dangerous route [noise]\nPaid for by non ... stop the attack on British road safety sponsored by business labor local governments and transportation African\nMany major funding from California light for top [noise]\nDon't you start with humans route John Paul scammers forget the right opportunity and we are going to get away with it will get we have to sit on campus [noise]\nCan't\nBuy handle here and a good morning on a friday October fifth All right to vote is going right on the\nSenate or two and a debate so or the Senate doesn't have the\nAbility to filibuster the Democrats don't have the ability to just keep on going and going and going when it comes to stop the boats so tomorrow probably will be the final vote that then we'll move a matter of fact will in fact confirm a red cabinet\nAnd the big issue and I'll tell you what uh was up in the air was a Jeff Flake and Jeff Flake was up and is a senator who doesn't care he could look at this strictly along moral grounds just how she felt\nA without any political consideration everybody else it's all political matter of fact a a mansion ah all voted in favor for political reasons\nHe is in the Senate fight for his life he's a Democrat\nAnd he is in a red state\nAnd so I have no choice and we don't know which way he is I was thinking I mean he wasn't a big fan I'm probably isn't a Brett Kavanaugh then you have a couple of other senator too I I think one more of a name doesn't ring a bell\nWho is going to flip a to the Republican yes because there is nothing to lose anymore right and\nSo in court or what Corker voted in favor interestingly enough in court or doesn't have anything he has no a skin in the game\nBecause he also has no he's out of their running he's retiring so uh there's no reason for him to have voted either way so uh the vote is moving forward will probably be fifty two forty eight is my guest the way it's going to go tomorrow which of course is considered a nomination is\nHere to the nose are forty nine the motel is agreed to so if you wanted one I already nine wow\nIt's about as close as you can get well you can do fifty fifty but uh just by a hair and or you had a for example who was Gorsuch ah went through dramatically bigger numbers\nAnd you had done the next the last time it was this tight was I think a Clarence Thomas so what does it mean with the U.S Supreme Court that has flipped\nFrom a super liberal court then to a court that was considered\nBalanced with Justice Kennedy being the swing vote he could have gone either way too now and he retired to doubt a solid five to four a conservative majority so what does it mean well ... to most of us who doesn't mean a whole lot\nYou know for example abortion rights we live in California California will always have abortions in our constitution the right to privacy and I don't care personally I mean my when my daughters and abortion are you kidding my daughter's aren't married yet they're not even having sex there twenty three years old they don't have sex just ask them\nOr so or the the gay rights what you think there's a problem with gay rights in California\nThe trick is to do it outside of California\nAnd then you have national health whether I'm see personally none of this affects me I mean I'm always going to have insurance so I don't care but I Do in terms of how it affects me All right I'm exempt from being affected by this court particularly as a matter of fact\nI'm probably ah is probably going to help me to have this court in terms of taxation and died in well not so much environmental controls 'cause I don't have a gas station and I don't have a factory\nBut it's a it's going to change the way we view the world for sure you're going to see environmental protections are really decrease and out when the president for example uh takes away E. P. A. restrictions\nAnd ... and it goes to court or the court's going to uphold or the president can uphold uh the conservative view\nGay rights are going to be much limited rosy weighed even though Brett Kavanaugh said to Feinstein that this is settled law it that it's not\nWhat's going to happen is that even if roe v Wade is upheld per se the fact that it's gone\nA there'll be so many restrictions they'll be in such nibbling away that it's going to be effectively as to death by a thousand cuts is what's gonna happen to roe v Wade and uh you're going to see uh well my big thing of national health actually my big thing morally is across the board\nYou know environmental protection for I Believe in a certainly I Believe in global warming and climate change so we've got to\nBut someplace I Believe in alternative energy my next cars probably going to be an electric car or so\nAnd that's me making I guess that part of the uh uh that part of a political statement but for most of us it is not as big a deal as if for example you happen to be a poor woman in Arkansas\nOr in Texas and you need an abortion\nAnd you need health care and\nObamacare which may very well be and done with this new court if another lawsuit comes up\nIt's uh it it the constitutionality aware of of whether the president has a right to do what President Obama did\nUh it's it it's going to be a very different country much like the Warren Court back in the fifties changed America and it went way liberal Earl Warren who was former governor of California by the way who headed the U.S Supreme Court was achieved justice that turned a quarter round completely\nThe Miranda warnings brown versus board of education all of that and now it's the swing\nAnd is it going to be as liberal the way the Warren Court when will it go that far to the right ah probably not\nBut yeah you're you're going to see a different America that's for sure and you're going to see ah the the Democrats the liberals the progressive saw up in the air and the difference is unfortunately for the progressive it's not a question of waiting for the next president to come in\nOr waiting for the next Senate or house to flip\nThis was lifetime\nA president's nomination for justice Supreme Court is probably the most important long why it is certainly among the most important but certainly the longest lasting a part of his or her legacy\nAnd this one what Thirty years from now you'll still see Brett Kavanaugh on the bench now if\nRuth Bader Ginsburg hangs on awaiting the election of a Democrat and this was the last one the court may go back\nTo a five four maybe go no it wouldn't I'm Sorry yeah roof gator brings ... a super liberal so you have\nTo wait for a couple of the conservatives and they're going to last a long long time so the best is going to happen is the court will stay five to four\n\nAs conservative court I mean it's well we'll see\nAlright coming up we did a story yesterday about inmates California inmates who are firefighters\nAnd how they're trained and can't get jobs truck lovers who's a friend of mine weighing in may firefighting programs for years he retired uh with uh I think county uh LA county firefighters and uh he I mean I ... truck would would his uh\nYeah with his title was what did he retire as anyway we're gonna have Chuck aboard and we'll talk about what we talked about yesterday as a follow up care if I Am six forty\nK pacify the boss Angeles Orange County and I are radio station [noise]\nConfirmation vote coming I'm Jennifer jumped fully live from the KFI twenty four hour news from the U.S Senate has voted to advance to the Supreme Court nomination of judge Brett Kavanaugh of cool confirmation vote is expected this weekend Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said the vote would be making a statement whether the ...\nOf partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence or will reaffirmed it in the United states of America every one is a girl proven filter\nMcConnell calls the past two weeks since the misconduct claims came out a disgraceful spectacle\nThe Dodgers have taken an early lead against the Braves and an hour last the final score yesterday at Dodger Stadium with six to nothing that chapter David Freese topped off the lead with the sacrifice fly in the bottom of the eight the five game series continues tonight at Dodger Stadium\nLAPD cop who says he was abused by a priest has taken a novel approach to suing the Vatican many Vegas lawyer Mike then against says the lawsuit uses a law that allows foreign countries to be sued for crimes that took place in US soil\nTo be firefighters yet can't get jobs once they're out and they're fairly close\nTo getting out because I'm assuming there are very few people on death row that or volunteer firefighters they go out on the fire line like Chuck lovers who would do I think a was with a uh LA county for how ... how long were you are in the uh the fire department valley county\nI have a total of a Thirty Years'\nOkay so ... been around for a while and died Chuck who I've known for many years or you were with LA county correct correct alright and are you in fact Rand these cruise the inmate crews for how long\nAbout sixteen years\nAll right so obviously a lot of experience first of all all let's talk about the training or how long it takes in what kind of a training these are these guys have by the time they get out\nOK well first off you know they start off with with the state and they get their trading and they learn the tools that we use our brush fire fighting\nAnd mostly they learned safety out at on there a fire shoulders you know the science of the fire what's gonna happen a and mostly just listening to what's going on around you are listening to your foreman\nAnd so I did how long does that take and how sophisticated as that from what you say is aren't you throw this a silver Superman Cape a over you and then you listen to your form and that doesn't seem to\nBe a lot of training am I wrong on that\nNo but you need to instill a sense of of priorities you know your life saving priorities step one step to step three uh it's not an easy thing to put those things on when you have a firestorm roaring around you know it's like it's like a ... like I say all\nRight so ... so there is a a fair amount of training involved is is what you're saying\nCorrect now you know the training is ... ... they're not going to go out and be able to be a ton of asleep go out and fight fire\nA ... they need to learn how to work as a team\nWhich is something unique because uh [noise]\nPeople who are criminals are individuals and they don't like to take orders from someone else\nSo what's it like I mean obviously running an inmate crews very different than running a normal fire crew in ... you've done both so tell me are the differences\nAre ... the major differences\nWhen you're when you're working with someone who said ah there's an element of respect to automatic and with the inmates it has to be earned\nYou know you you can't uh they just don't come to you and automatically show respect to you that you need to show respect for them a because they've been [noise]\nMost of their life uh people have been putting them down you know there are there\nA few people have told from school you're never going to amount to anything and my job is really to go to build them up to your show them they can do what they're doing what we do is is hard work\nUh for the call your work but it it it it takes a certain amount of internal fortitude to really be out there\nYeah I'm going and what I Want to do is I if you don't mind keeping on for another segment but let me in this segment with a just a just the dynamic\nBecause at in prison there told what to do how to do it and they're not treated with a lot of respect by the prison guards I'm assuming ah they're they're treated very much like a\nSub now say subhuman but certainly not anywhere near the same level and what you're saying is it's very different when they're they're out on the light on the on the fire lines is that correct it\nExtremely different but is that the cops are wardens are\nOn them they have a lot of people to deal with and they don't have time for niceties\nRight let me let me take a break when it come back and I have a few other questions and we're going to get to they can't get jobs and that's a problem that's a huge problem we'll be right back this ... KFI are coming up we're going into second segment on that in the meantime there's Jennifer ...\nNo Senate Republicans in one Democrat had voted to limit debate on the Supreme Court nomination Brett Kavanaugh the vote means Kevin who'd be officially confirmed this weekend they got the gas has gone to a new theory are high and so now the LA county average is now three eighty seven you know see it's three eighty three prices in the ... another five to seven cents cheaper\nAnd the man in northern England has been rescued from what may have been modern day slavery\nLeasing car lousy the fifty eight year old was forced to read and it sticks sad for for decades\nWill take a look at your commute with the camp I in the sky and simply ring on the next\nTen years old those old sprays can

fiscal year and cut the total compensation for Ebbets top five execs by twenty percent\nYeah for example former CEO of a\nA Denise Morrison or her conversation was cut to about seven million a twenty two percent less I took that Israel would yeah that is a huge caught because seven million dollars is certainly not enough uh over the last three years she received twenty eight million dollars\nA and the retirement is a tremendous it's good to be a CEO I must tell you it's a great job now it's pretty rare fight air to\nYou just look at oh my God here's a CEO makes all this money to get there a is lifetime\nDon't you think that when if Campbell's downfall has been over the years it's tried to get into different foods and whatnot and I feel like it went away from the focus but just to see I don't know if people\nBy soups anymore or they do by soups not light not like they used to you don't see a where everybody in the world is a making\nA that dips\nAnd how many people now take a chicken and pork ... mushroom soup on it and then put it in the oven I mean this people are a little more sophisticated that although that is a delicious fish that is a dish\nMhm [noise] speaking of uh CEOs you on a mosque\nAfter settling those fraud charges from the SEC is back to taunting him on Twitter\nMy name is Milan than I'm Jeanie and he got on\nTwitter and he said uh I just want to say the short seller enrichment commission is doing incredible work and the name changes so on point wow and this is after resettled yes yeah he took it subtle and then he got you know because he settled\nSo what can they do them now they'd have to buy a new right problem with him\nBut he really he can't he goes after that diver in Thailand and he backs off and he goes after him again just make SEC than eating any thoughts he signed the agreement then he goes after them again\nWhen you're talking about a board that is now going to be far more independent pursuing to the settlement agreement made with the SEC is not gonna be a rubber stamp board anymore or how much more can you piss off aboard I was going to think you're a loose cannon will and say you know what this is enough\nAnd the thing is that the ... not technically dry on this deal as soon as it does drive though Iran is supposed to be under more control from the board as to what he does on social media there don't you feel like he's the little kid who's getting in one last hurrah\nMaybe could be although handed down but even retrospectively the board can say he's a he's just too crazy and it is affecting the sale of or or the or the value of the stock and even if someone on the board likes Ilan mosque\nAnd feels that his craziness has cost the shareholders some money on that board members duty bound to do something ah and ah the something may very well be tossing him from a tossing I'm a CEO\nWell the jets are either they crawl has gotten the endorsement deal after he lived a ball on his butt out like that and\nI found\nLanguage wiping uh if if he rubbed his but you know when you think of wiping yesterday I was listening to a guy Gary and Shannon\nAnd they were doing the whole thing about wiping and tissue and all of that somehow connected to this I mean there was obviously a spin off but the point is he took that I was looking at the video he took the ball you sort of rub it on his ass and threw it in the stands\nOkay now what like a big deal although he was fine Thirteen thousand dollars\nAnd his mom was mad at him oh she said I didn't like it as a mom I was shocked and I was a as a mild mannered person he usually doesn't do much celebrating I never go you see them go to the street\nBut you get a ... you get an excitement adults\nAre going on about misbehavior from NFL player yeah look at this list is nothing I Know but then but so Gen words where did he get a he gets so then do wipes which is the thing I guess it would toilet paper substitute for dude\nI Know she lives is sponsoring him as a Clinton our endorsing I Know it's\nJust it's a whole thing is is completely insane a very limited the amount of and by the NFL limited the amount of celebration\nThat a a player can do in the end zone which is too bad because the crazy stuff the players the at the dance in the answer is sort of break dancing I just was were fabulous and it was half\nThe entertainment and then the NFL\nYou remove that which is yeah come on\nHere's another yeah come on a Georgia woman's facing charges after she allegedly filled her child's ... with alcohol snuck it into the movie theater got tank and caused a ruckus\n\nMy feet are bringing it in the ... because you know how expensive it is that a counter that's like ... it's like a coat\nThat's why I when I go in I take a catheter bag filled with

and then got into it with the cop outside he told a cop out laughing kill you or no real smart socio as she's going to be true yeah\nOh you know I think the next ... story is don't teach her toddler
