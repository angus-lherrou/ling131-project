he calls back All right oh Chris\nWelcome to handle on the law Kris bill yeah there's\nA new tax law that allows me to a man a tax return from Eighteen years ago\n[noise] it could get a refund of taxes paid on military severance pay back then I was married to a someone that I cannot locate now are hiding from having to pay ... or\nSo I have no way of contacting her and I haven't heard from earn like sixteen years I don't know how to amend a tax return that will join with only one signature\nAh there there has to be a way of doing that because if the law allows someone to file\nAn amended return Twenty years later Eighteen years later a there's a a decent chance at the other partner their spouse or ... is not around\nEither can't be found somewhere out there on remarried died whatever so I there there has to be a way within the rules of the IRS because uh the Irish is pretty good about issuing five thousand new rules every other minute so the trick is to find an accountant straight out accountant who understands these rules\nAnd now when you file your tax returns you have an accountant\nChris yeah yeah have you asked your accountant about this\nYes and he wasn't serve any way to do it then he had and I haven't I haven't a point where the Iraq on friday\nAnd that is on it yeah that's the way\nI'm Glad you're asking me because of my vast expertise with not only this is tax law or this or tax returns and of course I you know when I have a complicated problem do you think I sit and researchers look it up now I go to my accountant Chris just like you did not what you did is you went a step beyond and that\nIs what I Would tell you if your account and doesn't know or several accountants you make an appointment with the IRS and yet I didn't mind it\nCould get that that I actually just fine at myself and uh maybe picnic or just magically appears\nNo no I I Would I don't know why I don't know if I Would do that I don't know if I Would do that what I Would say to the IRS is do I have to find her and uh then I Will then I'll go to extraordinary lengths to find her and that's when I go out\nSeventy grand behind the counter right that's another issue and that and I mean are there and you and and you may be able to get the whole thing okay based on the child support order\nSo I the magical signature ah she's she's still entitled to half of that yeah\nNow there could be a way where and this happens all the time with child support the IRS holds off needle grab people's money\nYeah our cases in that that stayed right now we're ... supposed to be surrender\nOkay so you're halfway there definitely time to talk to and IRS agent and and if the IRS aging doesn't know that rule specifically and it doesn't have any experience or a doesn't really understand that you go to a supervisor and you ask for someone who understands what's going on because it's a pretty obscure stuff\nAnd it's not as if a an iris Asian who doesn't understand this is incompetent in any way I mean if you ever look at the IRS code if you ever look at the Internal Revenue code\nThese our phone books thick with hundreds of thousands of rules\nAnd you're not normally supposed to be able to amend after three years\nWell they've changed the law I Wonder if you want to ask me I Would have said no but if they passed\nA law that is a different than we are in great shape\nIt's for military better yeah obviously are on February ... yeah All right so is there\nAny of 'em out there to get their return\nSo we're talking about a very narrow narrow description of a very narrow group of people and so you simply need someone who understands it and you're doing everything right man I'm there's nothing more I can give you other than you're doing everything
