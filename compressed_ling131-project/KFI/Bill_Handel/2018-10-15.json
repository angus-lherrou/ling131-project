W. F. one or two seven yeah well you in front of the call I got it through okay first of all\nThat's east of the Mississippi it are the W's west in this case and I the ah this radio station is now one of the oldest radio stations in the United states I actually was license Nineteen twenty two and you know what the name of the station was you know what to call letters were\nHanging by I Wish it were K. F. I. nothing in front of it\nEarly radios and you know no W in okay actually uh those were the early early radio stations anyway just a little bit of radio history there you will not be teaching that class All right now a guy a dummy so much to talk about uh he's on CNBC fast\nMoney weekdays on ... W CNBC a\nFrom a at two o'clock Pacific time and a guy\nA let's start with a ... I don't know whether it is that important in terms of the big picture economically but certainly as a news item Sears after a hundred and thirty two years files for bankruptcy this morning said\nDone over the any uh any lamport who took it over your ideal airports an interesting story sort of the c._e._o. fears he's been running the shop for the last decade or so\nHe was he was a hedge fund manager he was actually kidnapped and he talked his way out of this kidnapping sort of an interesting anecdote but he can't talk his way out of you know fears going bankrupt\nAnd the funny thing about here that it's really not that funny fears with Amazon before Amazon with Amazon Sears catalog I mean they had it all going on\nAnd they didn't adapt in this world you either adapt you change and your an innovator or your left for dead and that's exactly what happened to fear so it was where America shot no longer now does it have any ramifications the economy to a lot of point no\nI'm not edited maybe you know ten or Fifteen Years ago we'd have a different conversation but\nYou know fears is you know the sad part is nobody cares and how the mighty fall\nNow when you talk about not adapting or we're not\nTalking about the relative to the Internet because when you talk about target for example a huge retail store Wal Mart for example huge retail outlet or they're in good shape a relative to what's happening with the\nShape and but I think they also adopted with that so much the Internet although I think that's part of it I think it's understanding who your customer basis and adapting with the changing demographics and then it never did I think they were\nForever lost in the Nineteen sixties Nineteen seventies and it never really um move forward you know the world changes and you have to adapt with a change in customer base\nAnd you know if you're thinking there's so much it's your whole life you know people don't use wretched sending more I mean I'm ... I'm not trying to be glib but I think you understand what I'm saying they never really adapted their stores with the changing\nAnd this is actually my handle here\nA Monday morning October Fifteen some of the big stories that weren't covering of course uh the case of ... the ah\nAmerican journalist actually Saudi lives in America we just talked about a hundred and thirty two year old company called Sears going bankrupt guide me and a guy is ... scene on CNBC spouse Monday every weekday\nAnd are more like expert guy a now a we're talking about minimum wage and Amazon has now going to Fifteen dollars an hour and many other companies are following I are are following a the same formula or here's a quick question and that has to do with\nWages are now sort of picking up and look how long it took\nIn light of all of the corporations that over the last few years have made so much money in wages did not keep up even a little bit has it now reached the point where it looks like there is there some correlation\nHope so I mean we're finally seeing the commensurate wage growth to sort of you know coincide with the tremendous job growth we've seen for the last listen I Know it's been great and the Trump Administration but it was great the previous eight eight and a half years as well so so your point we're finally starting to see\nWhich grow which is really important but let me just say a couple things technology it's extraordinarily deflation area and we see technology tickled faster than maybe any time\nThat's true of this country and I'll tell you a flat out that\nMinimum wage raising it we can argue if it's good or bad Amazon going Fifteen dollars an hour but I don't think they did it out of the benevolence them because they wanted to serve their employees I think that was part of it but remember Jeff Bezos the founder and CEO of Amazon it's been under incredible scrutiny last\nSix months or so for not being nearly as benevolent charitable as he should be given as well I think this does a few things it gets them off the hook on that front\nAnd to your latter point it forces this competition\nTo act in kind if you don't think Wal Mart and target are not going to have to do similar or they could just not paying attention and that hurts them more than it hurts Amazon a thick Amazon has about six hundred thousand employees give or take\nWal Mart has about two point two million so Amazon can win that land war of raising wages and I think it a really good just\nWhat it really does it hurts their competition which in it and really help the Amazon\nOne of the things the administration are never talks about is a far far greater than a wages or competition a or even trade policy is the fact the technology is wiping out jobs faster than anything out there\nAnd here is the question and I don't know if you've kept up on this I Hope so\nAnd that is for example I'm assuming that uh the Amazon fulfillment houses these huge centers are they about as robot a size as you can be 'cause they still have a ... billion a employees or I don't think\nSo I think they could see further I think you're going to see further um [noise]\nI think technology is going to take hold even further I think there's a lot you're going to there's going to be a day where there's two people in these factories or or warehouses whatever you call on them and the rest of it as just run by machines without question I mean you're seeing if\nYou've seen it across the landscape and by the way you know everybody wants minimum wage should go up and again I don't want to go down this political rabbit hole but if you make McDonald's for example raise minimum wage what do you think they're going to do while they're going to say you know what\nLet's just put more of these key off saying instead of having people at the register you're just going to walk in the eye pad and you're going to order and we're going to limit eight forty percent of our workforce so you\nKnow there's unintended consequences of raising minimum wage and one of the things that does it just speeds up the use of technology I mean that's a longer conversation but I think that's where we're headed\nUh my wife and I were having a conversation last night about jobs that are no longer or will no longer being existence\nFor example just like legal secretary side as I started my practice every lawyer in a legal secretary no one does now a all everything is done on a work on word processing and they're very very few legal secretary filing is all done electronically\nAnd that's just my field or the field that ah that I had a when you talk about other uh companies or other uh feels ... for example retail is changed completely now when I go to the supermarket I I have not gone in one of those lines and probably two years\nBecause I self check out\nEvery single time and now in ah Ralph's as where I shop has a eight of those stations and they're always full people checking out like crazy and\nLook I understand that but for a couple things don't you miss the human interaction mean wasn't there's\nNo ... no you don't oh I Know I have here we're just we're no you don't know that but you don't yeah right you don't have\nHow many how many times have you asked a clerk at a supermarket out to dinner\nWell then I'm not asking them out to dinner but I'm asking how they are what's going on you have a little ... Kim it's a little bit you know it's it's you are losing human ... I Do but maybe I'm just a dinosaur Dina's that\nSelf check outs the first of all never work she always did it mean always things beep because you put it on the tray wrong and somebody comes over with their little key fob and they look at you cross eyed and you know exactly what I'm Talking about but that's where we're headed without question you want another another field that won't be around five ten years from now\nYou're talking about the trucking industry with all these you know or the autonomous vehicles and you know self driving cars how many truckers you think's going to be out of jobs in a decade that's going away as well\nYeah I imagine that the first uh uh uh the first non driver vehicles are are going to be in the truck department first auto automatic vehicles I think\nWithout question I mean if you think about it think about the cost savings\nFor these trucking companies if they can figure it out and and again one of the labor cost is a huge input cost if they can eliminate that it's a total score so if you don't think that they're scrambling trying to figure out that out you're just not paying attention so a lot of the jobs are going by the wayside good news for you is\nThey'll never make an artificial intelligence that can rival that bill handle um W. care five six forty AM the great white shark of the food chain\nYou guys have the job already stop it would you\nWho's laughing and about you know because everybody is so my producer Alex or because you're a fantastic suck up and you don't have to man I\nCan't even think of fat I'm none of those things I just call it like note is\nFine you know what to take the afternoon off go go and spend some time with your best friends are the retail clerks supermarket I have a good one guy will talk again where you take care alright coming out Saudi Arabia's play to get Trump off their backs\nAnd we'll see what Saudi Arabia is doing now in response to a backlash of the show ... murder this is KFI am six forty\nListens to KFI pocket a Kohl's grand that is a lot of marketing their next chance to win happens\nWithin twenty minutes\nOkay Angela and her radio station [noise] warm and\nWindy weather I'm Jennifer ...

Arabia to discuss the disappearance of a Washington Post journalist some told reporters at the White House lawn he's spoken with the Saudi king ...\nWant to get his his mind but it sounded to me like

Senate campaigns than almost anybody else these guys are very very slick they understand the system one hundred percent the president also saying you know we can't he's thinking we can't jump into this thing\nUh we have to or she is walking on eggshells and the reason is ah the jobs program in the defense budget president is a big fan of selling arms and Saudi Arabia is one of the premier buyer of American arms and he says wait and say we've got a hundred and ten billion dollar package here\nUh that we do not want Saudi Arabia to walk out I mean selling a hundred and ten ... a billion dollars worth of arms Saudi Arabia is no small deal and he said I don't want millions of people do put out of work well will be millions but certainly be tens of thousands\nA and raise a Raytheon Lockheed Martin other big defense contractors\nAre saying you know you gotta watch out on this we're going to lose a lot of people but there's another side of this and it's interesting ... ghost wrote an article saying you know don't get too excited about ah the Saudis threatening to pull their contracts first of all their contracts\nAnd second of all Saudi Arabia I didn't think about this until I read it and it's interest is very interesting way of looking at it\n[noise] Saudi Arabia has effect of le latched on to the United states is way of doing things the arms that it sells includes the training include to spare parts that it has includes ah everything\nAround American arms when it deals with its a defense industry you don't just switch that over to Russian\nArms that you buy your Chinese arms which is a complete pivot that's not so easy to do and they were going to look very carefully before doing that so what is the takeaway here well I think it's going to go by way of what the president said\nThat somehow it's going to be a rogue\nActors inside of the Saudi consulate and gee we didn't mean it and even though there's evidence and strong evidence that the Saudis have tried to set up sort of a sting operation to get cars show ... to go back to Saudi Arabia and to be arrested\nBecause ... has been a very strong opponent of the crown prince he actually used to be in
