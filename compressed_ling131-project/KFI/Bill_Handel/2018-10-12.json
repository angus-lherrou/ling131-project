a of of the banana itself so it becomes can retard these these fungi\nAre interesting James pretty cool\nThank you so much and thank you for the trivia that somewhere down the road in our lives somebody's going to be like did you know that there are thousands BCS a banana\nOr ... years ago [laughter] geez it ever going to talk do Monday you to go Dodgers go Dodgers absolutely I see you

with ABC's Jim Ryan Jim Happy Friday I guess the only thing that I can say is I'm Glad people are finally being honest about distracted driving\nWell maybe and then of course even if they're being honest you and you have to assume that these numbers are way low and the people maybe you're tracking it better just flat out why [laughter] a new study this is from\nDrivers that dot com they are an online drivers ed companies you can imagine that shows that are like fifty three percent of us are too poor or said admit to texting while behind the wheel that forty one percent say they do it while they're stuck in traffic so you're you're in a big traffic jam cars aren't moving\nThe grabbed the phone and you start looking at social media are checking your text messages or email whatever you might be doing there at the wheel this same studies show that about eight percent of drivers admit to watching Youtube videos\nBehind the wheel oh so benefit and worst gym\nYeah and I mean I think it's it's yes and my guilty of it I Would love to say that I'm not going to have the tickets to prove that I Am guilty of it and that when I got nailed for I was at a red light and so I was sitting there and I made the mistake of answering a text message and gotten nailed by a cop who was across from me at the intersection that I guess I didn't see 'cause I was distracted\nButton I I don't think I've ever gotten so far as to watch a video I mean that almost it seems like we're getting a ... in which we're using our phones is increasing\n[noise] well yeah exactly and and so or other dangerous behaviors that same survey looked at\nA alcohol about thirty four percent of drivers they that they are comfortable driving after they have one drink after tutoring Nineteen percent say they're comfortable driving that at some point you know it ... maybe a little more than two you're getting close to a lot of a whole level it says you shouldn't be driving adult than marijuana\nAbout ten percent of drivers to that over the last twelve months they have driven after either smoking more eating marijuana you ... and the and the you know a large percentage of most of Ninety percent say that they think that marijuana use is not as dangerous as alcohol consumption for drivers well they don't traffic studies show that that's just not the case\nYeah distracted distracted that's for sure are cops also I have they I Know that this was kind of a big issue when California legalize marijuana anyway costs are saying hey wait a minute we're kind of putting the cart before the the horse here because we don't really have a way\nTo say whether or not you are distracted because we don't have a barometer in which to measure marijuana use\nRight right whether it's impaired by alcohol or impaired by marijuana as you write to if you know the police departments have gotten used to testing people field sobriety tests for alcohol not so much for marijuana and that has been a problem law enforcement across the country has complained about that as more and more states\nHave legalized recreational marijuana or medical marijuana to start with ... and so it yeah that's it\nRemains problem a quick easy test for marijuana usage and how much you've had had an hour impaired you are because there have been obviously traffic accidents traffic fatalities attributed to marijuana use in places where it's been ...\nAnd I think too it's still kind of kicks my ... with the fact of how friendly super and left and you know still freaking taxis are that people still get behind the wheel after drinking\n[laughter] no you're right and those those things are available out there and there's super convenient\nAnd around the holidays you got the ... service or services that offer free rides to

no no no but after the fact they're they're instead of somewhere else maybe I I'm trying to get to something which is when this happens people like that\nOr if there's a way that the courts or

are no longer and are there are new and it's expensive stuff by the way it can be a what a what is it\nTwo hundred and fifty or a thousand yeah yeah because you have any court assessments on top of that because it could easily cost you a grand what I don't know what I'm not\nClear on is they say four hundred Ninety One people but they also say they do up to twenty four enforcement operations a month so it was just four hundred Ninety One people in one enforcement operation\nI don't know\nThey made ... sweets at the LA county fair four hundred and forty three citations just from that okay

to be known as but it is a part of a new structure of a border\nWall repairing offenses has now become part of the new border wall that replacement anymore and now it's called a border wall system\nA

these incidents we've seen where people are getting a cost it and the cops are being called on people who aren't actually doing anything wrong\nOr if you knew for a fact that somebody was illegal and you called ice than you have a there's a debate about it is that a good thing to do and you're not but the problem is you know it's going to happen\nEvery time anybody hear somebody speaking Spanish they're going to pick up the phone call I Would it's crazy All right uh last story which is so bizarre well or in the U.S immigration system they are now checking kid's teeth to see if they are adults

or by looking at the tee\nLewis is one of the controversies ... can you be yeah even a forensic dentist how can you really tell me we have an ... year old and an eight especially if you're talking about a matter of months and how much is this costing\nWell we don't know because they will not disclose how many of these assessments they're ordering every year and they're not disclosing how often they used to be in for\nA ban forensic dentists are not inexpensive because you've got it first of all the cost of the den is second of all it's a forensic dentists which I've never heard of incidentally I have no idea what a forensic dentist is other than doing stuff like this is a new one for me a and a ... but it works in horses so I don't know why it wouldn't work\nWith humans\nObviously I'm pushing the or the ... but ... is a I mean that's pretty ... actually it's pretty offensive stuff in this uh uh you're you're actually remind you of Nazi Germany that used by the caliber of figuring out a whether someone was quote subhuman or not by figuring out shapes of heads and\nLooking at teeth oh no it's ah it's pretty crazy stuff\nUh anyway it's offensive it's a no for

KFI station\n[noise]\nAnd I hear that by [noise]\nAm six forty handle here [noise] on a friday morning October the ... okay or it's going to be that would have spent a little bit differently I mean we'll get back to all the crazy stuff that happened kind yeah a\nAnd we've asked Thomas Guy who the friday so there's still plenty plenty of show so let's move over the world of earthquakes no we love earthquakes here in Southern California and a lot of people who are recent\nA residence or don't quite understand earthquakes\nAre a good healthy earthquake or is something that is really an amazing thing to feel\nAnd in bad cases to see so we've been talking about earthquake warning systems they haven't been Japan or they have in Mexico even and finally or getting ours and which was ridiculous because it's tens of millions of dollars\nIn a budget of two hundred billion dollars the state couldn't find thirty or forty million dollars for an earthquake warning system for God's sake All right so we're going to be putting money in and it is going to be the most modern in the world because obviously it will be the newest\nAnd an earthquake warning systems give us warnings of a few seconds twenty thirty seconds up to Ninety seconds\nAnd while doesn't seem like a lot I tell you can be a big lifesaver for example in Japan or when they had the big one what is it and that they had the earthquake warning system what happened the trains were able to slow down\nThe a major power system was able to shut down most of ah certainly the dangerous transformers where huge amounts of power or ... that normally are pushed out on the wires were reduced dramatically a it's a gives people a chance to dive under desks\nGives gives you a chance to take off your clothes and jumping into bed and have\nSex you could say the earth moved I've always felt for some reason always wanted to do that that's just something that just resonates with me so where's the downside of this well there is because the more sophisticated it is\nAh the more false alarms you get\nAnd here's a basic promise a premise about this the longer an earthquake last the stronger in generally is\nSo if you have a let's say ... and where do you put the line of where the earthquake a system comes into place is it a three point zero earthquake\nIs it a five earthquake\nBecause at a three point zero or let's say you're a three point four three point five there really isn't much damage\nAnd it becomes so sensitive well let me give you an example uh we're sitting here in the studio and there is a truck a good size Eighteen wheeler that rumbles passed and it feels like there's an earthquake\nJen you felt that here oh yeah yeah when you think oh my God and earthquake is coming and it's a truck so let's say you have a super sensitive earthquake alarm system well that's going to register as an earthquake so what does that mean we dive under the desk\nEverybody knows that there was an earthquake coming and all of a sudden you get a bunch of false readings which is what happens to one of the big problems is where at what point do you do you put the shaking of the earth\nAh at what level is the the seriousness magnitude before he kicks in\nThat site slightly stations are really interesting uh they go down about ten feet\nInto the ground imagine a a piling right you drill down a and it looks like a um oh what about five six feet across\nIs the whole that goes straight down about ten feet and at the bottom there is a concrete base on which the top of that is the sensor that measures the earth are starting to quake\nAnd it's a I have to tell you that when they work they work\nAnd they worked beautifully and are there are well for example what is it happening in Japan or the high speed rail they have that actually works didn't cost sixty five billion dollars a that's slowed down dramatically because if you have a ... if you have a train\nBy the California professional firefighter in

message rates may apply\nAlso ah on social media every day we put a new stuff up and uh got a lot of good things growing up today in the morning as we prepare to show a we think oh yeah that should go up yeah we should do something there and so every day there are so some find new stuff coming up\nAll right now a this business was sharing your DNA now I Am not in the least bit interested in finding out that I'm One quarter in you it not at all couldn't care less uh yet at the same time using the DNA that I don't\nWant to use you can find me which really pissed me off\nNew research shows it's sixty percent of white Americans can be identified using open genetic genealogy ... a genealogy databases same approach or they used to catch a Joseph James Dean Angelo or the Golden State killer decades or after he uh committed rapes and murders in the seventies and eighties\nAnd a according to a computer scientist at Columbia University who uh is a really involved in this stuff he says finding Mr and Mrs anonymous a killer long lost a loved one for example is not a fluke\nThis is not winning the lottery ticket this is very strong this technique so his team\nIs now urging companies you better create policies encryption whatever to prevent intimate digital data from being passed around in ways that we never even intended\nAh why here's how it works so someone provides DNA and one of these fun testing kids\nRight I Want to find out ah what my genealogy is ah my great great grandfather came over on Ellis Island or or was in the revolutionary war or whatever and I want to find out how and what and where and so I some distant relatives so someone who decides that\nHe's going to be providing their DNA one of these are companies a moderate what is it ancestry or my ancestry or twenty three and more whatever the hell they call these guys\nAnd then ah they start figuring out closer relatives so it's not a question of mailing you it's a let's say or the the costs are looking for you 'cause you're the suspect and they're going to have your DNA for example but let's say they have a third cousin\nRight who their DNA right and then they start in it it it doesn't match or they can't find you 'cause you're not in the database but they have your DNA say they have a judge someone scratch you for example during the course of rape hypothetically but your date DNA is not in the database the FBI\nDatabase so they start matching and they find out you have a third cousin and then they start putting it together All right how many customers do you have and then they go\nWell okay a cousin who is eighty six years old that lives on the east coast that scene in a wheelchair probably not but how much the cousin who is near the crime scene\nWas about the right age and the story just starts jelly and that's the way they do it\nAnd so it is a way of finding you out using this DNA and the stats are really really impressive\nA study led by a Stanford thirty percent of ... percent of people in law enforcement's forensic database can be linked to relatives in the consumer data bases there are two different databases won the consumer ones where you\nFind out your genealogy or find out how much percentage you have of ah being white Russian or\n... or say you're African and so the two combined you put those two together and all of a sudden\nYou've got a situation where your information is out there without you doing anything about it you have fallen cheered you haven't given a swab\nAnd uh this is really scary stuff so scientists that these scientists analyzed the database of one point two million anonymous individuals of European descent\nWho had used either my heritage or ancestry dot com or twenty three and me those are the ones and they found that sixty percent of them\nSome relative was found in the database whose DNA matched to the level at least a third cousin that is a sharing great great grandparents and that's that's is Ellie was what led to DeAngelis arrest his third cousin\nHad in fact gone on one of these genealogy bases that DNA a DNA companies right and so with that they were winning laid down\nFor about Fifteen Percent of the people are the closest relative was the second cousin sharing a great grandparents that makes it even easier\nTo come down a onto or figure out who the potential suspect is\nAnd then it just goes way beyond that let's say I'm a hermit and I don't want any information about me shared I don't believe in emails I I'm not going to get a Ralph's card\nI'm not going to have a credit card I just don't want any information I Choose to have my privacy protected one hundred percent good luck\nThey go to a genealogy a website figuring out who I Am there's all algorithms and next thing you know is Mr hermit is contacting would you like a credit card we know you don't have one\nAnd by the way there are three von shopping stores and a seven eleven a write in your area where you can go in shock\nWhen you buy gas even though with cash\nThank you go there and window broke he wrote a piece you go on\nYour ... or what a talent huh now they're going to be oh yeah by one of the more unusual showbiz characters are yesterday had a meeting at the White House ah with the president you know they're going to have lunch with President Trump and with that Jared Kushner army and\nThey were going to discuss a whole bunch of topics prison reform of what's going on in Chicago the Trump agenda I mean it went on and on and no normally I I ... I don't know of any other rapper that the president has had lunch with\nIn the world of showbiz but Tanya West is an ardent Trump supporter on Saturday Night live he wore the make America great hat getting nailed for that which\nI find very hypocritical on the part of the show biz liberals because anybody who stands up in his anti Trump ... it's open season\nThe more anti Trump they are in the media the more they are blood uh except when you have someone who is on Trump's side who used\nTo write it and that's kind of your west now of all the people that Trump could have on his side in showbiz\nI don't know it kind of us would be the first one I Would choose if I were in the Trump Administration why don't I don't know because maybe Kanye West is nuts that he is out of his mind he sort of ...\nHe's a funny one war maybe he's brilliant I was talking about this earlier maybe he's brilliant so\nIt was a there was a press conference suppressed gathering in the White House and there is Kenya west across from the president across his desk the resolute desk the president is a city where normally sits behind the desk Kanye West is in front of the desk\nOr in a chair I think Jim Brown was next to him a great football player Jim Brown a very quiet a very thoughtful man I interviewed and before\nI he's ah he he has some ... tossed him around canyon not so much so I there is a the root of the oval office for reporters and a question was asked\nAnd Kanye starts on a ten minute ramp\nAnd here are a couple of\nCuts uh then I Want to share with you and then maybe a quote or to\nReverse course if you're in the oval office or how does it feel so\nGood at it and they're good at it it's a great place\nYeah great energy it's a great place I why not you know that that's just one or and then uh after after the ramp but I Want to get to some of the quotes are on the ramp a here's what Trump said\n\nSee I Want to stay from anytime he wants\nSmart cookie smart and gets it and\nNow this was after a ten minute in sane ranch by the way a lot of it was uh talking about his hometown Chicago because of the murders in Chicago are at such an aide just incredibly horrible level and that was on the agenda for him to talk about you\nGot Levi the greatest genes company in the world making their jeans and a and Vietnam so we're going to need to get a few breaks to be able to have some places in my hometown of Chicago and to point seven million ... million surrounding suburbs where we can create some factory\nYour record for them to Detroit factories 'cause he's a master of industries a builder\nYeah no at that point I fully expected the president to get off of his chair slam his fist on the desk and go build or\nOh he didn't you know that's just me having fun and then there was an issue with education right came up because that was part of the conversation we need to put curriculum\nFor people who really came on the street now people who are just trying to set us up to go into it works is the more criticism that apply to what people are really going through\nHuh\nI had no idea that the school system set you up to go into the prison system now the education can be so bad that uh you might be through several steps you end up uh but uh I'd love that we need a curriculum that doesn't put you into the prison system\nOkay we sure as hell do why not uh and then ah let's not forget gun control\nWhat about on my arms with all the debate about the second amendment going on the following the legal or illegal guns of the problem na na na legal ... we have a right to bear arms\nRight now here's kind you're going right down the a gun advocates\nA month truck or the problem is uh that the the illegal guns are always the problem is I'm going to kill people it's a it's people that killed people although it takes people to actually pulled the trigger\nI've always wondered that are wondering how that didn't work\nUnless you have automatic trigger colors so people aren't involved\nBut ah there was a combination of a con you are going through what is pretty conservative Republican doctrine which sort of made sense all the way into the insane like out of

they're having a hard time getting to a lot of it\nBecause of the trees and the housing houses that exploded and are there is debris all over the road is he said uh it sometimes takes hours to move even a block down the street\nSo it's a pretty terrible stuff\nWell the first lady didn't interview with ABC and she says she's got more important things to think about then her husband's alleged affairs [laughter]\nYeah well it makes sense she said that right 'cause out what else is she going to say but I'm thinking there she is twenty four hours a day you know living her life goes to bed\nRight looks up at the ceiling before she falls asleep refuses to think\nAbout her husband's infidelity he's only thinks about her job as a first lady and what to do about barren and out of a

are being you are being sarcastic\nRight nah yeah I mean I ... yeah I'm being very sarcastic but I Am but at the same time would expect her to say\nWell of course she has to say she has said something along those lines and you you bet that line has been bandied about and do well thought out because every time she goes public you know she's going to be asked that question and here she is confronting its parade on as opposed to saying I don't want to talk about if you could say that\nOr it's not true you could say that\nYeah they said that there were no questions off the table and you knew that was going to have anything\nSo I it's just it's what she had to say although it's obviously not very plausible I I never think about it I don't have time to think about it okay\nI don't know did she ever I mean I Want to split the hairs but did she say I never think about it or was she simply saying I have more important things to think about\nThat is true I more important things to think about and do but the same time never even enters your mind\nWell maybe they had a conversation I always think about this they had to have had come to Jesus conversation about this maybe they did they both came to some sort of understanding and said okay this is going to be our agreement on that and I was on all of it\nIf it's President Trump you need to have come to ... that that's very funny about
