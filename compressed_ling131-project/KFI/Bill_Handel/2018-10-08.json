heavily weighing his best the lure attracts you right now ABC Jim Ryan them more than\nI could do I don't have that luxury I've got to come into the bureau although you know I can work from home if I needed to have done that in the past but I think it's still most Americans are still working from an office so only about seven percent of employers\nMake the option available to their employees but that number ... forty percent over the last five years the number of employers were offering that and there are some who are going all in the old computers for example it set a goal of\nHaving more than fifty percent of their workers working from home buddy or twenty twenty jumper they've already reached that goal now more than half of del workers do do the jobs from home\nNow is the case of we want to make this just easier on him our employees is this a case that we want to cut our overhead and have a smaller space therefore our people can just work from home is it what is it\nIt's all of those things are more you know there there are some companies fail notably it others have\nA sense of civic responsibility they want to get some cars off the road get some traffic out and to\nCut down on pollution is is one way to do it if you have fewer cars are people commuting by car or the old mass transit aside then you've you're able to cut into that somewhat\nSurveys have shown that workers are generally as productive if not more productive if they're doing their jobs from all because they're getting to work early or they're not spending half an hour an hour of trying to commute and then an hour getting home they're spending all that time being very productive\nThat can be a danger though Jennifer those same surveys have shown that uh you know people who they can suffer burn out if you are working in the place where you live because you simply can't get away from work then\nYeah absolutely because a lot of people go to work they put on their effort in at work and then the minute they leave at the you know they talk about you know leaving your work at the you know shutting the door leaving your work at the door kind of thing and then you go home and that seems to be such a place where you can relax and whatever but if you're works come in with you that might change the way that you look at your home\nAbsolutely that's why it's important to have one space for an office or\nThe one one place where you do your work at home the rest of the house is reserved for you as a home a place to live and get away from that so that yeah you're you're simply replacing that office building somewhere that somebody else owns or or rent a poor please inside your own host home but it should be counted as\nAs your your boss is base and what's your in your work and\nHas a company like Jell reported whether they have seen an increase in productivity or decrease or anything like that I assume increase if they're you know already getting their target goal when it comes to having their employees telecommute\nYeah there there have been surveys about that not by dealt with by other of outfits that have looked at this phenomenon is still fairly new of course are almost all the growth in self employment since two thousand five is among home based in corporate business but\nAlso people who work for outside companies and we're not talking about their home based businesses but if you work for\nA company or whatever that company might be but you do your job from all those numbers have been rising the and the ... and in that time and that last ten Fifteen Years or you've seen surveys done to do show the productive productivity in bend job satisfaction or equal to if not hire if you're working from home\nAll right thanks so much Jim or I didn't see later that's ABC's\nJim Ryan I like it I like to work from home thing I Would like to have an office so to me there are a lot of times when I think\nI can absolutely be doing this from home I Do part of my work at home I Do you know I Do the five hours on the air here and then I pretty much leave right after the show because in at night I go home and I do what I call my prep\nFor the show for the next day and that's another hour and a half you know two hours on a on a crazy night but I like it because it kind of it's just me it's just my alone time I do need to have a separate office that would probably be good instead of me getting on you know sitting on the couch getting distracted by the Dodgers game as might have been the case last night\nBut I Do like it just because it gives me the flexibility to do the work when I can do the work and then I really can focus on it and I say okay for the next hour and a half I you know usually don't turn on the TV I Do sit there and just work\nA and he is going to

taking a little bit about that later on Dodgers\nA is now game for the afternoon one thirty and a story about climate change and that's coming up at eight o'clock All right in the meantime back we go with a more mundane guy you're Donny our expert\nA guy\nOn a mattress from is the latest retailer to go bankrupt so we're seeing bankruptcies on the other on the one hand like crazy it's like meeting Skittles are so many of them uh yet at the same time other stores are doing just dynamite target for example is doing well warm Walmart of course a sewing and they have\nNot uh so what ... what's the difference between the two\nWell last year we had twenty I think last year twenty retailers filed for bankruptcy Toys R us was one of them Jim ... named a lot of names you know this year I think so far this year we've at twelve and mattress from being the latest\nYou know they have this is the bottom line there three thousand stores physical stores in the United states so they just have too many stores um they're going to try to shutter seven hundred of them they're going to try to re emerge from bankruptcy but\nThe bottom line is so many of these companies admits corporate Darwinism a lot of them never adopted and and the world pass them by and I think that's what you're saying by the way I don't think it's necessarily unhealthy I mean it's clearly not great if you're an employee of the farms that it's clearly not quit if you're a shareholder of these farms\nBut you know you have to adapt thick about fears holding fears\nWas where America shop for decades and she fears with Amazon before Amazon that the catalog and went out to the house you could sort of thumb through it\nThey just never figured out the digital was the way to go and unless you understand the changing marketplace the change in way consumers buy things you're gonna get left in the wayside and\n... going to take over again I might I might try to be glimpse here but that's really what it comes down to so there are we tell us that have figured out you mentioned a couple of them target obviously being one of them in the wall Mart and there are a few others but these anchors stores and these sort of malls that the stores that live in the strip malls\nThat are in visited by people are being left at the wayside\nYou mentioned a three thousand stores and immediately out what comes to mind that I'm questioning this\nI it may not be mismanagement on a day to day basis it may have been a management\nUh opening so many stores and if the storm made even a little bit of money they would keep the store opened and ally versus highly performing stores where everything else is just shut down that makes sense\nI think it does make sense I think you constantly I mean I'm not going to use I mean this is a good example not a great example but Goldman Sachs is sort of the gold standard of of of Wall Street but every year the bottom Fifteen Percent of their employee base gets\nGets down basically and that's every single year they do an evaluation now they may be very qualified people but they're constantly trying to evolve and they're constantly trying to make themselves better and I I Can't speak\nA ... and in prose about mattress from it I'm not that well versed but what I Will say is to your point\nThey never really took a hard look at their business and then in today's world things go very quickly and the world passes you by extraordinarily quickly and I'm sure you've seen out there in California you know go by mattress for them it's not like people are lining up to walk in\n... by the way if you have any questions regarding mattresses\nIn general or I can spend a good long time telling you about what works and doesn't work in the world of mattresses ... yeah I ... that's not a problem it's just one of those are the mattress companies out there is so strange businesses say the least we ...\nBack issues so you need to you know you need to be on top of the the\nL O L it's I'm not going to mention the folks that I Do a commercial for sleep number back but I Will be more than happy to talk about business in general and then the other issues the malls are moles dying and I've done a couple of stories saying that\nIf they don't go the route of Disneyland effectively their dad is that it does that make sense\nYes I mean there are some malls that will there something more obvious in this country that are going to do well regardless mall of America and Minnesota this one out by me it's just there's certain moles that will do well however the majority of these places have to figure it out how do you get people into these mall the anchor stores\nAre clearly not doing it obviously the fears is not helping JC Penney's not helping\n'em to a certain extent Macy's is not helping anything stores so they have to figure it out what do they do they're going to have carnival rides are they going to have a entertainment I mean I don't know what the answer is but they better figure it out because now\nVacancy rates are about ... a little over nine percent\nAnd that's the highest level with the un and basically ten years you know again people you know people just are not going to the mall you gotta get bodies in these places and it's not happening for the majority of the malls in the United states and they're dying not necessarily a slow death it's actually happening very quickly\nI I was just in Dubai a few months to go with that mall that has the indoor\nOn a ski a ski facility\nWhere a hundred and ten degrees outside you go inside them all and you can actually ski ... now is one of the dumbest thing I've ever seen I tell them anything\nBut to your point though they're trying to they're trying to get you in there and he was ruined the mall of America their their carnival rides the Ferris wheels a roller coasters again you can you set it yourself or they have to be more like Disney World and maybe they do All right I mean but as crazy as that sounds\nYou know it makes no sense in the world is going to the store is just\nBoring there's not much there especially when you go on the Internet it's in your home and then turn around
