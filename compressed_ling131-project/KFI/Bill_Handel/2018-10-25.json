same room with me here to cancelling\n[laughter] why definitely about oh definitely mentioned that oh highlighted my career\n[laughter] All right we'll go with that [laughter] yeah Jason let me ask you a question why does anyone need to be paid twenty six and a half million dollars to make believe on TV\nWell no one needs to be paid that but it sure is nice to get it and one of the reasons you do get that kinda money is your show it's the talk show on TV we're talking about the big bang theory and the new Forbes List of the top paid ... guys guys on TV\nAnd the cats are the big bang theory pick up four of the top five spots were talking about Jim Parsons at first uh who's been on the top of the list a for a couple of years now twenty six and a half million dollars for him that includes the big bang theory money and is young Sheldon money\n'cause he's executive producer on that voice guy on that so you get\nTwenty six and a half million Johnny go like east coast are right behind them with twenty five million and the other two guys on the show on there and Simon Halbert their third and fourth with twenty three and a half million and like I said they you know they are not because of the show on\nWhat was your back in the day in the nineties when I think I first heard about that sort of stuff when all the cast of friends they banded together to hold out for it but I think it was like a million or something like that but that episode but\nThat was for episode and that's you know I mean I guess you look at an inflation is is Twenty years later and that's what these guys were getting was a million dollars per episode they're making this money by the way they took a pay cut\nLast year the final season\nOf the big bang theory they weren't getting a million dollars an episode it's now down to a measly nine hundred thousand dollars per episode so you know they need a little extra little money and the lord shall love I guess they're not\nNot to mention all the words these are still going to get even after the show's drawn\nYes a hundred percent the show's gonna keep paying them for for quite a while now and and I remember also so there there was the top four or five on that list that's just the guys with the list of the women isn't even out yet and there's another three women from the show who are definitely going to be at the top of that list as well oh\nSo it's not a mixture is just a man I was wondering why there were no ladies on this list separate um what's the point is that right now they\nFormed says that they've been doing that for a long time because there is a disparity it's better on TV because especially because they've all negotiated together so they're\nAll going to be making around the same amount of money when you look at the movie list I mean not usually a huge difference do you have like the rock with a hundred and fifty million and on the women's\nList it's like a scarlet Johanson with like fifty million or something if it's there is a big difference there and I think it helps point that out and you know that's one of the things in Hollywood they're trying to change\nWill speaking of highly paid women ...\nExactly how long do you think it'll be and exactly how does NBC get rid of Megan Kelly altogether [laughter] yeah\nI mean this is this is a really turned in the last day or so since the black race comments on Tuesday show and then she apologized to embassy staff that night and then on the show yesterday but the the everybody on NBC really went in on the nightly news of the today show itself out broker came on and\nFrom that pretty strongly that she owes a bigger apology to folks of color across the country that was yesterday and she started her show yesterday with an apology\nBut in the past twenty four hours things have moved very quickly several reports\nThat she has been dropped by her agency a child that was going to make a move anyway but that to UGA but that apparently is not going to happen now ah and that actually lowered up she's got well high powered Hollywood lawyer to come in and you know supposedly negotiate her accent there\nSomething that a couple of these articles said that they've been talking about for a while a different role for her at least\nA Entertainment Weekly says ah and I don't know if this just being time but we begin discussions earlier this month about a different role with NBC News and making because she wanted to be more involved in political coverage in a deeper way that she can do at nine AM which is nice\nBut she wants to delve more into politics\nI guess which is what she was doing a lot more of at Fox and on this show on the ... making show at nine AM she's gotten in trouble for more things that have nothing to do with politics I mean you have this which is which is race but they were talking about uh you know kind of TV celebrities in Halloween costumes [noise]\nUh she got in trouble for ... for a dream Jane Fonda interview asking her what some team was kind of inappropriate question [noise]\nUm but now at this point I don't know if they can move forward with her at all it seems like everybody's moving away from her and you you said speaking of money she's got a huge contract there twenty three million a year reportedly for three years [noise] totally sixty nine million dollars\nSo either they're just gonna have to pay or out on that or or you know the sticker somewhere else where she can't make\nAny way and when they pulled her the embassy in the first place and definitely tried to soften her up and how to do things that weren't so I guess Fox Fox News channel or yeah I I\nGot to say I don't know how she was personally but she just always seems so uncomfortable now place doing the softer stuff it just was not in her wheel house\nIt really I mean it really wasn't in the show's ratings kind of reflect that they've never really been great a and a lot of people at NBC\nSet with are coming over from Fox News they ... they felt that you know she just didn't really fit in there and you're right you know the the softer stuff maybe isn't really hurt thing uh but they've kept her on for quite a while now even though the ratings haven't been great now they've got to find some kind of exit plan and it seems like that\nOn probation or much okay he stood up it's a double hit okay fair enough and Mike you're supposed to be here what a week and a half Yes sir if all goes well depending on the probationary I didn't know I didn't know you around that long yeah I was here the the week that uh KFI

election and what's\nTalk more about that there's some stats I Want to share with you to give you a reality check and how this could easily be dealt with a matter of fact there may very well be the facilities right now to deal with it and I'll I'll go into that a as a later on what time are we doing that ah\nYeah Caribbean stuff I'm doing that here we go nine twenty alright nine twenty climbing up\nFacilities to handle this kind of a situation the largest provider of shelters for immigrant children in the U.S has surrendered to live their licenses [noise]\nNow fighting each facility has to be licensed yes separately yeah you don't get a blanket license where I Want a bunch so they're called southwest key\nAnd they run shelters in Texas and Arizona and or the shelter\nIn Phoenix they run in one in Youngstown a they had to give up their license and pay a fine you wanna know why\nThey didn't have background check information on the people working there they were not providing anything resembling adequate health care so uh they have agreed to a whole bunch of stuff they're gonna have to do now including hiring a third party healthcare consultant\nYeah and I guess actually doing background checks because there were a lot of complaints that these kids were getting a sexually abused by staff\nSo this is the Arizona department of health it's interesting that that how a who's running these checks because we've been hearing more recently in San Bernardino there was a big check out there where they got fined as well someone died and\nOne of these things are being rushed to be built yeah and contracts are being rushed to be signed because there's such an influx of these kids that are separated for their parents\nOr one of President Trump's foundational back pets is not holding up as the stock market keeps dropping\nDown and write another uh six hundred points or wiping out again\nWhen he Eighteen that's that's gone Merrick and even right now yeah but you know you're okay now here is with the president's doing as every president does when the stock\nMarket goes up like a dead it's the credit to the president's seat when it tanks like this it's not his fault\nIt's the feds fault it's whoever's fault China's fault it's whatever it is so he is doing nothing more what he won't be touting his how great the economy or the stock market is kind of me still on fire unemployment's in great shape uh but uh\nAnd is this the start of because we're due for a correction we have just we're in the biggest market in the history of the United states a longest bull market you know what goes up can't keep going up\nAlthough investors and people think it will remember the housing crisis in ... new never drops\nWell maybe you know we weren't does drop\n[noise] account already how yeah but it's how how sales are falling that's the headline\nDown almost Eighteen percent that here in the five county LA metro area the biggest drop since October twenty or hand which was a during the great recession as we now call it right\nOrange County twenty two percent yeah drop in sales and\nYou know what they're saying it's largely because of the tax cut plan that makes it less financially advantageous to buy a house because you're going to be limited on your property tax deduction for mortgage interest deduction we all of it you're though I Know people who are renting or like you know when all the time ... so its sales fall\nDon't ISIS shouldn't price Asia it'll have start to come down to bail happen\nBut still a the price of as this fell the price of homes still wind up median home in LA county that's a midpoint of the sales six hundred and thirty five thousand dollars San Bernardino three hundred thousand or in that every hundred that includes a visit to Dr ... and ... on Orange County\nEight hundred and twenty five thousand dollars median price for home I was able to afford that that's also the county where sales fell the most yeah ...\nSo there's a lot of these people are are self sort of side lining from buying houses and stuff like that I was gonna ask you about with the stock market with the kind of going down and how media and the presents himself talk about they'll take they'll take the credit for when it's good and then blame when it's bad do you think\nWith with stuff like this where people have sort of holding off buying houses that they're more wise to the fluctuations in the market\nWell they're just a prescient because I think they have a I have an idea of what's going\nTo ... and two thousand it wasn't that far ... well not long ago\nTen years although that's a lifetime a in terms of memories because you have millennials that it's the history of like the assassination of Abraham Lincoln they just read about it in the history books are okay\nI Do one more limited one has waited one more ah did the city of chapter get shafted on the bullet train [noise]\nWell they got federal [noise] they settled their lawsuit with the rail authority and\nWe don't really know how much money is involved other than the rail authority has to reimburse the city for two hundred thousand dollars worth of staff time and that's because they sued a under the environmental quality act I mean you say you're not doing the right guy who is your take on the trains are already do crazy here's the thing\nSo this lawsuit settled there still fix more the rail authority has to deal with and now a project on the environmental side and you're not\nCounting the or you're a you're interfering you're well there's one that says that you are in\nViolation of uh what was the prompt ten that paid for all of this yep Seventy seven billion dollars now way way overrun delays cost and this is my favorite\nThe hundred and fourteen miles segment it's going to open up right and that's billions of dollars\nFresno to Bakersfield and how crowded is that going to be that's going to be it's going to be like a New York city subway during the day I'm going to be two guys might build off I don't so many people go from Fresno to Bakersfield All right uh coming up Erin ... the latest\nOn those suspicious packages this is a KFI am six forty [noise] think you can win\nI Am from Reno valley and I just want a thousand dollars by\nHoly crap you can with your next shot at a thousand dollars on KFI is coming up within twenty minutes okay bass than her radio station\nThat number grows disturbingly [noise] I'm Michael ... from the KFI twenty four hour news ... three more suspicious package have shown up in Delaware and New York city the packages were address two of them now being confirmed a two former vice president Biden or want it to the actor Robert Deniro\nThe packages a official said look like the others sent to CNN\nAnd other prominent Democrats around the country yesterday\nGeorge Soros earlier in the week an FBI I live in Virginia has been inspecting all of them some packages contain bombs made of PVC pipe stuffed with powder and glass\nTwo of them were addressed to yesterday were dressed in LA democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters one was sent to Washington DC and the other was stopped at a male facility in South LA LA county sheriff Jim McDonnell called it pathetic\nAnybody anybody anywhere in the chain of custody of this uh these packages to potentially be a\nBe a casualty of of\nThe package sent to the congresswoman was clear by an LAPD bomb squad and then handed over to the FBI cops in LA's rampart neighborhoods say they have caught up with some reaching burglars police say a crew of four men made their marked by snatching stuff through windows Russell manning says his home was hit in the middle of the night and\nThese guys caused it through our second storey window\nAnd stole two guitars and a purse\nDetectives have linked them into Nineteen burglaries investigators say the crew probably hit other homes as well police that they found guns\nAnd extended magazines during a search last week a new housing complex and among take for low income families and homeless veterans has considerably more applicants than units available city manager Alex Hamilton says if local governments in the entire region tried to fill all of the low income housing need\nWe need some like six hundred thousand units just to meet the demand so but you can't think like that you got to do it one step at a time and just try and chip away at it and that's what we're trying to do\nGo again to the image or a description of come on if you're going to do that at least spell the names correctly\nKnow it but it's an interesting point you raised because ... and and and as well the sophistication and and and that's the big question right could these bombs have gone off or or whether we're they somehow\nMeant to scare law enforcement officials currently believe they were meant to go off and they were rudimentary and the packaging had the misspelling and\nThat that that you know some of this may have been intentional humor this could have been designed to throw investigators off the trail they they just don't know the the bombs themselves were\nFairly rudimentary but but had all the components of workable devices and so the the fear is that they could have gone off and and thankfully they did not reach their intended target and and those that they did reach a were not harmed\nYeah I don't want to get into an ... a discussion here by an IRS my point like you to comment on this or I have heard law enforcement authorities college uh amateurish which then leads to it's going to be easier to find that person because we're just not talking about a very bright person or at least that's my take on it\nNow matter of fact you write that's my take on that interested in your too\nSo now a let's go on and talk about the uh the victims right the targets shawl all liberals so I'm assuming assuming that every single democratic\nA congressperson senator everybody in government has been put down a warning has been issued by the FBI saying you've got to be really careful and look what's been happening\nIn fact we just learned that the former President Carter has been warned but he too could be a target and has been told to watches metal carefully\nAnd and so I think anyone who fits that description of prominent Democrat or or particularly someone who has come under criticism by President Trump is certainly mindful but I think the good news is that in the case of the the the most prominent Democrat to get protection [laughter]\nThe screening methods worked you know the mail did not get to Hillary Clinton or to ... or to Maxine Waters of because of the way their mail is is screen and the other cases um the the police are going to be interested in how the packages arrived in ... and in fact [noise]\nBill I just got word from a source about the CNN package it was sent by the u._s. mail to one of the post offices here in the city\nAnd then a routine private carrier pickup for delivery of all male at the site goes to CNN [noise] um and and so at least the YPG can talk to the courier if they want to they can perhaps trying to isolate where the package originated and the postal inspectors are going to be on that uh you know for the foreseeable future\nYeah I Do you know careful careful careful just by the way it used to let you know a little bit about how we work here I Am KFI whenever I get a package it's handed to an intern to go down the hall open a and that's just a matter of policy I just wonder what you know airing a thank you a bill we will talk again right coming up white nationalist\nI have been arrested in Los Angeles and we're talking about these guys are crazy for just in Charlotte I this up so it's a it's a bad group

I don't need I think to know what black people think about black face in the history of black because it is universally understood by almost any decent person as being terrible\nI'd like to know what a black person thinks about a white pride well Sara Lee dressing up as a celebrity and using makeup\nI Will tell you why on their face I'll tell you right now it's offensive because of the historical context shouldn't do it under any circumstances at all and I was talking to a more as a matter of fact ah who is African American here at the station and I once asked him I said is the N.\nWord ever appropriate he said never at under any circumstances and I gave them an example I said let's say a somewhat attempted to kill President Obama and pulled out a gun and said I'm going to kill you you and word that I ever use that word in context to Cody goes absolutely not\nAbsolutely not so I Would have\nTo say I'm going to kill you you n word he goes that's correct\nSo when you were reporting on the University of what was said right at the point I'm making is that that African Americans are certainly all the ones I Know\nI take that and they simply you use that word you're drawing the line that's it you cross the line and it doesn't matter context doesn't matter intend it doesn't matter ... looking at it and the dictionary\nAnd saying I'm looking let's look up to or black face oh that's it you're done\nAnd so here I Am a uh and I'm saying I I don't think that making Kelly should have been fired mhm or should've even gotten in trouble or because of the context and what she said I think she could be corrected\nI think she could say uh you know what I just used the wrong word that's it I mean he apologized for using something out of context by the way I I Will probably be not be here tomorrow for defending Megan Kelly I just want to let you know I fully expect a suspension and so uh just\nTrying to you know I I think there's I just I Do think there's more to it than just words because she's still she she as a white woman was saying there's no problem with a white woman dressing up like a black person in darkening their face that's right that it that is a debate\nAt first of all is it a debate is do we as white people even have the rice\nThe there's a point to there's a point do we as wide as see they're already at All right so if I wanted to dress up because we don't mean to harm it's therefore if I Want to dress up as a President Obama during his tenure I'm done I'm ... I I Know ... rode\nOut like you can make this point about why ... and I and I and what I'm trying to do is is see it from a black person's perspective which I can never do but you want to dress up as president Brock Obama\nWhy do you have to make your face start because if you want to like where's and why and and put up and right I get home court podium you know the president's ... and ran out on that front of you may not identify in kind of\nGood for you have a All right now let's talk about ah the bombs and now what happens so at this point we have these eight or nine bombs that are out there and they all are a plastic bombs\nWith a debt Nader's and we're being told their ... barely amateurish what does that\nTell you as a bomb expert\n[noise] okay so uh I I used to command the kind of terrorism division here in LA uh we had bomb packed dealt with these issues all the time\nUm this is very unusual I mean you've got nine devices that are out there now they appear to be assembled and deployed in a very amateurish way or the by\nA PVC pipe um apparently there's some batteries or the power pack and very light it it almost looked like it wasn't going to go off well none of them went off but it's almost like they didn't want them to go walk 'em they contain material that are very different than most pipe bombs that people deployed to to to you know wreak havoc to kill people\nSo you tend to wonder if they didn't go off and they're built in a way that looks to amateurish\nThey were they were sent to people that were just so obvious as far as uh you know people doing battle with President you start to wonder why is that why did they constructed this way and do it this way where they didn't go off is there a different message other than sending these bombs to people\nHoping that you know they were going to get killed or harmed I mean so that's the big question that the investigation is looking\nSo Steve let me interrupt for just a moment are based on what you just said I Do they bring in profile or to try to figure out why and how the circumstances work in exactly the methodology here are you in it and if they do do they bring them in this early\nOh yes absolutely they are bringing the profile during their profile is are in there\nThey um and and there's probably a couple of different ... like the the first an obvious profile that most of us were were thinking about when this all started to break it you know somebody who um it does not like I'm all of these victims positions and and their narrative that you know when they get up and speak\nYou know so we're looking at maybe a suspect there's stuff that that is anti a President Obama anti Democrat anti you know a liberal positions and someone\nWell when you when you have these ... these bombs to point and they're not going off\nAnd you know the behavioral analysis would will look at that and they'll say okay there is that one but maybe there's another profiles somebody else who's not necessarily trying to hurt these people but they're looking at how are we going to influence the political agenda especially with the election coming up so and and there may even be another type of profile that they are developing\nI'm an ... so it may not just be what most people are probably thinking a white supremacist or not it might be somebody else that just not happy with the political atmosphere in our country\nWould you be at all surprised if or whoever sent these bombs is already on the FBI a radar\nI wouldn't be surprised and and here's why not only the ... this is clearly somebody who understand bomb making and we got a lot of people out there that the bureau's looking at a whether they are um you know into a bomb making into um explosive material maybe they're into a you know they they make gun\nYou know a lot of gun makers out there that are also interested in explosive and so on their all into 'em relocating ammunition so they deal with a lot of those types of materials that could also be used in bomb making ... you also have a lot of people out there that go to like home depot and some of these other stores that purchased chemicals in certain type of material that\nJust by themselves are not against the law but when you put those together that you know that's a big problem and\nYou know potentially so you know the bureau and the joint terrorism task force LAPD sure all the local agencies were were on the alert for that we've been on the alert for that for many many years especially after nine eleven so uh so that's something that you know the person or persons that are doing it they may already be on the radar\nAlright I seem to put you on hold for a minute I Want to come back and I've got a few more questions to ask Anthony ...

Democrats\nAnd so are there the FBI trying to figure out\nI Would say there are all Americans\nThat too\nThere's a reason that's not that doesn't help the FBI around them out of though and closure there there's the ... that is the reason you're not here in the mornings point that out and stuff like that nation\nRevoke a move on okay okay that's it not a yeah\nPresident Trump says the reason America as angry as because of me\nSaying now now now now that is the reason for all of the anger the divisiveness in this\nCountry and of course not him he has nothing to do with it it's the news media\nA match to blame here well of course this news media to blame here our news media is responsible for all the genocides that are going around the world that responsible for all of the friction we have with other countries and um there is and I love is a White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended his comments\nThat he made about media\nSaying that the president has condemned the violence in all forms he has done that by day one\nOh yeah well how about his statement saying the media is at fault the president has uh the condemn violence in all forms well how about\nWhen he said that you love the fact that one of his supporters body slammed a reporter the president condemns violence in all forms I mean what else is going to say with that one\n[laughter]\nThat's the problem there is no reality here there's nothing in his White House it's a it's ... here's a question even his supporters I'm Talking to a couple of his supporters um when I say can you believe anything says they say no\nNo no you you know what he's going to say is the basic leaders at least a fifty fifty if not more of a chance there's just not true\n... middle Easterners terrorists in the caravan we know that for you but there are well how about the proof while we have no proof\nI agree there's no proof but but they could be there okay what do you do with that\nThe cognitive dissonance between him being at the White House yesterday and condemning all anger and the threats of violence and then last night at a campaign rally kind of\nLaughing about it go figure\nThe first ever I her radio broadcast toward to show your support for your phone now if I Walk out for a guy\nYou can leave this off your singles ads I like dinners and walks on the bench you know why we all do the same kind of my junior ... weeknight fix on camp [laughter]\n\n\nCan't buy into here it is a survey October twenty five years we continue handling the news late addition no coming up nine o'clock and do something we almost never do take phone calls and this has to do with Megan Kelly used the word\nAnd I think also or whether or not the appropriateness of whether or not a white person could ever dress up as a black person for Halloween\nOr under any circumstances has to do with that ah that's of course you want black people answer I think so you think one black person is going to say it's okay uh yeah we'll find one\nThat I see there you go assuming there that sometimes to me that black people are just a minute let's not at all and everybody thinks I like are they all have exactly the same opinions about everything\nWould be a question yeah also a real quick maybe we'll do a topic on this I Am of with a sidebar story of the bomb scare is a you know a Donald Trump has talked about the president talked about the divisiveness is in this country the polarization and it's\nThe media's fault and ah that's that's who's causing the problem and uh we're just looking up at the two screens we have CNN and Fox two different headlines of course to different takes one hundred percent and a waiting pointed out this they're both the media\nAnd uh I think what Fox a wealth CNN says Trump attacks media amid growing bomb investigation that was that that comment and a CNN I says Trump calls on media to not to set a simple tone there\nAmong the ... uh about this scare set of civil tone not report it\nRight the media is a ... I guess it's simply reporting this is what's happened ABCD and eat and that alone is a I imagine not setting a civil tone I don't understand that I truly don't I just don't get where any of this is going I don't want to even be ... you\nGet certainly that Fox News has a spin and CNN has a spin\nYes absolutely uh but uh in this case uh CNN or saying Trump attacks the media he attacked the media that is a factual issue he said the media is at fault\nFor this polarization fake news that's what's at fault course not him or not supporters I mean it's the media well in the case of the bomb scare in what Donald Trump said yesterday about it and been blaming the media would more than just reporting if they'd done\nWhat more than just straight out reporting the facts at CNN do and\nI don't know the answer to that\nPart of the you know a part of the problem is that you have ... and his true both Fox News and CNN there ostensibly news channels and they're not a lot of their content is and and that neither of them are trying to fool anybody about this a lot of their content his commentary\nThey are trained and obviously commentary is going to come with a point of view and a slant\nWell the the point is they are trying to fool us because they are calling themselves that news outlet objective fair and balanced a on Fox CNN uh analysis a and I'll tell you who I doesn't lie about that\nWe we don't lie we our opinion we are not factual well sometimes we're facts\nWell sometimes a procedure would just make it up of course a but it is\nI think ... and I think MSNBC is very honest to end its approach because it's so wildly asked liberal that no one at all ... ... can construe MSNBC as a news outlet that's impossible All right uh let's move on speaking of polarizing\nOh thank you because no one's surprised the stabbed another dude at a research station in the Antarctic\nGot them may couple of Russians and one guy just went crazy pensions in a confined space so we went ahead and stabbed his buddy another researcher and the Russians are set is because he basically went crazy and then they went the only thing I point out is uh I'm assuming\nThat wherever he was stab there was a lot of swelling so no one had to say let's get some ice and put it on him\nThat was wonderful I enjoyed that can Alison I couldn't I was like oh\nHere's a creepy story that is unfortunately also true to middle school girls in Florida have been accused of planning to kill their classmates and drink their blood room\nAnd it's a legitimate snoring is happening or there are ... eleven and twelve apparently they were watching horror movies and they came up with this idea here's what they want it to do\nThey would stake out the school bathroom they would wait for smaller students to go in\nThis is all coming from the police affidavit they would cut the throats cut up their bodies eat their flesh drink their blood and then kill themselves\nThey wanted to go to hell to be with Satan [noise] [noise] [noise] and to make sure because you said well why not just kill yourself they wanted to make sure they would go to hell\nSo first we kill a bunch of innocent people then we're sure to go to hell and be with our buddy saying I'm willing to back that they did find them on campus with nine eight crazy cutter and a nice sharp and now there's their attorney sound like below it goes up pizza cutter like the ... and\nAh yes yes they borrowed the saw from uh like I Know you're out of your own though [noise] talking about Halloween here's a story some sex offenders are invited to a Halloween party they\nBy the\nMayor Gary Jones\nIs revealed the plan to keep twenty five to thirty local broiled sex offenders under a law enforcement officers eyes at city hall for three hours that may be a problem\nThat's look on what I see I understand it and I'm not my nose is not bent out of joint that this is the worst thing\nThat I've ever heard of it is completely illegal [laughter] you know and love now a lot of these predators during Halloween and this is part of their sentencing or in the registration as sex offenders lifetime sex offenders during Halloween they cannot answer the door mhm they cannot have their porch lights on\nThey certainly can't have candy in other words they have to uh they have to make it seem as if nobody is home as much as possible and steam Gregory yes see Gregory every Halloween goes out with the police tax taskforce\nOr looking for people who violate that looking for men who violate that what's it called like operation like candy corn or something like ... different different I mean this happens in a lot of different cities and he does a very large things in different places you know\nBut it's a and Steve has some of the most amazing audio when he throws a microphone in front of people's faces my favorite one was a a guy who did open the door\nAnd a which is illegal and he had candy in his house at the other thing you can't have candy bars anything in the house and Steve sticks a microphone in his face as he's being arrested handcuffed and said ah see\nRagweed from KFI radio and the guy literally said KFI radio now this is while he's
