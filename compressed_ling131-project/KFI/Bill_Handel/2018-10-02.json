part that you get this thing just change has been a two minute originally the president said as well as Republicans as we're going to limited to just the allegations of ah ah Christine Blasey Ford\nThin and expanded to the allegations of at least the true\nI think even the three now a women uh then it had to do with only people that were mentioned\nUh in that hearing ... and that's what the president an initial we order that's the information we got now it is wide open the FBI can go where everybody wants to investigate these allegations whatever you find you fine but it has to be done by friday\nAnd here is the question I have one of the FBI comes back and says we need more time to investigate this I don't even know if they do that because the FBI say here's what we have\nThat's it so Thursday night they produce a report to the committee\nOr they say they produce report anyway and they note that we need more time to fully investigate this don't know at this point my guess is they probably could do it in a week is just a matter of how many agency put on it\nYou put enough agents on this site you can have an investigation done it probably five hours with everybody in the FBI on top of this so I think it can be done and I'm assuming they're going balls to the wall on this that's the assumption\nAnd we'll see if there's anything there\nThe vote is scheduled for friday\nIt's a procedural vote that then brings the actual vote on the floors or early next week which is the quickest they will happen and uh that's what Mitch McConnell is going as

to go through the props I guess is going to be every Tuesday\nRight yet every Tuesday until November ... okay uh we're going to go through the various propositions now propositions are kind of fun for a couple of reasons propositions literally the only way that the electorate can go directly to the ballot\nUsually of course you have to go through your legislate legislature tour but this gives the opportunity for the electorate to go through it used to be and the reason that we've done this historically is when proposition started at the turn of the last century the legislature was so corrupt\nThat there had to be a mechanism to bypass the legislature and here came propositions putting uh the various measures directly on the ballot now is there anything wrong with propositions there's everything wrong with propositions\nFirst of all they are written in such a way they can't be understood\nMeant that you don't have legislation not be understood but at least professionals write the legislation\nYou're talking about legislative analysts veteran each office\nA senator side you have in the simply people write legislation here in California and these are professionals that do this and they actually sit down and think about unintended consequences their hearings hopefully\nAnd it's well thought out where as much as possible with propositions nothing's thought out\nIts let's just fun up there and then we'll get these various interest groups to start paying money\nAnd then two things happen when the ad starting and it's all about advertising by the way the whole thing is about add money you're starting to hear more and more here on KFI TV is already inundated with ah\nStops and that is two things you have to take the bank one is they're all liars\nWhen someone says this is for the tax payer one side it actually is against the taxpayer when one side says this is for the kids it's not for the kids it's for the teachers\nWhen one side says this is for the roads it's not for the roads All right so that's\nNumber one always though that the people that push the props are liars they're the ones that come up with the names of the propositions\nWhich are always uh always convoluted are and are affected we say the other side let's try to come up with something or they write them so you can't understand them and on top of that the unintended consequences go crazy All right the first two are actually pretty clear\nYeah it's just going to sound like a real estate agent that\nDoesn't make any sense real estate agents don't make sense of the

I'll be doing this every Tuesday until the election this is ... too and it has to do with housing now ... she was kind of an interesting one because it really doesn't pay we're not really borrowing more money we're taking money that we've already borrowed and moving yet from existing mental health programs\nOr to build housing and mental health services\nFor uh people\nWho don't have the kind of coordinated services that according to the ... to people they should have some really just lose money around\nAnd what they're arguing is ah you take money from existing health programs mental health programs you moving over here and it's a better use of the money\nBecause we really don't have any comprehensive mental health programs are not only housing but also jobs also in any kind of rehab that's necessary a support staff it's a social work staff that sort of thing\nSo a ... to ... to the folks who are in favor a will help establish and strengthen partnerships between doctors law enforcement mental health officials et cetera so how about the folks that are against prop to this is a harder argument because it's not any additional money\nWell the argument is it takes billions of dollars away from our loved ones and rewards developers and bureaucrats\nYeah whenever you build anything or it's developers who do it yeah kind of hard to understand because the government can't build on its own\nThere are very few government contractors out there the government our sources buildings so therefore bureaucrats or excuse me developers and here's the other situation\nThat is and this was always the argument you hear this on prop commercials all the time don't put money in the hands of eight and the bureaucrats because just another agency it's a bureaucratic nightmare taking away money and giving it to a bureaucratic agency government doesn't know what it's doing\nNow here's the problem you have any program I don't care if it's mental health I don't care if it's infrastructure program somebody has to oversee it\n\nI mean someone in government has to oversee it which means a beer craft\nA bureaucratic agency has to over ... ... what do you do just give money straight out to the private ah the the private developers the contractors here you go no oversight\n\nIt is always it see that's just a specious argument\nBecause by definition whenever state money is being spent in state borrows money\nAnd we don't have too many toll roads we don't have too many for a for profit mental health facilities out there a few but for the most part we don't veterans do or can you imagine the VA it's run by bureaucrats well of course it is\nFEMA it's it's run by bureaucrats now\nThis FEMA by trailers for example from trailer dealers should the money just go straight to the trailer dealers without bureaucrats being in charge so you hear about that all the Thai developers bureaucrats or the bad people the problem is there's no other way of doing it\nSo that's props [noise] ah so that's sort of an infighting situations\nWhere are those people against prop to are saying don't take money away from these programs and use it for this program\nAnd the folks in favor of prop to are saying well we needed more here as opposed to there so that's it's one of those yeah it's basically in fighting prop one is a different story prop one is by is borrowing four billion dollars now\nA a word or two just really quickly because we're running out of time about the amount of money we're borrowing the amount of money we're borrowing actually for the state is fairly easy we have a two hundred billion dollar budget in the state of California which about three percent is being used to pay back bonds\nThree percent of the income is being used to pay back bonds and when you hear about all these bonds four billion ... billion ten billion two billion you know a huge majority of bonds have not\nBeen sold they're just sitting there they've been okay that's the way it works you okay the sale of bonds\nAnd then the treasurer of California issues the bonds to be sold there are tens of billions of dollars that have not yet been sold so you have to put all of that\nInto context so next week will do more props every week and then give you a a voter's guide ...\nWhich is on the Web site by the way which you can't listen to you can't watch it you can't pay attention you can follow it coming up rich tomorrow tech Tuesday a lot of fun stuff to talk about license plates you license plates going to change rather dramatically KFI am at six forty\nK pacify the boss Angeles Orange County and I already [noise]\nDodgers when I'm Jennifer Jones Lee live from the KFI twenty four hour news rooms the Dodgers have won the national league west tie breaker for their six straight division title goatee Ballenger but the Dodgers up to nothing and the fourth against the Rockies on and five Seventy LA sport [noise]\nAnd that's why you've got all these different websites that dropped the vowels\nThey put a couple of words together you know they add the word happy at the end whatever you need they will figure out because you cannot get a good domain anymore it's just that the domain Russia is over so if you look at all these new tech companies\nThey all have really strange names and you know you have to the tough part for that as with when it comes to like people say on the radio or saying it on TV or saying it in passing you can't really spell it out you got to go Google and hopefully comes up if they're if the person is good enough\nBut that's what happened to me one of the top searches for me is like rich on tech dot TV literally people type it into Google that the top search for me [laughter]\nYeah but if they ... dot com they're going to get some ... what does it come due in Shanghai that owns a rich on a tech dot com\nThey are making some sort of a electronics and accessories but they don't actually use the Web site for anything that's what really bugs me they just have it for I guess internal email or something but they've had it for you know eight years now so every year every year I tried to scoop it up and they\nThey were doing it I have you mentioned that you like Chinese food for example and you're a big fan\nOr you know I mentioned that but they didn't not seem to care and they said a lot of the dishes do not translate\nSo you know here's where my partner is a genius and my surrogacy practice at many many years ago we were in the egg donation part of it also we did do surrogacy in a donation and just at the start of it she picked up to make a name AIG bank\nDot com which we own that's a good one now we don't use it but we've been offered some money for it but uh we are our\nOffice the big bang dot com happens to be in Shanghai and we just don't take meetings\nNo matter how much All right so let's move over to ah some new stuff going on\nA license plate a license plates here in California or going digital or are these like the television screens you see all over the place that are changing the advertising signs\nNo but that's uh that's one option that you know you might you might think that could happen in the future of the state needs some more money but no these are imagine a Kendall that instead of your back license plate and this is bolted onto your car has that same ... display\nAnd a company called revive or auto convince California to be the first day in the nation to allow these to replace your plate\nUm and what they do is they basically display your license plate the whole day so it doesn't it's not like fancy it's not displaying advertisements when it's parked or anything like that but there's a couple of benefits for number one uh they have wireless built in the cellular connection GPS\nWhen you were near your tags you do not have to put the stickers on because it automatically updates through the air\nIf there's an Amber Alert they can display on the back of your car so they can you can help out with that if your car stolen the plate will actually change from your license plate to the word stolen truck driving not around\nIt can pay for toll so when you go through you know any sort of told you have to in California toll roads it can automatically pay for those toll\nThat is cool and how about someone hacking it it becomes a brand new license plate\n[noise] well that's the other thing so of course because these things are connected there is the opportunity for security concerns and I think the number one is big brother you know so now California can the or every car is at all times theoretically now the company says they do not share that information with a DMV or any authorities of course we're at the beginning of this\nUh these plates are also seven hundred dollars by the way so no one's getting these things just for fun these early adopters people that are into technology Peter I just think it's\nCool to state says it's okay they they have Claritin or about declare it\nNo it's already cleared were the first ones other states including Texas Arizona\n... and everything will be next does the state of California would charge a premium for this for example like fan of the plates\nWell the seven hundred dollars includes all that but then you have to pay a monthly fee of seven dollars oh yeah oh yeah California is going to make out on these things but the reality is a bill I think this is just kind of an in between technology as I call it\nI think in the future cars will probably come with just a display on the front and back that will become the license plate for any state that you go to also be a lot more flexible it'd be like all those futuristic psi phi movies\nWhere you know if you're wanted for

shows that the ... that the reason that this happened was\nLow I think one out of twenty champs right so it doesn't matter what if you ask a hundred thousand people right and they don't get to be one out of twenty then yeah then got an ugly\nIf you have twenty questions one of them might be randomness\nWe just happen to have a two minute conversation a and a show and I yeah math and I should win the idiot I Am and he's trying to\nGet you to explain something All right so let's move over to I the oh here's a story exposure from X rays mammograms and other scans and this was one of those were Marjorie for example when she gets arrested for X rays and she's gotten a lot of them she has a ... chess thing she also has a back\nThing shows his leg thing she also was the next thing I should also gets migraines are her knees are bad uh because the euro oh she's she's a ... a a balance issue anyway we'll we don't have time to go through all of it but the point is she's gotten a lot of X rays over the years any danger there\nRight\nSo of course X rays do have risks associated with them but you know life has risks associated with it so it's a matter of perspective and you know kind of balancing the risk you already take so uh you know for example the highest radiation is from a CAT scan I tell people that that there are studies that show\nYou have about one in six thousand chance of a lifetime fatal cancer after getting a CAT scan um you know so\nThis is a single CAT scan\nYeah young single cats can so you know you don't want to get a CAT scan if you don't need it but on the other hand that's the chance that you're going to die in a car crash this year too but you still drive a car so the\nPoint is if you come into the hospital with abdominal pain and it's really serious and we need to find out what it is it's really not unreasonable to take that risk because you're going to take the risk when you get out of the hospital and drive home\nA mammograms or just straight X rays for broken bones any issue there\nThose are so much less radiation though I mean those are a hundred times two hundred times less radiation and so again with those I mean I have people that that really ... I've had people that that demand a CAT scan and then when I say I want to get a chest X ray they refuse it\nAnd it's like okay the chest X ray has won two hundred of the radiation that you're refusing\nBut you you're demanding the other one so\nYou know it doesn't make sense when you need it though the bottom line is I if I needed a Catholic and I would get a CAT scan if you if you need to figure something out it's worth the risk but I you know I'm really I ... you know I've never been excited about those full body scan\nYeah I Know you have in the meantime I one of those same Martin Rees life you know that I\nGet it I get it but how many ... you know did so the point is did we do if we did six thousand of of what we save one life and I don't know the answer to\nThat and unless unless your life exact yeah exactly\nSo anyway and by the way people that she had lung or Carson annoyed and that was found during the body scan you right\nYeah yeah pre cancerous lesion that would have turned to lung cancer\nIt just killed me when you found from\nWhich I Know I Know it's what do you do with that All right we're [laughter] he ... and she found out she had a hammer toe or at the same time I mean that there was that was a lot of cash scanned information we'll be right back with Jim of course we've got plenty more to talk about this ...
