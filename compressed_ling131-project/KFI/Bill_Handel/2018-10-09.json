Rick Seaney talking about flying there Rick I guess it's a little bit harder if you're an American airlines passenger and you need to read books these days\nYou know it looks like some bean counter was looking at some members saying why are we paying for all these things and uh they said our competitors doing it they seem to be doing that as well so\nWe're going to go ahead and make it a little more difficult for people to get re booked on other airlines when other issues occur now remember when weather occurs at an airport it probably affects all airline so this is probably an issue when the actual airline in this case American has an issue within their OWN Network\nUm so if you're paying a lot of money for your ticket if you have a lead status for example looks like you're going to get preferential treatment\nOkay so what was the deal before they said that you were books on an American airlines flight and I don't know something happened there was a maintenance issue with the plane and they were going to re book you another should they would read book you on a different airline even possibly if there was the\n[noise] yeah typically they would do that a lot of people didn't know that could ask for that I'll give you an example I it it was a long time ago but they had actually grounded some uh McDonald Douglas Aircraft I happened to be at an airport and I and they we went to the ticket counter and I said well we won't be able to fly and those aircraft today and\nI said well can you put me on US Airways to get back home and they hadn't said no problem will get you about that so they simply they won't do that anymore\nUm well let's put it this way they have some discretion to do that in certain situations I've seen examples like weddings and a variety of other things where people are missing things but essentially um this is just another one of the ... the changes that occurred\nSince we have hardly any competition in the United states with airlines if a competitor said hey you know we're going to read a book people and um then they probably wouldn't have had a policy like this\nVery excited alright waned morning Alice Alice good morning my

each other and they kept it all about the issues are no low blows\nYeah it was just your normal and they're not going after each other there's no there are no fireworks here should if they have different philosophies truly now the only thing about\nA John Cox is of course he says we're doing everything wrong if a but he has no answers or we're Gavin Newsom says uh we're doing everything right and whatever we do wrong I have no answers\nDid you hear Gavin voice mail sounded but here sounded weird I don't want to see drug ... really weird because it's John Cox uh yeah\nThis notion of a sixth century solution to twenty first century ... problem is ludicrous your spouse is ... ... if you think he's just horse\nYeah orient starting ... well how much stumping is he doing I don't know

that\nUh other than that it was a it it's just he's gone again over the top even his supporters said he shouldn't have said that [noise] that especially after she was a credible witness and then she became a liar\nI had said All right and it only helps him in a way helps no matter what he says it's the base I ... it's more about uh the number of people ... says more about his base than it does about him\nAs far as all of this is concerned it says more about the voters who are mean and who are insensitive who are downright vicious uh if you don't ... if you don't go our way we are going to

was a long time a public defender in LA county and father of two died over\nThe weekend after contract in what they believe was West Nile virus\nNow this is a scary one because\nWest Nile virus or flus out it's a ... who are at risk the elderly people the very young people those who have compromised immune systems this guy was healthy as a horse ... runner in great shape didn't smoke and he got it\nAnd it brings swelled up and what one of the problems as they thought he had a stroke like two in the hospital but it was this uh Westinghouse now\nI'm hopefully it is so aberration all this is such an outlier situation or that it ... it doesn't spread although when you think about people dying of West Nile which it's pretty rare for ten times as many people die of the\nFlu yeah and then you've got ... car accidents\nAre now type face is spreading in downtown LA\nLeave you there have been an outbreak but now it looks like the cases are starting to increase [noise]\nYeah it's just you got first of all kill your pets uh\nAll the free pets you know that's the wrong answer to kill the fleas on your pets maybe that's where I wanted to go okay\nYou know where those pet colors and it's a this dangerous stuff and it's I guess you can do stuff\nThat a ...\nA fleet protection in type ...\nThis is not this is not a problem out in the general communities this is a problem in places like Skid Row right\nThe homeless problem yeah it's uh it can be a little scary and the scary part is the diseases are coming back\nThat you thought were nonexistent even eradicated polio is coming back measles is coming back mainly because people are not vaccinating their children are and it's a you know this stuff is coming back it's no fun\nYou remember that girl who died after eating a a ... sandwich that had an enlisted ingredient she was allergic to well a second person has died because of an ingredient in one of their products yeah it was a super ... rainbow slap right it was supposed to have a non dairy yogurt\nBut it turns out that the supplier of the ingredient gave them something that had dairy protein and so\nAnything that says super vet I stay away from anything that claims to be vegetarian stay away from\nAnd stay away from a capri sons that seemed to have less juice send them then they should because they might have mould [laughter] disgusting\nThey can see how it would happen like there was a dead in Indiana who he goes and he gets a ... out of the fridge and he\nNotices and it just seems a little low on content right well he goes any cuts the top off of it and opens in and out comes shoes\nWith mole was more on it yeah and there was like I got punched as well as some might grow it was a micro hole in it that uh the uh mould\nAh came in and so and it at least I think craft owns it and I think that at least a you know they went to the lab in crafts was honest and said here's what we found as opposed to picking it up which they didn't say we don't know what you're talking about yeah\nA which happens last story and the reason I'm doing this because I Am going to pour does today to pick up something more for my daughter\nAh well as you won't have to go there if you want some of their foods because porters bakeries now shipping pastries and meet pies\nYou regard that they can you can make them at home they're frozen you can make them when you get them or you can put it in the freezer which even for another time and that is so does without\nThe law is not unusual because you have a these iconic brands then freeze Murray calendars pies for example there are pot pies I think Wolfgang Puck has a whole line of frozen goods\nAnd a poor does of course is uh there's one here in Burbank and there's like eight of them\nAnd the lines go out the door I mean the lines are half a mile long 'cause it's really good stuff it's really inexpensive relative to other bakeries and there is a they have um there's a brick kind of thing uh it's a a pastry\nThat's spinach and cheese right which is wonderful my daughter loves it\nAnd I'm looking at ... they're not shipping that you\nKnow no they're not shipping all of their product yeah there are five five of their products can shift\nSo I'm standing in line today oh to get those for your daughter and cause right there right around the corner yeah usually say get them yourself mhm and she said you're coming home yeah shredded eyes she sheds listen you're taking my sister the Packers game you're thinking stock give me a damn about ... paste refund poor knows they she got ya oh yeah\nWait a

up at a seven thirty right so\nI handle sorry to interrupt but are there are multiple reports that Nikki Haley has just resigned as the UN ambassador wow on\nAnd that are resident I Wonder why the nation I Wonder why\nI don't know this is a CNN is reporting this\nYeah I Know I'm looking at it I'm looking at it it's a yeah I'm fascinated why out of the blue I mean there was no contention between the president and Nikki Haley they loved each other and ah certainly there was no issue about her being unhappy at least publicly so I'm fascinated to know why she would resign she\nWas just standing behind him when he was at the un a couple of weeks ago\nLike every shot you know she was and they go right to his although when he was speaking before the un talking about being the greatest president in the world and how he's the one\nAh sheesh he should be the president of of the world\nA sheet and people started laughing at the members of the assembly actually started laughing out loud you could see a little bit of uncomfortable she stole weekly looking sort of straight ahead\nAll right so uh we'll start talking a lot more about that as a news comes in All right uh yesterday uh the quote debate which wasn't a debate between John Cox Republican businessman and ... and candidate for governor and Gavin Newsom\nOr the Democratic lieutenant governor of California running for governor a under the Democratic ah\nWell actually more ah the\nThe ... I Would uh say uh under the guise of the Communist Party of America is that fair to say uh yeah pretty much tell which way I'm going on this one don't you so they uh\nSport if you will and they're very different in terms of their approach they both think that we have the same problems I mean that there is no issue they agree on the problems and incidentally they disagree on the answers\nBecause both of them don't know what they're going to do\nAnd so it became a very big picture was so awful argument they had ... what do you think what do you think let's talk about this anyway a few found cuts of the uh sound cuts to the debate John\nFirst of all I'm In the housing business I started scissor daughters ago when I built apartments for a living I can build apartments in other states that I operated in for a fourth or fifth\nOf what the cost of building California and it's and it's government that has driven up the cost of housing in California now we have to exercise leadership from Sacramento and I will certainly do that because we do need to build a lot of housing but we need to build that housing cost effective way with lower cost\nYeah and then of course you well how do you do that I don't know wait till I'm governor and then I'll tell you how to do that\nBut he's absolutely right on this one or the cost of building housing is ridiculous\nI mean per unit it's tens of thousands of dollars in permit fees alone I and other fees I mean he just crazy and the way you have to go through I mean the process itself building in safety in title ... for example if a developers looking\nAt taking a piece of land and turning it into a residential a residential area I mean it is beyond crazy and I've watched this uh my brother who's been developed over the last Thirty years and I've seen this explode in terms of getting in the way now at\nThat with the rent control measure that we're going to talk about you put all of that\nTogether and what it does is make it even more difficult\nTo build if possible I didn't think it was possible to make it more difficult and so\nThe answer for John Cox is I'll take care of it the answer for Gavin Newsom\nIs I'll take care of it the difference is we can do it as the state\nAnd conquer saying just start eliminating just let me build\nAnd therein lies the problem in having watched this I I there was no issue Cox is right on on this one new soon as that of his mind what is that you're gonna make it more and more and more difficult to build well we need housing we need to help the poor okay\nWell how about eliminating some of the restriction so we just have to help the poor\nPolice\nAlright uh oh by the way do we have a Gavin Newsom says response to that John\nOr do I just keep on going\nAnd what about you housing one of the specific plans of the Fifteen specific plans we have to address this housing crisis comes to the issue of allocation of tax revenue\nMayors have a perverse disincentives rousing mayors actually have an incentive for big bucks retail mayors collect cities collect retail sales tax they don't collect property tax we would like to have that debate about re allocating that tax\nBecause so many big box retailers are going up because uh the retail stores are exploding right so take tax money and just move tax money from a to B which of course leaves big holes in the program that you're taking tax money from and so what happens well we've got to fill those roles\nAnd notice it's tax money tax money tax money that's the mantra\nCome back more there's plenty more here\nThis is a KFI Jennifer Jones leave Europe\nNikki Haley has resigned as the ambassador to the un the president is expected to make an announcement about this in about Fifteen minutes from now governor Rick Scott in Florida is warning that hurricane Michael is a massive storm that could bring total devastation of parts of the states so far it's a category ... storm\nAnd Indonesian officials say they'll hold prayers this

strategies yeah Garry on weekdays attending out\n\nMorning to you who's just breaking\nRight now by the way is Nikki Haley has announced her resignation as a Vassar the un\nI sort of came out of the blue and do we're waiting for the president I don't know if we're going to carry it or not following her resignation his remarks and I'll tell you I I can do is ... she's a wonderful human being she's great she's there's ever been a better UN ambassador except if I were you in a bachelor I'd be better and that's\nWhat you're going to hear okay back\nWe go to bill O'Riley a and his new book bill again thank you for joining us uh your latest book and you've done what Seventeen of these or something or this one is the hunt for the worst war criminals are killing the sea ice with your co writer
