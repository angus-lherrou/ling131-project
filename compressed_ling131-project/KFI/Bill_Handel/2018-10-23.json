towards the\nLibrary and see what happens bill morning from six to stand on campus\nFans you know\nWhen\nThe time\nOh these Dodgers red socks series is in the shadow of debate as they say let's talk with ABC's hearing to turkey and this is the matchup we haven't seen since Nineteen sixteen and technically the Dodgers weren't even the Dodgers and they were still the robbing\nThey were they were the Robin and Babe Ruth was pitching for ah for for the red Sox and and the Dodgers were still in Brooklyn of course oh it's been it's been a while and\nUh I I think there there is something about this kind of coast to coast a matchup that includes the whole swath of the country never before have two teams played in the world series that are farther apart twenty six hundred miles separates Dodger Stadium from uh from Fenway Park\nSo you know and there'll be eleven that for ratings have nothing else\nWell I mean it's better than like you know brewers versus\nI mean with all respect to Milwaukee that whatever\nBut I mean it it it it's storied franchise has a couple of baseball originals and I think in in that way it appeals to a cross section of generations I mean the you know your father and grandfather has an opinion about the Dodgers are the red Sox\nAnd and so I feel like there there may be some investment here even if there isn't quite the story that there was last year with Houston after the hurricane or the cubs after a billion years some some goats and and all of that\nWell this this just has a sort of the and like you were saying about you said it doesn't have the modern day thing on it but it's got that history I mean this is a one hundred year old history\nWhen you look back and you look at the shadow of debate that goes along with it and you look at the fact that where the Dodgers have come from Dayton until now and the history of just the actual game back in the day back in Nineteen sixteen and the Dodgers lost would have been waiting a hundred plus years do you know go back to when it\nDid handle cover when it was\nA Christie over here right now we'd be fighting I think I'd rather impressed with how well\nThe ... but they do is I think something about the you know the the this baseball original bit that does you know harkening back and um and and I think it's baseball has struggled for privacy as as the than the national pastime\nUh ... this series helps to recall a different era in in the game you know for the Dodgers trying to win for the first time in Thirty years and and and and the Kirk Gibson moment that but it's been so celebrated this uh this month or you know the the Red Sox who have had\nA fantastic success as of late but certainly when I was growing up in Boston it was you know yearly heartache of it you know it it\nAnd I love this two black men and two male others what the hell is a male mother\nNever heard of a male either so anyway we'll see what happens with that and whether they catch them or not\nOh we're watching that and my grand caravan of Central Americans push in Mexico\n\nAnd I just yeah and why\nIt's hard it's hard to look at these people with their children\nAnd a camping out on the street and

she doesn't get her check until the first and die if she does make it back\nAnd all it will I'm just doing the math here no oh no no no no\nAnyway it's a you have mixed feelings on this one truly not about the check I mean I've know mixed feelings about that but uh it's it's a tough one a when you look at this what do you do and of course the political a fall out on this it's the best thing ever\nHappened to the president has or the or the number of people swell and are coming to the border I mean they're still a couple of weeks away I Would think yeah and there\nYou're going to see a

badly done and the president goes on why has the body of someone or the killing of whom has been now officially admitted because the Saudi Government\nRight the crown prince admitted there was a killing\nIncidentally were just they were reporting a or a sky news reporting the body parts have been found on the grounds of the constantly general counsel general\nAnd a while I just it's why why why changing stories the team coming in the cleaning up the investigation or the Turkish investigators not allowed in\nI mean all ... who's the local collaborator remember they said there was a local collaborator who took the body or after the admission that\nA show he had been killed inside the consulate ... they took the body well who is it we can't tell you we won't tell you or we don't know who we gave the body to\nYou know I Need to walk back my comments because I just looked at an overhead map of assemble and it looks like there is quite a difference actually in where the Saudi conflict is versus the consul general's home so they would it would not have all been behind say a gate okay say what would have been some sort of a transfer\nSo therefore assuming the body parts were taken and it belongs to the show gay uh I'm assuming it had to be and I I don't want to get too graphic here in small pieces\nOr how they said there was a tarp or something or carpet didn't they say that\nDid they do with what they said it was wrapped up and then given to but then that could be just part of the story yeah you know in the end you know the Saudis are saying anything and everything it could is that they could have for all we know put a cause show a blender\nAnd then uh taken him a in a no that's a little God's going maybe a little bit too far a but so we we don't know they're just going completely crazy if body parts were found and at this point looks like it's the case we do know that just reporting from sky news\nUh then how did they get from the conflict to the council generals yard or his garden we don't know it's up in the air the Saudis I I Can't wait for the Saudis to come back with yet another story and then another story and then change that story\nAnd of course we know that Eighteen people have been a detained quote detained out of the soil I I think all Fifteen of that team\nHave been detained or one considered one of the ... died in a traffic

building of the atomic bomb during World War World War two it took virtually the entire resources of the federal government or billions of dollars of that time I mean today I think it costs two billion dollars in Nineteen forty\nThrough Nineteen forty five to build the atomic bomb to me I I don't even know what two billion dollars is today I mean it's tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars so the only way to deal with this of course is a comprehensive approach of virtually is the most important thing it's not and it's not going to be so big pieces right or small bits and pieces\nWell let me tell you a Gavin Newsom dum da I did and boy is he being a male for this\nHe took away money\nFrom homeless single homeless adults slashed the amount of welfare bastard\nWhen he was a supervisor and what he did instead was use money to fund shelters housing and services took the money away from the people and uses specifically for shelters housing and services was called care not cash\nAnd ah the programs to stop a these welfare recipients for spending money their monthly checks on heroin or alcohol and how do we know that was happening because the emergency room visits spiked in San Francisco right after welfare checks were sent out\nSo you're going to see the Republican candidate John Cox a ratcheting up his attacks on new some over homelessness will mentioned that he took away money\nFrom welfare recipients of course not say that the money was used for another program and if he does say it is it will be it was a failed the program\nAnd here's the problem with homelessness it's all a failed program\nIt's an impossibility deal with this\nExcept\nWith massive amounts of money and then I've all I've often said a successful program here in California to deal with homeless\nThe homeless issue and we're talking about housing the homeless we're talking about the support services the mental health services the medical service services because homeless people

of the me too movement comes a rather interesting case a in Utah first of all a statistic or two and we know that a very few cases sexual assault\nOr are actually are prosecuting even though in the ... me too movement that's going up\nBut this is according to Salt Lake city da Sam guild who's running for office by the way a again an average of forty four percent of violent crimes are reported and lead to an arrest\nIn Utah twelve percent are brought forward that's after reporting which we know so many are not twelve percent\nAre brought forward so the bottom line is a sexual assault cases or not I in terms of numbers brought forth very often\nAnd uh so what's the problem with a women who know the sexual assault is taking place take it to the authorities and the d._a. simply refuses to prosecute\nWhy because they're a bunch of bastards and they happen to white sexual assaults of course not they're saying it's it's not enough we don't have enough evidence are usually in say he said she said there are no witnesses and all things being equal when you have a he said she said without additional information\nI it's not going to happen the d._a. will not prosecute\nSo ah there is a cause it's rather unique to Utah\nThat permits or these crime victims to request the state Supreme Court appoint a prosecutor\nIf the d._a. refuses the case that is very unusual\nIt's another avenue where women who have alleged that they have ah been molested assaulted can go forward with the prosecution even after the da says no thank you there's not enough evidence\nUh now as I said is unique to Utah but this concept of victim initiated prosecution is sort of available in other states attorneys for the women are looking at this that this may create a viable blueprint for other states\nSo while the da and of course he had to say this right or Sam he'll call the petition an intriguing thing that's never been challenged\nHe does have some concerns that's the way he's couching it and you have\nTo be very very careful much why the centers Republicans had to treat Christine Blasey Ford uh literally walking on eggshells had to be very very careful\nIn not attacking her and the same thing is here the d._a. who thinks this idea of sucks by the way is not going to say that for fear of being perceived as attacking women who have been assaulted but here's what he said\nA successful lawsuit will pave the way for thousands of frivolous petitions and many of these cases\nNow is there an argument there not much you win because you have to go to the state Supreme Court you get a special prosecutor\nNamed and they're just in this ... of course I'm going to be jumping on this\nI mean keep in mind the state Supreme Court gets thousands of partition so I'm assuming it's been a it's a similar to the U.S Supreme Court where if not thousands hundreds of petitions to rule in a matter and just not many or ruled on this and this is the case by case basis\nSo the lawsuit this lawsuit\nAsks for a specific ruling on one case that has been turned down for prosecution and I don't believe you're going to see this as a broad sweeping decision\nI think if anything if it goes and there were four women involved in four different assault charges each of which has been denied a prosecution because the d._a. just said we don't have enough\nAssuming these cases go forward it is not going to be a new policy it's going to be this case under these circumstances which is not precedent\nWe have to remember and people think that every time the Supreme Court rules on something it's this wide sweeping change in the law and we have to now changed the way we do business I Know the vast majority of cases I held bound by appellate courts are very specific and very narrow in their ruling\nThat's what the courts do\nThe courts traditionally are very narrow in\nTheir decision that's simply policy they really don't want to rock the boat the courts now occasionally the court does Citizens United changed everything ... changed everything brown versus board of education changed everything\nBut those are fairly rare most of the time is much more narrower ruling so we'll see what happens alright\nComing up a rich them hurled KTLA he's rich tomorrow on tech Tuesday a we've got a bunch of fun things to talk about in a an inter personal bitch that I have that drives me completely
