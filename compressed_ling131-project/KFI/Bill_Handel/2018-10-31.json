someone but all you're doing is growing a dead person that's not what the intent to hurt someone is the intent is growing person\nWho's the victim very is no because the person is already did now there are some rules on the books now because they pass statutes making it quote a crime\nBut a statutory early you can be a crime but common law is there are no common law crimes here\nWhich is why they pass statutes because until they pass ... until the legislature said this is a crime\nIt wasn't it is an inherent crime for example stealing is inherently your crime killing is inherently a crime\nNot neck were feeling why\nLet's go back to the premise because the victim\nIs an ... ... people do not have rights as people\nSo how 'bout mutilation of a ... well that statutory and uh that you can get a you can be in trouble for but again a until that was statutory passed it didn't happen particularly when we're talking about sex\nAlthough wasn't to property damage or it is ... common law that was a and so would and doing that I mean it's not the person's ... who's doing\nA good point but when was the last time that a dead people were actually property\nDoes on the wall you a question I Know a legal question who had somebody has some kind of proprietary I'd write as to the body\nNot as property not as ownership of property I think\nThey would write legal series in where you you know somebody dies and let's say they didn't leave a will and you have to decide whether to bury them or cremate them right if someone is whoever\nHas the right it's next of kin or it is a decision making that someone has you have to dispose of the body I had sort of not only not on a property issue\nIf it's a person in a coma it's because the person in a coma can't exercise any decision making\nRight okay now\nThe person who's dead is it simply the same idea that a dead person of course can't exercise or just because it's the dead here's the thing is a dead person a person\nNo a dead person is not a person do you want to hear something that's gonna blow your mind what\nAnd you're absolutely right about so many states didn't have any laws until like the tooth California didn't have only until two thousand four yeah\nIn Wisconsin these three guys this woman this girl died in the sky saw her picture in the obituary and he called his friends and said help me go dig corrupt so I can have sex with her and they did\nAnd they went to charge him they didn't have a specific networks ... and they charged him with sexual assault\nAnd it was thrown out of course because there was no one to assault but here's what's going to blow your mind the appeals court reinstated it and they said the sexual assault statutes that it's a crime to have sex with someone without their consent and that dead woman did not consent\nEra do sexual assault see that's wrong because some one\nA dead person is not a one\nA dead person as simply a cadaver that can or cannot give consent whatsoever cannot be raped\nOr is and other than statutory\nEarly to not be liable ... under that's correct cannot be liable case right cannot be slander and when it comes to ownership I

and\nIf a dead person if not somebody's property yes what is it what is that body like under the law what\nI think it is simply what status does have I think it is a piece of meat I think unless statutory\nI have if I can my refrigerator that's a piece of meat ...\nAnd if you have sex with that steak a piece of meat huh is that I Need help well it's a dead cow is that a bit of geology it is not is not again\nCan we agree on this when people are charged with all kinds of crimes and banning the crimes that are against the person re doubts robbery what is the indictment say the people of
