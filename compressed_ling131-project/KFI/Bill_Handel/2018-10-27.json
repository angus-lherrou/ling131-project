I I just hit a cone on my car and it was a I still think it's it's going to go against me\nAnd I have a oh God it's a long story I have a BMW which I'm never going to happen again ever\nSo I called my insurance Asian I found out that is going to cost a billion dollars to fix the car 'cause we were caught fortune and I started replacing it he said and I go I'm sure I'm going to get cheaper insurance and he said you're replacing it with what Nineteen eighty two Toyota\nIs what I'm going to get to replace the carts but anyways I Would I I\nThe ... the first thing I Would do is ask the insurance company or call your age and phase is going to hurt me if it doesn't hurt you are you going to get your insurance and sue for up to ... so are there is the answer a shovel the short answer done in a very long\nA long form alright Don Liz you're up welcome to handle on the wall Hi Liz how yes we are\nOh I'm going to you all are set up a welcome car owners are going to cost more of a bottom dollars on a ... just the soccer\n... oh oh I Can't get in to check on two kids that have been a fishery that going on like that yeah that one ... oh yeah for a\nWhile to get a divorce after he died of all over the last ... I'm going to target among\n... parents took hold off on a call ... ...\nYeah I don't know I don't know why you would need insurance because it's real simple you the trust is simply written into the it goes to your kids\nHe doesn't go to the list goes it goes to the game like can I add so why do you need insurance I just don't get it I mean the laws real simple go see your kids or whether they're ... yeah whether they're all ... law\nFirm and shot\nOh All right here's the bottom line I don't know why you would need\nInsurance because as I said uh the trust a when you die and go straight to your kids spouses have absolutely no claim on that insurance it's separate property a it's an inheritance\nAnd so now and especially if there's from selling insurance oh yeah it's it's they're trying to hustle you for insurance money\nSome for my my feeling\nYeah and the insurance and when I don't get his insurance for ... to protect them against what\nUh what about divorce court\nWell they're going to take them to court anyway wow I mean it tell you if you got your you're going to argue\nPeople if it's a lot of money that's being left inevitably the divorce spouse is going to get a is going to go to court and incidentally there was no chance the divorce spouse is going to get a dime and the only issue is if it's lots of money they filed a suit and effectively\nWell you're supposed to tell you what why don't you give me some money will drop the suit it becomes a nuisance ... issue where you don't want to deal with it or the money's tied up uh it's just the ... that's what happens you got the sleeves wall attorneys who just simply an act of extortion or an insurance on whose life\nWell whose life or they want you insured they tell you know [laughter] just wiping Sharon's in general\nWow okay here's okay\nHere's what I Want you to do here's what I Want you to do I let me change my mind uh I Want you to go ahead and ask them or life insurance and as a better fishery I Want you to know uh my last name is spelled with ... ... email ... with an L. E. okay\nOkay All right so uh make sure it's William W handle as the beneficiary of your life insurance policy [laughter] All right thank you much okay this is handle on the law\nGuys just surviving on me [laughter]\nAnd what was going\nOn you [laughter]\nAnd just walk\nOr you know where your exits are Portland and I'm like hey how are those other than that it's only three to follow these rules and stay tuned KFI further instructions say Hi Angela in orange county and I are radio station [noise]\nBy here is a story and this was one where ah what do you do with the law in this one how do you apply the law because it's so what happens is self is so strange that the authorities going okay\nWhat do we do with this one and this has to do a here locally Davis a Davis high school student\nUh is accused of baking her fat grandfather's ashes into a batch of cookie sugar cookies specifically and giving them to classmates of which uh these classmates ate the cookies and part of the recipes was grandad dashes\nAnd a public a charter school at least nine students were given these cookies or some uh eight the cookies without knowing of this extra ingredient and were horrified others now\nSo ah school resource officer officer reports or two female students are involved and bringing the cookies to school and hand them out and I'm now a police of open the case and are trying to figure out\nWhat law has been broken my ashes are fine\nI mean that is I guess adults are rating cookies but certainly no harm there is nothing in there that causes any harm to anybody and certainly for the students they knew they were reading Grande as ashes there is no issue I don't think\nUh the few that didn't know maybe there is a emotional distress because ah probably most people would be a little upset about eating a southern gals grandfather releasing the ash form\nAnd uh so the cops are considering a California ... penal code regarding the disposal of human remains an improper manner but no ashes\nI don't know although you're not allowed to spread ashes in public places you can't go to a public park for example and spread ashes but the law does not consider baking those ashes into cookies\nSo it was out there looking at with the school the working with the school to figure out how to proceed with this one because certainly this is not a good thing\nIs Larry as personally I mean that's a hell of a story [noise] All right well let's go ahead and take some phone calls here\n\nAre Dorothy Hi Dorothy yes ma'am what can I Do for you what can you tell me\nIt's going to see a Bernie that would take my case again my insurance company for refusing to improve on me to go to the specialist Dr Adam I met with Joan\nOkay well I if you sure and his plan you have does not pay for doctors that are not part\nOf ah the network ... on what basis are you going to sue the insurance company because that's part of your contract with them\nBecause the one that was shown not follow up\nWith my negative lab\nOkay that's a problem you have with the doctors not with the insurance company\nNo but the doctors they read them not to follow up when my lab tests are saying\nI have but that's but that's the doctors who are refusing to follow up what is it what does the insurance company have to do with it\nThat's supposed to do what they've been doing and now I'm just saying no\nWhat have they been whether they've been doing\nTo another one\nOkay they within the network or outside the network\nAnd that may have sent me Adam okay or on the page\nOkay well here's your problem uh\nIf if a contract calls for a other doctors out of network to get involved with say the doctors in network can't deal with it a then yeah then I think you have an issue uh but uh my guess is that\nThey're not required to and they just do it or you know for example you give me an example uh\nUh my dad were part of Kaiser which is the largest HMO in the country and it's all network I mean you do your doctors are in Kaiser they don't pay a dime for doctors outside of a network not a penny so we go outside doctors we pay for it unless you're out of the area and it's unless you can have access to a Kaiser doctor I mean it's with\nLA care okay I just telling you I'm giving an example of what happens I'm Out of a out of a ... out of the network what what happened was my dad needed heart surgery and they were so filled up\nThat they brought in doctors outside of the network but they didn't have to your insurance company doesn't have to and if it did before doesn't mean it has to now so the bottom line no Dorothy I don't think you have a case\nThat doctors are not willing to follow up\nYeah I get it that you have a problem with the doctors no but the insurance company is supposed to send me where I can get this service I mean and they're the ones that have the option of saying yes or no\nYou just said they have the option of saying yes or no notice the word you just use\nYes but the reason they can say no I think\nThere than there is someone in my network but I've proven to them they follow up on line\nSo All right but they're saying that do they say they need to follow up or is that your call but they need to\nFollow up what my from them for getting worse\nIs it your call you see but here's the problem you're now playing Dr Dorsey\nNo if you're actually saying okay\nThen you're like OK Lauren though here I go on assuming all of that is true right All right I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt there is no lawyer I Know who we touch it there isn't enough money in it\n[noise]\nThere's your problem also is because a failure to follow up if it what you mean we you know when we have a ... case when you're dead as a result of their failure to follow up and their duty bound to do that so tell you what after you die called me\nAnd we'll talk about a case and then I'll get a lawyer to that will be interested this is handle on the law tests of Aurora or tests I bought I have that though I have that right\nAs many hours as you can throw in the ... ... as the trail I Love that in the Hispanic trail or do you use ... or ... yeah it depends on who I'm Talking to

just she puts it in without a written agreements or you just say thank you\nOkay [laughter] is that a trust or just you know it's just something I Know there's no trust\nI mean you can put all the property and trust but it's a different issue so unless I ate you it's it's basically a gift to both of you is what it is good she's just she's decided to pay down the mortgage and there's no indication that she wants to any of the money back it's just\nHey thanks very much a wonderful human being\nWhich is concerned about is if she is the way that that that they don't end up going to get

tendons in common which means upon the death by that half of the property goes to your kids for example so they become owners with her\nThere's a bunch of different ways of doing it so I suggest you

synagogue shooting aftermath\nContinues I'm passe about life from the camp by twenty four hour newsroom at least four people have been shot and killed at a synagogue in Pittsburgh another four people were shot this includes three cops NBC News is Pete Williams says the shooter has been it has been arrested\nThe authorities are going through the building just to make sure that no one else was involved that's a standard procedure in something like this\nAnd to make sure that there are no other victims ah so it has to purposes for them to go through the building very very carefully and very methodically\nAnd um you you know there's an issue going on here 'cause that's immediately suspect are asking what he did and didn't do because for him but I\nFired him because he said he went and filed a lawsuit and that was a point\nNo I understand and you're allowed to do that and uh because you go to attorney to file a lawsuit I Want to know where the thirty nine hours is easy sent you an accounting of what he did for the thirty nine hours\nAnd it gets that it was a regular\nNo no no no that doesn't work he has to send you a full detailed accounting\nUp every minute spent and what he did that will probably many ... he has to and so when I Would do at this point is immediately take the accounting races just working what he's saying you the bill what was on the bill what what is\nIt wasn't that he said he was going to put a lean if I when I got another lawyer and I wasn't the case laying on anything I get\nAll right so it was ... so it was a contingency agreement right All right then what you do is you take that contingency agreement you take the check that you wrote him you take the bill that he sent you that you paid like an idiot\nYou ... man oh good then I just call them up and say you keep on going after me I'll see you in the state bar\n[noise] that's one way or another lawyer\nYeah no no no no no it's the state bar no no it's not now he's entitled to some kind of a percentage or for whatever is gotten on a contingency basis if there is no when then there will be no money so\nThe contract\nWell not really not really because he ... there's probably languages as he can bailout anytime I so that's not a a breach I guess it is morally but it's not legally a breach and when you talk morals against an attorney\nSo ah what you have is uh you you take the bill and you call him a write in and say this was a contingency case you sent me a bill for Eighteen thousand dollars if you don't withdraw immediately I Am taking this the state bar\n[noise] also that it was going to go after my current attorney but I I I Know\nHe's not going to go out to your current attorney is going to put a lean on the case for work that he has done and then it's up to your current attorney to go she ate with him you're not even part of this let the attorney that yeah you're fine it's just a he's blowing smoke is what he did\nOoh right\nRon oh let's go Casey was do that is yeah hello Casey welcome to handle on the law\nHigh my um I've got my question is how much weight does egg Fifteen year old out in on the family law or judge\nIt depends on the judge a book probably quite a bit especially if you're talking custody I'm assuming as to which parents the child wants to live with exactly yeah the court the court will pay attention to that there's no question that some might go ahead\nI have an evil act that at very permissive with them and hold them instructed them they don't have to do chores alright where my house and they just sit around and play video games\nGot it so uh so what you do what they want to live with got it so uh what you do is bring that up to the judge and the judge\nAs I said it has a lot of ... has all the kids have a lot of input but at the same time the judge is going to look at why do the kids want to live with mom and actively the kids living with mom means no rules no controls and nobody\nCares about chores Casey no one gives the rats about whether shores are done or not done\nThat one is the ...\nBut she's not even there he's at work\nAll that's a different story that is a different story and with again the Fifteen year old is he really need a parent there\nAnd I don't know the answer that depending on the judge but here it is I'm assuming your kids are going to say they want to stay with mom 'cause it's so permissive and you're going to argue I understand what the kids are doing but here is why and then the judge is going to make his or her choice and that's all you can do is bring it up and see what the judge says\nIf I'm the judge or I'm going to try to nail mom for doing that and that's\nAssuming that the kids that you can prove a or at least establish some basis for that being the truth\nAnd ... and the cave I newsroom\nTests or some new ways yes we have an updated information from the ... percent on shooting guns shooting that has left at least for people that NBC News is now reporting that the suspect in the synagogue mass shooting was armed with an A R Fifteen style rifles\nHe also had multiple hand on his name is Rob ... hours that is the man suspected to be behind us and if I'm shooting\nTrump on this devastating event says it's a terrible thing what's going on we have in our country ... weather and the five freeway and\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the investigation\nGoing on right now have you identify either four o'clock I'm Sorry to hear from it for you here for myself or the SAC ah special agent in charge of the FBI us attorney as well as the elected officials movie for us today what's the next step here the next step is a\nSecure the crime scene the FBI has both assets from both western Pennsylvania and from DC and route here so they will be running the investigation and the crime scene with the support of both the Allegheny county place and the city of Pittsburgh close she's actually that\nI have no idea I'd like to also mentioned the state police or you know they've been instrumental in helping us out as well just because it's it's worth ... was Farsi as race right now where it's six centuries you identified the garden and [noise]\nI didn't know if it was actually a month I didn't have a car so\nI Would argue a well then you have to argue with those damages are and that gets that gets kind of difficult if you had rented a car you could easily said these are the costs that's part of my damages\nIf a friend had taken you back and forth to work or you can say it is worth X number of dollars\nA there are a bunch of things but uh I don't know you're certainly getting thousand dollars that I filed against the yard instantly for the thousand dollars and then what I Do and then I Would ask for another five grand just for the hell of it and uh just a tell all at small claims and argue what you had to do and and and try to figure out\nA money equation for that\nAnd this and little or specific you get the easier it is for a judge if you simply say I was out of a car and it was terrible for me I Want five thousand dollars the judge just tosses it if you say here's what I had to do and this is what it cost me and even though I didn't spend the money I Would have\nIf I had any money these are the damages\nThat's what I Would argue and see if that works\nHello Giovanni welcome GMO new yes I Am\nSo five years ago that case it was a phony what the plea agreement that there were two of us here of exposed it will go to the letter from a district attorney that at this list all of them one I apply for jobs well do I keep that you put it ... no\nNo you're done you know you're doing you're doing is just expose you have no

you're on the air a lot of people know and find out and they go why don't you tell me and then the argument is because it was expunged\nAnd legally I don't have this anymore although there are ways of going back to the record and finding out but for the most part I wouldn't say\nThat there has been a felony conviction and maybe it was simply a felony arrest in there you don't have to say that at all at all\n... how old can can Europe welcome to handle on the law [noise] go ahead I can\nDo a ... uh I like to know what do you do about the uh are having some regrets again for fraudulent
