Feinstein if this happens ah she's out well first of all it takes Nancy Pelosi to impeach and it takes Dianne Feinstein to be part of\nThe uh the crowd or the Senate that would remove the president from office and say hey let's say they take the house yeah but they don't take the Senate I won't then a a full impeachment is dead in the water that just like Clinton it's crazy and makes zero

[noise] she's in London with the chargers so I it's\nA whole day that's going to be really weird uh what kind of actually fun tomorrow very modified version of the shows and uh know Kelly is a broadcasting from political on this weekend that's going on also what\nA busy weekend All right now uh let me tell you what is going on in the world of student loan still keep in mind is the economy is doing very well booming stock market or the lowest unemployment fifty\nYears and uh what's happening\nWell ah first of all auto loan debt has grown fifty two percent over the last eleven years a mortgage and credit card debt is actually falling about one percent student loans have grown a hundred and fifty\nSeven percent I mean this is crazy\nThree times the rate of mortgage and credit card or a million times the rate of a hundred and fifty seven is I Can't be a hundred fifty seven cumulative if you go to one to one fifty seven what does that percentage increase to point six million percent I have no idea\nAnyway why why is that\nDoesn't make a lot of sense well there's a couple of reasons that I Want to share with you a number one the cost of education has exploded far far faster than inflation\nA also a lot of the schools in which a student loans and this is Seventy percent of the defaults incidentally and the default rate is way up one ten of the student loans are now Ninety Days Pashtu that's a lot where if you look at their homes it's one point one percent\nAnd car loans are right there in a couple of percent so when you're looking at ten percent that's pretty astronomical so one of the big reasons Seventy percent of the student loan default is because of the crop all of fake for profit colleges\nYou know the ads you see on TV all the time you know you can learn I Love those ones you can learn to be a dental assistant what does that mean\nThat means answering the phone Hi Dr Smith office and making a really here's your appointment date there it is and you can learn to do that and all it's going to do is cost you a twelve thousand dollars a year for the next two years\nAnd degrees in engineering and degrees in computer sciences which in most cases or let's say in many cases are totally worthless\nThat's a big problem\nBecause here we ... we have a some kind of thinking there's never made sense to me higher education is for everybody\nYou go around the rest of the world higher education from the people that make the grade you've got ten percent of people are Fifteen Percent that are eligible for college the state pays for it for the most part it's free and those are the people that go to college\nSo there is no such thing as a uh it's there's no such thing as a lead is him in a in a good sense anymore or you know everybody's a winter uh we have to feel\nGood about everybody there is no such things as people who are less than you are less qualified than that doesn't exist everybody should go to medical school everybody should go to law school well you look at me everybody should go to law school 'cause if I can get in you should you can get in but what happens is\nWe have a society now where it's a hideously expensive to set up higher education and ah people borrow money like crazy there's so much of a fraud is pandemic and look at the problem you have now here is one\nAnd I read this and it didn't make much sense until I started looking into it the more money you borrow the less you are apt to default\nIsn't that crazy well here's the reasoning\nMore money you borrow the longer you're going to be in school which means you are going to get more training you're not going to spend six years in one of those for profit learn to be a dental technician school\nOh\nYou're not going to be a hundred thousand dollars in debt or a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in debt but if you go to medical school to go to post graduate school you are going to be in\nDebt to that extent but you're going to pay it back because you are going to get the jobs you will get the six figure jobs\nOr the fifty sixty eighty thousand dollar your job which enables you to pay it back\n\nSo uh the bottom line and we're hearing this from a lot of experts with one point five trillion dollars in student debt second only to mortgage debt\nThat is a problem and it's going to bite us in the back in the the but ah but\nBite us in the ass that's easier for me to say a for a very long time it may be catastrophic alright coming up a look inside the GOP wardrobe or a war is still going on oh you bet\n... explain what's happening with that when we come back KFI eight and six forty by listeners are winning I\nThem ever won any\nThe actual war room started and we talked to James Carville yesterday and he was part of that initial war room George Stephanopoulos incidentally uh that you see on ABC\nOr he actually was head of the war room I think he's twenty seven years old when he created the war room and the bill Clinton a run for presidency and the war room is exactly what it sounds like\nIt's like the situation room and the White House\nAnd it's a question of creating messaging it's dealing with a daily attacks\nWhat's going on and just actually a manipulating\nAnd controlling the message and how uh the candidate reacts or the president reacts so ah the Republicans this time around man or they have exploded they have taken it to a whole new level and they have left the Democrats in the dust\nSo let me give you an example and it happened this week\nRight the Republican Party is research director Mike Reed\nFinds out about Senator Elizabeth Warren's DNA test before he gets out of bed\n\nFrom his bedroom he starts the machine worrying and it starts going crazy now a President Trump and his aides ... initially play down the news about Elizabeth Warren and her connection to her native or alleged Native American ancestry\nAnd as a matter of fact Kellyanne Conway told reporters that it doesn't interest me and Trump said who cares\nWell nine forty six Monday morning the story changed Ole boy we blasts out his first female to thousands of reporters and allies laying out new talking points for his side this is within an hour of the news being released\nAnd that Warren's test showed a miniscule percentage of native heritage and her DNA\nAnd that did not end the political problems that she's had regarding her ancestry as a matter of fact her release of the DNA results which she thought was going to help her just exploded in her face\nSo\nWe'd writes a quote having his little is won five hundred and twelve Native American ties I mean he writes this I had actually tweets is a heavy as little as won five hundred and twelve Native American ties does not give you the right to claim minority status\nAnd that quote now goes of course viral on Twitter\nAnd what Elizabeth Warren hoped would be a moment of vindication has turned the other way\nThere was another trophy\nThere are sixty GOP researchers book gr bookers attack dogs as part of that war room\nCarefully curated relentless stream and sometimes outright lies totally misleading but it it doesn't matter because once it's out it's out on Fox News picks it up as fact it goes out in the Twitter world\nAnd all of a sudden and this is a Donald Trump and his presidency his administration his followers what's round is square what's up his down what's black is white\nCase in point Michael Cohen who flipped right Donald Trump's personal attorney for ten years the fixer the president\nTweets out he was a low level PR guy that really didn't have much to do with me\nMemory paid Stormy Daniels I mean that's kind of stuff we get now that's become fact now in the\nTwitter world that's a fact low level PR guy\nAh what do you deal with that\nA ... Paul Manafort a guy who was peripherally involved in campaign he really had nothing to do with it he was a campaign\nManager sure so\nWhat this war over this party operation does it has a ... shop just the research part of it of Fifteen people scans news video streams or any screw up in the Democratic party\nOr we average according to read we average over a million views a week on Twitter we have Fifteen million views on our YouTube page just this cycle we've got a large megaphone\nAnd the Democrats really haven't come up to par yet now they will probably right now the Democrats are concentrating on the races there concentrating on flipping the house\nThen it starts with a presidential election and\nEven so the Democrats until there is a candidate or are not going to be in the same position as Donald Trump is because Trump is going to be the nominee and twenty twenty that's a given it's always the ... the a sitting president as the nominee of his or her party so\nIt's a right now the\nRepublicans are up and running and doing a better job to say the least by\nComing up or how do you indict someone for a crime when you don't know who that someone is\nYou don't have a name and you're still indict them\nAll explain that to you and uh we're gonna have waned come back 'cause this is a write up his alley uh whenever we do an issue like this this is KFI and there is
