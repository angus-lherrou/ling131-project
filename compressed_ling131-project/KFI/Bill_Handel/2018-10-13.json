right Oh hi rose rose you're up welcome [noise] I don't yes ma'am\nOkay Simon with um my boyfriend for ten years he hasn't done in taxes than ten years mhm he's finally getting its act together and if I'm Marianne life responsible for that\nBut first of all let's start with I don't know\nWhy would you marry someone who is such an auditor flake that he hasn't filed taxes for ten years\nWhile he pay the taxes they haven't found a fact\nHow he'll wait a second just write the check to the IRS no no\nNo I mean taxes come out of the ... nothing like that he does all that I just had to file that site yeah he's probably entitled to some big refunds actually if you think up until maybe\nBut I'm just wondering if I marry him and my response though\nA hell you're only responsible for being stupid and home now well that's a given but\nI Know I mentioned perfect and I love you and I'm not there\nTo see the will lessen well we can have that conversation can't we are because I did we talk about your boyfriend now or soon to be husband you're not responsible I have perfect but you have to be a little careful when you marry someone who has financial issues\nYou just keep everything separate everything separate and and and what I mean separate is everybody has totally separate bank accounts and you have a shared bank account that then you write household checks out of\nThe mortgage or a gardeners are utility bills or whatever and so that is the queen is wait now as far as he is concerned\nHaving pay the taxes and not filing a tax return now that is a violation but it really isn't a big deal\nThe IRS doesn't really care he just file their taxes and you may even be entitled to he may be entitled to refine so why even though the violation and\nIt's one of those and not paying taxes they get very upset yeah now he paid it\nYou're fine and then just say hey I didn't file their taxes that memory lapse for ten years and I don't remember and I woke up by ...\nBeard and ripped family go on for\nWhatever but uh I haven't voted accountant filed taxes dammit and get a refund okay I'm often yeah okay yeah you're an idiot from Mary guy like oh All right I Steven hello Steven Yes sir\nI have a question about being arrested on mobile called a couple of days ago told me that I ... my name [laughter] and then return learnt all within twenty four hours local law enforcement wouldn't be around them\nYeah I don't remember of course not uh although I like returning those phone calls or they're just they're just they're just fun to return now normally a yeah of course it's a scam\nAnd no they can't do it and they are in violation of the law and here is the problem you call the authorities and whoever a is a uh whoever handles sad that they would probably be the FCC I guess who is in charge of that\nAnd why they put in a complaint and then they put you on the list because they've got two hundred and thirty million of those to deal with\nAnd I don't think I'm exaggerating either now I returned phone calls I got one the other day uh it wasn't even a a robocall it was well robo call them a sense of the dialing but I got a live person who ah said ah ah I'm with the IRS\nAnd uh we have a A N and we ... a ... and do you have to pay and nice and you have to pay right now and I wasn't really a yes and we'll take a will take out a check over the phone or will certainly take a credit card and my favorite one is we'll take a I tunes card\nOr apple cart that's my absolute favorite because you know the government takes apple cart apple to or I chose anyway\n[laughter] excuse me [noise] so what I did is\nI said really a IRS leaning goes absolutely ago once you give me the number of lean because what he's talking about it I said there's no such thing as an I arrest document that you're holding onto that doesn't have a\nFile number on it so why don't you give me the final number\nOh we're not allowed to do that really and so\nI just had a ball with this guy and of course hung up on him and I hate the fact that he called me the bottom line whenever anybody ever make that kind of\nA a a threat you just hang up on him and he's going to replace by doctors or your time\nOkay All right yeah it's just what robocalls when I just read that fully half of the calls that you weren't going to get are now going to be robo calls that are now out there it's gotten to that crazy in my case it will be virtually all of the calls because no one ever calls me\nI just I don't get people to call me because I don't call them and it's this whole thing about how I hate people may have me and so it's virtually a hundred percent and they're getting so good I got a call the other day and I were talking about robocalls I'd I mean it was I was stunned 'cause I I\nYou know if you you can easily tell what a robocall is if you even begin to look at it and thinking you're in your mind because normally where you think is is is going is this a robocall once you even asked that question you understand that it is so I got a call and it was one of those I knew my name\nIs Mr handle and this is a call\nMr handle and no one was on the other end except some computer I'm Mr handle my name is whatever ... collection agency and then our hero clunkers you go and the woman says oh excuse me I just dropped my head piece sorry about that ah oh here we go I have my head piece back on again it was a robocall\nThey got me they got me I did not know for the next ten Fifteen seconds until I said hello hello and they now have programs where they go excuse me I didn't hear you\nAnd then I started screaming you stupid rich and I'm ... by the way that was the least of what I was calling a ... of course they don't have a program to answer that I put it was great fun robo calls but no the bottom line is if you ... the IRS never makes a phone call\nCollections agencies will and you simply say you stop it you do we do this by mail you're done talking to me they'll call you again and you've heard me say a million times used the magic word harassment\nAlso you can say I've been a which I Love is I'm recording this phone call I just want to let you know you staying on the phone call you stay on the phone with me you're allowing me to record the phone call\nClick\nUnless it is a legitimate collection agency where they're following all the rules say absolutely no problem no problem you recording this you owe them money\nAnd okay\nSo much for that All right ah well come back we have more this is handle on the law\nKFI listeners are when I found out from the first one I just won a
