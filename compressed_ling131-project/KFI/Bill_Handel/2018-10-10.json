about that as a matter of fact seven o'clock we're going to be talking to ABC News correspondent peak Coons\nColds or who is in Panama City\nFlorida where he scuba gear\n[noise] for sure they're paying at the cat for right now but yeah everybody saying it could hit a category five less unbelievable but did you ever seen category for a category five something like the Richter scale like Fifteen twenty miles an hour which\nIs did you ever seen a hundred and thirty five and a hundred and forty five hundred and fifty really is no big difference yeah I mean your house is gone under any circumstances just how quickly the debris flies\nIf you I mean I hate to point out at TV versus radio but an CNN\nThey've got a really interesting little caps and they just went away but right at the bottom of the screen they have the category I don't know bard that scale and it shows as the winds pick up how much closer he gets to a category five so it just bounces so it'll show you if it ever hits a category five as I say good as to CNN pretty fascinating\nWe have not yet seen the obligatory shot of the reporter and ...

any moment now I'm Jennifer ... Lee live from the KFI twenty four hour news from hurricane Michael looks set to become the first category for hurricane to hit the Florida Panhandle forecasters are predicting storm surges up to Thirteen feet\nHurricanes expected to hit land today with the wind speaking around a hundred and forty miles an hour is man in the small town of Appalachia cola says he's not following an evacuation order\nWe have no idea what's really from uh some of us have some of his left the ones who said we're just so we're going to pray that eventually ...\nHurricane Michael is forecast to move north east over Georgia and the Carolinas and reached the Atlantic by friday the Mad Men is greater Brock Long has appeared on good morning America with some last minute evacuation warnings\nTo anybody that doesn't evacuate that experience a storm surge doesn't typically lived to tell about that story\nLong says the government is ready to help those caught up in the storm\n... position search and rescue teams to to be able to move in as quickly as we can wants the elements of the storm passed through\nAuthorities in Ventura County have seized hundreds of pounds of illegal drugs from Mexico\nAre crazy people walking up and down the beach\nNot anymore they weren't yesterday but there were partying on the beach yesterday at a cop come along a bay county sheriff's deputy came along and said say folks are kind of waited in with a beer bottles and the\nPlastic cups of liquor waded into the crowd is let's say folks I Want to be every one of you to tell me your name and your next of kin\nBecause we'll need to know who to call when you're dead that don't leave now that maybe you end up\nKnow that's pretty powerful stuff yeah you know it's something we all get out or right because a mandatory evacuations are the authorities don't have the right to force the issue do they\nThey can't force you to leave they can certainly make it uncomfortable for you to stay in one of the ways they are doing that is by saying quite truthfully look if you get stuck in a high water situation or let's say your tree has flown down on your house and you're trapped don't expect help not right away not until the winds die down because those people who were first responders will not go out and this weather\nWhich makes all the sense of the world now in terms of the first responders FEMA Red Cross a National Guard I'm assuming they're all set up and do you have information of what they're doing it in where their station right now\nYou know a region for a FEMA is space where I'm based in Atlanta and we've had a lot of conversations about this and you know after what happened in Puerto Rico last year with a response they're very keen to make sure that\nNot only do they get it right exceptionally right now but that they are perceived as getting it absolutely right in this case and so they are here they're free physician to all the supplies they think this area will need in the weeks and months to come to recover and more importantly they've stage people who will help with the rescues that will and\nEvidently the required after the wind\nOr do people stuck it high water people stuck a you know in in the houses that have\nEither broken down and collapsed around them or that have had trees or something else fall on top of them\nAnd I'm assuming a utility crews have come in from all over the country because of course one of ah the the things that happened whenever you have a hurricane or anywhere near a this kind of a category or strength is the power lines all go down and and you just need thousands of people to help out do you do see any of those and are they strategically placed\nThere not where I Am but they are strategically placed and that's the point they're going to be here hopefully to jump in as fast as possible and try to write what goes wrong in this form or they're expecting a lot of damage and the storm of they haven't said what tiger how much what they say that they expect things to be as they used the word that you use catastrophic\nYeah and just real one real quick when his ABC issued a scuba gear for you guys yet [laughter]\nI got

Lee live from the KFI twenty four hour newsroom hurricane Michael is getting close to the Florida Panhandle with category for strength winds up to a hundred forty five miles an hour the administrator Brock Long says search and rescue teams are already waiting for the moment the storm has\nPassed what you're going to see is a storm moving very rapidly through Georgia and they will maintain hurricane strength for southwest Georgia central Georgia as it passes through later today and ... and early tomorrow\nHurricane Michael will be the strongest hurricane on record for the panhandle region President Trump has said tweets urging people to listen to evacuations orders Trump is approved and emergency declaration for Florida he's been briefed on this storm today at the White House by the female administrator and homeland security secretary\nAnd Wednesday victory of course is a hurricane Michael about to hit landfall it's our cats for storm\nCatastrophic is the way it's being described also ah you get to win some money in the ... between five and twenty after every hour thousand bucks we'll give away a also don't forget to go on her social media at bill handle show Instagram Twitter Facebook\nAnd I'm west with every day we're putting things up now\nAnd it's just fun stuff\nA very deep deep thoughts of mine which uh make people really think [laughter]\nOkay so much for that right oh so you're saying we now said Nikki Haley was resigning as a matter of fact it was just a few minutes into the show when Jennifer said hey handle we have some news ah it's just been announced that Nikki Haley who is the UN ambassador has resigned I mean out of the blood\nAnd uh uh the timing is raising eyebrows so what the president did is a there was a very quickly arrange a media availability meeting in the oval office a where right afterwards after the news broke they met\nAnd Haley said her resignation was simply about needing a break after six years as the governor of South Carolina followed by two at the United nations and Trump said he knew all about it\nAnd I said he's known as long as six months ago when she told him about a desire desire to leave you know the problem is no one else knew about it even the inner Trump circle had no idea even her staff had no idea\nSo those two are obviously are trying to downplay the idea that this was very quick\nAnd die if it was planned it was one of the best kept secrets in the White House that doesn't know how to keep secrets at all well uh she's due to leave at the end of the year so it's nothing very quick giving a the president or some time to\n[noise] to choose a new UN ambassador and she's a very interesting lady she's one of the heroes or one of the superstars of the administration like by both the Republicans and the Democrats and one smart lady to save at least and one of the few who could say no to the president actually\nContradict the president when the president says a\nA show said be and and do this publicly so ah the theories why did she leave and\nUh one of the theories as she got a edged out by boat and then palm pale she wasn't hard line enough\nAnd they have effectively co-opted or the entire off for in a policy of the United states\nI ... it usually the UN ambassador doesn't have much to say about policy but clearly either they didn't like what she was doing when she can front of the president and actually went the other way publicly uh or or they want to be the choices\nThey want to choose so that's one theory that it was ... and ... and uh the other theory and this has been discounted is she wants to run for president\nI Know she is not going to run for president as a matter of fact when asked\nThat that a sort of a news conference see a\nMeeting that took place in the oval office she was she was asked she goes oh no no no no I'm not running as a matter of fact I'm going to campaign for this guy a pointing to the president and so um you know there are a bunch of theories about this uh now I I have a theory\nAnd ah I think this one makes sense and that is very very few people in senior administration position stay an entire term\nMatter of fact a lot of them may well some state a term a and even that's rare or the number of people that state two terms is even rarer and the reason is simple senior post in any administration or simply\nBrutal you don't see family you were Eighteen hour\nDays there's no such thing as any time off that pager and now the cell phone is always turned on\nA you always are going to get tax and you're going to get notifications we need you at the White House we need you at this office\nAnd especially for chief of staff more than anybody else they just they can't take it anymore Rahm Emanuel who was a Obama's first chief of staff who's now mayor of Chicago a left because he uh he said I just can't take it anymore\nIt's just it's just insanity\nAnd it's not a matter of money because these were very very bright people who otherwise could make a fortune I mean here and what do you think Nikki Haley who makes a couple of hundred thousand dollars a year how much do you think she can make on the lecture circuit\nTwo hundred thousand dollars per speech and she decides which speeches she's going to do\nAnd when and where\nBecause she will have more opportunities show will be requested by more organizations then she could ever fulfill Bill Clinton does and he I think they're going to get to a couple of hundred thousand dollars you got two hundred fifty thousand dollars a year or more\nAnd if he does want a week and I think he does more than one week let's say it's for what is forty times two hundred and fifty thousand dollars at ten million dollars\nYeah now\nA ... and ... and of course they send the private planes right they send the private jets to pick you up and you get to go and they put you open a hotel room and trust me it's not a standard room either so much theory is is that she just\nWants to have a a normal very well paying matter of fact insanely well paying life\nOr she's being kicked out by my palm pay or ... or on the president's kicking around huh how's that for theories huh analysis\nThank you very much this is why get paid the books are coming up Cal State university a universities mixed big change\nIt makes a big change to uh to classes and of course I haven't gone to see as you always am personally involved and have somebody to say about any policy changes that see as you and we'll be back in the meantime out Jennifer\nJones leads you are
