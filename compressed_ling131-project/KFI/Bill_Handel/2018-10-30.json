laws\nNow a ... have you been hearing on the political fallout saying this is way early days or the migrants orange here won't be here for a at least three weeks and this is premature at best have you been hearing any of that\nSure yeah that's really part of the conversation and if there are people who are part of this uh this chain of this a caravan who managed to catch a ride they may be here earlier than that but I think the bulk of the people if they are still on foot or won't get here and rewrite for another month maybe\nCould be forty five days before they make it to the border so yeah it's it's early ... it's interesting timing to leave but as far as the military goes there ready to follow orders melt march often go where they're told to go and that's where they're coming\nNow when you talk about the support services administrative serves of services that sort of\nThing more are they looking at the troops that are trained and those kinds of services or they simply throwing X number of troops down there and say the border patrol tell you what to do\nThat I mean that's a good point there are you know the the aircraft groups of course with the with the army with Fort Campbell in Fort Knox\nAh they obviously are trained in that that the maintenance and the support of those aircraft they're trained in that engineers will be headed down to the border those military engineers are\nAre trained in that sort of work so they try to match the skills of the people they're sending with the jobs that are required and then the obligations that are going to be mess so yeah I think they're trying to to match those things up as closely as possible\nNow how 'bout hard assets are they were is they are they bringing aircraft that are they bringing equipment Humvees that sort of thing\nYes see one thirty is a couple of those a C. Seventeen or there will be a ground vehicles that will come along with them as well to a deadly Humvees meat or whatever the next generation is so\nYeah they they have all sorts of other assets that they're bringing with them to help out with this role so it's a big job it's not as though there they'll they'll be twiddling their thumbs they will be busy and ah it could be an interesting deployment regardless of how long the less\nAnd so at this point do we have any timeline is when they're going to be in place and ready to deal with the migrant caravan coming in\nWell the first group is to be in place by the end of the week uh I mean that's pretty quick they move fast and and they'll get down here in in position by then over the next several weeks and you'll have the rest of this deployment fifty two hundred active duty people strung out from California all the way over here to Texas so\nThe timing is not such that the troops are in place and then they just sit around and wage or the timing is such that it's going to be fairly close to win the migrants approach or hit the border or do I have that right\n[noise] yeah they they will be there before this if there is a large group of two thousand three thousand migrants show up all at one time asking for asylum and are going to start that process and uh you know these folks will be in position already backing up the
