morning to ABC's Jason Nathan's in mourning Jason\nFirst of all an answer your question yes it is you yeah\nThe Dodgers so just so you know I'm used to it but [laughter] so Halloween made over thirty two male and its second week in theaters\nDid which is a little lower than expected but I mean if it was or thinking maybe forty million which would I actually had been high because a lot of these movies they dropped more than fifty percent so forty million would have been much less than a fifty percent\nDrop in a very ... specific movie like Halloween\nYeah exactly six one Seventy one\nThis is actually the eleventh if you're counting all of them this would have been the eleven no and\nThe franchise yeah not all of them that Jamie Lee Curtis not all of them I only two of them I Believe that John Carpenter the original one and then the second one um and then he was kind of a part of a producer on this one then there was some Rob Zombie ones there I mean there's been a lot of different\nHalloween iterations over the years so this was but this one they're saying you know it was the truth is equal to the Nineteen Seventy eight original which by the way had it's forty year anniversary over the weekend as well so it's been forty years since that first one a premier in Los Angeles and ... a forty years ago Saturday\nAnd it was the first movies I made my dad take me too and he hated horror movies\nThere well I mean you know and it brought in a kind of slasher flick that we haven't really seen before that\nStates started a lot of that stuff and it was panned at the time I mean it really good they've got terrible reviews at the time but it became a classic it made some of them like Seventy two million dollars worldwide\nWow today in today's dollars which would be over two hundred and Seventy million dollars so it was it was very successful which is why they kept doing I'm I'm I don't know if they moved to a lot of them but you know here we are\n... years later so Jim Carrey gets this award or this Charlie Chaplin war that took place here in Los Angeles right now but it doesn't really helping the honey awards and that's a British made some assuming that if\nThe British Academy awards or the British Academy or the ... the people who do the ... and things like that they gave out the britannia words on friday a couple of different kinds of awards but the one that he got was the Charlie Chaplin award for humor ah which you know\nOkay Jim Carrey cool you know ... very funny a Jim Carrey hasn't been very funny it was a year or so\nFew for if you've been following Jim Carey's been very very political uh mostly painting and painting political art\nI'm at ... at this event if the Beverly Hilton he chose to use this time to really go in on President Trump and the different political issues are talking about the president he said shameless to this is not nor will ever be a superpower is the mark of a villain\nKidnapping children is not what great nations do\nAnd he also said almost half of America this moment believes there's a sinister deep state diabolical plotting to what give them health care um so that was kind of a funny one\nAnd he actually he or she opened um you need a little bit of humor although you know it it made me a little too soon he opened with um that sang 'cause this was All right ... everybody was it that the peak of the the mail bombs on friday when he would friday night when he did this\nAnd they opened his speech with a joke saying the award I'm Glad it didn't come in the mail\nLong shot\nJoined again and I I watch that I watched and I can't remember who was he pointed at a a ... and he's had\nTo say like they had a conversation about it he is Cate Blanchett as in that he was talking to you\nSo ah and here's the thing about that is what's funny is that like you say it carries vocal about his politics and things like that in the last year or two or three uh eh it's and to be given an award like this\nAt some point you got to look at it and go by what what was the real purpose of giving him this word was it to draw attention to that drawing attention to themselves because they put him up there and they knew he was probably going to say something like that\nMaybe I mean you know what defines a career he's been he has been a very funny guy for a very long time ago showing in his career maybe he is not do if if you're watching the it's not really funny but his Showtime show kidding which is fantastic and\nAnd really kind of dark interesting portrait of a a guy who like Mr Rogers' type guy I find that I find it very interesting\nI think is very good at it to not ace Ventura type slapstick stuff though you know it the Jim Carey\nShow them a lot of range over the years and this shows a little bit more but that's a very good series as well although I don't think he is being honored for specifically that here is because not a lot of people are actually watching it are paying attention to it but it's very good\nWell on the other side of the political slash entertainment aisle Kanye West has a new line of shirts\nI yes he does he is calling for helping push a cause which is for a black sick you've heard of breakfast right\nThis is a black say which is a black exit from the Democratic party\nAnd he helped design these shirts which turned up over the weekend made their debut at the turning point us says young black leadership summit a so they have these shirts there for sale you can see them on the website and they say on the black sea and we free and their hats and stuff as well [noise]\nUh and the one of the woman in charge of it said they get ... designed them you helped put them together um you know and\nI don't think that the young black Leadership Conference was that that was the group that was at the White House on friday I wasn't it\nI Believe so and it wasn't the one where he were President Trump speaking rain on friday over the or over the weekend I'm so he uh\nThat would explain the connection that have gone you organized with these guys\nAnd I don't know if President Trump picked up a black shirt or a free hat or what\nBut it's very possible but you know as Rolling Stone also points out Kanye West is saying this um and talking about a black accent from the Democratic party and on one hand and on the other hand giving Seventy three thousand dollars to the Democratic Chicago mayoral candidate so\nOn you did yeah so you know I don't know exactly where his\nBoss and he's not be putting out shirts that say exit black exit from the Democratic party but he is is he is he suggesting where to go to or just get on there no\nNo and that's that's been tiniest thing he says you know everybody needs to think freely think for themselves of course he wears the make America great again hat but he's not necessarily\nSaying everybody needs to be a Republican or that he's necessarily Republican he just he believes in Trump and you know that's that's where the line is for him\nSo and finally The Simpsons apparently going to be dropping the quickie Mart owner blue from the series which is kind of one of those things where people probably wondering what's taking so long I mean that's one of those accent accent that when they first came out everybody liked to do and as time has gone by they realize that it's really not so cool to be doing that accent\nIt's especially if you're Indian Andrea and\nWho grew up with The Simpsons which is with the whole point of ...\nAnd a couple of people give it like seemed like it was a random thing I intend to random it's just happening too much other\nWell this was major intact because he posted I did ... I don't remember this was what he posted on gab\nOr if this was somewhere else where he said I'm going in yeah going right before he went in and did that but he had been he'd been raping on that gab platform\nYeah ... well you're right to bring in the heat to gab who was suspended by their um hosting provider pay pal shut them down stripe which is a a different payment service they shut\nThem down because I guess ah companies are realizing that they can not be in bed with that level of hate speech\nIt was interesting to see how bold this guy specifically was saying what he said as soon as he as soon as he gotten cups or be even before he got in touch they asked the I mean I don't even know that they asked me just volunteer all these Jews need to die\nAt just the blatant sea of of saying that now it's ... it's not even I mean I guess he got into a real short shootout or a gunfight with cops who got there but I don't know if you've been running out avoided for cops yeah\nAnd then eventually just came out I don't know if he ran out or a bullets or what but it just the the the balls on the guy just as well and I'm doing it and\nThe only Max's trouble now because uh you will notice that he's facing twenty nine federal charges\nAnd one of them I says you're using a firearm to commit murder and I haven't seen the charging instrument but I'm assuming that to what we call at nine to foresee using are carrying a gun in relation to a drug trafficking crime or crime and violence\nThat is a huge amount of mandatory consecutive time on top of whatever else you're gonna get and I want to see if there's more than one of those counts because if you get multiple of those counts\nAll that consecutive time get stacked one on another on another he could find himself basically looking at life plus\nHow is he not in any way shape or form looking at that regardless\nYeah but I'm saying as a simple matter of no charge and here's a yeah without any other consideration or anything you know he's not going anywhere I don't think so nor should he and of course in response to that shooting a the LAPD has stepped up\nPatrols around places of worship\nHere in Los Angeles

stories that we're hearing of course the eleven people killed in Pittsburgh I synagogue on Saturday morning that is by far the biggest one and on a local story that is\nNot particularly important to me by important the sports fans especially in light of what happened on Saturday\nThe Dodgers lost All right so maybe next\nYear why not anybody ever lost a three a World Series in a row don't believe I think it's only two right they just hide the record for having lost you think it's only happened once or twice before in the thirties or forties yeah\nHey a guy guy a dummy fast money weekdays it two pm on CNBC a guy you know that's down are you a baseball fan\nI think the Yankees probably obliterated the Dodgers a few years back in the fifties so but I if you want me to look it up I can go to Google machine\nA yeah just curious you don't have to uh Alex To look it up that's her job\nWell that's what else does and you know that's what she does\nA yeah All right let's do it move on Mondays we have a some a fun stuff to talk about and there\nIs some discussion going on about the estate tax\nAnd why the wealthy people hate it so much because they're the ones that get nailed with the estate tax and it's bounced all over the place and I'm One of those people that hate the estate tax and not because I'm going to be taking advantage well eleven million dollars being left you a per person\nBeing left to the kids which means if I had the money I'd be able to with Marjorie leave twenty two million dollars yeah like that's going to happen in this lifetime and that's without any kind of a state tax but the philosophy of the state tax and that is you really don't own your money you're merely renting your money\nIn the government owns it from day one I mean what a crock\n[noise] well it's a government or it's it's a crook but at least listen you just mentioned it so the estate tax the JOBS Act raised it now so it's eleven point one eight million per individual starting this year two thousand and eight teams go into twenty twenty five but\nThat's double the amount that it used to be I think it was a you probably know better than I but I think it was five million\nPrior or they're about so at least\nThe numbers higher but it you're right I mean if you've earned it you pay taxes on that money your whole life you\nKnow why do you have to give it back it it doesn't make a lot of sense now that obviously people come down on both ends of the spectrum a lot of it falls on party lines\nA lot of people think you know you should get back to society and you know you don't need all that much money other people and you've just sort of verbalize it you know you weren't that you should keep it if you want to give it to your kids want to give it to charity you want to put it in your coffin with you that should be you're right\nIt's fascinating the way you describe the left in the right wing or the left wing the people that are obviously in favor of a state tax or they believe in taxing people who are in the money at the highest level\nAnd then turn around and effectively say whatever's left after whatever point the law currently says that goes back\nTo the government to I mean if that is not a redistribution of wealth if they I I don't know why didn't they call this the Carl Marx\nA national tax asked a dry it drives me completely nuts but politically speaking a how potent is each side historically\nA if you listen I think you are the great um purveyor of history so you know better than I Do I think\nLook I I it starkly I think the the conservative side of the equation makes the most sense to the most amount of people um I think people can understand\nThat if you've earned that money why should you have to give it back to the government I think most people can wrap their heads around that but I think there is a faction and affection is growing stronger\nCalifornia's thinking Norman ... making poverty hunger and homelessness right now they need to make sure we all as resorts California's ... governors make our love when their priority\nAfter an accident people are confused emotional shaken Johnny can't here

biggest the synagogue attack on Saturday leading eleven people dead a hate crime Dodgers lose last night they're done\nHopefully next year orange continue on with them all on Monday and guy a dummy a guy let's start now talking about Microsoft and Amazon where the employee backlash about military work is going on an Amazon Microsoft said too bad\nYou know that's what we do my question is when they come to the point where employees actually have a say in the kind of business and employ your ah takes ...\nThat's a great question I mean in Nineteen eighty four remember James Cameron relief or the Terminator and remember that whole premise of that was the company sky net and they were doing work with the military and sky and that's going to become aware and blah blah blah and it's going to start this war potentially\nI think that it's funny I'm thirty four years later or whatever it is\nA lot of people thinking that's what's coming to fruition and they're concerned that companies like Amazon or Microsoft list is pretty long does work with the military artificial intelligence\nAnd its use you know basically their technology can be weaponized so I think that's what a lot of that only employees a lot of citizens concerned about to answer your question um\nI I don't know you know I don't know if you have\nKnow large faction of your work or base starts to protest I don't know what you'd do quite frankly um but it's interesting these same people um will do business with the Chinese and the Chinese that are basically stealing our intellectual property they have no problem with that so\nI again I hate to use the same phrase but this is a multi faceted so interesting and I think ... ... again like the last conversation a lot of it comes down on party lines along party lines like so many things are these day\nYeah and how is that how are these companies responding they ignore and and they say things like we appreciate your concern but look up SOL in the dictionary uh how how are they in\nYeah I think that's ... well I I don't think they're saying look up SOL which you and I know what that stands for and you can go to Google machine to find out but a lot of companies saying you know we discuss these inches these issues with the government and you know we're going to use them in an ethical way and you\nKnow they're saying all the right things um and you know very often for more coal\nYou know he said the same thing I mean you know where they're going to be used in an ethical way we're on top of this but there'll be hypocritical because again you know if you don't like us doing it here to help our military to help us there\n... think about these technology companies to stop doing business with the military based on whatever concerns there are that were war mongers or somebody weaponize\nYet the same companies or other companies to do business with potentially our enemies and that puts us behind the eight ball yeah I'm not trying to get I'm Crazy here but that's sort of the other end of the spectrum you know if you get if you are so concerned about doing business with the military here I'm ... then there's the bigger threat I mean potentially\nWe put ourselves at risk for sure so I don't know the answer in terms of what the you know how much the employees can effect change in this regard\nAll right let's move over to a the a push for electric cars or GM is now pushing big time even a as our president is rolling back the uh the ... the emission standards in anything having to do with the invite\nYou know what I mean you hear outrage the first thing you have to say is why are they outraged typically because\nMoney is at stake and that's exactly what's going on with GM I mean I'd love to be able to tell you it's because you know there there there's some benevolent to it but the bottom line is because they're such a huge amount of money invested in it and there are the point now in their culture and their history whether on the precipice\nOf electric cars and turning the page or turning the corner they don't want anything to stop that and you know the president's going to roll back emission standards that's not gonna you know ironically is not going to help them\nHey ah how far behind is a GM in this technology and his ... years to catch up or they're basically there'd be there very quickly\nIs obviously um they were the first mover and they still have a significant lead but ... companies are absolutely catching up so I don't think\nAlthough I think the the recognition might be a couple of years away that technology is not that far behind and if you look and I know you get um email from them out he is right on the precipice as are a number of other companies so\nI think it all the tests the was the first mover and recently ... stock has been doing very well the competition is catching up in a meaningful way and it's just a matter of time\nIf we're still doing the ten years from now bill my sense\nIs my you know Nineteen sixty eight G.
