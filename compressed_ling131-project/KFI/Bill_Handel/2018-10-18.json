Jim Ryan the gym this dancer in when it comes to accidents in states where marijuana has been legalized so what are the numbers\n[laughter] yes it they look first of all this all comes from the insurance Institute for highway safety Gen\nThey'd been studying the numbers coming out of the first war period to legalize recreational marijuana Colorado Nevada Oregon and Washington state and in those states and the insurance Institute has found a ... percent increase in the incidence of car accidents\nThat they have those numbers are against the neighboring states Idaho and Montana the other states where it's not yet there are ...\nAnd climate in fact about six percent more car crashes are happening there and the Institute says smoking marijuana marijuana use by drivers that's probably the reason\nI have to wonder if it's because maybe people who weren't marijuana smokers are now trying it since it is legal in those states that don't know how it impacts them directly because they're new to it honestly\nWell potentially that's true but there's still if you're pulled over and you're found to be impaired border region from alcohol marijuana from prescription drugs\nYou're breaking the law so you're right it it may be people who are accustomed to it through for knowing the facts but regardless if you're not supposed to be driving after using these drugs who stole the effect that really affected worn off\nYeah and so I assume that the message is a pretty basic one if you consume you know anything basically don't drive or at least find another way home or see where you are or something but also age do the states where um where marijuana has been legalized have the police come up with good ways to detect whether somebody is\nDriving over the legal limit like we have with alcohol\nYou know and that's a big problem you're you're you're touching on something that the insurance Institute of concern about most states don't even include information on driver drug use in crush reports at all\nAnd now it may you know they they may do field sobriety tests and determine with a a a breathalyzer something that you've had too much alcohol but the the permitting that you've had too much of anything else is difficult\nIt's often very simply on observation of the police officer red eyes or the other stuff that might be found in a vehicle which writes it is a difficult thing and we're in kind of a brave new world when it comes to teach the use by drivers\nAnd ... of the states where it has been legalized are cops saying that they are\nUm I I don't know if you've been part of this but how has it come out with their costs are saying that they're pulling more people over on suspicion of some sort of driving under the influence whether it be drugs or alcohol finding that more of them are driving under the influence of marijuana you know in addition to just to not just the crashes but just overall you\nNo one knew just packed up everything the Eighteen

making any furtive moves not reaching for anything literally just walking in a cop pulls up and shoots him\nAnd that's what the video shows and again I said what happens before after but you see what happens for see this is one of those videos where I don't think the police can say oh well the video started and what happened before or you have to look at in consider because\nThis is not body

all in black\nI don't see ah the ... I don't see the uh the problem here I really don't maybe I'm missing something\nWell the problem is it's I mean I don't know that it's that outrageous because generally when a description of summarize given but the problem is the description was so vague that it wasn't really of helps I don't know what he dressed in black highlighted his race and so some people were offended\nI Know I see I don't buy that now we're going a little bit too far in terms of political correctness here it is an African American this high stress an all black hooded sweatshirt and he was staring at\nA this kid one of our students at a Starbucks now you can argue whether he should at least that at all\nWhether the principal should have warned because this is off of off site et cetera Starbucks but to describe who it was odd because it happened to be an African American uh no I'm a be\nThat's the only reason that the the auto was suspicious because it was a black probably don't need to get in a white person doing whatever the guy was doing nobody would've thought on but you know\nThat's I'm Glad the parents would put put themselves in the principal's mind that he wouldn't have any of course even assuming he wouldn't have he's willing to admit that so come on it's a it's a little bit much alright salmonella or you\nKnow a federal officials said that there's a strain of salmonella it's gotten almost a hundred people sick and its antibiotic resistant\nWhere you can actually there's\nBook of salmonella chicken [noise]\nDon't know if it all now are you ...

okay that's why\nAs a caravan of Central American migrants trying to come to the U.S makes its way north President Trump says he will use the military to close our southern border\nNow there's going to be a huge outcry\nIt's Trump Josh shooting from the yeah that's all it's just hymns\nViewing there will be no military or you don't need a military to stop twelve hundred migrants from coming to the border I the border patrol just says no thank you and so\nIt's not going to it's it's not going to happen and it's just not he's also threatening to to mess with aid yeah ... it's it's it's just it's all bluster although I read\nI read it that Mexico has sent to um big jet liners filled with military people down to their southern border to try to stop it and I don't know if you want to take that as they don't want to pick off president but I actually do want to try to stop it I think so because they are afraid of what he might do I\nThink they were there just simply showing that there are cooperative and died because of the deal was cut with Mexico and United States and they signed on and they just want to show were good guys that's what I think\nJoe Biden's got a message for Democrats should they take control of the house [noise]\nSays\nYoung soldier horses and don't try and if he's the president [noise] too quickly that\nThis is crazy for them to even talk and that's what I thought all it does is guaranteed Donald Trump's twenty twenty victory a bit there at this point there is no impeachable offense\nWhat so ever none zero and if it turns out\nEven if the president was involved in trying to uh somehow a mental with the Russians with the election I don't know if that's even impeachable because we're talking about high crimes and misdemeanors in office and he wasn't and also the constitutional issue all the way up\nSo this is talk of impeachment is politically stupid beyond stupid just like with Bill Clinton\nRight it was just stupid or it\nIt it was never going to go any place to be they impeached him but he said it wasn't even close to the trial so it was it was nuts well\nAre they got out of the stormy and now it's summertime for Trump's

going to happen it will be dismissed because she is a political figure and much like the other case that was dismissed against Stormy Daniels for defamation same thing uh you'd call me a liar there for\nA high you you've defame me it's not going to go any place although the a Trump order saying that the lawsuit is politically motivated\nI don't think so I don't buy that I think she came forward just because she's pissed off at a at him\nA former president of USA Gymnastics has been arrested in connection with the Larry Nassar case\nWhat does the penny former president of USA
