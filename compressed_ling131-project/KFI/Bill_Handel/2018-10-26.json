{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "Or will it that's the root of the debate about this props Josh block with the humane society of the United states lays down the intent of the measure about\nTwelve will make sure farm animals are confined in cages are right now it's still legal to so veal from Bebe cabs who were taken away from the mother shortly after birth and confined in a crate so small they could barely move their entire life\nUh it's it's still legal to sell pork from these big factory farms that confined mother pigs in cages barely larger than the pigs own body they're unable to move for four years you know for as long as we go to high school these mother pigs can't even move\nA and a and sadly it's also a we still legal in in ... currently widespread to sell eggs from\nHans confined in Baron wire cages where they can barely move and they're forced to eat sleep a desiccated lay eggs in the same small space every single day and so by voting yes on prop twelve we can make sure of cage free conditions for these animals or otherwise are horribly treated\nSo who's against prop twelve unpredictably some farm interest groups such as the national pork producers and the California Farm Bureau but also pita and the humane farming association\nOr proposition twelve is a cruel trail and not only a farm animals but if California voters and context is everything here\nAnd say Geoff ... director Bradley Miller and the contacts he's referring to is another proposition from a decade ago prop too which did basically the same thing that prop twelve is trying to do\nProposition to is overwhelmingly supported by California voters who were told by both sides that a yes vote on proposition to mean industry cages would be completely outlawed no later than two thousand and Fifteen\nAnd they would receive at least as much space is to be able to fully ecstatic both wings without it countering another hand or the side of their cage that's generally considered to be two feet\nThe problem with prop Tuesday that left a lot open to interpretation and block says this measure fixes that with specific parameters\nYes the humane society in the intervening years between proposition to and proposition twelve changed his own position cages it actually lobby for federal bill that would have established cages nut case free\nBut cages as a national standard and would have prevented states from ever outlawing cages are ever giving them more than one square foot\nSo it's just us itself has been co-opted they changed their position now they're coming back to California arm in arm with some of the biggest players in the industry to repeal California's vote for cage free by two thousand Fifteen\nAnd repeal California's demand that they received more than one square foot and in its place including proposition twelve which adopts the industry is guidelines\nMiller though he says the humane society has softened his stance on cages\nPrep too was a huge success but it's been ten years it's time to update the standard to ensure that the pork veal and ... and the state don't come from caged animals and also increase space for these animals so they're not in cages at all\nBock says the notion that prop twelve reveals any part of props you as a complete fabrication what's more he says prop twelve but give California district is standards in the nation on the space given the animals blog also says the prompt doubles as an environmental measure\nThat will you know prep twelve in doesn't just create better conditions for animals but it creates more sustainable farming and that's why the leading environmental groups are all part of the coalition likes here\nClub natural resources Defense Council leave conservation voters earth justice and many more and and the reason being is that these confinement operations\nOr pollute the air and water and soil and they decimate rural communities of because of all the pollution that runs into a into voting yesterday ... such as good for animals is that just makes or food safety better because of better conditions for animals leading to save for food but it also makes our environment cleaner\nAnd there's a lot more to this debate for example what the farming industry has to say about this problem and you can hear that and more by downloading the proposition ...

ABC's Mary Beth clerk\nGood morning America wanting how are you I'm great how are you oh let's see how many weeks is it now for weeks from Black Friday\nYet for her for that exactly\nIs it does is it really ... for one thing on friday anymore is it still considered friday\nAnd then ... them they they have on Black Friday but I think more than that black or white and a lot of the ... going on all month leading up to that kind of get tired of the pond or\nSo or with the barrel or chips in tricks and stuff still for Black Friday shopping and it just seems like a it's not an adequate because you know I think\nSome people actually enjoy it I hear people talking about how they they love staying up late you know or it right after Thanksgiving they you know they get to nap and after the trip to fend kicks in with turkey and then they'll go get line if they're not already in line\nAt that I'm finally wrapped up in the ... and ... and I'd have to compete with other people out there but there are there are really great deals that they had that the people coming back but there isn't that what about their kids have got to everything that had to fight it out to spend money to spend a lot of good quality product so\nWhen we talk about Black Friday or we specifically only talking about ... at this point or is that is is is sort of Cyber Monday included in the black friday nomenclature I guess for\nEither they're they're all together and there will be of course I Am sure Amazon don't have the up on Black Friday as well a lot of 'em don't get it in an online game because they know that's why people are shopping if they're on the computer and I found on Cyber Monday than hoopla and are even as an actor Cyber Monday that or we could also just more idea of the field\nAnd maybe it's just me feeling a little get off my long with your moral Yukon founded kids I got a mall near where I live and they practically gutted and started over trying to revitalize the stores and you know when you trying to get the kids and\nYou know to come back to uh do you do you see any kind of resurgence to record motors especially with with things like Black Friday\nI Want to get myself but I did think I mean and the environment ran right now there's a lot of added to allow that got out of business do whatever they start in ... but traffic back in because they know that even if you're there for what is special thing like the like and in fact I like it some more money out of it but that although I got to plan ahead\nAnd buy it because they don't want to get you to find something to buy it um but that is the help they want to get people back in the story and that this is the one way to get a share\nIn the primary stuff obviously is probably tech stuff that people are going for\nA lot of TV not Catholic but also um ethic and reports our research shows that November a really good at the chicken highly or to buy later at biases refrigerators ranges washer and dryer on that it it took an update or something right now like they had a good ... well now that kind of look into that\nSo in and of course toys with Christmas coming up that's probably a big thing is well\nOh yeah so I mean parents I probably have already heard whatever the audit by it that had once it gets I probably didn't address I'm not sure what that play it but there's always going to take one show that that'll be accurate I got to parents [laughter]\nSo and we were talking before about just how big black friday is is is would you say that shoppers I mean is there a certain percentage that you would say that that have had it with the black friday crowds\nAre a lot of things that I think it is people who are just like it that are kind of over ... the overall my wife but they're not going to you

can criticize me at will even blaming me for the currents spate of bombs yet when I criticize them they go wild in screen it's just not presidential\nYeah here's the problem when you're the

presidential\nAnd that's right eat there are blaming him he's blaming the Democrats\nAre for the bombing or or at least encouraging the bombing is is great this is\nThis is typical Trump stuff or the

decision to stop the immigrants from coming in and then it'll go to the Supreme Court and dot net will always happen before election day I doubt it\nYou think ah now that I'm sort of a hard argument for them to make I mean 'cause before with the immigration stuff they you know it was it was a matter of security whereas if people are just coming here to ask for asylum right\nA little bit of Oregon very there are I there was an argument saying that uh that of the terrorists they dig up many of them did come from certain of those countries Saudi Arabia although Saudi Arabia is off your original list a but at least there was a tenuous argument to argue that his national security to keep people from Central America\nFrom coming in to or even asking for asylum which is legal legal out to do that and somehow connecting that to national security on the basis of well there may be middle Easterners in this crowd or there may be tourists are terrorists although there's zero\nZero evidence of

not going to say exactly everything they did because you never tell everything but are there are many different methods that are used to make sure that a dangerous package does not get\nWhere it wants to get one thing is a lot of places have multiple receiving facilities meaning let's say you have the main building everybody's working there the mail to that building in some cases comes to a location first all the mail comes to a location first that might be several miles away\nAnd his screen to their deaths every piece of mail every single piece of mail comes first to an offsite bang

is somewhat secured metal detectors going in sheriff's our federal police ah that is going to be caught fairly early on that has a fairly safe building right\nOr if they don't have that they're still

D and a lower cost [noise]\nI just ah ah housekeeping matter for those of you who are aware of it though there was another suspicious packets\nOperation a involving a suspicious box that was found leaning against the three of the heart that's been resolved that it is not connected to this a or a similar to this it is also a a contains a nothing hazardous so that has also been resolved if you were following the developments in that and [noise]\nUm I Want to especially command\nOf the work of the postal inspectors but also uh the work of the six hundred thousand postal employees across the country who I've been working within the postal system to locate these packages before they're delivered\nUm and to alert authorities and this is an example on the part of a one vote for her when she saw this recognize that frozen in the system and was able to resolve that before it got delivered to a location in Manhattan so very good work here so we're not going to be able to take questions\nAlright press conferences over and uh that was a the deputy commissioner for counterterrorism and to and uh I guess that's basically had counterterrorism from the New York police department and once again here is a\nAnother bomb truck driving through the streets going off to a whatever location they do to explode the or the suspicious package or investigated I assume at this point is do they just take it and explode the thing\nUh or are they simply keep it figure out which I think is the case\nI they investigated they look at it very carefully figure out that it is not a threat like the other ones are we're not uh uh they were not manufacture to explode and then there's another piece of forensic evidence now there are twelve\nUnless there's one more and do we came in a right when the press conference started and was a the deputy commissioner deputy chief or the NYPD for terrorism or Michael was that a new is this the thirteenth package\nNo I think that we're referring to the original one with the Clapper in that that was that that was sent to the CNN offices to address to him\nOkay fair enough right before we have um [noise]\nKenneth Starr a show up\nA let's let me talk about ah the plan to reduce Medicare drug prices we do that any way and no doubt going to follow the story whenever there is anything breaking I'll go ahead and do that the latest on this is the two new packages that were sent\nA and this one a particularly to James Clapper at the CNN building in New York\nAnd so once again New York and it's always a mess in New York they block off streets and clear out buildings and die if anything else\nUh the perpetrator of or these\nAttacks are if not committing out now terrorism or maybe making a massive political statement which may be the case\nBecause all of these packages were sent to either a people detractors of Donald Trump or enemies of Donald Trump who are not being particularly political or outright Democrats who are very liberal was one of those two\nI ... I'll tell you who's ever doing this certainly succeeding and screwing up New York\nI mean that is if that's what they want to do they succeeded admirably All right so a coming up by just before the election of course the president is issuing a many new statements many new programs in one of them\nIs that he wants to Medicare to start paying similar prices to what other countries do for certain prescription drugs so here's the problem\nIs in the United states the price of drugs are so high no place in the world even begins to compare with the price of drugs that we pay for ... the prescription drugs it's out of control even Medicare that totally controls every aspect\nOf the medical coverage it's virtually untouchable when it comes to the drug industry and that's because of some very powerful lobbying from uh the drug folks from big pharma so with the president has done and here is his ... proposal is that other countries who negotiate\nWith the drug manufacturers I mean the country's negotiate\nAnd that's how they keep their prices down if for example Germany has to go she needed a much better price for insert name of drug here then automatically we as Americans don't pay any more money a bill or\nJust a real quick started yet and CNN is reporting that a federal authorities have arrested a man or wow in connection with the mail packages apparently I think they said that they arrested him in Florida but we'll give you more information has that comes in\nThat is and let's let's figure out how long that truck because keep in mind them ... I'll do the Trump Administration business later maybe will pick it up on Monday because there's so much breaking right now with these packages\nSo wow we have ...\nOh so far and we were told that it looked like they came from South Florida\nThat was the information that was released or to the public\nAnd we're talking and I was in the interview that I was watching with a terrorism expert and I think even when brought that up that ... I Believe me there's a lot more information they had that they were not releasing\nAnd because of these packages they did not blow up these bombs did not blow up a they have twelve on their hands or at least ten that they were able to do forensic examination of the the other two were fairly new\nI they had enough information enough evidence there that makes it almost impossible for someone not to have been caught and I was just a question of time and there was an arrest right now my guess is that they're pretty solid on who they were arrested I don't think\nThat this is going to be one of those persons of interest\nOr that or questioned and then let go arrested and then let go for lack of evidence because you have virtually the entire FBI ATF or the postal office their inspectors or the city of New York called the police departments are all going crazy here working together\nOr to determine where and when and how and most importantly\nAnd do so I Want to repeat what has just been released just a few minutes ago and that is there someone a man has been arrested in and he is someone may oh did he say man didn't they they do say man OK so a male person has a male and the sense of male has been arrested\nI lean on and I I and that's all right thank you so much although it was a little confusing writes ah it's sure why not I has been arrested in terms of by the way I was just screwing around with this I just in case you think I'm a complete moron\nI Will come back a tennis star is with us a special prosecutor during the Clinton investigation and boy did we ask some questions about him you think anybody knows more about what's going on in Bob bowlers mind then I can start probably not we'll be right back KFI am six forty\nBy listeners are winning by\nThat one and\nRight now the only difference between them and you\nPick your next chance to win is coming up in the next twenty minutes\nOkay bass than letting her radio station\nHurt it just now from a handle on Michael pros or live in front of the KFI twenty four hour news or CNN is reporting we haven't been confirmed yet that CNN is reporting that federal authorities say they've arrested a man in connection with all the packages containing suspect exposes over the last week again it no more information\nFor in this case ... originally asked to investigate one small aspect and all of a sudden it becomes wider and wider on what your comment on that is that appropriate is logical is that what you should be doing is that part of your mandate\nThe answer is yes yes and yes ah [laughter]\nWhen I I'll tell you about modern just a second\nBut when I arrived in Little Rock to take over the investigation which is already under way it was a hydro already there were many different dimensions the investigation whitewater ended up being simply an umbrella name but it's a misnomer because there were many at different branches of the investigation including\nThe fraudulent buildings of Webster Hubble Hillary's law\nPart right we actually interviewed him and a boy he went down hard on me well he did it because\nThere's such a he's such a good guy but he got himself into a whole lot of ah heard in terms of financial problems he fraudulent lead build including the federal government you should never do that that's a very bad ideas but that's an illustration of how wide spread the investigation was now let's talk about Bob Mueller\nI before we do that real quick uh because uh this end it of course with the most famous part of the investigation and that was the Monica Lewinsky a Bill Clinton affair legitimately or literally a ... just real quickly when did you know\nThat it really did happen because it was a while before Clinton for example when the wagging the finger I did not have sex with a woman how early on were you looking at each other's oh yeah he did it\nWell we operated on the hypothesis that it was true\nOr by late January Nineteen Ninety eight and of course it took many months for this process uh unfortunately those Bill Clinton chose to keep lines of the American people but much more importantly he lied under oath and so when he knew that he committed perjury in a civil deposition\nA whole was run by Dick Morris and what Dick Morris the great ... said\nThe American people will forgive adultery they will not forgive perjury you see hit already committed perjury so from that point on it was fight to the ...\nAnd of course I didn't lie to all of his friends the closest people remember Madeleine Albright are who are outside his cabinet secretary was stunned when she found out\nA because he had looked at her and said I didn't do it and everybody said come on you can't deal with that All right so anyway and you're not you're not a big fan of Bill Clinton when I look at the stuff you wrote and said mom I got to the point where I Would have argued you are so prejudiced\nOr the kid out of the job but you're allowed to do that aren't you as a special prosecutor\nA listener malice toward none charity ... now I don't mean that was ah hey come on [laughter]\nI was after the fact is Jacqueline you're not old enough to remember there was a guy named Jack Webb dry it Joe Friday prayers just the facts and so that's what we were after the facts just the truth\nUh and so that's that's what we uh well that's what we found the truth was the president had not just committed perjury ... going to lie about the kind of relationship that's it gets used me that is absolute rot\nBecause you've got to tell the truth if you're going to go under oath you can't lie to a federal grand jury by the way settled a case which is exactly what eventually did\nAll right let's take a break and when it come back and talk about the Mueller investigation and your thoughts on it I can start former special prosecutor and a little bit about what he's going to be doing or is doing right now\nAnd my career ketamine you've really been around the block and a good way [laughter] thing right it's not you know I'm not talking to a lady who has been through five plastic surgery [laughter] All right we'll ... we'll be right back with Ken Starr
