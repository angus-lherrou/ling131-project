morning and we say hello to ABC's ... hair and a federal judge judge dismissed Stormy Daniels defamation lawsuit against the president why what was the reasoning\nWas that it just ... like the the merit necessary to to go forward and this is the one I you know either a fresh myself\nBecause there's so many Stormy Daniels versus Donald Trump things that this was the one where she came on the view of the attorney Michael Evan Audi and released a sketch of a man\nThat she said you know kind of came up to her during an exercise class with her then baby daughter and and threatened her to leave Donald Trump alone and\nShe assumed that it was Michael Cohen or one of his henchmen out to get her released a sketch of this uh something that the president you know almost instantly mocked and\nWe talked about this uh you know\nA sketch years later about a nonexistent man called it a total con job\nAnd now uh the uh the judge has said this defamation lawsuit isn't going anywhere like eleven out is going to file an appeal with the Ninth Circuit to see if maybe he can resurrected\nAnd but what ... underground to watch what his appeal beyond\nWell the lawsuit claimed that the president acted with actual malice and reckless disregard for the truth because he posted a tweet marketing her claim that she was threatened by any chance are known\nMan to keep silent and it's involved or a two thousand six you know her two thousand six of alleged sexual encounter with with with Trump and the whole um the the whole thing says\nThat the the president caused her actual arm and and I remember she had said that this guy told her to leave Trump alone forget the story\nAnd and there's been no evidence to support the claim that this actually happened and that's part of the reason why the president's attorney called the dismissal of the lawsuit a total victory\nOkay so it's almost more of Trump's reaction that the appeal is going to be based on versus the actual hey we had this this uh the lawsuit saying hey we had to sketch of the guy and that the president said that there was never the guy was almost more of the reaction had he not done that there might not be out appeal at all\nAnd then you can usually get one of these and a pretty pretty horrible [noise] [noise]\nWell according to a couple of unnamed sources the Saudis are preparing a report in which they

it was rogue agents within the uh yeah I bet\nThat they didn't have clearance to do it I mean there was no transparency and they're going to be held responsible but the idea was I guess to interrogate him in a duck him\nOut of turkey and\nInstead that you know they ended up killing that will be that will be their story\nYeah uh I don't even I don't even know necessarily to I haven't heard the abduction part yet\nI did hear the it was they were interrogating him and they just went too far\nA buddy been interrogating him it's under torture you cannot interrogate someone to the point where you kill that person without torture\nBeing involved and are there are trying to worm their way out now what I Want to know is how much of the world's going to accept it ah I I Know we will of course

and you're not you're not going to see that the Catholic Church has gotten very sensitive to this now\nThat's an interesting point you make because I think I I think part of the reason for releasing these list in this case it's the archdiocese of Washington and they really still is thirty one priests\nAnd when they release the list they also released a statement saying nothing like this has happened in the last Twenty years and\nSo sometimes the releasing of the list is an opportunity to highlight I think it is that you no longer have this problem going\nAlso a ah been pitching and

against the wishes of gates on my dad\nThat was oh his Hodgkin's a disease goes back to Nineteen eighty three and ah so ah the treatments were successful but it left him exhausted and he said you know I've got to do more with my life than this one to reevaluate my priorities\nSo Microsoft wow went public in eighty six a first date Allen shares worth a hundred and thirty four million dollars\nAnd his network as of yesterday was over twenty billion dollars so after leading Microsoft or he decided he wants to donate to worthwhile causes and began investing in quote other people to do it exciting new creative things\nAnd he literally spent the rest of his life\nUh spending and putting his fortune to work a philanthropic causes a a bunch of investments that professional sports teams space travel technology I had a pretty full life say the least see also live very large a as billionaires\nOf all want to do he had three shots over the course of years including the octopus\nOr one of the world's most famous yachts four hundred and fourteen foot with a basketball court to helicopters and it had to submarines\nPretty impressive\nAh he also owned the Portland trail blazers in Seattle ...

one of the most valuable properties in or all of Southern California maybe even the country uh it's on the market for a hundred and fifty billion or a million dollars hundred and fifty million dollars for a piece of property\nAnd over the course of his life\nHe donated more than two billion dollars to libraries museums AIDS research or even the search for ETs extra terrestrial life so it was all over the place to see say the least\nAnd he was a very early signatory to giving the giving pledge a which is committed to contributing a majority of his wealth to philanthropic causes\nAnd most of it or was funneled through the Allen Institute which funds research into brain science sell science artificial intelligence and so he was an early early advocate of these billionaires taking their mass\nOf wealth\nAnd upon their death or even throughout their lives instead of just handing it to their kids and starting these dynastic wealth families gives it away\nTo ... a ... a ... so and
