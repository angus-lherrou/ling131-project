[noise]\nIt's Wednesday October third what's new today on the free I our radio\nWith the with all the best pointless talk at all in one athlete rocked up every ... doctors dog family radio station my only experience\nFree I plan your\n\n\nGood lord okay mornings from six to ten on campus [noise]\nI Am\nVoting my simulating talk we're going to talk about his story coming out of the New York times in just a second some of the other stories were watching and the KFI twenty four hour news or a group of teens arrested for a high profile burglaries apparently had a lot of celebrities in mind here in Southern California\nInvestigators say three people hit the homes that Brianna ... league I think four times Robert Woods over the last few months\nBecause the the teams had a list of more than a dozen other stars burglars used event calendars and social media figure out when the celebrities were away and the federal health survey has found on any given day one in three American adults will eat fast food the Centers for Disease Control and prevention track ten thousand adults over four years\nLunch was the most common fast food meal\nPeople age twenty to thirty nine eight fast food more most often\nAsian people were the least likely to eat fast food and then ate it slightly more often than women were just minutes away from handle on the news this morning but right now let's say good morning to ABC's ... who's got a New York times story this morning we're up to presidents always had either self made man but this article in the New York times is saying maybe not so much\nNo it it it it really does a poke some holes into the the story that the president has been telling for years about taking what he has called a small load of a million dollars in turning it into his ten billion dollar empire and\nThat story New Yorkers have been kinda snickering at for a long time because the president's a business ups and downs have been well chronicled by the tabloids here usually with the president's own backing and in fact the New York times faulted itself\nFor kind of buying into that story and and not doing a more thorough job but now over the last year and a half three reporters have been looking at more than a hundred thousand documents and report that the president's father\nHad given him in today's dollars the equivalent of four hundred million dollars beginning when he was age three uh he was already a millionaire by age eight and so had this um this unyielding safety net during a series of of of business failures\nAnd a lot of the transfer of wealth a came without paying the requisite tax bill\nI Would assume that the money that he started making when he was three was probably some find his dad had set up for and that was maybe some return on some sort of investment or something\nWell it is that there's there's that but there's also what the paper calls a series of dubious schemes an outright fraud that now the paper says President Trump had a hand in over the years to help his father evade taxes\nAnd and I think if you you ask any trusted estates lawyer that deals with a wealthy client they would say that they'll they'll try to take advantage of any potential loophole or or or whatever they can do to keep their money away from the tax man so I don't know that it's all that surprising\nBut what the times outlined is at least unseemly\nAnd in some cases um you know potentially illegal although the allegations are too old to ever be prosecuted\nAnd President Trump's lawyer has even threatened to sue the times reliable over this article right\nThe president's attorney called up one hundred percent false and defamatory but but did not offer a detailed response and and this is a pretty thoroughly researched piece of journalism and I don't know if you've seen the printed copy of the paper um which I Know it's a bit of a relic but I still like it at\nAll right on the front page they they print some of the documents that they reviewed and some of the checks and some of the\nThe the uh the the tax statements and so they've they've gone point by point\nOver these records to to say that the president help transfer more than a billion dollars of his parents wealth to himself and his siblings\nThat would have produced a tax bill of at least five hundred fifty million dollars the papers as the family employed a variety of tax Dodgers to cut that way way down and uh when you're a real estate developer in New York that may be\nYou know if not okay at least nobody\nYou know nobody really cares or nobody's looking at it yeah when you're the president of the United states the magnifying glass gets a bit bigger\nOh for sure and I think the fact that he has touted himself as a self made man makes it kind of even worse or makes it so that if you're going to tell yourself that knowing that you are going to have every teeny tiny part of your life scrutinized\nThat better be true with every single word you either had better be the case and not saying that it it wasn't the case then yes maybe he did take that money and then parlayed into what he has today\nBut along the way it ... you know starting at the age of three I don't think that I think you know my parents were probably put in like ten bucks a month away from me for college I don't think I was getting two hundred grand a year\nAnd you know uh if only my daughter was getting two hundred years it every day with I Would not be evidence conversation a book that actually you know I I think there's you know a couple of ways to look at it there's the wealth transfers in ways that were unseemly at the least uh may be dishonest or or potentially a lot of red fraudulent\nAnd and while there is no criminal liability here the the New York State Department of taxation and finance is looking into the allegations and\nI guess potentially could ask the trumps to pay back taxes\nOkay well I Know one story just real fast that I saw an article west from Nineteen Ninety I guess the Trump Casino needed to make a loan payment so there was a man that was sent by Fred trumped the president's dad allegedly bought more than three million dollars in poker chips that he never used in New Jersey counted that as an illegal loan and I think in both to sixty five thousand dollar fine\nOr that there's another one where you know the the president or ... is in order to you know again do a transfer that you know kind of went beneath the surface\nUh bought a bunch of cleaning supplies that he said were needed for uh for for some of his buildings and and then sold them to the tendency to twenty percent markup and there was like the shell company that that that took the twenty percent markup\nHis his well All right Aaron thanks for laying out the story for us the later the later ABC's air and Kentucky\nBut even then you would think by now his security system would be so extraordinary\nBut any anybody get or is it oh God wow you're going to die to this yeah this is this the chips are you getting sick I'm not getting sick\nThen donate some chips on the air and I'm like I Love ... we all love son chip crunch but apparently your throat can't handle the well I just a little bit of dust in their in any case where we're seeing ... or ... or ... whatever the aisles maintenance and uh he must have the most extraordinary system\nHow can on the

billion dollar tax refund he uh he got with other people's money that we're investing because there was a tax loophole\nAnd that was legal the New York times is saying all of this stuff is not legal sham corporations\nThat were created to funnel money through a out a the decrease in the valuation of properties that were transferred after the death of his dad which means lower taxes well just to give you an idea\nIn terms of just raw numbers by the time the money transferred from his dad's will\nIt was a fifty five percent tax rate\nIRS tax rate they the family ended up paying five percent\nOn the money\nSo are there a is a pattern according to the times that show deception and\nA actual outright fraud a couple of other things and that is a Donald Trump of course by literally did it all himself his dad through the corporations was starting to pay him from the age of ... three\nHe was earning today's two hundred thousand dollars\nBy the age of eight he was a genuine millionaire in his forties and fifties he was received more than five million dollars a year but by then I it's it's a trust that was set up and you can't argue that but I Love the ah here's two hundred thousand dollars a year when you are three\nBy the way that small loan of a million dollars according to the times it's actually north of sixty million dollars and so\n... what happens is uh that\nAmong the very wealthy families obviously they hire an entire slew of lawyers\nAnd accountants to go through every word of the IRS code and take advantage of it this is where people a ... a lot more advantage and people like us I mean we just we don't pay hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars to accountants and lawyers to deal with the IRS\nI mean they obviously do I now the other big take away is not only is the accusation against the New York times or if that's going to be a perceived as fake news\n'cause it's a New York times in their investigation and it doesn't matter how much

[noise]\nAnd\nI visit is I Can't buy handle here it is a a Wednesday morning a\nBigger story that we're covering the the big training stories of course the Trump tax dodging New York times accusing him of actual fraud when dealing with taxes over the years and the Kavanaugh story keeps on going will there be a vote on friday a procedural vote which means on Saturday as early as Saturday the Senate\nCan vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh on of course there's all kinds of issues involving that just gets more complicated by the minute by the FBI as adjustable released its latest data on crime and they put this data in a church\nAnd uh the figures part of them show the clearance rate that is a the rate of crimes being solved a and the numbers thanks so good for murders the clearance rate is sixty one percent\nOf the worst for out of ten times people just get away with it\nFor aggravated assault it's fifty three percent half the time people get away with it and for rape thirty four percent ...\nTwo thirds of the time people get away with it by the way for property crimes of drops to twenty percent mainly because the cops like someone Berger writes your home you call the police they showed nine days later\nBut it's even worse in many communities because the murder rates in communities typically the black community we'd gas I dropped even lower\nAnd analysis Washington posted this or an analysis of killings over the past decade and fifty two largest cities post found that no surprise here black Vic victims who were counted for the majority of homicides\nWere least likely of any racial group to have their killings result in and arrest\nWhen the police arrested someone in the black killings sixty three percent a or a or a clear with whites forty seven percent of those are blacks\nSo pure racism right where it was five a little bit deeper in for a moment when you talk about the black communities a lot of gangs\nIn the black communities\nAnd we know that black on black crime has huge but that is a huge number is ... gang related\nAnd they don't usually clear those crimes nearly as much why because nobody in the neighborhood will ever testify\nYou don't find witnesses in those those neighborhoods because people are scared to death now let's say here in Burbank someone is murdered and you have four witnesses that have seen it for a witness to show up\nAnd the cops will say what'd you see well of course here's what we saw\nAlong he pulled out a gun or whatever it is\nGo to the black neighborhood that the gang infested neighborhood what'd you say nothing but you are right there I was turning the other way and you hear the shots no and\nYou can't force the rate you can't force these people I wouldn't would you testify knowing that there was a good chance your your family are going to get hurt or maybe even killed\nSo in some areas and the worst crime areas\nI interview in twenty Fifteen with a criminologist the clearance rate for murders and non fatal shootings can fall down to the single\nDigits so\nIs this racism or I mean you can get really deep into the racist angle and talk about sex a racial disparity et cetera and I think I'm a couple of things were happening\nOr if it would be because also the recent shootings and you got for us in the ... factor a as a result of that that's not to say police are not bad actors and they're a grabbing more police to do this but as a result of that police are jumping in as much\nI've talked to cops and that's the case and so therefore since cops are more like less likely to get involved a criminals are more likely think they can get away with it and they're more likely to commit these acts\nAnd on the other side if people don't like or don't think the police are going to protect them they may be likely to take the law more into their own hands to see it's it's a circular argument\nAnd a journalist who documented all of this uh and uh she wrote a book Joel avoid user name and I I think she put it it really well in context take a bunch of teenage boys from the widest save us safe suburban America\nAnd then put them in a place where their friends their murdered they're constantly attacked and threaten signal that no one cares fail to solve murders let their options a two week space to escape really be limited\nAnd then see what happens and so\nThe problem is very deep and people tend to make light of it when you talk about the activists for example the black community it's just racism there's the answer\nNothing else pure racism and this is why are they don't do as well as whites\nIn terms of schooling in terms of graduation rate in terms of jobs in terms of college showed a college education and college graduations and the answer is pure racism\nSame thing with Hispanics so racism well\nIt's obviously much much deeper than that and we've talked about it over the years and we will continue talking about it and we're getting there I mean there there's enough information out there where thinking people\nLook at this and realize that that's one of the most complex problems that we have in society and\nAre we dealing with it well yes but then again money that would otherwise go for example to programs dealing with is not that they succeed or fail because that's another issue entirely\nNow it what's the flavor of the month homelessness is the flavor of the month and so we want our resources are thinking our attention our money going to the homeless population so\nThere you go just wanted to share some bad news with you and I know that if you're white and you get killed there is a much better chance of them are the police finding the perpetrator or not that it matters you 'cause you're kind of dead at that point\nBut at least you have some understanding right coming up a investigation the Kavanaugh investigation update what's new in the news when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh that's coming right up KFI am six forty\nK pacify Angeles Orange County and her radio station [noise]\n\nBring arrested I'm Jennifer ... Lee live from the KFI twenty four hour newsroom\nA group of teens arrested for a high profile burglaries apparently had a lot of celebrities in mind investigator seat say three people hit the homes every ... ... and Robert Woods over the last few months but LAPD captain ... says the teams had a list of more than a dozen other stars\nViola Davis LeBron James Matt Damon and I'm a ...\nShe says the burglaries used advent calendars and social media to figure out when the celebs would be a way some Republican senators are criticizing the president for making fun of judge Brett Kavanaugh's accuser Christine Blasey Ford Trump joked about Ford last night at a rally in Mississippi\nI had one well do you think it was it was one of them I'll do it\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago when\nWhere he said it will we will never allow this to go further it went for it\nSo now it was the week of the FBI investigation\nInto the allegations looking into three actually too serious allegations won by of course ah Christine Blasey Ford she testified as to that\nOne by Deborah Ramirez who talked about a Brett Kavanaugh exposing himself they're looking into that and I don't see or even looking into a sweat Nick whatever they held her first name is uh the gang bang gang rape or it was just with absolutely no\nNo nobody backing up other than her statement and what makes her statement even less believable is Michael ... who was representing her ... she's credible\nThe shame of it is for anybody who's represented by Michael I have an allergy or no one believes that word he says he could say Mother Teresa was a good human being no one believes\nThey've got that's Michael have an idea of course it panned out that way oh she's credible witness has no you don't All right so the FBI investigation is happening this week\nWe are being told it may very well end to gay so what does this span here well here's the part that is ... the news is coming out according to Christine Blasey Ford's attorney the FBI not has not talk to her yet\nAnd as far as the other witnesses who were there she mentioned some people that were there are certainly Deborah Ramirez mention people that were there at the incident where Brett Kavanaugh allegedly a exposed himself\nSwinging his penis in her face I think is a the along the allegations I mean that's I mean that's pretty out there and they're looking into that the FBI's looking into that are we in a no no we're not no because the FBI normally doesn't release that information\nIt doesn't\nIt is it provides the information to the committee both sides Democrats and Republicans the Republicans of course they're gonna keep it quiet the Democrats if there's any there there are going to instantly release that information\nSo uh what's going to happen I think what's going to happen is exactly what the Republicans are Republicans on a committee were afraid of and that is the longer this thing takes the more women will come forward accused Brett Kavanaugh of wrongdoing\nThere's an issue as to his drinking where he didn't outright lie but he certainly skirted it\nDid you ever blackout never blacked out did you excessively drink I like beer I still like beer do you like beer almost sounded like a doctor knew or Dr seuss book I like beer do you like\nBeer cat in the hat likes being we all like beer I mean it got pretty stupid\nAnd ah so people that were interviewed buddies of his said oh yeah he was falling down drunk and then there is a a letter or some kind of writing where he describes how obnoxious drunk he was was he so drunk he couldn't function I like beer\nDid you ever blackout absolutely not did you ever\nGet so drunk 'cause you don't remember what happened absolutely not now G help Kavanaugh because we all know he drank like crazy which by the way I have no problem with someone uh in is a senior year of ... of high school and first year of college that's what people do\nThese guys get plastered that's what frat boys do and I think it'd be easier how do you just said yeah I drink a whole lot when I was younger and then I went\nTo Yale first in my class and then I went to Yale Law school\nAnd then\nI did all these years of public service for the last twelve years I sat on the appellate court yeah but I drank when I was younger okay so what instead of skirting around the issue so we're going to see we're going to see what happens\nAll right the power structure\nIn Washington DC how much is it changed because of the me too movement Paul gee that's coming right up KFI am a six forty a there's gender\nBecause the gas has gone up by more than two cents in one day in so gas prices had already

the time the election happens what is an ancient history of the fact that Joe is ancient\nHe's Seventy five he's going to be Seventy six ... me that's going to stay with him and he's gonna have to fight that one big time now the good news\nIs ... it's Seventy five is today's Seventy four\nYou can do things that are a lot older do you do you care for example the Donald Trump Seventy three that Hillary Clinton was what the Donald Trump was at that point was he's sixty was Seventeen when he ran no one mentioned the word about age nobody cares unless you're in your eighties\nThat might be a problem but I I don't think so\nI don't care you know depends on how you look whether you're vibrant whether you're young I mean if your daughter ring and use a Walker or that may be a little bit a

what Seventy six Donald Trump will be Seventy four\nAt that time so what\nWhat it's going to be an interesting fight I don't think what's gonna happen here's the fun part the two big issues that are going to the theoretically could nail Joe Biden and that is his attack on how he\nTreated Anita Hill the Trump people are going to argue that Donald Trump is going to on the stump start screaming about how he treats women what Joe Biden did that's one problem that I think is going to happen with a ... and the other one is his age\nHe's Seventy six but you're Seventy four he's too old you're Seventy four so it's going to be\nInteresting to be fasting I Hope widened gets it I Hope Biden gets the nomination truly and then the issue is\nYou know who am I going to vote for that's an easy one
