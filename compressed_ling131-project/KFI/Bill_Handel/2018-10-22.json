I coincidentally enough\nAnd the rest have been detained have they been flown back to Saudi Arabia we don't know but they of I'm assuming they have they've already are left and then went back to Saudi Arabia yes they did 'cause remember the to charter planes\nThat they flew in on those gulfstream jets they flew in on which were charter by a from a private company and we don't know if the Saudi Government charter them\nOr that sort of up in the air but chartered by a private company where they were a private company that are very close ties to the Saudi Government in the royal family\nAnd uh so at this point it's a they're playing the line of a rogue agents now there is also video\nOf a guy who looks very similar to crush Yogi and it's being reported that he's a body double adopt all again or if you will where he is seen leaving the consulate and are not done very well one of the things about the way Saudi Arabia is handling this totally ham handed\nTotally amateurish they can do much better than that well maybe they can't do much better than that uh because I don't think they've ever dealt with something like this so I'm looking at video of the official Saudi spokesperson who speaks very good English but in a monotone and he keeps a straight face you have to give them credit\nFor that he doesn't wins once and\nSaid it was a rogue agents matter of fact I'm looking at him are now very serious yes it was a rogue a and yes they had no authority\nAnd a yes or we're going to do something about it we are detaining them and the problem is is that the story is change so many times there is no one who believes it now the Saudis certainly know that no one believes it there I mean they're not stupid people they understand\nBut what choice do they have\nOther than their statement now the question is you pick a story and you stick by it why you would change the story every ten minutes makes no sense in the store and get stupid on top of that\nSo let's say it's going to be okay so you call it as a ... it was a rogue operation okay done and then the ... people died took his body out and we don't know where it is and they've been arrested oh no\nUh and uh we don't actually know what happened oh no no fist fight you was choked I had already left the embassy or before there was no proof of him leaving and all of a sudden now there's videotape of him leaving and he looks so and and they immediately discern that it's not him\nThat it's a a body double\nSo we'll see what happens today I Can't wait for this one All right ah coming up are the experts are saying California and he's more housing we know that right but you know really doesn't believe it you I'll share that with you when we come back\nKFI unless chicken with Jennifer Jones laying on the news

bringing a lot of it out even in light of the even in light of interest rates going through the roof\nLet's talk about that and I'm going to check out that Instagram once I get off the phone with you but in two thousand nine um there was about six trillion dollars of home equity in the market so in other words if you're not you're a house bill obviously but let's say the normal person's house is worth three hundred thousand dollars and if you worry\nHanging hanging on by thousand guy you\nYou live where I live in a more town New Jersey\nOkay you there isn't a house that's worth three hundred thousand dollars within a hundred miles to the studio [laughter] I just want to point out quite please I digress swiftly line\nI'm not I'm trying to get a hypothetical hypothetical you want to make it a million on making a million dollars that's a little crazy and I ... well for you get my point yeah I did for three hundred\nYou're paid one fifty of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars of equity so in two thousand and ten of them were six trillion today snapshot\nIt's fourteenth point four trillion dollars worth of home equity out there now people are saying maybe the homeowners Seventy million or so homeowners that would qualify to start tapping into that\nThat could be a huge boon for the retailers or maybe it'd be a great thing for the economy in general but that's what we're talking about almost more than double what the number was eight years ago\nNow the question here is if the market tanks like it did last time or unemployment explodes oh we're in for a world of hurt aren't we\n[laughter] world of hurt because then people get upside down you know everybody thinks you know and I say everybody but everybody thinks that the price of their home the value of their homes going to go up in perpetuity and for a long time that was a case we thought differently obviously in the financial crisis of all eight or nine\nAnd a lot of people didn't have equity in their home they had negative equity in other words\nThey owe more than the house was worth ...
