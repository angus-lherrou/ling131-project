{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "As I Walk closer I could see a mother and child inside the voice the mother and child were sitting in the grass talking and smiling and joined the bright sunny day they were dressed in what I Would describe is Eighteen hundred clothing that I've seen in western movie\nIt was if I was watching a floating TV the\nMother that made eye contact with me and appeared confused and scared terrified she grabbed her child he ran away I don't know if they were goes I got a sense that they were alive as me however from a different time it's not as if I peaked in the past and this this\nIs a common one that I'm hearing more and more about and it's the idea of wormholes portal\nGyms um and and that sort of under special conditions I'll call them goes enter into our universe\nI'm so in this example the witness in a sense was able to access the previous timer dimension universe and she was able to look back and see what's happening that location and maybe the child and the mom saw this woman dressed the future at the coast futuristic clothing and got terrified ran away so it's almost like a glimpse into something else\nAnd a lot of times these are perceived as ghostly encounters\nYou ever when you're doing these ah these studies have you ever encountered something where you'd even skier due to\nUm personally no I haven't been scared\nLegit I had an experience I'm a I live in sort of the country a rural area of Ohio and I'm a one morning\nA you know my wife was out of town and I'm One morning I had I kept getting these overwhelming feeling like something's wrong like fear like adrenaline and I was sort of drawn to the outside uh we have a four acres and upon and I for myself I don't feel this way and my dog was to be on the same way to normal she's pretty calm in the morning when she was like scratching they get outside\nSo I'm like yeah well you know my scientific brains going just take a shower and go to work and don't worry about it you know and I'm like you know what I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to follow through with this\nSo I opened the door the dog and he went outside in the back yard and she sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I saw something like in the pond floating and I started walking and then I started running and it was a neighborhood cat had gotten into the pond and somehow um you know drowned in\nThere by you know like dove into the ... you know all that stuff [laughter]\nBut I myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but something drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing and I never got that feeling or that desire to go outside but something happened and I kept asking myself what what happened what made that they different\nAnd was there some sort of like distress signal sense to me was the cat in distress and it's kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know so that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kind of like this so many cool things happen there it's really an amazing experience\nHow many people normal experiences ... because the person who died comes back never had someone punishments has had to had to tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI you know I don't know percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there goes my encounters have to do with easing are coping with the psychological injuries like the staff of a father or something\nYou know I'm\n... you know you're sort of struggling with the death ah there's all these motions happening um so you know the body sort of\nThe the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that's sort of sets in motion of plan to sort of ... this psychological wound through another whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you might use unconventional means\nKnow and if you have collective on consciousness or collective consciousness exist and memories\nOf personalities and experiences of all of our humans are sort of stored in the atmosphere [noise] um you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like your father showing up and saying don't be shot I'm at a better place\nYou know and and I think these things [noise] I the research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these um\nBereavement operations associated with their spouse one month after their death um so it's a pretty high number eighty percent\nIt's huge yeah yeah\nYeah and and perhaps these bereavement operations er visits from the deceive shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual psyche and perhaps ... could be sort of a way\nThe process emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of the survivor you know final goodbye from the disease\nCould help us move on through crisis or grief\nOr maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of moved towards revolution and ... ... and when I talk to the these people that have these encountered they often report feeling more at ease\nOr accepting of a loved one death after the evaporation and I think on TV usually go stir negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive I'm can come out of it goes and counter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is\nUm something to look forward to this is not a negative and demons and things like\nA brand and what have you conclude about the people who are more receptive to these guys are preparations and then comes the mothers what's so special about though\n[noise] that is a that's a great question I Wish I had a definite answer for that um I think [noise]\nYou know something narrow biological is different about them you know when they put them there's there's some cats out there specifically with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like\nI Would like human magnets or something or yeah yeah exactly\nYou know the research is kind of sometimes fifty fifty if you want to think about that thing this phenomenon exist and and it doesn't exist but there's some some really unique experimental design that um you know where they're actually doing that from our F MRIs jeeze\nAnd what they're finding is their their brain is actually and their bodies are reacting to this electricity at very low levels\nSo there's some sort of\nObjective evidence that they can detect things that are more than ... other people and the general population can you know so and this is true for but then we all we all experience pain differently right and they've shown that arise as well so you you know you know I like it poked\nWith a pen and to me it's a horrible painful event for you it's not really that it\nDoesn't hurt at all say with those brand and we're going to talk more when we come back last will take phone calls get another couple of stories of some of your
