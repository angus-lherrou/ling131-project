{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "So sometimes people have these experiences have these dreams and they disregard them you know and I've heard of other cases like that too\nSo as you say these ... can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that I bring up another subject which is sometimes people receive messages and dreams which aren't the cognitive\nAnd who's giving them the ...\nThat's the question right where's this message coming from you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious oh we could save coming from something they've added or we can say it's coming from the spirit world\nYou know but some of these messages\nFor example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that you could be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could have been her fear\nMhm you know um\nAnd maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nUnder there was a movie about to a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other government to leaders to to assassinate them\nAnd you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that they mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy\nI don't know how they're dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of getting having making someone to have a heart attack I don't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused it right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although we don't really know and how how would we know it's right you know um so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable\nMhm [noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams 'cause I have also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um it wasn't a pay cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up\nThis is the message I got I I just saw these where it said this is a world of illusion\nAnd the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition above the ides of march\n[noise] that's right in fact she dreamt the night before he was killed she'd done that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate hate in order to please also with ... told Julius Caesar it'd be where march which is the fifteenth of march and he he north ... ignored his wife is killed so\nYeah that was a very strong premonition premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their ... told me\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't leave their intuition\nAnd then they do the ... after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened and all\nThat said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they disregarded things which could be dismissed that superstition there's always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was about horse racing and oh yeah one of his friends apparently\nReally understood who's gonna win the race but didn't bet on that horse spit on something else and lost in ... in the movie screaming at ground you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your ...\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fair I think people who don't believe it [noise] they don't believe it and also they're afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because there have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth who have another body experience during surgery and then when the recovery from the anesthesia and they wake up evil to tell the doctors nurses um\nWhat they saw and what they heard while they're out of their bodies there was one patient who was blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the parent and on his\nDoctors hot and of course the doctor was astounded\nThere was another case of a blind patients who left his body during surgery [noise] I think no he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures and he left his body and he was observing everything that was going on\nAnd then when he when he recovered and they couldn't find where she put a statute and he wanted his teeth back\nRight\nBack but then then they\nSaid I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I saw you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nThey were they were wild yeah it works it would work out\nWhat ... what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component like I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's pure normal\nWell I think it's related you see I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual I mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them psychic some people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous\nOr Mr polar mysterious Israel different words of being used to describe the same event\nBut I think paranormal event and have a spiritual component yeah but I'm not saying every paranormal event but some do of course it depends on the person who was having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\n[noise] [noise] oh definitely I think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there is something more out there that we don't just have to live our routine nine to five feet you know day to day lives that there's something more than we don't really know about and I think it should be explored\nUp next when we come back with Dr many ... we're going to take phone calls your goals your stories about ... do the dreams and so many other things\nYou were just talking about here on the coast to coast they find out more about tonight just log on to coast to coast am dot com\n\n[noise]\n\nHer license to twenty seven I don't ...

actually borrowing money from\nPeople with compromised lung function out of chronic obstructive hatch let's do this [noise]\nThe proof of homelessness crisis in his capable and much of Southern California ten ... street like this one in downtown LA creating the sun bleached and dust imbedded campus mosaic of suffering and many of these homeless people are dealing with mental illness\nSo in the state of California there um last year there are a hundred and thirty four thousand people who were homeless in Los Angeles county it was about fifty three thousand people homeless in Los Angeles county of those fifty three thousand about a quarter of those people were are struggling with serious mental health issues\nJoel John Roberts is the CEO of patch or people assisting the homeless he supports prop to along with Deborah ... from the Steinberg Institute she says the prop simply unlocks money that's already there from the millionaires tax that was created by prop sixty three back in two thousand four which became known as the mental health services act\nAnd then it twenty sixteen the legislature passed a law to take some of that money and build permanent supportive housing for the lawsuits kept everything tied up in our prompt you it's essentially a software patch fixing a malicious line of code freeze up a hundred and forty million dollars a year to cover the cost of a two billion dollar bond\nThat's a really good way to describe it that you know the attention from the very beginning with Trump sixty three was that that of course this would make a huge dent\nIn the ... and people living on the streets with serious mental illness and that there would be this housing component um link to services but then that wasn't happening in a lot of places so part of what sixty three does\nIs it it provides the major incentive to say I'm this is what everybody needs to be doing because we know what works\nAt the unicorn right it's the rare bond measure that won't cost taxpayers but nevertheless there are still opposition Douglas\nDone is with the national alliance on mental illness Contra Costa chapter which split with the state organization to opposed to one\nFree money to pay for the bombs which can total four point two billion over Thirty years to foot six billion state wide over forty years\nAnd dumped as a percentage of the money that's been going to county for mental health services wouldn't that'd be diverted to pay for permanent supportive housing\nSo it could be left holding the bag for seven percent of the funding they would normally get from from from the mental health services\nRobert says he understands that argument\nIs basically saying let's let's increase taxes for more housing and what we're saying is if there's already money out there let's use at first 'cause it's much easier and the reality is a stable home is part of mental health treatment so it's I see a stable home as\nAs complementary to to services so I Do understand that you know we need services for people struggling with mental health\nBut there are so many people out on the streets that need housing that we really need the housing\nBut done so it's going to bond route instead of paying as they go with the equivalent of throwing away money\nSo the longer the bombs go the less actual funding there is the bill but brick and mortar and the more it's going to cost for each dollar brick and mortar funding that you spent just just to build the housing see where I'm going with is\nAndrew loo says the crisis needs immediate action\nAnd it's also important to point out that what we're using again this is very small percentage of funding for the mental health services act\nUm it's it's it's being used to leverage two billion dollars up front so that instead of sort of taking away at this problem over\nDecades for using money up front you know his props who passes those bombs are going out this fall you know and and and we will we will see the response beginning at the beginning of the year\nSo a yes vote allows for money already being collected to be spent building permanent supportive housing for the mentally ill a lot more to this debate and if
