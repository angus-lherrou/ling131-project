but it caught him on a where's\nAnd on this particular day he was standing there and the noise or the falls and on the opposite bank the creek which was wounded with toll kind of pointing spruce ... uh pines\nHe sees something going up and down in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee\nSo he's watching this thing going up and down and thinking to themselves what on earth is a monkey or a channel Z doing up here\nNow he couldn't cross the river\nAnd when the thing came down on the tree it went into the the trees that surrounding it and vote in other words there were like low boroughs ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so when it was up in the high treason could see it\nAnd when to climb down we couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention when he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up sits there and one position and staring at him\nSo now he's looking at it it's looking at him and then it lowers down again well moments later\nHe sees some ... in the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill alongside the fool's and here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder of daddy\nComing along the bank and going out of sight in front of him into the woods so you had one carrying the other one\nWho knows it's anybody's guess what this little critter was doing maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human conflict when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something to play with your kid in the park you know\nThat's right now you mentioned earlier about a couple that moved down to their house to get away from big what happened\n[noise] well I've had a ... there's been a number of people have moved houses are a United sooner aren't and rural areas right\n... yeah for the most part are people who have backed up against a wilderness areas or for instance when we talk about I mean this is a very interesting a story\nA involving no sighting but evidence like it's nobody's business uh these people and when you talk about Maine George I don't know if people really realize this Maine is the size of the risk of New England combined\nAnd you know Ninety percent of it is uninhabitable so when you talk about world and there's it's not just the Pacific northwest British Columbia Canada here we have a lot of wilderness in Maine we have a lot of wilderness right here in New York state\nAnd so these people had moved from one house to another house in northern Maine\nOr the money was right the property was right the people I had lived there before them we're gardeners they will gardeners this was like a match made in heaven\nWell as it turns out over time they found they were accusing each other of losing the gardening tools the wife is saying that has been with the shovel where's the rate was this so finally the husband get the idea\nThat they're going to gather together all the tools they have to an inventory and then they were going to keep the moral locked up with the exception of two small hands spades\nSo having accomplished that they realize they were missing some tools\nAnd they started they left\nTo hand spades on what she called the the wife called the bistro table on the patio and they were using them for partying plants\nAnd\nNo sooner had they left them out there a couple of days went by and now these hand spades withdrawn they actually called the police report death on their property of you know tools and this and that number\nCould understand who would come on their land has the tools and take tools I mean it's ridiculous you going to go to jail for taking a shovel you gonna run the place Rob the place well Frank [laughter] through such a bright he bees and things like that [laughter] so\nThey actually went out into the property in the woods they found one of their shovels leaning on the tree and the wife scope doubt nine feet off the ground one of these bill it one piece can garden trials with a rubber handle on it\nShowed into the side of a tree nine feet up\nNine feet up so they went back to the house they got a like an iPhone to something took pictures of it they brought a ladder out the husband couldn't budge this thing it was buried in the trees several inches couldn't budget\nSo they had recalled the police and told them the story about finding the shovel in the woods showed the cop to shovel and the ... everybody was baffled by you know this turn of events here\nAnyways the long and short of it was\n\nThe cop told them look if you have any other problems get back to us I'm not sure what happened here I'm going to pass on to the detectives\nWell\nAs I said the long and short of it was a couple of days later they came outside and the guardian behind the house\nHad been trampled down there were huge footprints in the bed or tomatoes are taking the heads of lettuce one mashed\nAnd whatever had done this which was obviously a big foot\nHad stepped right over the fence not using the gate there was a gate on the garden and it just step right over the wire\nWinning had it's full of feed and then left they recalled the ah the police over to see what had happened that would have transpired and\nHe actually told them that this was pretty much the best evidence he had ever seen a and that they had had reports periodically of people saying they saw these big tall creatures coming in their property of walking now so it's\nIt's convincing\nYeah it's not like it's not like these things on being seen it's just that they're

... places for people living in the ... ... ... in terms of population and economy five hundred Fifteen city were type related in this whole thing the Austin, Texas comes up a number one Miami,

absolutely and often doesn't surprise me because you know the whole key Boston weird thing it it seems like a great place to go if you were a college kid\nCaught like yeah yeah I mean it's a college

if you try to drive from one end of the city to the other but the people seem to like it it's got a lot to offer and and all students one of those places that to you you see on these kinds of lists very frequently ...\nYeah exactly I think the first five out of six are all in Texas which makes sense because even for adults who have been you know lived in California all their lives Texas seems to be one of the top destinations spots for them\nBecause they're just looking to get more bang for their buck and it seems like companies more and more are moving out of California heading to the Texas area and so they can travel right along with their jobs\nWell yeah I think you're right and and part of the cost of living I have\nA brother lives in San Francisco and you know if it's astronomical and cost of everything he comes out here to Texas for a visit you can't believe are cheap gas is and how little people pay for a for housing and and I think that's that's part of what it comes from those\nTypes of does do pretty well in these things but to Seattle, Washington is number three are among the the big cities\nAnd cost of living there is a sort of an issue gets a little more expensive than most places in the country\nAnd I would think the places where you've got so Seattle where Amazon is or you go a\nTexas where you've got a lot of the bigger companies even some of the tech companies that are starting to have you know some of their um pop ups there it it kind of makes sense though they may be they would at least leave California because even though it's still might be

phenomenon that when I when I kind of want to look more into you\nBut they are moving like I have got a friend who's a child is moving to Pennsylvania and they were talking about how do you know we will then wanting to leave California so we're going to go to I Wonder if this is going to be a trend where parents are going to say like\n... and they're all going to live together so again it's kind of this whole the millennial thing where we keep hearing about kids living at home longer but they're just to sort of a family affair like Johnny going off to college so you know what we're going to
