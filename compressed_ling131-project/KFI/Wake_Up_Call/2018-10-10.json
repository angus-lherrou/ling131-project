I saw her continually walk all the way towards the door and I waited\nAnd waited and yet\nCame in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there but yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my field to wait for her to walk yet\nAnd yet there was no one here and oddly enough that said location is where the coast guard because it's on the coast guard base a coast guard reports\nIn women walking on the wall in that same location so that was kind of intriguing I'm\nA ... the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we get a public goes on ah what island White House and a good fit pool meals Maine we were in

the island or the dog wouldn't go so well with the White House keepers afterward took care of them to a dog actually died and\nI don't she says the dog you describe\nPretty much that just as good as a dog\nThe dog and I did see a picture that looked like it but can I say that was it though I Know but so I mean these two things that I'm really not looking for goes but it certainly saw it would

political strategist John ... says support for prop six is largely evaporated at\nTwenty eight point nine percent yes to forty one point four percent no with about twenty nine point five percent undecided\nNot Thomas says one reason for the dramatic shift in support may be the ballot language for prop sex Thomas says the shipped also coincides with big advise from the campaign to keep the gas tax well how does a lecture in daycare five per se and Carlo will be explaining all eleven statewide ballot measures but first a little history\nCalifornia's Proposition system was born in the progressive movement back in the beginning of last century the process started in Nineteen eleven was quickly augmented do allow citizen initiatives and referendum and recall things that took off pretty quickly\nThere was one ballot amazingly in Nineteen fourteen that had forty eight propositions on it\nTo be fair there wasn't much to do in Nineteen forty two voting on all those process kind of like watching Netflix today dramatically soccer is executive director of the initiative and referendum Institute at USC\nOr purpose is to track what's going on on the ballot propositions across the country and bring scholars together and basically published research to help me understand this process\nYeah forty prop seems a bit overkill but eleven also seems like a lot right well in twenty sixteen I calculated\nHistorically how many propositions are on average in the balance in California because there was a lot of\nThose little chatter about the eighth or Eighteen propositions I Believe and there was a lot of chatter about how long that bell and his historical average going back to the beginning Nineteen twelve or for a an even your election is Eighteen propositions so Eighteen is the normal number for us so from that perspective of living is low\nYou're supposed to be longer there were three ballot measures that qualified but last minute deals

Ninety nine dollars so it's pretty much in line with kind of the smartphone crisis we're seeing out there you know if you can get a smartphone for under a thousand dollars these days one of the hop and smartphones that's pretty good thing um another feature Jennifer I think is really cool it's called ... shot\nAnd this takes a bunch of Google's big into artificial intelligence right right so when you're taking a picture sometimes you get someone linking or it just doesn't come out right when they can swipe up on the photo and Google recommend taking other pictures at the same time a better picture the alternative you know to what you do so that's kinda cool\nOh that is all equal\nBut there is one feature that stole the show Jennifer and it is amazing because we're getting hammered with so many robo calls it called call screen and basically any time you get a phone call from a number you don't recognize you can tap this little button on the screen that says screen this call\nIt will literally send it to like this little automated robot that lives on your phone\nAnd it says hey excuse me um why are you calling this person can you tell me your name and why are calling\nAn advisor talking you will see a transcription on your screen of what they're saying and then you can say stuff back using the little robot like can you tell me more or I'm not interested or hang on whatever you want and it's all happening on your phone so privacy concerns we will not seeing any of this stuff\nAnd then you can send them to voice mail you can trashed them you know send them to spam or you can block their number or you can just pick up the call so it's like having a virtual assistant built into your phone\nOkay that is brilliant now if the if you determine I don't want this call or you know they they see the robo call this spam or whatever dean what what's the next step do you tell it this spam or whatever and then does the block that call for you\nYes so you can you know like it's just\nLike literally you know how you pick up a telemarketer call let's say you get like a regular person that's kind of like normal you know in the mid west there talk if you try to sell you want something you feel bad right you don't want to just hang up on them so you end up talking to them for a little bit for\nThe computer doing it and it's like hey this is Dan from you know come to America and we want to sell you a um you know extended service plan for your computer you would feel really bad and you hear him out for a couple of minutes if it's a robot you just have a little strange 'cause I'm not interested in it than I Am not interested please take me off her left goodbye and it just does it for you it does\nThe dirty work I Love that almost would be reason enough to go by that song\nI Know a lot of people are going to love that feature I Can't wait to get my first and also I can test\nThat exactly I mean speaking of artificial intelligence how his Instagram using it to detect bullying\nSo I've always talked about how Instagram if you've ever noticed the comments on Instagram are usually pretty positive they don't go into that kind of dark territory that YouTube does yeah well now they're kicking it up a notch they have this new enhanced comment filter\nThat is using artificial intelligence basically if a comment seems like it's pretty bad or involves bullying they are going to flag it and send it to a human team to sort of look over and allow or disallow it on the website and the reason for this is that they weren't Instagram to be kind of a happier place on the Internet\nI don't know Jennifer if you've ever looked at comments on YouTube\nThey are pretty much a day just is spelled destruction for all of humanity\nAnd it doesn't matter it can be the most you know a name on there and the most interesting and yet people just truly like crazy\nIt can be a cat kissing a dog and it's the most beautiful moment and all of history and literally it will be the worst comment that you want to like burn your eyeballs out right yeah I'm so is the greatest doesn't\nWant that to happen right so anyway they're using all this artificial tells you to keep it to be to keep it from being this a terrible place and I I think this is a good move from them um you know it will go to a human person if it gets flagged for review\nSo a human still has the final say on some of these comments obviously they're using a larger AI filter it kind of get rid of just for the straight up trash right right so this is for more things are a little bit more um\nYou know you've got to kind of figure it out because they're also used in the context of the picture as well so some pictures will invite more debate and others right of\nCourse yeah the kitten ... probably not so much other stuff yeah it could definitely happen again before I let you go real fast because I've been ... let's talk about how this alpha that spin offs thinks he can use your line as your air conditioner\nSo this is called a dandelion and this is alphabet is obviously the company that owns school they're kind of like the big holding company they have a bunch of little companies and eat them this is one of their startups called dandelion\nThey use basically the heat and the cool from the ground to heat your home and this is called geothermal it's been around for a long time the problem is it's very expensive\nBut it's kind of eco friendly it's a it could be very efficient so they want to find out a way to make this more mainstream and right now the system does cost about twenty\nThousand dollars which if you're just sort of typical homeowner you're going to look at that they can get a regular air conditioner for ten thousand right right\nAnd that's twenty thousand after some rebates by the way\nSo the point is Google is trying to work on this because in the end this would be a better system because it's safer it's more fuel efficient it's kind of using energy from the earth\nAnd it just looking at their website it seems pretty cool um because basically pulling heat from the earth to heat your house and then it's totally pulling kind of cool is from the earth to cool it and the different season so\nUh I think that's cool um I I don't know for twenty thousand dollars is gonna be a tough sell for a lot of people yeah but again Google's job is to make things come down in price by evolving that technology\n... and then as soon as he does evolve they are going to be people jumping on that bandwagon like crazy which thank you so much travel safely back from New York enjoy the rest of your children will talk to you next week\nAre Jennifer talk to you then they\nSee you later and you can find in mind rich on ...
