{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "I actually say when I arrive at the airport I think actually need a news story today because the best stories sometimes served up when something goes wrong I really talks about this road trip but\nDon't you know at lunchtime I sit down at the airport by I have a beer on the straight and not have a beer when I can see on the red faced man next to me as you looked like a fellow who'd like to hear a story and I look at the interest he introduces himself he's a former copies of former detective from the East Bay area oh interesting\nHe looks at me he says Robert he's ... my name I have to share this with someone I was in a graveyard this week and I look at him [laughter]\nYeah I was in a graveyard I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk\nAnd I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a head start is her name the full name\nAnd does the date this person died last summer and I can't believe that her but I cold she'd never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to head thing he says what do you think of that I said it's a great story it's a very great story I mean that it produces\nWhat about you know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my call them to sudden goal is to a certain place might even be an age of the sudden because that's what he but\nAs I'm telling us it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on a day when I'm saying at the airport I don't need a news story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and that these examples proliferate so\n... you know what it how it works is that the the attitude of the energy you occurring again to have results your attitude traveled ahead of you in life\nShaping wanted waking waking fuel round the next corner which is a very good reason every tuning in life to pause and check your attitude check what his play you know when you're in a soundtrack check what you're saying to you so Trump the negative mantras self limiting beliefs\nAnd be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know we need the brain to dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think it's a good body is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind to not to into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us about a matter of reality as a dense of consciousness so\n... there's no hope of separating mind matter they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the party has its own messages his discoveries the phenomena but used to be called pre sentiment which I experience a lot maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the buddy sometimes seems to know\nThings that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize what is going on the body reacts\nTo something ahead of time for example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled it surprisingly high and there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to do uh get get some blood for a blood analysis hits a gusher my blood is boating and it's\nAll you lived in pants and after that I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen ... the white queen screams\nBefore she put her finger so she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to it in the before it took place on the doctor said my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden phenomena presented miner anticipate symptoms be said but I couldn't possibly be reported people think I was looted you well you know I said so I think the ... we know in our body all sorts of things we know thing we know what the bleep we know that we know enough about it you know so medical response was we pick up things from a distance from other people\nWe feel what they're feeling in our body as well so that's about the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nWell active dreaming is a way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again to remember your dreams are going to share them the right way to you're going to take action that will empower your life and bring some healing energy and guide in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also method of Lisa dreaming you would call it shut medical use of dreaming we ... my favorite way of ... will disagreement venture\nIs to start out loose or the state lose what does that need it means that we use shut medic coming in the workshops\nAnd we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay the romance an adventure steel industry let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the dream and have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff's going on by going back inside the dream and facing the scary based on the ground it might mean\nI Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Merrill someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic looser dreamy another example is and I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that risky try like state\nTo eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psyche can intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation and if you like I tend to the images of rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the scenes that will come to you the pool to footloose of dreaming and finally\nActed premier the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open we got the how to look at simplicity outlook for signs from civil to the world around you so this is also a program on the method all that tending to the dream like symbols\nOf everyday life Robert to the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think that dreams themselves misleading I think that a spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminder to interpret according to the wrong standards I think that don't think the dreams in themselves to ever deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems with the floating around that we don't walk around we can pick up things from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to is that is truly our own\nCan be worked in the service of helping healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible beast but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront these two on the ground you might find that behind something that's scary you know learning and you and\nYour dream is a power power of understanding of power that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not deceptive but a rush to interpret according to narrow understanding what dreams is about can be very misleading\nYou got a rubber we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and take phone calls and continue chatting about your latest war
