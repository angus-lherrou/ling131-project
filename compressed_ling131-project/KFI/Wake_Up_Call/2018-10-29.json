airplanes and his his you can Google I'm Jacob you've done and you can go and check out his airplane defines as his airplanes were used by the British and they were used by the Canadian military and others had it as as the country's headed towards a World War one\nBut he he tries to reflect on this he's puzzled by these dream he's worried about them he started writing them down\nAnd then he he he comes across basically of the people I Can't then and people who are talking about the possibility that there's hired inventions and he's reading Einstein while he's reading about Einstein's dream for popular science and he he ended up developing a theory\nThat the dreaming self can somehow lift itself up off of our normal world and peek into other parts I'm In the timeline or for other areas in the timeline of the dreaming self\nDreaming consciousness has a kind of the freedom\nThat uh that are a regular everyday consciousness doesn't have any and he uses a lot of scientific ideas that we can talk about do you want to how he does it but he has a has a set of scientific ideas that he that he uses to think about how this might be possible how could the dreaming self be able to have the power and be able to lift itself off of our timeline and see\nSee I'm into the future and you write these ideas up in a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know like sometimes give talks about this and different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get one says of things that then happened or didn't happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job who were they seem to be in some other reality and then they come back and this one ... ... what do you how do you how does that fit into the brain were you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of the experiences as well also in that chapter six um and then a little bit in the chapter on cs Lewis I'm\nAs well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's a famous writer of wrinkle in time\nJust recently a movie made a vat of that book she talks about ... and time travel and so on and some of her books so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right Monica my presence could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done pick up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what China's which is really counter intuitive and weird right I mean before I find people thought about climate is linear or something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we had a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of into defense of prime flows forward\nUm in fact though you know I find that a number of counter to the things to say one of them was that\nOf the ways that we experienced pine is probably just an illusion and a product of the limitations of our own consciousness that I find equation for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different than they really lay out of the universe that could be called the block universe\nUniverse that already exist so um you know all the patients in the universe at all times of the universe\nI'm already exist and are all laid out in this big block we are we are kind of passing through [laughter] after that that block right we occupy little portion that block but every moment in our past and in our in our president and in our future and then the earth's future and then our son future\nAnd and all of our defending futures over from authority laid out in the block at least according to the the laws of physics um and and this is actually discussion this company wants to look at it just got to my book but you can also look at Brian Greene's book he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of walk universe so I'm done\nAnd I was only laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies back all the time\nYeah you're right you're right it may it may not be big bill topical issues right like um faith investing in human free will and how we are we to make choices on and so I'm\nI'm ... and we can talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and somebody other people in my book did as they thought these problems was in fact you know I'm I think what happened happening is that you know the fact that he's feature moments are already laid out somehow in the black universe makes it more positive or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow\nLift itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should there for the natural world right to free spatial dimensions one kind of production dreaming up he said lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moments\nAnd Don believe that um you know you're going to find find here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space philosophers there um that the people who happen and some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\nI'm In and you could we could talk about that as an additional visual dimension or we could talk about that is now maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and he he got everybody everybody's sleeping self had this degree of freedom and he also believe that everyone if they haven't kept a journal by the head of the infant and they follow you got a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream job\nYou believe that everyone that they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and half of them I'm sort of mixed up together\nWell I guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that over there we're going to get into that ah those topics as well as near death experiences want to talk about the science is a sharman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we have discussed on this program before might fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and

text me immediately after he waited [laughter] at least there was a ...\nOf its times like this when that comes out right\nThat's right yeah when the phone started blown up with a a bragging I guess you'd say but that's okay I you know two years or oh made it we made it I don't know if the bullpen management was up to the snow but\nYou know now I was going to say it just seems like this was one of those games who's just a just felt like this is just it is that the resignation I think it already been kinda sending in after especially after Saturday\nYeah I I have to agree because look what they want a hundred and eight hundred sixty eight in that division and the second place she won a hundred games\nI mean the way the the better team and they'd been a fire tested all year long\nIt seems like ultimate bad luck the Dodgers to use in a row they get the Cinderella story and the sympathetic or you know fans on on Houston side last year and then this year just studying credible ... in Boston coming through\nTaught one to nine they just I mean even David Price had decent that back I mean come on\nWhen does that happen so ah I read that\nWas just that organization of old ladies around the country and they wear the red hats but now red hat belongs to big blue\nYeah it's a it's a cloud company and IBM has bought it for thirty four billion dollars by far the biggest acquisition that IBM's ever made and I think it's the third biggest tech I got a confirmed that but it's the top five for sure but I think it's number three as far as acquisitions go\nUm IBM needed is really huge it's an old debt deal though that's something to keep an eye on and take this they're paying sixty two percent premium on the closing share price for red hat\nOn friday that's a really high premium usually see premiums of like twenty maybe thirty percent depending on what you're getting for this but they have to have this because they they're they're behind and cloud computing and that's where it is going to the margins in cloud computing\nAre pretty high right 'cause you're cost it a little bit lower and what you're delivering is worth a little bit more so you can get a better profit margin off of that but Microsoft Amazon alphabet are all way ahead so this is the only way they could really say Bible Isaac is there a\nIs it is there a limit or a cap to cloud technology or is it is that something is just an unlimited thing more companies are going to be offering it and doing it\nProbably there's there's a lot of head room still in this space for eventually yeah we'll get market crowded and whatnot but\nAs long as they can still make chips and as long as they can still store a data than it's there's really a lot of room left here so I mean an IBM is late to the game okay that's fine ah there's still a lot of upside here but at the same time I'm Still a little bit worried I don't know what their revenue was looking like coming in but having to dump out thirty four billion in debt\nIn order to get back into the game it it that that's a that's a pretty heavy lift so ... we'll see how their quarterly look in the next couple of quarters\nWith his red hot a red hat look at where do they fit within the the ... the grouping of cloud companies I where where do they fit within it\nIf you're talking about market share and it's not huge but it's enough right it's a toehold in in in a market that eight of us\nThink of it like this a W Amazon Web services runs a about a third of the entire Internet wow right at that it's huge right I guess the biggest piece of pie Microsoft has a huge pot a piece of the pie too\nI'd say like maybe a fourth of that would be where about red hat is but with IBM and you know if I'd be up knows what to do it I mean it's it's a good it's a well run company so\nThey're gonna be able to put some management in here and have a strategy to kind of play it like I said play to catch up game I just wonder how much they had to pay in order to play\nYeah you know I mean that's thirty for Bill among\nThat's ridiculous and it's like one of the third biggest of all time as far as that's concerned\nThat's right and more IBM the entire I be a market capitalization is only a hundred and fourteen billion so they just gamble a quarter of their work\nOn this purchase in space that they frankly they they're really didn't have much of a choice I mean they could have bought half of it maybe or ... or a controller partnership something but I guess I just wanted to own it outright it's one of those by versus build you know like do we do we internalize this and and take those capital expenditures on in order to build\nA club service or should we just by once we can bolt in and then just trust that we knew how to steer the ship I think that they went with obviously with the by I mean it's there's no other way around it\nSo as of friday um Amazon is no longer the second most valuable company in the U.S that title now goes to Microsoft yup\nMicrosoft so how long has that expected like apple still being number one by the way I mean is it even close between wanting to\nNo no no it's a couple of hundred dollars between the two apples well above a trillion and has been there since about September", "show_name": "Wake Up Call", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "29"}
