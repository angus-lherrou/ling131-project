{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "Is those few very relaxed moments just before you drift off to sleep at night sleep researchers call that the hitting the gotcha state it is a state of time when you could not only reprogram your own side\nHe threw repeating affirmation Z or prayers are holding visualizations but but\nCyclical researchers have also found that those few moments before you drift asleep at night are prime time in ... Patel a path or extra sensory activity\nMysterious things occur when people hold African nations in mind or silently repeat them to themselves in those few moments just before going to sleep at night\nThat he is an exquisitely unusual supple suggestible time it's a time that each of us experiences every day you also experienced it just as you're coming to consciousness in the morning use that time that is the prime time for silently reciting affirmation stew yourself\nIt it seems to work doesn't\nThat's been my experience George when people ask me for a simple step to take that is always the step I give them again my mantra is never neglect simple things we have a habit of overlooking simple things used them there's more depth there than one might expect\nWhat are some of the positive mind control methods we should use\nWell one of the things that's most important is writing things down right down your goals and I don't mean on the computer I mean get out an old fashioned pencil and paper and do it because once you do that\nYou've actually created a physical manifestation so to speak of the things that you're looking for the actual tactile act\nOf writing something I think not only helps\nPersuade you mentally and in terms of your neural pathways of the goals that you're moving towards but you've actually done something empowering you've done something real if you sit down and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life\nAnd you know these are things you want with all your heart there not diversionary\nBut they are essential life goals\nTake that list put it on to some sort of a laminated card or something that you can carry with you look at it morning noon and night\nThink about it as much as possible and when things on that list come to you and over time they will come to you and they may come to quicker than you think\nJust expressed gratitude and most important of all don't tell anyone what you're doing remain silent because sometimes you share these things with other people and the roll their eyes or they'll say it's nonsense than they knock you off your resolve remain silent make your list\nCarry it with you review it three times a day memorize it and when the results arrive\nExpress things that is a method we can all do\nAnd it's easy isn't it once you get into it\nIt is easy that the the the the important thing is to do it with consistency is to do it with silence and us to do it with total stark honesty\nArriving at a definite aim in life or a a a small number of things that coalesce around one name has enormous power an aim is really another way of saying focus and we know that\nWhen you focus the sun's rays with a magnifying glass were prism they become an enormously powerful what is a laser other than focused light\nNatural laws are consistent your mind is powerful when it is focused which is why I keep emphasizing the idea that you have to really nailed down what you want in a very concrete way it'd be very honest with yourself that's we're focused comes from\nMitch since you've been doing this have you use these techniques for yourselves\nEvery day every single day George and I must tell you you know I my life has gone and directions that I never could have expected I've done television and that rating and and and and written many books and articles including\nIn places that are not known for their culture enthusiasm type written about these topics in the Washington Post the wall Street Journal the New York times I never dreamt that was possible and so I feel like I'm an example of the effectiveness of these\nMethods and everything that are offered to the coast family or things that I wrote tested myself I Would never ask somebody to do something that I hadn't experimented with myself\nOr you could tell you love doing what you're doing\nI really do I really do I mean you know ... it's a dream come true and the most literal sense you know Fifteen Years ago this is exactly what I pictured myself doing and exactly what I wanted to do be patient sometimes things happen quickly but sometimes a gestation period is also necessary\nIt is amazing work how people get this membership into the miracle\nGlide the miracle club I used to say that anybody can join the ... he didn't have to\nSign your name up any where there was no magic decoder ring in anything and of course that's true everybody who's listening is automatically a member in the ... of the miracle club but I got to thinking you know speaking of magic decoder rings maybe it would be fun if people had a little membership card so I asked a friend of mine a great artist named Tim boat\nTo draw up a membership card in America club but anybody who emailed me\nAnd I'm super easy to find throw my name into Google it'll take it in my website and my email email me and I will send you your own membership card to be in the miracle club you could sign that you could folded laminated carry it in your wallet just something fun to have with you to sort of keep you on course throughout the day to keep your thoughts\nSteady and productive so I I thought it would be fun for people to have an official card\nA designating their membership and the miracle club so send me an email you get America club membership card\nWe're going to take calls next hour with Mitch Horwitz in of course we will take your miracle stories as well I Would guess Mitch it's surprising how many people have miracle stories\nIt it is overwhelming you\nKnow we have to understand that life is made up of of of joys and and sometimes great tragedies but in as much as we do experience catastrophes in life and let's face it that's part of life\nWe also experienced extraordinary absurdly unexpected moments of good news there are in fact times George where we get just what we're looking for and I would say that's more than just the turn of the roulette wheel our minds play a role in\nThat again a miracle is a departure from all expected and all reasonable circumstantial\nWill come back with calls next on coast to coast they find out more about tonight just log on to go to ... am dot com\n\n\n[noise]\n\nDo I want to have brought worst or not we're not Gilbert and now you're outside reasons to visit along those is we number five you're\nWe're hearing on the bench around and said you were you in Ninety nine\n... or any\nOther time\nIn London during the day I was thinking\nIf I Am voting like Jimmy leading talk in some ways we're watching the game by twenty four hour news ram\nManny when they have nightmares than the boys in blue\nMore about the set out to be as now due to one in ...\nThe first to Santa Ana winds even a blow down\nPower man I don't know if you like our last that long for hours and hours yesterday\nExtreme cell and a woman in ... it was crazy weather yesterday we'll talk all about that and you didn't like let's say a manmade used a backpack\nTo haul the baby into a Walmart restroom by the Bible chat with ABC's hamburgers secretary in the ... has arrived in ...\nTo show he was killed without their clearance they only meant to torture and kidnap him and those involved will be held responsible\nWell that day and partners with what you heard the President's Day yesterday uh about there being roped killers inside the conflict but then there's also goes along with you know plausible deniability with the with the um Saudi royal family going well we didn't know we we just thought we were going to you know tortured the guy we didn't mean to kill him\nSo this story has a lot more to be told I mean we we don't know anything about what actually went down and Tom ... absolutely right when he uses the term rumor mill that's about all that we do have for certain is a really hot rumor mill at this point hey look this right now it's your chance to win some money\nYour shot at one thousand dollars and now they're making like she works bank to deliver it to hundreds you'll get affects confirming every plus I her radio invoke standard data basically supply of this nationwide contacts at the bank to two hundred two hundred and lucky\nThere did I get you off guard All right so what is going to happen is you're going to get a call from a number you don't recognize when you do\nTake that phone up this hour because it might be the guy going hey congratulations you've won a thousand bucks\nAnd if you don't pick it up and move on to somebody who will and your next dance when comes next hour during handle on the news or let's get back to some of the other stories coming out of the KFI twenty four hour newsroom we're talking propped up propositions and this year's ballot has something for practically everyone even kids\nAll those years balance say the smallest bond measure for lack of four would authorize one point five billion dollars for Thirteen children's hospitals in California and the money would be used on infrastructure improvements\nOne of the things that is happening down and you know across the state actually is set them off the statewide health planning and develop it meant requires that hospitals me a new improved seismic safety standards so all hospitals are working towards that goal\nUm and so what and what that means is that in twenty thirty a our hospitals needs to be able to be fully operational and the events of the major earthquakes and not just that the the building itself safe standing in the ... event of an earthquake but that it can continue to see patients\nAnd Louis Coons president of the California children's hospital association says they're not there yet\nWe still have eight hundred and Eighteen dads across our children's hospitals and that represents about twenty eight percent of our total capacity that are still not compliant with that new seismic safety standard including some does at the ... about twenty ... so what we want to use this this new bond measure forced to complete that size network\nGroup says the hospitals are also treading financial water is about two thirds of children's hospital patients use ...\nAnd the state of California ranks forty eighth when it comes to reimbursing providers in the Medicare program is it's one of the most um ... programs in the country so it's very hard for us to make all the infrastructure improvement needs that need to be made and children's hospitals on just to our own fundraising efforts\nAnd on top of all of that there's the hospitals core mission to help the kids and Cruz says the demand continues to rise\nAnd not demand is being driven by a couple of different things\nOne is that children with complex health conditions are living longer so and that's a good thing um so for example children was cystic fibrosis it used to be a condition um where children wouldn't survive out you know beyond being toddlers and now the average life expectancy for somebody with cystic fibrosis is over forty years\nUm the other thing you know so that's that's one example another would be um um infants born a extremely prematurely used to not survive but now are able to survive with with the improvements in medical technology\nOn the no side is the California Republican Party and communications director Matthew Fleming says the opposition is based on a broader philosophy the guys who gets borrowing\nAfter a considerable amount of debate the party's delegate opted to oppose this measure are not on\nThe merits self obviously um towards hospitals and children's health or or of the most important but um [noise] a lot of the funding can be found in the private sector and I think are delegated\nFelt like with you know a looming budget crisis and with um hundreds of billions of dollars in unfunded pension obligations and citizens school boards are having trouble keeping up with those payments were just felt like I'm borrowing more money maybe it wasn't a prudent choice swimming\nSays bond measures can end up being an empty burden on the state's general fund\nAnd two dozen fourteen voters approved a water bond which we were supportive of and um today nothing's really been built on that so just because these bombs get approval they borrowed the money but then um a lot of times the construction lag for for various reasons for for a really long time so\nI'm alternately we did feel like\nWith the pension invoke a\nPrices the way they are yeah it was better to post\nI Would say that children's hospitals have a track record of spending this money effectively to help build the infrastructure that we need to serve patience we're seeing an increase in crime of patience and increased number of patients on that account on and we we believe these funds are necessary to make sure that we can treat all the kids who need care from our hospitals\nFull it's run down the numbers here it'll be one point five billion dollars likely to be repaid over the next thirty five years with interest the total cost is projected to be about two point nine billion dollars it'll cost a million dollars a year from the general fund budget to repay the bonds\nAnd close to three quarters of the money will go to a private nonprofit hospitals working out to about a hundred thirty five billion dollars each\nOther Eighteen percent or fifty four million dollars each or go to five University of California acute care children's hospitals\nAnd the remaining ten percent that's going to go to public and private hospitals offering services to kids under the California children's services program

shelters up and they've had lined up and then you guys on your own are able to put something up that aside just quickly before we wrap this up the taste is outbreak that we've been talking about so much that's made the news\nYou were mentioning how they had been trying to clean up the streets but\nI've heard from reporter after reporter they go out there they actually watch the streets clean\nAnd the homeless leave their you know in ... and the street is clean but they come right back\nBringing with them or whatever you know they they're you know animals may have had with them or or whatever is on them and how do you stop that how you can bet that\nThe only way is to put people under a roof and and that at least the urgent needs to be immediate needs to be treated like\nA
