F. I. files we all the government say effectively will look here is\nOur data or as much of it as we can release\nYou know without compromising setting\nClassified information um ... you know and and the ultimate irony of all this might be ... genuinely governments don't really know what they're dealing with either I'm which takes me back to the mountain Reese\nQuite won't if we all dealing with some things so above and beyond comprehension let's say it would be an allergist to explaining quantum mechanics tuition and say\nYou never know you you never know when you look at Leonardo da Vinci's works or he depicted things that we have today I'm not sure you knew what the what what do we drawing what do you think\nWell he was clearly a visionary genius in a time travel\n[laughter] well I'm not sure about that but um I guess there are there are a handful of physicists working on that Ronald Merrill it\nComes to mind yep but I think there are some some others or you know I had a job and the ministry defense where I was paid to sing the unsinkable so I I don't really things out\nDid you get involved in remote viewing or anything like that like you work with the ministry you did\nYes absolutely we had you can't run a UFO program without finding yourself the the focal point for anything\nYou saw that any in any one kind of comes to the government about and of course we had we had people who said that they will psychics and they wanted to volunteer their services to the intelligence community to help us well you know locate\nSoviet ballistic missile submarines are on mosques buys them traitors button that sort of thing so we looked this is a classic low probability high impact scenario probably one way but if it does the payoff is so big\nWine on so we actually did have a program the U.S government of course had three over the years that we know about grill flame\nSon street can Stargate the ministry defense go into this briefly in about two thousand and one\nAnd do the study which which was classified I think the ... it's now classified and only ministry defense website actually all in the national archives website I'm not sure where but it's out there it it wasn't a very good study I have to say\nIt um didn't learn the lessons of of the U. S.\nPrograms and on because it was an intelligence program the age old problem they they work so much in silos but they didn't go out and talk to the sorts of people that they probably should have talked to I some of the people involved in Stargate and real frame and some trade\nWhat do you what do you think rumors about a congressional hearing on your phones the\nYes it has I and actually this this is a big breaking news story literally just this week it it turns out it's more than rumors 'em all you know from\nReliable sources that the Senate Armed services um Services Committee has already started looking at the two thousand four new may incident which of course was the focus of of some of these\nThese the classified videos that we've been talking about they've interviewed at least to the pilot and I think one of the right All right just\nSo so we have the Senate Armed Services Committee involved we also empower I'll have the house armed services committee involved and if you look at the congressional record\nFor the house armed services committee dated April ... you will see a paragraph tucked away and I think it's run through about forty three forty four pages but up right there on the second page paragraph for three I\nWon it says that the CIA say ... supply the committee with a briefing on basically what I did\nNick when we come back we'll talk more about these rumors of Russia hearings and then we'll take phone calls spine law were just saying with Nicole goes to goes the mind more about tonight just log on to ... dot com [noise]\n\n\n[noise] hey ask I\nHave you been saving for retirement and a vacuum are you ready to start making great financial decisions stopped the guesswork over finances and investing for retirement go to a trilogy F.

[noise]\nHadn't in Milwaukee for that game will talk about all of the happy moments from yesterday Kobe Bryant's after when this year apparently hasn't done much to raise his past we'll talk about that and we've just heard about the San Bernardino county sheriff's deputy being shot this morning I'll tell you more about the situation surrounding that\nThe Washington Post is published what could be the final article written by the disappeared and presumed dead journalists\nI mean we all know about Dennis Ross Dennis off the owner of the bunny ranch who died this week just hours after his birthday party the guy was on the ballot do for election in Nevada he's dead but he's still might wind cheery is this true and there's even a a thing as as possible\nYeah not only might he when he is probably expected to win according to his former campaign manager um yeah Dennis Hopper passed away on Tuesday he was Seventy two he had just had these big birthday parties at um his house and then a couple of his bravo and Nevada [noise]\nUm but yeah he he died after one of them and people have said it was you know he didn't do drugs he didn't drink he didn't smoke except for the occasional cigar [noise]\nUm but when it comes to the ballot his name is probably going to say on there the ballots are already printed up um he's running against a democratic woman for state legislature who is a former school administrator and she was trailing badly in the poll was expected to win this election easily\nOn them and said he thought he was going to go all the way to the governor's office some but you know\nNow that he's passed away his name will be on the ballot and here's what they're going to have to do now that he's gone with the vacancy they will then have a process of meeting with county commissioners and they're going to appoint\nSomebody to probably fill the seat to the legislature and here's the thing that ever it ... it's a it's actually a lot of Republicans are saying that um that they won't vote for him even though he has passed away\nBecause some even like maybe the evangelicals who hadn't supported him so much before say that well now we could appoint someone in there who's not quite [laughter] I'm like him and so I'm going to go ahead and vote for him\nWell yeah and you could see how and and I'm I'm pleased to see that it's not necessarily just going to go to the second runner up because if that's not the way that the people want to devote and all these people have already sending their mail in ballots are like hey wait a minute we wanted our vote counted that seems like a more fair process than to give it to a Democrat for whom they didn't vote\nYes correct I mean and and and that's why once the ballots are printed out the ballots printed up and you've got to do that and as you mentioned people vote by mail you know and and some who were not thrilled with Hoff who you know who had a you know pitched himself as the Trump from ... which was a town he was from\nUm you know very self styled Trump self styled Republican you know he he Trump wrote a book called the art of the deal\nI'm offered a book called the artificial him um he he really loves Donald Trump and some Republicans did not like him because of that I liked it but some didn't but now they're saying OK well he's passed away so I'm going to go ahead and vote for him and hope that somebody else who I think is more mainstream Republican Mike it on the ballot\nYeah and it doesn't surprise me because\nI think I'd well what did surprise me it was just he was running for election I just hadn't paid attention honestly and then yesterday when we were going through kind of the list of people who happen to be at his birthday party it was like the county coroner was there and there were some like share is\nA you know higher ups sheriff's department higher ups you were there and I thought last kind of weird that all these people you know we're like buddies with them but that makes sense if he was going into politics and was you know very politically connected there within ... or ... in within Nevada itself that totally makes more sense than\nYeah exactly and other person who was there it was the activists to hit the heavy on tax cut activists Grover Norquist um you know the anti tax guy\nUm he was there as well because off had been strongly against um this uh commerce tax in in Las Vegas that he had been fighting that and you know a lot of he had a lot of support in Las Vegas from a lot of people but again you know other side you know he's just a little too out there I Wish there was somebody else on the ballot\nNow his name will be on the ballot and according to his campaign manager he is likely to win\nHow fracking Siri well you know this world is a strange place and you're just one more story to add to that pile I Know I Love when I get\nThe story you're correct I have to say I was kinda glad when I saw what was yours last night on the list of stuff that Siri goodbye to you later that his ABCs Siri Preston\nAll right well we'll follow up and if he in fact does when we'll let you know and we'll tell you what the processes afterwards because you know\nI'm pretty sure this is probably unprecedented for the the folks there in ... but you know he owns the bunny ranch so I can only at you know this kind of go doesn't is really kind of goes far from the course with this one [noise]\nAnd by the way the mega millions jackpot has grown to nine hundred million\nLucky winner in tomorrow night's drawing could claim a cash lump sum of more than
