think that happens and and Heidi Heidi really covers this so beautifully um because she did she have a lot of people um to me you know email and talk to her about their experiences\nAnd there was an experience where um there was a it was a man who was ... experience they probably actually spoke to that man had men like\nDoesn't really have facial features he where it's like a foot door and sometimes a coat but what people get the feeling they have is out of fear right 'cause they'll see this kinda shadowy figure while they are their bodies paralyzed but they're awake and\nAnd one man's ass you know who are you and he said they called me scratch and scratches another name for the devil\nBashing the day when he tried to Adam and Eve away from God\nIt's okay to get that scratched out of the book wife\nAnd so clearly he's not a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory it's all it's a theory is that you know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience\nThat when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit the spirit goes off and parties and the actual face I'm sure many people have talked to you about that for planes\nAnd you know with our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this little space and I think that that's a little space before it lands properly and you are aligned on is when this can happen\nAgain it's just a theory which were pretty good ...\nIt's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition that I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have a bad because you know what\nThe light doesn't name more light or the dark doesn't need more dark dark needs a lot you know the the the darkness one flight so I think it's you know people are are these bright lights that I think that this entity kind of makes its way and and I don't\nReally want to spoil for folks 'cause I I I Hope people will read the book I'm a at what happened that last time that alec saw the ... man because of that is probably the most profound event that has happened in my entire life\nWould you want to duplicated duplicated that experience yeah yeah I can handle it now you would really yeah I could put you couldn't [noise]\nUm it was um oh let me just tell them I just tell your audience what happened\nWhat I'll do it if you want me to George and like\nAll right I'll tell them All right we have a couple of minutes yeah oh you use a chocolate left the blackout oh I'm Sorry\nI mean is when you say you're going to tell us\nOh yes Oh yes so I I thought how am I just tell everybody instead of just the thing about them having to read the book to find out because what happened was that Alex called in one night and said I saw that happening again\nAnd and he spoke to me and what he said to me was how her my name is Ron and I went he he said what\nHe said how her by name as wrong as I noticed that the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of I accept that it was not very nice jeeze and I said and he's trying to scare me away from you\nYou think that was him\nI don't think it was like that that but I think it was that man who knows I Would say a lot about a lot of people fair to say um but I think that you know\nIf anybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare either going to find that thing that triggers you right there I find that deep dark thing they're going to find\nWho is the antagonism this person's life and mine is my accept that and and he brought that up and Alex didn't didn't even know about my accepted didn't even know his name\nWhen all this was happening to you\n[laughter] we went weird yeah I mean\nAre you under control which is now I mean do you feel as if you're in control of what's happening\nI I Am I Am I Am I Am now because I now understand that I Am in charge I completely understand you and I am also I've become feel is\nUsed do photography all ... ... it's almost like that's the hobby will you do the ...\nYou know that goes for tiger fee and um and ah\nAnd storytelling it would be considered um the inciting event it's it's that event is what triggered all this other stuff to happen and photography was you know a little scary at first because I\nIt's weird it's it's it's weird there's no doubt and\nDo you know who the subject matter is for you you are these random ...\nUm [noise] I Do have a picture of my mother has a um I didn't include it in the book because it felt a little too sacred\nTo include that in the book or do um but other than that I don't recognize a single one I've had a couple that have come back twice\nSome of them looked like the Eighteen hundreds garb\nThey do they do\nYeah no I I don't know is all of them are there some of them um you know I feel like I've gotten a few that looks like they had a rough time the last time\nThey and their bodies like a guy looks like he's been beat up a woman who looks like she's very sad maybe\nThat's how he died it could very well be\nCould very well do they talk to you\nYou know I'm after a while and after I got past the I Can't believe this is happening to me face um when I Would be able to see them I Would I Would start to ask 'em I I was better\nWeirdly by communication is better when I talked to love what
