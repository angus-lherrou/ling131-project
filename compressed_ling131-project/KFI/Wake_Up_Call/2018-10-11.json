{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "End of the story Lisa gets her book done and it becomes an Amazon best seller so I've seen this over and over enough to to have the doubting Thomas in me start getting pretty persuaded that something amazing is going on here\nThe skeptics would say walk right\nThey would but when you get a hundred percent of people and they've had you know we have people where\nRobert he and his wife were in financial debt and they needed you know a certain amount of money I think it was about three thousand dollars or something like that damn it comes in exactly what they need as a bankruptcy fun\nOn a lot of the blue out of\nThe blue another woman over spent\nAnd she gets you know she over spent on a holiday or group doesn't intention for she hears from the hotel says we accidentally overcharged you buy exactly the money she was overdrawn\nI'm somebody else was down to her last two hundred dollars she wanted to set up a website she had a port wine staying and one in ... and was wanting to do a Web site and set up a business to help other people not feel bad about their birth marks\nAnd she's down through last two hundred dollars and she suddenly here from Lloyd's of London ... she had been a former employee to say that she could get a special amount of money because she had been part of this again out of the blue\nSo this happens so often that it it has convinced me it's not just look it's not just happenstance\nAnd you say universities are studying the power they what are they doing\nWell we did the um we did the brain study you know and then we found and as I say we compared it to things like meditation and we found that it's not the same in all ... state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis what makes you feel like you're part of something much much bigger the power of eight you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and granddaughter\nUm and again we've looked at it compared to other um mystical states and its\nIdentical to a Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this hot largest chiropractic university\nUm has their nearest scientists and we're planning a study with their biology department to looking at the immune system markers so what changes in your immune system when you do this\nBut one of the other big pieces of this I talked about it with altruism was the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments\nAnd they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas near it's the longest near the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on um things like releasing oxytocin which is a hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we're caring for babies\nAnd ... the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so\nWhen we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that we um you know we we actually get healthier but the other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending love to the Israelis\nThey found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group [noise]\nUm that Vegas you're also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like us\nSo that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow America America is so polarized now what if we started doing intention experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be ... that would be an interesting experiment\n[laughter] well you know we're doing one this set this Sunday on doing a pilot experiment like that in ... county in Florida um we're gonna do something about lowering violence but\nWe've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next next spring\nOn where we want people you know of the different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nYou talked about a mirror of what is that\nWell the mere affect me was the biggest piece of this George because\nYou know we weren't just seeing affects among the receivers of stuff and the receivers of the big intention experiments you know the outcome of the biggest change all that was amazing to me was what happened\nTo the participants in these intention experiments\nSo when we started doing these these experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and we're able to get on the Web site and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly ah I asked them how it was for them and I was getting answers back like this\nUm I felt like I was part of the higher network you know my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beam in Star Trek remember these are people who are participating in their own\nHome in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly is after they participated in a piece experiment their lives became more peaceful\nThey were making up with relatives that we're getting along better with their partners they were getting along better with their bosses in their co workers\nThey were ... and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with\nSo that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing when we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lives were more peaceful\nSo in a way that's probably the most the most powerful part of the intention experiment it's not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation in what happens to those people need changes their lives being part of that\nWhen we're going to come back in the moment and take phone calls I've still got a few more questions for you as we talk about the power of aid but we'll take phone calls in just a second on coast to coast am Lynn Mick Jagger with us the giants in the field with the intention is to\nFind out more about tonight just log on to go to ... am dot com\n\nMa last week I mean where did you get all the cash on

around half a million\nAll right Pete thank you so much for the update I'm Glad you're safe and we will be talking with you more thank you I take care of that is ABC's Pete comes and that yeah I got a I think I told you yesterday\nSo my husband is you know from the south and his family they're kind of all over the south and one of his aunts has they have a a beach house in panacea\nWhich is a little teeny tiny community I'm ... I mean we're talking one store one like nice restaurant that's about it in this whole little community and her house is right on one of the waterways and uh so we had we been there one time a long time ago and\nI remember thinking walk you know like walking out like wow they heard doc is like right on the water like the the water comes right up to the edge of it\nSo I texture yesterday you know just to say like hey you know we're thinking hey you guys and hope everything goes okay for the house there and and stuff and she said I got it back and she said I'm In a region her tax actually it's ... Jones she's a generally are in shock and utter disbelief about this storm\nWe lost another doc our sense it looks like water and crappy got in the house with a twelve foot surge\nSo they had twelve feet of water in this house which sits literally at the water's edge\nNow when she said crappy for people are going what is ... ... copies fish so there are fish inside the house it's just weird to even think about that anyway\nThat's what these people are going through so hey but Jones lucky her house is still standing a lot of these people's homes are still standing so\nA lot of people are going to be assessing the damage right now I mean just think about that it's like you know after a fire or after at you know earthquake you usually know because typically you're there but I'll fire where people go I got to go in and see what's left of my house that's what's happening to these people and they may like fire victims\nGet stuck outside for a while because some of the roads are closed\nOr they are just unacceptable right now or they're too many trees down like Pete mentioned so they can't get in there so the hurry up and wait for all of these people must just be
