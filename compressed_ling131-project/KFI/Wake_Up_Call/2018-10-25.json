Conley was sitting in front of the president\nSo he got he but but when I don't know is whether he was in a bench before him how that seating arrangement was I I I think he was sitting in a bench in front of the president or the way I like to I think he was in the front\nAt so the so a governor calmly and his wife were in front of President Kennedy and his wife\nSo there were three people in the front seat\nNo they were in another so it ...\nWhat if in another world feeding their and Andy ... or the other Secret Service agent was on the passenger side so you were at six people\nIn their car would have been six strange run in the sun was looking at it but what he did which can you turn Tom spike up for just one second to any purchased ... tell me what you're saying\nWell I just I just pulled up to the ... film\nAnd I'm watching them come over and what is described Kennedy back with his wife right and I'm hoping you can hear me 'cause I'm I'm looking at the film are now I hear you [noise] and uh and then a ... I don't see a third row of seats I I didn't I don't remember seeing the third row either built Thanks Don\n... and and again I'm that's what I always thought that it was just Secret Service agents at the front seat and then second ... governor Carl Lee and his wife and his wife was to his laptop president Jackie were in the back and Jackie was to his left\nLet's turn I mean by definitely do the secret service agent was on the front driving because everybody accused him of I'm turning around shooting the president uh yeah and I don't believe that happened\nBut no I you know again I think about this and I studied that as well because William Cooper is one thing that I write you know I thought about it I thought okay well the driver would have had driven standard if that's the case and also\nHe's driving so that they'd have to take his eyes off the road to turn and then make perfect shot you know with the pan\nAnd everybody wants to see that yeah so I you know I don't buy that one\nEveryone Bill thanks for being behind the secret door you've\nGiven us a whole lot to think about when the new book comes out get back on the program for a full show up next one more guest behind the secret doors\nTo find out more about tonight's gifts to log on to the coast to coast am dot com\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] ask\nThem throughout their lowest prices in years some prices dropping over thirty percent\nAfter a diamond solitaire is reduce from four Ninety nine to three Ninety nine one curious now seven Ninety nine and two carats sizes now nine fifty per carrot the jury exchange has thousands of geography diamonds insane price was\nCertified one or a diamonds now just Seventeen Ninety to carry now fifty eight Ninety we have thousands of designer mounting starting at one Ninety nine and your diamonds suck while you watch\nOne camera three stone rings are six Ninety nine to ...

at the White House how was that sort of received on both sides of the aisle on the hill yesterday even though they're not in session but\nRight well I mean we heard from a Nancy Pelosi in a couple of

here that the targets were either critics of the president or or people that they that the president routinely talks about that the president himself even even though he started with the message of
