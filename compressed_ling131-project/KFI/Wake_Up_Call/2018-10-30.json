{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "And in this nightmare the whole world was shaking it was like a the earth was the scene like a horrible earthquake but you know there were fissures in the ground and you couldn't stand up it was so bad and mountains were crumbling in the sky was turning the dark color and it was just like an end of the worst end of the world kind of apocalyptic scenario\nAnd I woke up in a in a sweat and and nervous and scared and\nI I went to breakfast with my uh friends are just like a continental breakfast and I told them about this nightmare and then we proceeded to the uh the base\nAnd uh we were on a tour when the sirens went off and they closed off the base and we went back to the education center and saw what was happening on nine eleven so so that was my um my pre cognitive or premonition dream it wasn't specifically about airplanes or buildings but it certainly was\nA the you know in a very apocalyptic event that or or life changing and world changing event and later I learned that this was there were many people around the world who had a nightmare as some more much more specific than mine but that very morning that this happened\nSo there is my daughter had none of those two we didn't know that yeah we didn't know what it was Bruce but uh she she she had the vision she was ah in in a city where\nAsh was falling down on her she said it was about a foot deep um but you know then then you like a day later it happened and she said that was\nYeah yeah some people have that morning some people had it a few days before the day before but there's there's so many people around the world who have who have a verified that this that this happened to them and so there is something to that this this that that that people had since that an end in a on a massive scale so which is\nAnd it's been studied uh I think\nThat the rate in talks about and one of his books I I I Can't remember which one of his books but yeah he does talk about that\nWhat do you think of to let them see [noise]\nI I I think I've had experience with with telepathy with my with my mother and uh she was very psychic and we used to just a regular deck of playing cards when I was a younger a ...\nA camping on the Oregon Coast we'd have wonderful camping trips\nOn the Oregon Coast in at night my mom would bring out the deck of cards and we would try to read each others' minds so she would send you know she'd have a car and she looked at it and send me the you know try to send me with what the card was and a\nWet well above chance we would get the the suit right we would get the sometimes the number or this or the ... you know whether it was a king or jak face card\nA very often we get it we get it a right\nTo the to the point where it would make my dad upset because he was a very practical\nCarpenter a blue collar guy no nonsense and he let us do it for a while and then once we had got a few hits he'd say okay that's it stop it\nNo more yeah he did he said when dad said stop if we had to stop a and my my mom you know so I had a special kind of relationship with my mom dealing with that and that she's the one that I think really cultivated it and I I that's where I got it from it so it wasn't for my dad I got the story telling thing from my dad that's how I ended up being a history teacher but I\nThink I got the psychic stuff from my my mom\nDid you have a big foot experience\n[noise] I I did uh I well I think it was a I'll tell you this was a ... near Oric which is northern California and the redwoods highway there and a driving south\nAnd uh my girlfriend was was asleep in the uh uh in the passenger seat and it was dark and we were driving to you know the big tall trees it's very ... and as I was making I think it was the road kind of veered to the left a little bit\nAll of a sudden right on the edge of the road like with its feet on the on the pavement was this very tall creature and it was Harry and it was a very dark but\nIt was definitely a living creature and it and it was wearing of all things that was wearing a hat\nA ... it was just kind of leaning into the truck is we drove by and it\nCouldn't have been more than you know maybe a foot away from the you know my side view mirrors I drove by\nAnd or the immediately I I I I woke up my girlfriend and I said I I think I just saw big foot and and she and she said what what are you talking about big foot I said well I think I thought I'm going to turn around and go back and then she she [laughter] she said no no that's okay just keep drive me\nAnd I said well we got to find a hotel there's one here another mile from here and she goes no no you keep going you keep going and\nUh so we kept driving but but later I found out that that that particular location near Oric was only I think about ten miles away from the location where that that one of the most famous big foot or videos is from\nThe Paterson given one yeah exactly yeah we'll be talking with ... and ...\nThere's been yeah there's been more sightings there than than any other place in in the United states as far as I understand from what the ... the uh the reading that I did\nAbout it so now if it if it was a hoax or this guy's taken a big chance by stand right on the on the edge of the highway and the dark total dark\nYup uh and then you can't get shot at or anything she got\nRun over crazy you know whatever or you know the alternative which which you know they're so that that was my my one and only a a big foot experience what\nAbout the uh thirty four episodes that occurred with you\nWhich is the favorite for you [noise] well I I don't want you actually like\nYeah I I'll have to say it all the connections with my my my parents with my mother ah when my mother came to me an inhibition after she had passed away and\nAnd uh and told me she she doesn't say much when she comes to me but she came to me and said and she was golden you know she was herself but very healthy she you know she died of cancer and she was very healthy looking she was gold and had this golden glove\nAnd uh she came to me and said you know there is a heaven that's what she told me and then that was it that was that was one appearance so that's\nWhere she was that's always a good thing Bruce stay with us we're going to take a moment\nFor a quick break but

the U.S Mexico border then at six o five it's handle on the news handles going to tell us about what is just come across\nThe news room a President Trump has as says he will play he plans to sign an executive order that would end citizenship for the children of non citizens and illegal immigrants born on us soil so when they say you know they come and they do a ... babies\nHe talks about his critics and the way he talks about political opponents and whether or not that's fueling some of the divisiveness an air across the country\nAny reason why you think a ... or is it a coincidence that you say that this was the first one she's had since October ... ... is it do you think it's any possibility that he might\nPull back a little bit because he's doing what he's doing on the campaign trail which is the same fire and burn stone but at the same time it seems when he's at the White House he gets a little less contentious as far as that's concerned maybe throwing Sarah out there to kind of be not the bad guy necessarily but definitely the one to hold up like you did\nYou know my sense of this is that we've seen the president so much over the last couple of weeks while Sarah's faded into the background and hasn't been at the podium the president is taking questions on an almost daily basis but I think yesterday that that the scheduling of that briefing was very deliberate because they'd be the why now after three weeks of not getting briefings\nAnd I actually leading up to the to next week's mid term right\nRight it can certainly had been speculation that maybe they wouldn't even brief until after the midterms just avoid talking policy in any controversy until after voters go to the polls but I think though that you know they were not happy\nWith the coverage and the questions that were being raised after the shooting and at the headlines that were saying you know the president's rhetoric could be fueling acts like this and and what a lot of his critics are saying over the past couple of days\nAnd I think they decided you know we gotta have Sarah go out there and I mean she was aggressive laying in the reporters\nAnd did you come out that way like you guys saw this coming\nEither she came out first of the very emotional statement about the shooting and about the victims and about the president's reaction but then once the question started it was a pretty fired up press secretary so you know and and the president likes that we've seen him\nA you know him as they like to say here's an audience of one sometimes you're playing to be the president has watching in the oval office on television\nAnd I think there was a deliberate strategy to sentence air out yesterday be very aggressive and deflect any of the blame that presidents and getting in the last few days\nAnd I'm I'm so fast and I'm Sorry this was a little sort of behind the scenes but um I just really curious as to when we see things like yesterday with with a cost of Jim ... from CNN you know pushing her on it saying you know you guys need to have the guts to point out which outlets specifically he's referring to and I'm always fascinated when you see\nHim or anybody that's questioning I'm looking at all of you guys the rest of you guys and your reactions of I I don't it's it's I don't know you guys can sit in there and he's talking actually about you guys yeah\nYeah I you know you do have to always remember there's cameras everywhere you know not to watch your reaction as a TV reporter certainly are perhaps more aware of that ... yeah you're on the cameras are there but it does get personal and it does I\nThink you know to get a little bit more behind the scenes and the very small room and people are very surprised when they come in and see how tight it is and I'm just jam packed\nAnd it gets hot in the air like quite literally he\nUh when they're that many people and things are getting a little testy between the press and the press secretary but I you know we like when she comes out we wish you would do it every day\nAnd when the cameras go off or when they're done is it always the same where they they leave immediately whether it's fair or anybody else or or how often are there are sort of off the record or just conversations taking place around if at all\nLike you know certainly there are accessible that is their job literally there were getting paid by the taxpayers to take questions and ah you know answer to the press and the American people but\nYou know the strategy certainly has been in the last couple of weeks to do interviews with what the White House deals are more friendly outlets and reporters the only times we've actually been able to ask Sarah Sanders questions in the last few weeks is when you catcher in the driveway after she'd come back from an interview with Fox News\nSo and do you do you guys ever feel like you're sort of getting a a kind of a wink wink we're doing it for the cameras sort of thing at all or direct that impression\nI think everybody going back to the Clinton Administration would say that once the cameras were turned on in the briefing room than there is an element of performance by everybody that the White House's\nAnd political people will say it's the journalist who are performing for the cameras that of course they both say it's press secretary who comes out and doesn't necessarily answer questions but certainly gets a sound bite out which is what they want to see played on the news later\nWow that's just the fascinates me I Love it sort of behind the scenes so what are we looking at today\nPresident and the first lady will head to Pittsburgh later this afternoon I no official details yet on what they will do who they will meet with the president says he liked to make a stop at a hospital to visit with some of the wounded law enforcement officers and think medical staff so perhaps it will look like that\nUh but it's a very very short visit just a handful of hours on the ground\nBall and it'll the mayor had said you're not welcome here or something that affects you have to\nBe a disruption I mean the funerals begin today there are three funerals in Pittsburgh and the mayor didn't want that to be at a disruption or distraction you know they're going to certainly need a lot of security resources put to the funerals uh and people are gonna want to go to the funeral\nAnd more and some of the leaders from the from the synagogue or and they will you handing these yeah and they seem to be a little bit more specific in there don't come here well now thing\nYou know there was one group that had said they didn't want the president to come but the rabbi Jeffrey Myers who is a performing the service that day ah\nWhen the shooting happened said that the president is welcome to come but certainly you know he's only there for a couple of hours I think it's notable he's going later in the day and perhaps his timing so that he can still meet with people and not disrupt the scheduled events\nAnd oh and one less thing so yesterday there was this thing with the with the Halloween and the kids being there and and and Trump grabbed one of the the staff look shaped like a surgeon at the top and he started waving it around I he look this isn't at this point of anything to do with his politics or anything like that he just does not look comfortable around\nYeah they do these nice fund events for military families and staff families and a half white also beautiful I'll say that I wasn't here for it though\nOh okay good driver so you
