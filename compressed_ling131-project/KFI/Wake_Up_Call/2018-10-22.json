{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KFI", "content": "Yeah not at all I mean you know the shark population in the Pacific at the time was much more concentrated and\nFrom the report from the survivors you know there were hundreds of sharks are circling them at any given time and you know they would it would be frenzied attacks and I think you know land line votes for\nTens of stories of just men and you know having everybody right next to them taking you know and they didn't know who the sharks were going to attack it was not a real rhyme or reason to it and so they were always in fear\nAnd one of those terrible stories was where you know there were\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the clerks pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and men were spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked and there was nothing left\nAnd so reports like this for coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers accounts because by the time Mr rescue arrived the men were really incoherent they were able to tell us know what was happening\nThat point in the story but you know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men and board is\nBecause the shark attack a tax increase and I guess you know I don't know how much shuts realize things but they said it seem as they were pulling the men from the water the shark attacks increased and you know this is\nI Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think seeing one sharks would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors for foreigners they were so sick they could walk on their backs you know for shark sharks that we're underneath them just swimming there they cannot stand on them\nThere's one account or you know we're going to be coming delirious when you look young trucks making ah there's food just reached out and grab some food right\nMhm yeah I'm young and some by the name of John Ralston he actually took his socks off\nAnd thinking he was going to wiggle his toes of base to learn the sharks and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to his senses of last minute you realize oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and managed to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing is\nSome of the worst effects are going to happen to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah everyone now the Thomas the end of the war and they're having this nearly\nA sale may think across the Philippine see 'em and then the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours and now we were talking about the hoarding of water credit Sarah mentioned there were only a sixteen rap\nBetween the ... there were four groups within three groups that there were four groups of four rats or three groups that for a raft in any case\nThere were four groups to form rafts but then the one group split apart on the second thing how can you that's right so that they were so any water and it was available which only available on the raft\nAnd said there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in and the third day and they were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were some men have absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how can you think that there were others who although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the dehydration itself was perversely causing then to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nTo some of them to come to the idea that they can stream them salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding out the ... piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through [laughter]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember thinking mom had ice in the back of her head like or a superpower was spot in trouble before it happened when
