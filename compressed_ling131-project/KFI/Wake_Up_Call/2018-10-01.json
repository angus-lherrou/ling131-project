they look like what the realms were like what they did anyway so I just encourage you to do that but here's the story this is true\nIt it was before nine teen Ninety six I used to live in Rochester\nBut I was living in California I drove across the country many times I went to visit some friends in Rochester ah I'll Try and find out the exact date but right now I Can't I'm going to send you an email by the way I'll say I spoke to you\nOn the Appalachian Trail from Rochester to Philadelphia you there's ways to drive in many places in the Appalachian Trail you can pull off the road and just walk and take a nice walk on the trail and one time I did that in the afternoon\nAnd there was a a man or woman and a boy and a couple of other people walking in one direction and we started talking and walking within five minutes another family came from around al ... similar to me out of nowhere\nAnd there were picnic tables right near there and the one woman who I was very suspicious of that just appeared\nSaid Hi to the other one and she had a girl and they said oh what can our kids play and the the the people that I had been walking with the mother said yeah and we sat down at a picnic table and the the strange woman said to the other lady that I had been walking was what's your name\nThey they tell him that name and the woman says that's our name too\nAnd then about three minutes later the lady looks and the boys gone and she starts calling them and I got up and I walk around and I swear to God I Am not making this up\nThere was a close creature over the boy the boy had passed out or I don't know if the creature bump them but this is the part I Want you to know it had\nKinda futuristic very tight fitting clothes it jumped this creature looked humanoid\nBut not totally human it jumped at least twenty feet from the ground\nWithout running jumped up to the the middle of a tree where you know the branches start coming out\nAnd then I just turned around and I went back I didn't say a word I was scared I thought that the creature and those people that are pure were part of the same group I thought they were military people and this creature was a genetic hybrid says what I Believe\n[noise]\nWell that's quite a story a David any reaction to that\nKnow interesting\nYou know you do have some uh past well thank you for calling with

theories than call in and we'll we'll have plenty of time to chat in the next hour\nIn some of your books David and I'm not sure if I don't remember an example here you you reference it about an earlier book in this new book about the boulders\nAnd I I was always wondering well heck there's boulders all over the place how can that relate to the missing persons a mystery\nYou have a couple of cases where witnesses tell you why it it relates that these things sort of come alive um or they move right\n[noise] well yeah I wrote a story in my last book one right before the [noise] about a

decorating I Know you have I Am\nSick sweaty and some of the stories were watching in the camp I newsrooms\nThis started October ... a year since the mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed fifty eight people were going to talk a lot more about that this morning\nIncluding ... in debt at five fifty with ABC's ... stuff underground side the bill requiring every publicly traded companies boards you include women and angels manager Mike ... is stepping down after Nineteen seasons at five oh five\nMore than likely though your forecast looks like it's going to be later either this evening into tomorrow probably best chance is Tuesday into Wednesday but don't be surprised if you do get some sprinkles in the next you know I don't know safety\nAnd we're probably twelve Fifteen hours away from the best chance at this point so anyway but we'll take what we can get just Mother Nature be gentle because think of all the fires that we've had here in California this year we don't need any goalie washers right out of the chute so you know to be careful about that\nWell the Arizona prosecutor who questioned Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's accuser at the Senate hearing last week says no reasonable prosecutor would pursue the case Maricopa County prosecutor Rachel Mitchell a Phoenix wrote\nIn a memo to Republicans on the Senate Judiciary committee that Christine Blasey Ford did not present it consistent account of the allegations against the Supreme Court nominee now Ford says Kevin op hinder down and tried to tear off her clothes at a party when they were in high school in the early eighties\nThe FBI is investigating boards planes and other allegations this week before the Senate votes on whether to confirmed Kavanaugh's nomination we're going to talk more about that in just a second with ABC's Aaron ... now the Supreme Court does start its new term today with only eight justices\nThat nine feet is still unfilled until this whole debacle over a Brett Kavanaugh is straightened out the remaining justices will start hearing arguments in the new term that runs through next June the first argument will be a property rights case involving protected habitat for an endangered frog\nThat's out only found in a pond in Mississippi [noise]\nGoal on the other hand you have to be able to do what's best to hand it has been built a belt and and you know if if the FBI ultimately concluded needed more time maybe the FBI will ask and it would be hard to imagine that the that anybody saying yeah sure go take all the time you need right\nExactly alright here and thank you so much will follow this went along with you they later\nVia by that is ABC there and ... and yeah I mean so in one hand I think well how did this come up when they do these bizarre background checks because they asked him the weirdest questions you can imagine and then on the other hand though I can honestly say it's not like\nAnybody ever went to now that this is not true I Do know that they did talk to one scotch high school friends and I do know that for a fact but did they ask him specifically did Scott have a problem with sexual harassment or was he ever accused of anything like that\nI I doubt it I mean I Know I don't know exactly what questions they asked but would there had been anything to even lead them down that road when they were asking questions like that probably not\nSo this could be an entirely new part of being background investigation because they didn't even know that that way as an option that there was a day or they're in this case\nSo anyway I got five
