today at age fifty seven\n[laughter] I think it's obvious that\nOur government isn't telling us the truth about a lot of things and I think that all of the stuff you know I've never seen\nAliens per se meaning the grave or any of them but\nI think is pretty credible now because you have the Internet and people post and flying crab wind cue stuff they don't fly is flying with no moving parts and I think our government knows a lot way more than what they're telling us\nBeen a big it all goes together this UFO stuff what the government is doing\nAnd that all of the ancient history having to do with religious figures could be advanced technology being used by advanced intelligence is in this cosmos\nExactly for ... or extraterrestrial whatever you want to you they don't want to tell you

ABC's Stephanie Ramos who was that the White House yesterday morning Stephanie hey good morning the president has obviously made comments including this morning and his little tweet about CNN\nAnd mainstream media and what he says is their role in the whole mail bomb issue in general is there hasn't been any word from the White House about a response to save ... former CIA director John Brennan who got one of the packages and\nCalled out Trump himself for his own language and sort of divisive rhetoric\nAt no we I mean when yesterday we heard from a white\nHouse press secretary Sarah Sanders who was adamant that the president is not responsible for these suspected\nCheesy downright offensive yesterday oh\nAbsolutely she says she says he he he will continue to lay out the differences between Democrats and Republicans basically say everything will stay the same and it has this morning the president tweeting\nAbout CNN which was it was interesting because he said it was about it's been he didn't say anything about the targets for about forty hours but early this morning at three o'clock hour\nEastern time he tweeted about CNN um just blaming them saying that they're the ones responsible for for the base of the current political climate\nAnd I again there's no no change from all whatsoever ever and a\nBrennan yesterday obviously kind of putting it back on Trump's so that so they're not ... he's keeping his up on the media he's ... I mean while he may still talk about his his the Democrats or the or political rivals or anything like that he's still seems to be getting the message on the mainstream media at this point\nRight absolutely President Trump he he believed that he is being unfairly linked to those type bombs and he is this morning stepping up his attack on the media tweeting about CNN he said that uh this is what he tweeted funny how lowly rate at CNN and others can criticize me out of well even blaming me for the current state of bombs\nAnd ridiculous and comparing this September eleventh now interesting enough about half an hour earlier he's funny he sent a partial version of that tweet that just read\nFunny how lowly rate at CNN and others can criticize out\nUm as far as that response to John Brennan we have not heard of response yet we heard from Sarah Sanders yesterday uh we'll see if we hear from her today but John Brennan I mean not holding back at all he of course was one of the\nSo in the change doesn't really or at least a price increase doesn't really start until after the year right\nExactly yeah so go out get Kenny enjoy the low prices now because next Halloween it's going to be a little more pricey Brian\nThanks for joining us and give us a heads up we're already buying more chocolate this time of year but the holidays like you said now we know to buy even more just to hang onto thanks Ryan\nSure take care\nI when we come back at it is our business ... business in tech expert Jason middle dinner right now it's checked in traffic from your helpful so Cal Honda traffic center taken away Robin\nDon't eat the LA on sixty weapon ready to seven ten hearing about some of the car spin out it takes away the left lane so that's going to be a bit of a struggle for me from about Atlanta so far Long Beach on the seventh ... north bound connected to the four or five south\nIt's a big rig that stalled in the right lane not a huge delayed though Iran should cook them and get you can eat before car nearly interact with a big rig to write lanes are taken away that is definitely packed in right around campus Ontario ...

KFI\n[noise]\nAm\nI Am struck me let me talk in his wake\nPros you're filling in for Jennifer Jones leave here some of the stories were covering this morning\n\n\nWere born from us you logical survey says he won't he knows the in the country are classified as a very high threat one of those is Mount Shasta in northern California us has more than a hundred and sixty active volcanoes didn't know that the most dangerous says kilo in Hawaii obviously which had a bigger rushing this year the Trump Administration is expected\nTo send the eight hundred or more troops to the U.S Mexico border to support the border patrol President Trump says he's addressing what he calls a national emergency at the border and World Series has set a record Dodger Stadium and Fenway Park or twenty five hundred eighty eight miles apart\nThat's the longest distance between fall classic venues in threes tonight at five in Los Angeles and he and five Seventy LA sports five fifty we're going to talk with ABC's Mary Beth quirk she'll give us a first look at Black Friday yeah it's coming just few weeks away\nIs even a thing anymore you know with Cyber Monday and all six o five and handle on the news handles going to tell us about one kid's attempt to set his school on fire\nAnd the will leak the details and eight o'clock handles going to talk live in Studio with Ken Starr you know Ken Starr investigated President Clinton in the Nineteen nineties and that investigation that started with whitewater and ended up with Monica Lewinsky right now it's our business is with my business in tech expert Jason metal to\nIs that Google being told to calm down\nWell [laughter] yeah it it's kind of thing you know Google is definitely a\nDamage control right now a story came out in the times New York times\nThat I and the creator of Android operating system Android Andy Ruben um had a series of questionable sexual relationships with ah employees\nAt the time they say they now have a policy against certain things especially if they were not people who were reporting you know into into that person's department or whatever they were running\nUm yeah but so instead of firing somebody after finding a credible sexual harassment claim they didn't fire and that could have but they let him walk with about Ninety million\nAnd a and so yesterday a Google comes out and says hey by the way we do have more policies were much better about this and where you're fired forty eight people over the past three\nYears with little or no compensation on their way out the door so they are in damage control if they didn't see this coming it's crazy ... and given the fact that they didn't go to Capitol Hill you probably saw the empty chair earlier this year right when you know\nFacebook was their Twitter was there in W. jak went for Jack Dorsey went for Twitter and Google was an empty chair because they didn't want to have to admit in public that they had just been hacked as well so big it I mean the ... that led to Google Plus being shut down so for both of us who still use Google Plus that was a big deal okay\nSo the tech boroughs\nAre really feeling a lot of pushback right now it's not just regulation although that you do think some version of regulation has to come pretty soon it has to do with other things to it has to do with gobbling up competitors has to do with like I said the tech bro culture that has stuck up here in Silicon valley is seems really hard to break I Do it on my show\nI Try to break it every week on my show at least one sack but just 'cause it just has to do something has to give this has to stop and it just keeps coming out these headlines are terrible that happen\nI mean Ninety million dollars after ... ... allegedly forcing somebody to perform something in a hotel room on a business trip that's ridiculous\nSome so they so they admitted or just now said or admitted that they that they fired forty eight people that were terminated for sexual rap right did they say any of those other people were compensated they do say some of them weren't or they're just trying to compare to the one\nThey're just tried to compare the ... they're just trying to shave the corners the shark corners off of this story right now by saying before people have been terminated for sexual harassment including Thirteen over senior managers or above and this comes from the new CEO because this happened under Larry Page with Larry was backing CEO\nOr some DARPA chai and the vice president of people operations as they called their Eileen not and they send an email yesterday to all staff\nAnd then it was leaked of course are media we to the media uh so\nSo I'm just I'm just trying to get this straight that they're that they they admit to paying Ninety million dollars to the c._e._o. who was let go because of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct\nAnd their reasoning is well yeah but the biggest guy we met and we gave Ninety million to put all these ... and other people who weren't the c._e._o. got nothing and I sit on hospitals to calm them down\nExactly pretty much if you you pretty much nailed it right there I I also like I was talking to an anchor here or that I'm On with and I basically I told her the same thing was kinda like you know we take this very seriously um unless you're really really important to the company\n[laughter] okay let's just not the way to\nGo forward it's just not I mean it's a\nAnyway I'm going to be the company that you know everybody was writing it's all you know it's all one big family you know it's it's world working for each other and there it turns out they're kind of just like at least the perception that most people have a big corporations after all\nWell pretty much I mean you know Google has that thing called the twenty percent rule I don't know if you know this but people who work at Google or given twenty percent of their pay time to work on a personal passion project as long as it aligns with the ethics and morals of the corporation\nThat at this point that's a pretty broad the\nOpening isn't it\nRight right that's twenty percent time to harass other people I don't know I was going to clean this up they're gonna have to do something in a major PR way I I anticipate something happens within a week\nOkay let's move around will quickly is going to testify and tell us how to\nHow to a a pretty good week so far but they just announced that they're that they're kind of putting on hold one of their other sort of divisions\n... that really cool titles solar roof yeah so at the Youtube videos really slick is like two and a half years ago I think they announced this and there are still pushing it back that we're supposed to come out I'm Sorry I have to laugh a little bit because\nI Swear even ... uses a calendar and not to watch when it comes to trying to deliver products but when they he does deliver them they usually are pretty pretty solid fifty seven thousand dollars for a test is what it's going to cost when it comes out it was supposed to come out of\nThis year I think it's going to be May of next year above at the earlier that you know\nYeah and so they keep kicking it down the road kind of like we were waiting on the model three for an extra year so this is kind of par for the course but you know what you're right Tesla had a really good week this week it was so giddy about its earnings that you know it sped up its earnings call by a full week like the conference call they moved to be like oh we got to tell you guys doing now\nPop twelve percent after that earnings go here's my thing like I told you yesterday I have not seen them do back to back quarters of profits I'm not going to start dancing industry ... you're something in January\nAnd in one more thing and let's keep it on most real quick so let me get this straight he must have gotten billions of dollars in contracts for space X right\nThat's correct yeah why as it is their biggest customer\nSo why is it trying to get a half a billion dollar loan\nMoney is really cheap right now I and and I had the same kind of question because I saw that Netflix is also going to float two billion dollars worth of bonds of debt for its company too and I was like well why there needs to crush the quarter last time so ... and space acts\nNetflix money is still cheap right now if the fed continues on its current pace of hockey ...\nThen I think that people are kind of like getting it while you can you know what I mean like like let's let's just fill the coffers at a lower interest rate right now in case there's a storm coming in the next couple of years I think that's I think that's pure that just pure math and accounting I think", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Wake Up
