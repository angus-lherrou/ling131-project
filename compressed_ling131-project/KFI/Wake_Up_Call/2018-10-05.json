care that people have there's a really fascinating area of social psychology called terror management theory\nThat was developed out of the work of Ernest backer who wrote that great book a denial of death\nAnd they have found that if people\nAre you know functioning in a in a normal way and they get triggered by some reminder of their mortality it can lead to very pathological types of behaviors\nBut if you can bolster their sense of\nA personal worth their ... their value in the world and you you enhanced their self esteem\nYou'll see that when you trigger them they actually become more optimistic they care about other people so I think if we can approach this idea of death and the great mystery of it with an open heart and that kind of skepticism that is productive\nI I think you can become a great exploration and a wonderful adventure for people\nProbably could win no did you did you know agree Mitchell before he passed on\nYeah very well regarded worked with him for years wonderful person Edgar said in the interview I did with him for death makes life possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because\nHe was a person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment when he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there were plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find [laughter]\nUm but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he felt that was much more important to live a good life and to be a good citizen\nI'm to be loving inclined toward other people than it was to spend a lot of time worrying about what's going to happen next and I just thought that you know it's a powerful notion and he was a great man\nUsed their descended of evidence to prove that there's life after death if you were a quarter law ... knew this was challenged ducked was challenged could you prove that there's life after death\n[noise] so this would make a great reality show runner\nYou Ina courtroom let's do it [laughter]\nSo you have a judge and jury and you have people representing different points of view on controversial topics so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWith witnesses the common goal\nExactly giving their own um personal testimony based on their experiences\n... put it right there\nAnd then you get into this question of what one shift people's mind about that question\nAnd is it the data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and showed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting\nYou know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something you know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI I think she'll to Dr Merrill Lynch which were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after death let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it please and its role but it plays with all of what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWell I think again we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness\nAnd also our lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts\nWe live in a paradigm or a world view and the interesting thing to me about world views is that we don't even know that we have them\nAnd yet they're the most important thing that Shapes Our experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt Shapes Our experiences and so we can't see those things that lie outside of our expectations\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware\nAnd that we have what's called an attentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive those parts of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them\nAnd I think that that is a remarkable uh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of a functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level\nAnd to the extent we can you know turn the light on what those experiences are and what Shapes Our awareness where are we placing our attention that then offers us a point of liberation into expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe that the consciousness Lou ... outside of the brain\nI Do I think consciousness is something that has intelligence it is self correcting it is reflective and so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in the forest because [noise]\n... is filled with light and with that intention to manage life and so I I Do believe that consciousness for something much bigger than our individual brain I don't think it's an ... phenomena the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like you\nKnow the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it doesn't mean you've destroyed the conscious\nOr the signal or the signal exactly\nKeeps coming ... exactly you will will science ever meet\nThe spiritual ...\n[noise] I think so I mean I think we're getting closer and closer all the time I just spent time with the the uh the Android she's a robot\nNear Hartford about her yeah it'd be great for you to interview 'em and see if they would do it in a way that doesn't give me water is a talk show host if she's done a good [noise] I Do\nYou're nobody better than your George\nWe're we're coming back with phone calls your calls next on coast to coast they find out more about tonight's gifts to log on to coast to coast am dot com\n[noise]\n\nOn Dr based on the way of life you know when you\nPlay your perfect combination for me it fulltime pedicures and poker ... shopping and he repeats whenever you love to do you'll find more ways to escape chunk of resources you know when to my\nHotel dealers want to help you get home sooner and safer with their hopeful traffic reports heard your daily and don't forget to visit so hard to do is\nBring 'em on the morning in orange county and K O S T H ... to ... you\nWake up call with ... ...

New York detective into sexual assault case against Harvey Weinstein\nAt five fifty this morning so air and thank you for this portion of it I mean this just seems like a a rollercoaster override when you look at this whole Harvey Weinstein issue when it comes to all these different cases and now you add the cops side to it I mean that's that's one I didn't see coming\nYou know and I I I think look the the the the allegations have been so well publicized and and the evidence against one scene is so damaging that you know the the criminal case though is is a different animal or you know the where where technicalities\nCould undermine the whole proceeding going forward although as I say the the the police department and the Manhattan da Silva seem confident in their case even if this one investigator ended up making a mistake\nBut they kind of have to say that right\nWell they do but ah I I think they believe it I don't yeah they're saying it out of obligation of the they they do have significant evidence they believe against Harvey Weinstein and they they have powerful accounts from\nThree different women who've accused ... uh not only publicly but but uh in some cases of ah have evidence that we may not be aware of based on the published accounts that came out over the last year\nAnd a and and you have ... witnesses who are willing to uh you know complaining witnesses who are are you willing and able to testify\nGerm All right Aaron thank you so much of a good weekend to Gerald sat next week the later there at that they'd be there and ... and that's what mine seems attorneys are getting paid the big bucks for they're doing it exactly what they're supposed to do picking apart every single little detail of\nThis case against him in hopes that they can somehow get anything thrown out like Aaron was saying that the cases against him are so damning all of the evidence is so crazy\nThat his defense team has got to hang a town on any little thing that it can find and in this case it's going to go for what it can even if the NYPD as confident\nWe've got this this is a really stupid thing you guys are going after they got to go out or something\nYou can see why they do it well the former LAPD sergeant involved in the Rodney King beating has been sentenced or probation for driving drunk safety coon pleaded no contest a DUI coon was arrested in may after crashing into a parked car in the ... he was sentenced this week to three years probation DUI classes and a three hundred Ninety dollar fine\nAnd LA county sheriff sergeant and three deputies have been placed on leave for an investigation\nThe sheriff's department says the men were involved in an incident well off duty last week the LA Times reports based on unnamed sources the incident was a fight during a party the sergeant works at the men's central jail and the three deputies work in east LA\nThe state's clashes with the Trump Administration could be costing Californian\nAccording to data from the California Department of justice state leaders have filed forty four lawsuits against the Trump Administration says the president took office in twenty Seventeen\nAnd officials say so far the tab for legal fees\nHas top nine million dollars that's tripled the amount from the previous here still state attorney general happier but ... says that cost is less than one percent of the state's nearly nine hundred million dollar budget and the ads that it's a small price to pay to fight federal overreach\nBut Republican leaders say it's a waste of taxpayer dollars the majority of these lawsuits are still pending Monica ...
