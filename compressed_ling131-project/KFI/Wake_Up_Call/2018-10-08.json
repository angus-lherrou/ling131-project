life and death decisions so when they tell you they see something\nOut of the norm in the in the air ... then I take that very seriously and some of these\nPilots were trained bomber pilots fighter pilots a fighter pilots for a night I'm fighting a squadron were documented some of some of the most startling run ins with these UFOs\nThere's a story of alone be Seventeen crew that watch to UFO track them for miles I I think almost a about an hour\nAnd then of course a lot of people consider what's known as the battle of Los Angeles was a great story of\nThose yeah that's an amazing story and a and usually I think the was the story was the moving Nineteen forty one with John Belushi they made it seem like it was just based on what the war department called war nerves in other words this was\nA shortly after World War two I think er I'm Sorry after the bombing of Pearl Harbor I Believe it was in February of Nineteen forty two\n[noise] and aircraft gunners anti aircraft guns started firing in the air there was all kinds of pandemonium a and the war department just said the the people were nervous but I found a very uh an account from a very uh good witness\nWho are actually it was ... a professor at occidental college um later he was just a kid at the time and he said that ah what he witnessed was a huge object\nThat was pretty much just standing at it sitting still in the middle of the uh right above the ocean that these guns were trained right on it and it didn't seem to have any effect and then it drifted it almost sounded like it drifted right over his head so it was a\nTo me that was more of a story about something weird happening in the sky let alone a war nerves\nIll and and they shot against the Matthew people could hear ... sounds yeah average eating something\nRight this this person actually said uh some of the shelves were landing a few feet away from them and they had a the spotlight trained on it I think there's a a pretty dramatic picture that shows that\nIt is dramatic Matthew swing with us his latest book haunted World War two where did you get the book Matthew\nYou can get it at Amazon dot com Barnes and noble dot com go to your um a local bookstore and see if they have it in if they don't shake 'em down and try to get it in for me I'd appreciate it\nWhat about haunted ships from World war two\nWell I didn't want to just I didn't want to leave our our sailors out\nNo nine years maybe for me so let's not leave aside well\nYeah I'm going to make sure I have those in there so the interesting thing about uh after World War two you had these battleships\nYou had ... ah aircraft carriers and they were engaged in so many activities so much a honor that ah those sailors served in that it was a shame to just got old them or to reduce them to scrap it uh luckily for us a lot of\nPeople got into preserving those um\nShips those aircraft carriers and his battleships as living museums and they brought him back to different ports and and also when they brought him back to these ports they brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and and some of the ones that I collected the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor\nUm there's a lot of activity or a witness their shadow figure is probably one of the ones they call him shadow ed and Ed's stands for enemy designated which was a World War two term for when you come in contact with the enemy\nOr there's some pretty dramatic stories of ghost hunters chasing the shadow creature around the uh the carrier USS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented a ship base a haunted sites\nUh there there is a story about a man dressed in white naval uniform who are wanders around the deck some of the battle ships the USS North Carolina I worked with um a a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal\nAnd they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on there\nUm and of course we mentioned USS Arizona all of those uh and there there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book so yeah there are a lot of World War two ships are haunted and I'm just glad that they preserved and have him back here goes and all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening that seemed to all have the similarities and that has to do with tragedy mhm for some reason tragedy makes these ghosts or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\n[noise] yeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element\nOf uh you know I'll say not just the ghosts of World War two but when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated and even some of the ghost stories of\nOf country these tragedies just seem to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this is a at a interaction between consciousness of reality or maybe that were just so primed\nUm to to when we hear these tragedies to maybe hope that that uh the spirits go on or the spirits linger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just\nThere were a lot of family members forty of the people who died in the northern California wildfires Orange County many of them were in Santa Rosa where they went home by home for many days looking for body so\nA lot of people lost their loved ones in those homes in coffee park that group coffee strong what what they're doing is as they've come together they are trying to cut through a lot of the the tape to rebuild that help people out to be the leader of the coffee strong group was saying just to rebuild\nSome of the the brick work of it's like a a fence along the street kind of like a sound barrier in coffee park that that nobody knew who is going to rebuild that Santa Rosa said that's not ours that belong to somebody else\nA the homeowner's association says that's not us that that belong to somebody else so each homeowner is having to to pay to to rebuild their section of the fence on the backside of their home that runs along that street and that fence costs almost ... million dollars to rebuild that\nThe the concrete then they'll block and brick fence sits along there so coffee strongest is running that effort to say wait we can do this week and raise the money to do this so homeowners don't have that added cost onto it\nAnd all of the insurance headaches that the people have gone through a there have been a number of insurance companies usa being one of them who have been sued by\nHomeowners in Santa Rosa area\nSaying they were not insured for an off the your insurance company comes and says this is what your home is worth this is what you need for insurance then you're homeless burned and it's double that or triple that because labor costs go up a materials costs go up\nThere to rebuild her home in Sonoma County right now just because labor's and labor and materials are so scarce\nCan be far more expensive than most insurance companies ever said it would be and in many cases the homeowners have lost their their lawsuits and they're still fighting with their insurance companies\nSaying give us more money and you know in many cases the insurance companies are saying we can't you're insured for this amount whether it was the right amount or not it's up to you to decide no matter what we tell us or an insurance company and if you don't have enough you don't have enough\nThat is just a nightmare so it's it's just you know insult to injury you've already lost everything and now you're being told we can't even help you rebuild what you had it just it just makes me sad to\nSomebody they'll give you is only a fraction of what you think in Sonoma County was a a very expensive place to live any way before the fires\nAnd it really is now but you have a a tiny home that may have been worth five hundred grand back before the fires and now to rebuild it it's going to be one point five million you've got a plumber who lives in that home and rebuilding it is an impossible feat for that person\nAnd they're gonna have to move out of the area there's just not going to be a way they can do in their Alex thank you for the

there's a lot of optimism in the the two counties as well\nDo they need that for sure especially 'cause you guys are under red flag warning right now right\nYeah exactly and I think a year ago the red flag warning went on for so many weeks yeah they just make folksy and ... counties they get scared now every time that red flag warning goes up\nAll right Alex thank you so much I appreciate it you got to think that the later\nThat his ABCs Alex Stone live in northern California yeah I don't specifically know we were under a red flag warning because Scott what's going home last night he was
